Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Nigel Farage, Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon will all be out on the campaign trail. There will be two BBC debates in the evening â BBC Scotland will broadcast its Scotland
Leaders debate live from Pacific Quay in Glasgow, while the leaders of the
main parties in Northern Ireland take part in a debate in front of a studio
audience. Labour candidate Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who is standing in Tooting, has criticised the Conservatives for releasing a campaign video based on the same idea as hers, which she posted two weeks ago. Ms Allin-Khan had posted a spoof of a scene from the film Love Actually, when a character uses large, handwritten signs to get a message across to someone on the doorstep. (In the film, Andrew Lincoln's character is confessing his love to Keira Knightley, who is recently married to another man). Ms Allin-Khan's video went viral, being retweeted more than 8,000 times. Tonight, Boris Johnson's team produced their own version of the same scene but with the PM on the doorstep holding signs with his party's slogans, particularly on Brexit. Again, it's going viral on Twitter, with more than 2,000 retweets in the first hour it's been posted. Responding, Ms Allin-Khan tweeted: ""I won't be retweeting it - but Boris Johnson has copied my #ElectionActually video. ""Tanks. On. The. Lawn.

Don't share his version in outrage - instead, share my original version."" Several journalists have also been pointing out that the idea was done originally by Ms Allin-Khan. A councillor and party official were filmed making the comments on the election campaign trail. Read the full story here. This video can not be played Argument between Farage and Rayner on Question Time Following on from our earlier post, here are a few more of tomorrow's front pages: The Mirror says its front page from Monday - of the boy sleeping on a hospital floor - made the PM ""squirm"". The paper hopes Tuesday's edition will do the same The i says the ""hospital fracas"" has ""floored"" the PM - but it chooses to lead on the deadly volcano eruption in New Zealand The Mail leads on the prime minister's comments that the BBC's licence fee is outdated and could be scrapped The Times front page looks quite similar to the Mail's. It leads with the same image and story from New Zealand, while making a nod towards the PM's licence fee comments Lord Sugar is calling on voters to support the Conservative Party, the Sun says - using a well-known soundbite from his reality TV show, the Apprentice, as it's headline It's that time of night when we can share a few of tomorrow's front pages with you. One story in particular is dominating the newspapers... The Metro calls the situation a ""war of words"" which led to a backlash for Boris Johnson The Guardian claims Mr Johnsonâs team tried to turn the story on to Labour by wrongly briefing that a Tory aide was punched outside the hospital by a left-wing activist The Financial Times describes the situation as the ""first significant stumble"" the PM has made - and it's come in the ""final straight"" of campaigning The Telegraph looks instead at a memo which says the chances of Labour forming a coalition government have been seriously underestimated Listen back to the Question Time election special on BBC Sounds.

With only three days left of campaigning, Boris Johnson is criticised for initially refusing to look at a picture of a sick boy who had to sleep on the floor of a Leeds hospital. And Adam heads to Crewe to chat to a group of undecided voters. Listen to the episode here. This video can not be played The SNP say Scotland is losing out over Brexit Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Talking to voters around the country two big issues have had the elusive ""cut through"" in this campaign - the Tories promise to take us out of the EU at the end of next month and Labour's attack on their handling of the NHS. Of course, other subjects have been part of the conversation but those are the issues that have come up most often during the last few weeks when we've been travelling around the country. And in every election in recent history, the Labour Party has tried to sow doubts in voters' minds about whether or not the Tories can be trusted with the health service at all. That's why Boris Johnson's terrible day on the campaign trail today matters. Read more from Laura here. Emma Barnett thanks the panel and audience for coming - and that's it, the 90-minute debate is over. We've had questions on Brexit, housing, climate change and trust in politics - among other topics.

In the final exchange of the debate, Jo Swinson calls on Humza Yousaf to have an ""honesty"" about Scottish independence. Mr Yousaf - whose SNP party is calling for indyref2 - says that although he knows it won't be ""perfectly rosy"", Scotland would be economically stable if it were to become an independent country. But Ms Swinson - whose Lib Dems party is against Scottish independence - says it's only fair to be honest that, if Scottish independence were to happen, it would be ""a hit to the [Scottish] economy"". She backs this up by pointing out that the Scottish deficit is higher than the rest of the UK. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This page is no longer being updated.You can see the latest poll tracker for the UK general election due to be called in 2024 by clicking here. Over the course of the campaign almost every single poll has had the Conservatives ahead by at least 6%. So if they don't end up with the most votes it would be a serious failure. Labour have consistently been in a clear second place, a long way ahead of the Liberal Democrats in third. The Brexit Party started the campaign at around 10% of the vote but have fallen back dramatically - in part as a result of their decision not to contest Conservative-held seats. In Scotland the picture is very different. In the few polls there have been, the SNP has always had a commanding lead with the Conservatives in second place. Again, if that's not the result then the polls will have been badly flawed. For most of the campaign there have been marked differences between the polling companies. But all of them have suggested that the race has narrowed in the final two weeks. Out of 100 people who are likely to vote, about... Please upgrade your browser or enable JavaScript to see the full interactive experience There's about a 90% chance that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown above, which means there's a one in 10 chance that it lies outside these ranges. * Because the SNP and Plaid Cymru only campaign in Scotland and Wales respectively, the margins of error for their support across Great Britain is likely to be less than +/- 1% What most polls don't tell us is how votes will be converted into seats in the House of Commons. There have been several attempts to do this, though, using large polling samples which allow complex analyses of the levels of support for each party among different demographic groups. The central forecast of the final YouGov projection is a Conservative majority of 28. But it's important to look at the range of possible outcomes their analysis implies. For the Conservatives that range is 311-367 seats. So, on this basis, another hung parliament cannot be ruled out - and neither can a large majority. The BBC won't report on any polls that come out on polling day so this will be the final update to the poll tracker. The exit poll, commissioned by the BBC, ITV News and Sky News will be published when voting ends at 22.00 GMT on Thursday night. Compare where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election manifesto guide Going into the last few days of the election campaign the Conservative lead over Labour remains solid. The latest polls all put the Conservatives in the low to mid-40s and Labour in the low 30s in percentage terms across Britain as a whole. The Lib Dems are in a narrow 11-14% range and the Brexit Party are in low single digits - a long way down compared to where they started. Over the course of the campaign, both of the main parties have seen their poll ratings go up but the gap between the two is more or less where it was five weeks ago. As Sir John Curtice has pointed out, if the result on Thursday is in line with these numbers then the Conservatives are probably on course for a decent majority in the House of Commons. There should be a few more polls to come over the next three days - as well as another YouGov seat projection - so that could still change. But there would have to be a pretty big shift to point to a different overall result. Of course, they could all be systematically wrong - it wouldn't be the first time if that turned out to be true. But if you're using the polls as a guide to what could happen then their message is clear. The latest batch of polls lends more weight to the suggestion that the Conservative rise, which has been a consistent feature of the election campaign, has levelled off. That doesn't mean they can't go up any further, but for the time being it seems as though support for them is fairly static. Meanwhile, the Labour Party is still moving upwards - apparently mostly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats. If this trend continues, then we could be on course for another election where the two biggest parties capture a very large share of the overall vote. It would still need another big move, though, to reach the 84% that the Conservatives and Labour achieved between them in 2017. And there are only ten days to go. Our poll tracker smoothes out the bumps in polling by including old polls. Their influence decays, halving every week, but that still means our rolling average can look a little behind the latest figures. The differences are all smaller than the margin of error, but if parties are picking up or losing share, we might be a point or two off what a simple average of the latest polls would tell you. That's not so apparent when the parties are all moving in parallel - so we're lagging a little for everyone and the differences between parties will look similar. But, with the Conservatives plateauing, it might take a little while before our tracker starts to show Labour catching up as the most recent polls suggest they might be. YouGov's seat projection has raised a lot of interest. A lot of that is down to the fact that when they did the same exercise in 2017 they were pretty successful at forecasting the overall election result as well as the outcome in most individual constituencies. Their new projection puts the Conservatives on 359 seats, Labour on 211, the SNP on 43, Lib Dems on 13 and other parties on 24. That suggests a Conservative majority of 68. However, this still needs to be treated with caution for several reasons. It's still based on polling which, as we know, is always subject to error. The margin of error for this model ranges from a Conservative landslide to a very slim majority. Whilst the model uses a sophisticated technique to see how national polling trends play out in individual constituencies, it is always going to be very difficult to account for truly local factors - such as a prominent local independent candidate. Also, some other recent polls have suggested that Labour have moved a bit closer to the Conservatives than they are in the YouGov poll. That would clearly have an impact on the size of any overall majority, and the polls will continue to move between now and 12 December. So, whilst the projection is certainly very interesting, it shouldn't be treated as providing a reliable forecast of what the result of the election will be. One other feature of the most recent polls is that, with one clear exception, there seems to be more consistency between the different polling companies. If you look back to the beginning of October, there were very large differences between them. Now, each of the parties seems to be performing in a fairly narrow range across the polls: the low 40s for the Conservatives; close to 30% for Labour, and the mid-teens for the Lib Dems. The outlier is Opinium's latest poll which has the Conservatives on 47% and the Lib Dems down on 12%. Of course, convergence doesn't mean the polls can tell us what the final result will be. There's still more than two weeks to go and the lesson from 2015 is that there can be a consistent error across nearly all polls. Overall, the polls from the last week have shown the same pattern of movement as they have throughout the campaign. In particular, the Conservatives have gone up again in the BBC poll tracker and the Brexit Party continues to fall. There may be the first signs in the raw polling figures, though, that the Conservative shift is beginning to level off. Several of the pollsters have them one or two points below their peak in the latest figures. Even if their rise does stall, though, the Tories are now fairly close to the 43% they actually achieved at the 2017 election. A new Panelbase poll in Scotland also puts them only marginally below the result from last time. However, a result along those lines wouldn't mean their vote share was approximately flat across the country. The national figures can mask big shifts at a local level. There could still be dramatic swings in individual constituencies. Writing updates on the election campaign polls is beginning to get a bit repetitive. Once again, the changes since last week are basically following the same pattern as we've seen before. The Conservatives are up and Labour is also up a bit. The Brexit Party is down, and the Lib Dems are also a bit lower than before. In fact, the Conservatives are now pushing towards the 43% they actually achieved across Britain at the general election in 2017. As we noted last week, pollsters are adjusting their methodologies to take account of the fact that the Brexit Party has withdrawn in Conservative-held seats. That ought to help them hold on to seats they're defending. Perhaps slightly counterintuitively, though, it might mean Boris Johnson needs a bigger lead in the polls to be sure of winning an overall majority of MPs. Piling on extra votes in safe Conservative constituencies, thanks to the absence of a Brexit Party candidate, probably won't translate into extra seats in the House of Commons. A poll by LucidTalk covering the election in Northern Ireland was also published last week. These are few and far between, and the poll was conducted before the official election campaign got underway, so it's very hard to get a good sense of any trends. But compared to the 2017 election, the poll suggested the DUP and Sinn Fein losing vote share with the Alliance and SDLP going up. If the actual election result goes a similar way it could mean the smaller parties making gains in terms of seats at the expense of the big two. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties. YouGov's latest poll removed the Brexit Party, Liberal Democrats, Green and Plaid Cymru as an option in seats where they have stood down. The most notable, if unsurprising, effect was for the Brexit Party. Their support roughly halved from 9% to 4% as they roughly halved the number of constituencies in which they are standing. Other pollsters have said they will follow suit. We can expect further changes as nominations close and it becomes clear who is standing in each constituency. So there will be even more movements in the poll tracker over the coming weeks. Some of it will be, as ever, down to the changing political landscape. But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties.

But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. The trends that were noticeable in the polls a week ago have carried on over the last seven days. The Conservatives have continued their steady upward progress. But the tentative signs of a Labour recovery have also become firmer. Both parties' average scores are up, although they're still below the vote shares they recorded at the 2017 election - more than 10% below in Labour's case. Going in the other direction, the Brexit Party are down to 9% in the BBC poll tracker - their lowest score since the party was launched in April. And it's now clear that the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from where they were a month ago. YouGov has also published polls for Wales and Scotland. In Wales, they have Labour up four points with the Lib Dems losing the same amount since the last poll. Labour, on 29%, are now roughly on a par with the Conservatives on 28%. Since there are so few Welsh polls probably the best we can say with any confidence is that it looks close between the two main parties - with Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party also in a close battle for third place. The Scotland poll gave the SNP a very large lead on 42%, with the Conservatives in a clear second place, and Labour falling to its lowest score since before the last election - just below the Lib Dems. However, that poll was conducted more than two weeks ago, before the election was even confirmed so it's rather likely that these figures are out of date. There can be little doubt, however, that the SNP are currently on course for a strong result. It's nearly a week now since it became clear that there would be a general election on 12 December. There have already been eight polls conducted since then - we can expect that from now on they will be coming thick and fast. Over the last seven days the Conservatives have continued their upward trend in the BBC poll tracker whilst the Brexit Party are still drifting downwards. There are also some early signs of a recovery for Labour. They've hit an average of 26% - their highest figure since the first half of September. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have fallen to 17% - their lowest since the start of June. These movements are pretty small so far, though, so we will need to see if they continue in the coming days. There's no doubt that Brexit will be a major issue at this election. But as the campaign gets underway, will other policy areas come to the fore? Opinium has found that Brexit is a more dominant subject as the campaign gets under way than it was at the last general election. Forty per cent of people in their latest poll said it was the single issue that was most likely to influence their vote. That compares with 18% at the start of the 2017 campaign. However, when people were asked to name the three most important issues facing the country, 59% of respondents identified health/NHS compared to only 52% for the EU/Brexit. That's a shift compared to their recent polls where Brexit has come out on top or in equal first place. It's possible that by campaigning on non-Brexit issues the parties will be able to influence how much weight voters give to different subjects. Panelbase's latest poll also puts the NHS/health as the top issue. On the other hand, Deltapoll have Britain leaving the EU clearly ahead of health. The difference here could be explained by the fact they don't namecheck the NHS in their range of options. The last few weeks have seen a gradual, further strengthening of the Conservatives' position in the polls. In the latest poll by Opinium they hit 40% - the highest figure in a single poll since the middle of August. They've also moved up to an average of 36% in the BBC poll tracker. In the meantime, the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from their party conference highpoint to settle at that 18%-ish level they've occupied for much of the autumn while the Brexit Party continue to drift downwards. Labour's average rating has essentially stayed flat. Because voting intention polls are fairly scarce in Scotland, it's difficult to identify trends. But the latest Panelbase poll conducted earlier this month suggests that the SNP continues to dominate. Comparing polls to the 2017 general election result suggests Labour and the Conservatives are on course to lose votes, the SNP are roughly level with where they were, whilst the Lib Dems could gain votes. The SNP's share in polls has floated between 36% and 43% for the last two years. In our GB-wide poll tracker, that translates to 4%, occasionally dropping to 3% or rising to 5% since Scotland has just under 10% of the GB population. That's why we don't suggest a margin of error range as we do for parties that field candidates across the whole of Great Britain. Polls are even rarer in Wales - but the latest from YouGov, also conducted earlier this month, broadly matches others from earlier in the year. The Conservatives are down from their 2017 election share but Labour has fallen back much more dramatically. From the 49% they achieved then, their share of the vote has approximately halved according to polls. The Lib Dems are up sharply and the Brexit Party are performing far more strongly than UKIP did when voters last had their say. Our poll tracker lines show an average of results from the polls to date. Each dot in the chart above shows one poll result for a party. There are too many individual dots to keep track of: even on one day there can be very different results for one party from different polls. So we summarise all that information with a line that averages those results. It bounces around less and makes it easier to tell the signal from the noise (or the trends from the blips?). We use polls conducted by members of the British Polling Council. As of September 2019, that's BMG, ComRes, Deltapoll, Hanbury, ICM, Ipsos Mori, Kantar, Opinium, ORB, Panelbase, Sky Data, Survation and YouGov. Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK, but as a result we do not have separate data for parties that only stand in Northern Ireland. We use results that exclude or downweight those who are unlikely to vote and people who do not express a preference. We include data that are in the public domain: some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time and so we update the poll tracker as data become available. The margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points. This means that there's a 90% chance that an election held tomorrow would give national vote shares within four points of our estimates for each of the parties. And there's a 10% chance that it would be outside that range. We base these figures on aBritish Polling Council analysis,externalof the results of the final set of polls before each of the elections from 2001 to 2017. The approach mentioned above doesn't quite work for parties that only run in Scotland or Wales or are standing in only a few seats, like UKIP or The Independent Group for Change. The electorate they are appealing to is smaller and this makes their possible vote smaller when it is projected across Great Britain or the whole of the UK. This also means that their margin of error is smaller than that of those parties that stand across Britain and is likely to be less than + / - 1%. We have more coverage of politics inScotlandandWaleson their national politics pages. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls to date. Bigger and more recent polls have more influence on our figures. We also limit the influence of any one poll or of those polling firms who poll very frequently to prevent our results being too dependent on one source. In a little more detail: the average is weighted by sample size. The more people polled in a particular survey, the more weight we will give it, up to a threshold of 2,000 people. On the other hand, the older a poll is the less influence it has on the average figure we calculate. We also give less value to any polling firm that has data for more than 5,000 people in a fortnight. A typical poll may cover about 1,000 people. Because a party isn't guaranteed to get the same vote share in an election as it did in a poll the previous day. Polling a sample of the population has often been likened to tasting soup. If the soup has been well stirred then you need to have only one spoonful to get a sense of what the whole bowl is like. In the same way, a well-conducted poll of 1,000 people can, most of the time, give us an idea of what the country as a whole is thinking. But it's not 100% precise, so, the margin of error gives a sense of how the results might change with a different sample of 1,000 people. This margin of error only applies to national vote share: converting that into seats in Parliament is much harder and less precise. There are also systematic differences between polling companies who approach people in different ways, who ask different questions and who analyse the results differently. We list the main polling firms and the questions they ask below. Polling companies also analyse their data differently. They make choices about how to weight each respondent. For example, if a poll of 1,000 people is made up of 550 men and 450 women, it is unrepresentative because it does not reflect the profile of the UK population (51% female). So the answers of female respondents should be given slightly more weight than male respondents in the analysis so that the final results are 51% based on female answers rather than 45%. That's not controversial, but adjusting for past vote or likelihood to vote is harder. Some pollsters ask respondents who they voted for last time and weight the sample to try and ensure it matches the political make-up of the general population. One problem with doing this is that a certain number of people will incorrectly recall who they voted for last time - and a few will even lie about it. So polling companies often use a variety of further methods to improve the accuracy of their weighting. That variety of methods leads to a variety of answers. Most companies then weight or filter by likelihood to vote so that the answers of people who are most likely to vote are given the most prominence in the results. Finally, several pollsters reallocate a percentage of ""don't knows"" to the party they voted for last time. This is to get around the problem that emerged following the 1979 election with the phenomenon of ""shy Tories"" or the ""spiral of silence"" - people who do not want to discuss their voting preference but who will still vote. Our approach, excluding ""don't knows"" from our polltracker, is slightly different. It is like saying that they won't vote or, if they did, their voting preferences would look quite like those who do express a preference. Many polling companies changed their methodology when the candidates lists were released to account for those parties that are standing only in a few seats. If a general election were held today, which of the following parties would you vote for? Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, SNP (if living in Scotland), Plaid Cymru (if living in Wales), Green Party, Brexit Party, another party Prior to August 2019, Green Party and Brexit Party were only prompted for if the respondent answered ""another party"".

The alarm was raised at Lancefield Quay, on the north bank of the Clyde, at 18:43. The fire service sent 12 appliances to the ""well-developed"" fire in the second floor of the three-storey building. There were no reports of injuries. Crews appeared to be containing the fire, which at one point saw flames shooting from the roof, but smoke was still billowing from the flats. BBC reporter Graham Fraser said: ""There were lots of flames earlier. Now I can see a hole, about 15m long in the roof of the building with smoke pouring out still."" The fire destroyed part of the building's roof One resident told the BBC she was sure the building would have to be demolished. Sheena Anderson, who has lived in the block for 17 years, said her home had been destroyed. ""It will be demolished,"" she said. ""They've got all the water that's coming down from the house above me. ""If a wee trickle comes, it pours down the walls, so my house will be demolished. Nothing surer. I can't believe it. ""I've got what I'm standing up in. ""OK, it could be worse, but that's a terrible fire. What caused it, they don't know."" The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said: ""Operations control mobilised 12 appliances to the city's Lancefield Quay where firefighters were met with a fire on the second floor of a three-storey building."" Glasgow City Council said Lancefield Quay, the main road that runs alongside the Clyde in Glasgow, had been closed between Elliot Street and Hydepark Street.

Surgeons withdraw support for heart disease advice,"European clinical guidelines on how to treat a major form of heart disease are under review following a BBC Newsnight investigation. Europe's professional body for heart surgeons has withdrawn support for the guidelines, saying it was ""a matter of serious concern"" that some patients may have had the wrong advice. Guidelines recommended both stents and heart surgery for low-risk patients. But trial data leaked to Newsnight raises doubts about this conclusion. Thousands of people in the UK and hundreds of thousands worldwide will be treated for left main coronary artery disease each year. This is a narrowing of one of the main arteries in the heart. The guidelines on how to treat it were largely based on a three-year trial to compare whether heart surgery or stents - a tiny tube inserted into a blocked blood vessel to keep it open - was more effective. 'Check your cholesterol from age 25' Inequalities in heart attack care 'costing women's lives' My 'anxiety' was actually a rare heart condition The trial called Excel started in 2010 and was sponsored by big US stent maker, Abbott. It was led by eminent US doctor Gregg Stone and aimed to recruit 2,000 patients. Half were given stents and the other half open heart surgery. Success of the treatments was measured by adding together the number of patients that had heart attacks, strokes, or had died. The research team used an unusual definition of a heart attack, but had said that they would also publish data for the more common ""Universal"" definition of a heart attack alongside it. There is debate around which is a better measure and the investigators stand by their choice. In 2016, the results of the trial for patients three years after their treatments were published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. The article concluded stents and heart surgery were equally effective for people with left main coronary artery disease. But researchers had failed to publish data for the common, ""Universal"" definition of a heart attack. Newsnight has seen that unpublished data and it shows that under the universal definition, patients in the trial that had received stents had 80% more heart attacks than those who had open heart surgery. The lead researchers on the trial have told Newsnight that this is ""fake information"". But Newsnight has spoken to experts who say they believe the data is credible. Stents are a less invasive option for patients too ill to have surgery Prof Rod Stables, clinical lead for research at the British Heart Foundation, said this information should have been published and knowing it would have made a ""substantial contribution to our ability to appreciate the nuances of the results"". Shortly after Excel was published, the professional bodies for heart surgeons and cardiologists got together to write a new set of guidelines. But they had not seen the unpublished Universal definition data. Currently, European guidelines recommend either a stent or open heart surgery for people who have less severe forms of this disease. The European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery (EACTS), which helped draw up the guidelines, told Newsnight if the information on the trial is proven to be correct, ""the recommendation is unsafe"". ""It is a matter of serious concern to us that some results in the Excel trial appear to have been concealed and that some patients may therefore have received the wrong clinical advice,"" Prof Domenico Pagano, EACTS secretary general, said. Newsnight has also learned that as the guidelines were being drawn up, the trial's Data Safety Monitoring Board - an independent body that looks after the interests of patients - was raising concerns. Newsnight has seen emails where they raised concerns about the higher mortality rate amongst those patients who were receiving stents. The board thought this information should be made public, as they were aware new guidelines were being drawn up that would recommend stents or surgery. However, the main investigators chose not to do so at the time. They point out that the board allowed the trial to continue unchanged. Prof Nick Freemantle worked on the guidelines. He told Newsnight he would ""never"" have agreed the treatments were interchangeable if he had seen the leaked data. He said that the result of making the ""wrong recommendation"" is that ""patients who have received stents [for left main coronary artery disease] will have died who otherwise would have lived for longer, survived for longer, if they'd had open heart surgery"". The European Society of Cardiology, the other professional body involved in writing the guidelines, rejected the claim that the guidelines may have caused harm to patients. They stand by the guidelines, which they say were based on more than the Excel trial. This year the trial published a further set of its results, showing what had happened to the patients five years after their treatment. This found for every 100 who died after having open heart surgery, 135 people with stents died. Overall, 10% of people who had surgery died in the trial compared with 13% who had stents. Prof David Taggart, a surgeon at Oxford University, resigned from the trial. He says he ""had no choice"" as he believed the academic paper describing the five-year results did not give enough prominence to the mortality data in the trial. The NEJM had recommended that the researchers should give it greater prominence too. Prof Taggart said he believed the paper's final paragraph, which concluded that there was ""no significant difference"" between stents and open heart surgery was ""dangerous for patients"". When challenged by Newsnight, the trial's principal investigator, Dr Gregg Stone, said he believed that it had been given sufficient prominence and had been considered to meet NEJM's standards. Sponsors of trials like this are also responsible for making sure all results are published. When Newsnight contacted Abbott, the sponsors of the trial, they directed the BBC towards the trial's main researchers. The EACTS has now urged their members to ""disregard the guidelines relating to left main disease for the time being"". ""We recommend that patients seek the advice of the multidisciplinary heart team at their hospital before deciding which treatment option is most appropriate for them,"" said Prof Domenico Pagano. In the course of the investigation, Newsnight found a larger debate within the medical community about the way that conflicts of interest are handled. There is one school of thought that says they raise questions and need to be carefully managed because of potential bias - conscious or unconscious. Others say that interactions between research and business are vital and there is a real public good to be gained by them. In the Excel trial, the four main investigators all declared conflicts of interest. Lead investigator Prof Gregg Stone declared he had received personal fees or held equity in 20 private medical companies, several of which made tools that helped with putting in stents. He's also the course director for TCT, an annual medical conference where the results were presented. TCT makes money from exhibitors including some of the biggest stent makers - Abbott, who sponsored the trial, Boston Scientific and Medtronic. Prof Pieter Kappetein, who worked on the trial and on the body that worked on the guidelines, declared that he had left the guidelines body to go and work for Medtronic, a medical device manufacturer that makes stents. Newsnight found that he'd become chief medical officer of Medtronic Structural Heart. By Newsnight's count, around half of the investigators on the trial had declared personal fees from companies that made stents, and around a third of those on the taskforce writing the guidelines. These relationships are all within the rules. You can watchNewsnighton BBC Two at 22:30 on weekdays. Catch up oniPlayer, subscribe to the programme onYouTube,externaland follow it onTwitter,external.

British stars nominated for Golden Globes,"Taron Egerton as Elton John in Rocketman British stars are well represented in this year's Golden Globe nominations, with Rocketman's Taron Egerton and Phoebe Waller-Bridge up for awards. Waller-Bridge is up for a lead actress prize for Fleabag, while her Irish co-star Andrew Scott is also nominated. Marriage Story, a Netflix production, is the most nominated film, having received six citations in all. The Irishman, another Netflix film, and Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, have five nominations each. The Crown, Chernobyl and US crime thriller Unbelievable lead the way on the TV side of things, having received four nominations apiece. Johansson and Driver play a divorcing couple in Marriage Story Marriage Story and Martin Scorsese's The Irishman are both up for best film drama, as are Joker, The Two Popes and Sam Mendes' World War I epic 1917. Tarantino's film is up for best musical or comedy, alongside Nazi satire Jojo Rabbit, murder mystery Knives Out, Elton John biopic Rocketman and comic biopic Dolemite Is My Name. Golden Globes: 2020 nominees in full Globes criticised for all-male director nominees Scorsese, Mendes and Tarantino are up for the best film director award, with Joker's Todd Phillips and Parasite's Bong Jong Ho completing the all-male line-up. The South Korean film-maker is also up for best screenplay for Parasite - a dark comedy about his homeland's social divides that is also up for best foreign language film. Netflix has been throwing huge amounts of cash at both making and marketing its awards hopefuls this year. With that kind of spending, the streamer will be hoping for not just a good, but a great return on its investment. At this stage of awards season, it potentially looks like it might pay off. The film with the most nominations is Netflix's Marriage Story, starring Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, which has six. Just behind with five, another Netflix production - Martin Scorsese's epic The Irishman starring Oscar winners Robert de Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino. It's still early days though. Last year, the Dick Cheney biopic Vice led the way with six Globe nominations and went on to win a grand total of one Academy Award (for make-up and hairstyling). Still, for the last few years, the eventual best picture winner at the Oscars has come from one of the films with either the most or almost the most nominations at the Globes. The Globes' real power comes less from those who decides on the winners but rather from its position in awards season. While it may from time to time make some unusual choices, it gives some films the chance to build momentum at the crucial time when Oscar voters are deciding not only which films to vote for, but just as importantly, which films they'll actually make time to see. And in what can be a tight race, just having a film labelled as a Golden Globe nominee or winner can make a difference. Christian Bale is in the running for the best actor in a film drama award for Ford v Ferrari - released as Le Mans '66 in the UK. Bale's competition includes fellow Brit Jonathan Pryce for The Two Popes, as well as Antonio Banderas, Adam Driver and Joaquin Phoenix for Pain and Glory, Marriage Story and Joker respectively. This video can not be played With 27 nominations, it's a strong year for British talent Daniel Craig is up for best actor in a film comedy or musical for Knives Out, as is Egerton for Rocketman and Jojo Rabbit's young British lead Roman Griffin Davis. Leonardo DiCaprio and Eddie Murphy are also nominated in this category, for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Dolemite Is My Name respectively. The best actress in a film drama shortlist includes Britain's Cynthia Erivo for Harriet, a biopic of anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman. Erivo's competition includes Scarlett Johansson for Marriage Story, Saoirse Ronan for Little Women and Judy's Renee Zellweger - widely considered to be the favourite for both this award and 2020's best actress Oscar. The best actress in a film comedy or musical shortlist includes Dame Emma Thompson for Late Night and The Farewell's Awkwafina. I'm Gonna Love Me Again, a new track written for Rocketman by Sir Elton John and Bernie Taupin, is up for the best original film song award. So is Beautiful Ghosts, written by Taylor Swift and Andrew Lloyd Webber for the upcoming film version of Cats. It is the only nomination for Cats, which has been left out of the major categoriesdespite reports,externalit was screened for voters at the last minute. Swift expressed delight on Twitter that ""one of the most fun, fulfilling creative experiences"" in her life had been recognised by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA).

Into the Unknown from Frozen 2 and Beyonce's song Spirit from Disney's The Lion King also make the cut. Both films are up for best animated film - an award The Lion King will not be eligible for at the Oscars or Baftas, as it was not submitted for consideration. The remake of Disney's 1994 animation uses computer animation to create photorealistic facsimiles of real-life animals. Olivia Colman, Helena Bonham Carter and Tobias Menzies are all up for awards for their royal roles in the latest series of The Crown. Colman is up for best actress in a TV drama, where her competition includes Killing Eve's Jodie Comer and the stars of Apple TV series The Morning Show - Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. Dame Helen Mirren, Kit Harington, Emily Watson and Sacha Baron Cohen are among other British actors who are up for TV prizes. Harington's consideration for best actor in a TV drama is the only nomination for the final series of fantasy saga Game of Thrones. Menzies, Colman and Bonham Carter play Prince Philip, The Queen and Princess Margaret in The Crown Overall there are 27 Britons in contention for the awards, which recognise both film and television. Netflix - the streaming giant behind Marriage Story, The Irishman, The Two Popes and The Crown - has 34 nominations in all - 17 each for film and TV. HBO have 15 TV nominations, four of them coming for their mini-series about the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Ricky Gervais will return to host the awards on 5 January, having previously hosted them in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2016. Tom Hanks will receive a lifetime achievement award at the event, following in the footsteps of such recent honourees as Meryl Streep and Oprah Winfrey. Hanks is also nominated for a best supporting actor prize for his role as children's TV star Mr Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood.

Rise of SUVs 'makes mockery' of electric car push,"The ""immense"" rise in sales of high-emission sports utility vehicles means they now outsell electric cars in the UK by 37 to one, research has found. As a result, overall exhaust emissions from new cars have been increasing, not declining, for the past three years, says the UK Energy Research Centre. SUV sales are jeopardising the UK transport sector's ability to meet EU emissions targets, it said. Prof Jillian Anable of the UKERC said this made ""a mockery"" of UK policy. ""Effectively, we have been sleepwalking into the issue,"" she said. ""The decarbonisation of the passenger car market can no longer rely on a distant target to stop the sales of conventional engines. We must start to phase out the most polluting vehicles immediately. ""It is time to enact a strong set of regulations to transform the entire car market towards ultra-low carbon, rather than focusing solely on the uptake of electric vehicles."" UKERC was founded in 2004 and is funded by UK Research and Innovation, the UK government's research and innovation funding agency. It carries out research into sustainable future energy systems. The five major challenges facing electric vehicles Tesla gets go-ahead to build electric cars in China Dyson scraps its electric car project Are electric cars as green as you think? Over the past four years, there have been 1.8 million SUV sales, compared to a total of 47,000 for battery electric vehicles (BEV). In 2018, SUVs accounted for 21.2% of new car sales, up from 13.5% three years earlier. However, BEV sales are coming from a low base, as the technology is still relatively new. ""SUVs are larger and heavier than a standard car, emitting about a quarter more CO2 than a medium-size car and nearly four times more than a medium-sized battery electric vehicle,"" said the UKERC. ""Assuming the majority of these SUVs will be on UK roads for at least a decade, it is estimated the extra cumulative emissions to total around 8.2 million tons of CO2."" This video can not be played Should I buy an electric car? The UKERC said the ""extraordinary leap"" in SUV sales over the past four years seemed to be due to ""attractive car financing packages which divert attention from running costs"". Although vehicle excise duty is higher for gas-guzzlers, more than 90% of new cars in the UK are now sold by way of deals that wrap the excise duty into the monthly cost, ""rendering the only clear policy signal to discourage high-carbon vehicles somewhat useless,"" it said. All-electric vehicles still represent only a fraction of total car sales. The UKERC said they remained at less than 1% of new car sales in 2019. There are alsochallenges to uptake, including a lack of charging points on roads and too few low-cost models. The UKERC warned against abandoning the EU's emissions targets after Brexit, although no political party is currently advocating this. It said EU regulations had been structured to allow makers of larger, heavier cars to have higher levels of emissions per km. ""Yet, despite its flaws, there are dangers of Britain choosing not to align with the EU vehicle regulations post-Brexit,"" it added. RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: ""It's important to remember that the SUV trend has been developing for around two decades, arguably really taking off in the mid-2000s, whereas the electric vehicle (EV) market is only just beginning to accelerate as battery technology improves, along with the availability of public charge points. ""As a result, there are some very strong EV sports utility vehicles on sale now."" A spokesperson for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: ""Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and dual-purpose cars are an increasingly popular choice, available in a range of sizes, and valued for their style, practicality, higher ride and commanding view of the road. ""Thanks to ongoing investment, like all vehicles, they're also ever more efficient, with average CO2 emissions from new dual-purpose cars having fallen more than 43% on 2000 levels."" They're tall, spacious, and styled to look as though they belong halfway up a mountain, even though most will never ever venture more than a few metres off-road. SUVs are undoubtedly popular with drivers. But they're also big and heavy - and that means they emit more CO2 than smaller cars. But it would be wrong to see these figures as a sign that the market doesn't want more environmentally friendly vehicles. To put it simply, most people still drive petrol or diesel cars, and if they want a bigger car, right now they'll probably choose a petrol or diesel SUV, because they're familiar and widely available. But just take a look at the tiny, yet rapidly growing market for electric cars. Among the models now on the market are the Kia e-Niro, Hyundai's Kona Electric, the Jaguar I-Pace, the Audi E-tron and the Mercedes EQ. All of them are SUVs. The manufacturers think they can surf the wave of enthusiasm for big cars - and use it to sell more electric vehicles. The two are certainly not mutually exclusive.

A spokesperson for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: ""Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and dual-purpose cars are an increasingly popular choice, available in a range of sizes, and valued for their style, practicality, higher ride and commanding view of the road. ""Thanks to ongoing investment, like all vehicles, they're also ever more efficient, with average CO2 emissions from new dual-purpose cars having fallen more than 43% on 2000 levels."" They're tall, spacious, and styled to look as though they belong halfway up a mountain, even though most will never ever venture more than a few metres off-road. SUVs are undoubtedly popular with drivers. But they're also big and heavy - and that means they emit more CO2 than smaller cars. But it would be wrong to see these figures as a sign that the market doesn't want more environmentally friendly vehicles. To put it simply, most people still drive petrol or diesel cars, and if they want a bigger car, right now they'll probably choose a petrol or diesel SUV, because they're familiar and widely available. But just take a look at the tiny, yet rapidly growing market for electric cars. Among the models now on the market are the Kia e-Niro, Hyundai's Kona Electric, the Jaguar I-Pace, the Audi E-tron and the Mercedes EQ. All of them are SUVs. The manufacturers think they can surf the wave of enthusiasm for big cars - and use it to sell more electric vehicles. The two are certainly not mutually exclusive.

The volcano that is always active,"White Island is a popular tourist destination Moments before New Zealand's most active volcano erupted on Monday, tourists were seen walking inside its rim. The privately-owned White Island, or Whakaari, is a popular destination for day tours and scenic flights. It has been dubbed by some tour operators a ""living, breathing, geological giant"" and ""the world's most accessible active marine volcano"". Six people have been confirmed dead since Monday's eruptionand eight are still missing on the island - though police say they are also likely to have died. The incident has raised questions over the safety of the White Island tourism industry and the reliability of volcanic warning systems. Here, two experts explain the background of the volcano and its latest eruption. The volcano is located in the Bay of Plenty, about 48km (29 miles) from the east coast of New Zealand's North Island. GeoNet, New Zealand's geological hazard information site, says White Island has been classified as New Zealand's most active volcano since 1976, when it began 24 years of almost continuous eruption. A second ""eruptive episode"" started in 2011 and continues today. Jan Lindsay, a professor at the University of Auckland, said White Island was ""persistently active in the sense that it has a very active hydrothermal system"". Rather than having lots of eruptions involving magma, she said this meant it saw periodic ash explosions and had lakes ""churning over with gases"". ""The spectacular thing about White Island is that there is so much gas coming out of the volcano and lots of minerals crystallising,"" said Ben Kennedy, a professor of physical volcanology at the University of Canterbury. ""What that also means is that there are minerals crystallising deeper down and creating blockages - that allows pressure to build, and the volcano needs to periodically clear its throat."" He said there had been six small eruptions in the past eight years, but that on previous occasions there had been no tourists on the island ""mostly due to the time or weather conditions"". In 1914, a landslide destroyed a mining village on the island and killed 10 workers. There was a warning of unusual activity at the volcano ahead of Monday's eruption. In November, the alert level was raised from one - meaning minor volcanic unrest - to two, indicating moderate to heightened volcanic unrest. ""There was a heightened level of unrest and everyone was aware,"" Prof Lindsay said. But, she added, ""even though there was increased activity, there was no sense of what was going to happen."" An eruption can occur at any volcanic alert level, but there are also times when a volcano alert is raised to level two and there is no subsequent eruption, according to GeoNet. Prof Lindsay said it was possible there was no magma involved in Monday's eruption, which may have made it harder to detect. ""If you have something that's being driven by the hydrothermal system it's... not like when you have a magma chamber building beneath the volcano and you get lots of seismic activity,"" she said. ""If it's a shallow burp, you may not see that."" This video can not be played How to speak volcano like a pro Prof Kennedy noted that the volcano had been in a ""state of heightened activity"" for the past eight years and that ""the type of volcano it is means small eruptions can happen at any time"" with little to no warning. But, he said, high levels of sulphur dioxide were the ""tell-tale sign"" that prompted the raised alert in November. Monday's eruption was classified as ""moderate"" on the volcanic alert system, according to GeoNet. Prof Kennedy said this was because it only affected the crater area. About 70% of the volcano is underwater, with the crater and surrounding peak standing some 321m (1,053ft) above sea level. Including its underwater base, White Island is the largest volcanic structure in New Zealand. Officials said some 47 people from around the world were on the White Island when it erupted on Monday. Thousands of tourists visit the volcano every year. It was bought by Auckland stockbroker George Raymond Buttle in 1936. He later refused to sell it to the government but agreed in 1952 to have it declared a private scenic reserve. The island is today still owned by the Buttle Family Trust. According to the New Zealand Tourism Guide, the owners of White Island Tours were appointed as the official guardians of the island and access is only granted through designated tour operators. The BBC has contacted White Island Tours for comment. This video can not be played Tourists could be seen waiting to be evacuated from White Island Government agency GNS Science ""put out their alert bulletins and have good communication with tour companies and they know what the risk is"", Prof Lindsay said. ""They go out so often and are used to the volcano's behaviour, but something like this - it happens and it has happened in the past, but you can go years without it happening. It may change the way they do things in the future."" People nearby a phreatic eruption - an eruption driven by superheated steam and gas - are typically killed by ""hot steam and water and what we call ballistic projectiles - blocks being thrown out of the vent"", Prof Lindsay told the BBC. Prof Kennedy compared the incident to the 2014 eruption of Japan's Mount Ontake, where most people hurt were hit by flying rocks ejected out of the volcano. ""There also tends to be a cloud of ash and gas and rocks that might be moving sideways out of the crater,"" he said. White Island reportedly got its English-language name from explorer Capt James Cook in 1769 because it always appeared to be in a white cloud. A number of stories have been written about the volcano and in more recent years it has provided a backdrop to movies including the third instalment of The Chronicles of Narnia series. ""It's a spectacular, otherworldly place,"" said Prof Kennedy. ""It's an environment that you should wear gas masks on because of strong sulphuric gases. You can hear the noise of the gas coming out of the volcano. It's quite an intense but beautiful experience if you do a little circuit and then get off pretty quickly.""

In pictures: White Island eruption,"An island volcano erupted while tourists were visiting on Monday in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty. By Tuesday, six people were confirmed dead. Eight others were feared to have died and about 30 have serious burns. Tourist Michael Schade tweeted pictures of the eruption (seen above and below), saying: ""My god, White Island volcano in New Zealand erupted today for first time since 2001. ""My family and I had gotten off it 20 minutes before, were waiting at our boat about to leave when we saw it."" Tour guides could be seen evacuating people minutes after the eruption. A photo taken by the Auckland Rescue Helicopter Trust, below, shows the volcano from the air. A video released by New Zealand's Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences (GNS), screenshot seen below, shows the volcano spewing steam and ash. A combination photo from GNS, below, shows the volcano shortly before and after the eruption. Coastguard rescue boats are seen, below, next to a marina near Whakatane, about 40km (25 miles) south of White Island. Rescue workers treated survivors in Whakatane, on the North Island's mainland. On Tuesday, steam continued to rise from the White Island volcano. New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern (below, centre) gave a press conference with Police Supt Bruce Bird (left) and Whakatane mayor Judy Turner. Ms Ardern said she shared the ""unfathomable grief"" of those who had lost family and friends. The prime minister also met first responders at the Whakatane fire station. A flag in Whakatane could be seen flying at half mast. In Sydney, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison addressed media with Foreign Minister Marise Payne. Twenty-four of the people affected were from Australia. People leave tributes at the port of Tauranga, next to the cruise ship which had carried passengers to White Island when it erupted. White Island, also called Whakaari, is the country's most active volcano, seen below in 1999. Tourist Ron Neil visited the island in January 2017 and took the photos below. ""We were obliged to wear helmets and gas masks as a condition of climbing the volcano,"" Mr Neil said. ""We were only allowed on the island because the risk of eruption that day was measured as 1, on a scale of 1-5. ""Still the sulphur fumes were choking."" Mr Neil is seen above, wearing a gas mask. .

"Five dead, eight missing in New Zealand eruptionTwo British women are among the 31 people receiving treatment in hospital, says UK official.","This video can not be played Tourists could be seen waiting to be evacuated from White Island New Zealand police have confirmed that five people have died and eight are missing after White Island volcano erupted on Monday as tourists visited. Thirty-four people survived, with 31 still receiving treatment in hospital. Two British women were among those receiving treatment, said the UK High Commissioner to New Zealand, Laura Clarke. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he ""feared"" three of the five confirmed dead were Australian. Mr Morrison said that 24 Australians were on board a cruise ship exploring the island in the Bay of Plenty when the volcano erupted. Of those, 13 people had been hospitalised and 11 were unaccounted for, he said. ""This is a terrible tragedy, a time of great innocence and joy interrupted by the horror of that eruption,"" Mr Morrison told reporters in Sydney. The volcano early on Tuesday Also among those listed as missing or injured were US, Chinese, Malaysian and New Zealand citizens. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a press conference on Tuesday that she shared the ""unfathomable grief"" of those who had lost loved ones. Tourists were seen walking inside the crater of White Island volcano moments before it erupted. Ms Ardern said further rescue efforts for the missing were now ""very sadly a recovery operation"". This satellite radar image shows White Island volcano after the eruption - radar is able to take images that are not obscured by ash, steam and cloud The survivors of the eruption were taken off the uninhabited island by boat or by helicopter. Emergency services have so far been unable to search the area because of dangerous conditions, with plumes of smoke and ash continuing to rise above the volcano on Tuesday. Ms Ardern acknowledged the apparently high number of Australian victims. ""Can I say to our Australian family, there are no two countries closer and we are devastated at what has happened here and particularly want to acknowledge those from Australia who have been caught up in this horrific, horrific incident,"" she said. The privately owned volcano that is always active In pictures: White Island eruption New Zealand profile White Island, also called Whakaari, is the country's most active volcano. Despite that, the privately owned island is a tourist destination with frequent day tours and scenic flights available. Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Whakatane At sunrise in  Whakatane, smoke could be seen rising from White Island or Whakaari - 50km across the ocean. The waterfront was eerily quiet - save for the Australian and New Zealand TV networks (along with the BBC) sombrely conveying the latest updates on the dead, the missing and the injured. None of those hurt remain in the local hospital which was a hive of activity less than 24 hours earlier. Three patients have been discharged. Others - too sick for this small town facility - have been sent to specialist burns departments across the country. Many of them are critically ill. Earlier, as we drove to Whakatane through the night from Auckland we passed the illuminated outline of the Ovation of the Seas - the cruise ship which should have been continuing its tour around New Zealand. Instead it remains moored, as its passengers - some of them the friends and families of those hurt, killed and missing - try to fathom how this happened. Police confirmed that a total of 47 people had been on the island when the disaster happened on Monday afternoon local time. Rescuers will only go to the island when it is safe to do so, said Superintendent Bruce Bird. But reconnaissance flights detected no signs of life there. ""We will be relying on advice coming from the scientific and technical committee in Wellington who are currently meeting at the moment and hope to hear further advice on when we may potentially return to the island,"" Supt Bird said. A group of visitors (circled) could be seen inside the crater before images went dark Speaking at the same news conference, Prime Minister Ardern paid tribute to helicopter crews who had flown to the island on Monday to bring people out despite the dangers. ""I want to acknowledge the courageous decision made by first responders and those pilots who in their immediate rescue efforts made an incredibly brave decision under extraordinarily dangerous circumstances in an attempt to get people out,"" she said. White Island erupted at around 14:11 (01:11 GMT) on Monday, sending up a thick plume of ash and smoke which was filmed by visitor Michael Schade. Mr Schade, who was on a boat leaving the island after a morning tour, told the BBC he had been at the crater just 30 minutes before the disaster. Allow Twitter content?

""We had just got on the boat... then someone pointed it out and we saw it,"" he said. ""I was basically just shocked. The boat turned back and we grabbed some people that were waiting on the pier."" Another witness, Brazilian Allessandro Kauffmann, said in anInstagram post in Portuguese,externalthat his boat had left five minutes before the eruption. ""This other tour that arrived right after, unfortunately they did not manage to leave in time, and there were some people that suffered serious burns,"" he added. A live feed from the volcano showed a group of visitors inside the crater before the stream went dark. There are few details about those caught in the eruption. Some who had gone to the island were passengers from the Ovation of the Seas, a cruise ship owned by Royal Caribbean. It left Sydney last week and stopped near Auckland on New Zealand's North Island before arriving in the city of Tauranga, near White Island, on Sunday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australians had ""been caught up in this terrible event"" and the authorities were ""working to determine their wellbeing"". A web page has been set up by the New Zealand Red Cross for families to register missing loved ones.,external The island, also known as Whakaari, is privately owned and is typically visited by thousands of tourists every year, despite the fact that it has been erupting in some form since 2011. Geological hazard monitors GeoNet pass on information about the volcano's activity to tour operators and the police, but tourists make their own decisions about whether to visit. Visitors are supplied with hard hats and gas masks,externalto protect against sulphurous steam and must have suitable footwear to make the tour, according to New Zealand website Stuff. The owners of Whakatane-based company White Island Tours are the official guardians of the island, which was declared a private scenic reserve in 1952, and they grant access through designated tour operators. According to the New Zealand Herald, White Island Tours warned on its website that visitors ""should be aware that there is always a risk of eruptive activity regardless of the alert level"", while stating it followed a ""comprehensive safety plan which determines"" its activities on the island ""at the various levels"". Company chairman Paul Quinn said the event on the island had been a ""terrible tragedy"" and the company's ""thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been impacted"". The BBC has contacted White Island Tours for comment. Last Tuesday GeoNet warned of a heightened level of activity at the site, but also said that ""the current level of activity does not pose a direct hazard to visitors"". White Island has seen several eruptions over the years, most recently in 2016 but no-one was hurt in that event.

Johnson criticised over reaction to sick boy image,"Jack waited for four hours in a room without a bed, despite being admitted under blue light to Leeds General Infirmary Boris Johnson has been criticised after initially refusing to look at a picture of a sick four-year-old boy who had to sleep on the floor of a Leeds hospital. The picture inthe Daily Mirror,externalof Jack, who had suspected pneumonia, spurred complaints about NHS cuts. An ITV reporter tried to show Mr Johnson the picture on his phone, but he refused to look, before taking the device and putting it in his pocket. He later looked and returned the phone. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: ""He just doesn't care"", while Independent Group for Change leader Anna Soubry called his actions ""appalling"". Kuenssberg: Johnson's bad day shows election not over Mr Johnson was asked by other reporters why he had not looked at the photo, but he did not answer the question directly, instead repeating Conservative pledges for the NHS and promising to rebuild ""the whole of Leeds General Infirmary from top to bottom"". This video can not be played Moment Boris Johnson put ITV reporter's phone in his pocket Health Secretary Matt Hancock later visited the hospital to speak to management about the case. He said he was ""horrified"" by the incident involving Jack, adding: ""It's not good enough and I have apologised."" But Mr Hancock would not comment on the PM's reaction, saying: ""What people care about is what are we doing to improve care at Leeds General and across the NHS."" As he left, the health secretary was met by a group of protesters shouting at him. The boy's mother has said she does not want her son's treatment being used as a ""political football"". In a formal complaint to press regulator IPSO, she said she had initially given permission to two newspapers to use her son Jack's image but -  after the story was widely reported across other news outlets - she now wanted to prevent any further publication of the picture or his details. In her letter, she said the actions of the media were ""causing significant distress"" to Jack and his family. Boy slept on hospital floor due to lack of beds 11 charts on why the NHS matters in the election Are these 'new' hospitals actually new? Jack was taken into Leeds General Infirmary last week after being ill for six days, his mother told the Mirror. His mother said he had been seen as soon as he arrived and given a bed and oxygen, but a few hours later the bed had to be given to another patient and Jack was left without one for more than four hours. His mother said she then made a makeshift bed for her son with coats and took the picture. She told the newspaper the doctors and nurses were ""lovely people"", but she was ""angry at the lack of funding and the lack of beds"", accusing the government of ""failing our children"". Boris Johnson was on the campaign trail when he was shown the picture of Jack Dr Yvette Oade, chief medical officer at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ""Our hospitals are extremely busy at the moment and we are very sorry that Jack's family had a long wait in our emergency department. ""We are extremely sorry that there were only chairs available in the treatment room, and no bed. This falls below our usual high standards, and for this we would like to sincerely apologise to Jack and his family."" ITV reporter Joe Pike tweeted,externalabout his interview with Mr Johnson, which took place in Grimsby on the campaign trail. He asked the PM to look at the photo of Jack on his phone several times. Mr Johnson said he had not seen the picture yet but refused to look at it while Mr Pike questioned him. Eventually, he took Mr Pike's phone and put it in his pocket, saying: ""If you don't mind, I'll give you an interview now."" Mr Pike said: ""You refuse to look at the photo. You've taken my phone and put it in your pocket, prime minister. ""His mother says the NHS is in crisis. What's your response to that?"" Mr Johnson then removed the phone from his pocket and looked at the screen. ""It's a terrible, terrible photo, and I apologise, obviously, to the family, and all those who have terrible experiences in the NHS,"" he said. ""But what we are doing is supporting the NHS, and on the whole I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had. ""That's why we're making huge investments into the NHS, and we can only do it if we get Parliament going, if we unblock the current deadlock, and we move forward.""

Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson also said Mr Johnson would not look at the photo because ""he simply does not care"". She tweeted: ""He doesn't care about Jack. He doesn't care about anyone other than himself."" And the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called Mr Johnson ""a man with no empathy and no moral compass"".

Johnson's Brexit plan 'presents major challenge',"Putting Boris Johnson's plan for Brexit into action will be a ""major"" challenge for government due to new customs arrangements for Northern Ireland, according to a leaked document. The PM has said the UK will fully exit the EU by December 2020 if he wins the election and MPs approve his plan. But the document says government will struggle to deliver the infrastructure and staffing needed by that deadline. The PM did not directly comment on the report when asked. But Mr Johnson instead said his plan was a ""great deal"" for both Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and would ""give the country real momentum"". LIVE: Latest from the campaign trail Faisal Islam: Leaked document raises concerns about NI-GB trade General election 2019: A matter of mistrust? The SNP said the leak was ""just the latest evidence that Boris Johnson can't be trusted"". It comes as the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster, said Mr Johnson ""broke [his] word"" after promising there would be no checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit - a red line for her and her candidates. Throughout the election campaign, the PM has denied there will be checks in the Irish Sea, despite telling the BBC in the days after his deal was agreed that some checks would be needed. Mr Johnson's deal with the EU does mean there will be checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland but there has been confusion on whether there will be checks on goods going in the other direction. Will there be checks between Great Britain and NI? What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Mr Johnson has pledged to finalise leaving the EU by 31 January, and said a trade deal will be done with the bloc by the following December. However, he has also said if no deal is done by that deadline, the UK will still leave - meaning all transition agreements will come to an end by the close of 2020. First reported by the Financial Times,external, the document from the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) has cast doubt on whether the government will be ready to meet this proposal when it comes to new arrangements between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The BBC has also seen the document - which was circulated to senior officials in Whitehall last week - that warns of ""high levels of checks and controls"" as a result of the deal, and says there may be ""legal and political"" impacts. It reads: ""Delivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge."" DExEU said it would not comment on leaks. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak responds to leaked Brexit document But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak - who sits on the ""exit operations committee"" for Brexit planning - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had been ""incredibly impressed by all the preparations that have gone on"". He said such planning meant the UK was in ""very good shape, not just to deal with new trading relationships, but all the other things"". Commenting on the leak, the SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""Even his own civil servants know the UK government aren't in a position to deliver Brexit on his promised timescale. ""If we leave the EU, the UK faces years of difficult and contentious trade talks. If you've not liked Brexit so far, you ain't seen nothing yet."" The pro-Leave DUP has previously backed the Conservative Party, giving Theresa May a working majority in Parliament, but it has been critical of both her withdrawal agreement with the EU and Mr Johnson's. This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg grills Johnson in October on Brexit deal Speaking to Today, Ms Foster said the DUP had spoken to HMRC officials after Mr Johnson's deal was done, and they had made it ""very clear"" to her that there would need to be checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. ""This is very concerning for us as it goes to the heart of the act of union,"" she said. ""Boris wants to, in his words, 'get Brexit done', and I completely understand that. But you can't leave part of the UK in a worse-off position."" Asked repeatedly whether she could now trust anything the prime minister said, Ms Foster added: ""It is very important for us in Northern Ireland not just to have the words but the detail.

New Zealand volcano eruption kills at least five,"This video can not be played Tourists could be seen waiting to be evacuated from White Island A volcano has erupted in New Zealand, leaving five people dead and several unaccounted for, police have said. Tourists were seen walking inside the crater of White Island volcano moments before Monday's eruption. Twenty-three people have been rescued, but it is unclear how many people remained on the island. Police say aerial reconnaissance flights have not identified any sign of life there. White Island, also called Whakaari, is the country's most active volcano. The privately owned volcano that is always active New Zealand profile Despite that, the privately owned island is a tourist destination with frequent day tours and scenic flights available. Police have said fewer than 50 people were on the island when the volcano erupted. Deputy Police Commissioner John Tims told reporters that ""both New Zealand and overseas tourists"" were believed to be involved. Rescuers are not able to reach the island because of the risk of further eruptions, he added. It is currently night time in the area. Some of those injured are in a critical condition, Radio New Zealand reported. The eruption of White Island began at about 14:11 local time (01:11 GMT). Visitor Michael Schade - who was on a boat leaving the island after a morning tour - filmed a thick plume of ash and smoke as the volcano erupted. Allow Twitter content?

He told the BBC he was at the crater just 30 minutes before the eruption. ""It was still safe-ish but they were trying to limit the group sizes [of people visiting the volcano]."" Describing the eruption, he said: ""We had just got on the boat... then someone pointed it out and we saw it. I was basically just shocked. The boat turned back and we grabbed some people that were waiting on the pier."" Another witness, Brazilian Allessandro Kauffmann, narrowly missed the eruption. ""There were two tours that went to this volcano today. One of them was ours, which was the first. We left five minutes before the volcano erupted,""he posted on Instagram in Portuguese.,external ""This other tour that arrived right after, unfortunately they did not manage to leave in time, and there were some people that suffered serious burns."" A live feed from the volcano showed a group of visitors inside the crater before images went dark. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said: ""I know there will be a huge amount of concern and anxiety for those who have loved ones at the island at that time - and I can assure them police are doing everything they can."" She said falling ash was hampering attempts by rescuers to get to the site. Stills from a live feed show the crater minutes before the eruption The New Zealand Defence Force is now helping the rescue operation. A military plane has carried out surveillance and two helicopters and personnel are ready to assist. Police initially said there were 100 people on or near the island, but later revised down the number to 50. Some of them were passengers from the Ovation of the Seas, a cruise ship owned by Royal Caribbean. It is currently at port in Tauranga, a coastal city near White Island. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australians had ""been caught up in this terrible event"", adding that authorities were ""working to determine their wellbeing"". On 3 December, geological hazard monitoring website GeoNet warned ""the volcano may be entering a period where eruptive activity is more likely than normal"", although it added ""the current level of activity does not pose a direct hazard to visitors"". University of Auckland associate professor Jan Lindsay said the alert level was recently raised from one to two. ""There was a heightened level of unrest and everyone was aware,"" she said. ""[The volcano] has a persistently active hydrothermal system... if gases build up under a block of clay or mud they can be released quite suddenly,"" Prof Lindsay said. ""It's possible that there's no magma involved, that it's just a phreatic eruption - a steam eruption. We don't know yet."" When asked if visitors should have been on the island, Prof Lindsay said: ""It's a difficult question. It's often in a state of heightened unrest. ""It's a privately owned island and with lots of private tour operators. It is not part of the conservation estate - and so not under government control. ""GNS [New Zealand's geoscience institute] put out their alert bulletins and have good communication with tour companies, and they know what the risk is. "" White Island has seen several eruptions over the years, most recently in 2016, but no-one was hurt. Seismologist Ken Gledhill said: ""It was kind of almost like a throat-clearing kind of eruption - and that's why material probably won't have made it to mainland New Zealand. ""It went up about 12,000 metres into the sky and so... on the scheme of things for volcanic eruptions it's not large, but if you were close to that, it is not good."" Are you in the area?

'No sign of life' on New Zealand volcano island,"This video can not be played Tourists could be seen waiting to be evacuated from White Island New Zealand police have confirmed that five people have died and eight are missing after White Island volcano erupted on Monday as tourists visited. Thirty-four people survived, with 31 still receiving treatment in hospital. Two British women were among those receiving treatment, said the UK High Commissioner to New Zealand, Laura Clarke. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he ""feared"" three of the five confirmed dead were Australian. Mr Morrison said that 24 Australians were on board a cruise ship exploring the island in the Bay of Plenty when the volcano erupted. Of those, 13 people had been hospitalised and 11 were unaccounted for, he said. ""This is a terrible tragedy, a time of great innocence and joy interrupted by the horror of that eruption,"" Mr Morrison told reporters in Sydney. The volcano early on Tuesday Also among those listed as missing or injured were US, Chinese, Malaysian and New Zealand citizens. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a press conference on Tuesday that she shared the ""unfathomable grief"" of those who had lost loved ones. Tourists were seen walking inside the crater of White Island volcano moments before it erupted. Ms Ardern said further rescue efforts for the missing were now ""very sadly a recovery operation"". This satellite radar image shows White Island volcano after the eruption - radar is able to take images that are not obscured by ash, steam and cloud The survivors of the eruption were taken off the uninhabited island by boat or by helicopter. Emergency services have so far been unable to search the area because of dangerous conditions, with plumes of smoke and ash continuing to rise above the volcano on Tuesday. Ms Ardern acknowledged the apparently high number of Australian victims. ""Can I say to our Australian family, there are no two countries closer and we are devastated at what has happened here and particularly want to acknowledge those from Australia who have been caught up in this horrific, horrific incident,"" she said. The privately owned volcano that is always active In pictures: White Island eruption New Zealand profile White Island, also called Whakaari, is the country's most active volcano. Despite that, the privately owned island is a tourist destination with frequent day tours and scenic flights available. Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Whakatane At sunrise in  Whakatane, smoke could be seen rising from White Island or Whakaari - 50km across the ocean. The waterfront was eerily quiet - save for the Australian and New Zealand TV networks (along with the BBC) sombrely conveying the latest updates on the dead, the missing and the injured. None of those hurt remain in the local hospital which was a hive of activity less than 24 hours earlier. Three patients have been discharged. Others - too sick for this small town facility - have been sent to specialist burns departments across the country. Many of them are critically ill. Earlier, as we drove to Whakatane through the night from Auckland we passed the illuminated outline of the Ovation of the Seas - the cruise ship which should have been continuing its tour around New Zealand. Instead it remains moored, as its passengers - some of them the friends and families of those hurt, killed and missing - try to fathom how this happened. Police confirmed that a total of 47 people had been on the island when the disaster happened on Monday afternoon local time. Rescuers will only go to the island when it is safe to do so, said Superintendent Bruce Bird. But reconnaissance flights detected no signs of life there. ""We will be relying on advice coming from the scientific and technical committee in Wellington who are currently meeting at the moment and hope to hear further advice on when we may potentially return to the island,"" Supt Bird said. A group of visitors (circled) could be seen inside the crater before images went dark Speaking at the same news conference, Prime Minister Ardern paid tribute to helicopter crews who had flown to the island on Monday to bring people out despite the dangers. ""I want to acknowledge the courageous decision made by first responders and those pilots who in their immediate rescue efforts made an incredibly brave decision under extraordinarily dangerous circumstances in an attempt to get people out,"" she said. White Island erupted at around 14:11 (01:11 GMT) on Monday, sending up a thick plume of ash and smoke which was filmed by visitor Michael Schade. Mr Schade, who was on a boat leaving the island after a morning tour, told the BBC he had been at the crater just 30 minutes before the disaster. Allow Twitter content?

A live feed from the volcano showed a group of visitors inside the crater before the stream went dark. There are few details about those caught in the eruption. Some who had gone to the island were passengers from the Ovation of the Seas, a cruise ship owned by Royal Caribbean. It left Sydney last week and stopped near Auckland on New Zealand's North Island before arriving in the city of Tauranga, near White Island, on Sunday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australians had ""been caught up in this terrible event"" and the authorities were ""working to determine their wellbeing"". A web page has been set up by the New Zealand Red Cross for families to register missing loved ones.,external The island, also known as Whakaari, is privately owned and is typically visited by thousands of tourists every year, despite the fact that it has been erupting in some form since 2011. Geological hazard monitors GeoNet pass on information about the volcano's activity to tour operators and the police, but tourists make their own decisions about whether to visit. Visitors are supplied with hard hats and gas masks,externalto protect against sulphurous steam and must have suitable footwear to make the tour, according to New Zealand website Stuff. The owners of Whakatane-based company White Island Tours are the official guardians of the island, which was declared a private scenic reserve in 1952, and they grant access through designated tour operators. According to the New Zealand Herald, White Island Tours warned on its website that visitors ""should be aware that there is always a risk of eruptive activity regardless of the alert level"", while stating it followed a ""comprehensive safety plan which determines"" its activities on the island ""at the various levels"". Company chairman Paul Quinn said the event on the island had been a ""terrible tragedy"" and the company's ""thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been impacted"". The BBC has contacted White Island Tours for comment. Last Tuesday GeoNet warned of a heightened level of activity at the site, but also said that ""the current level of activity does not pose a direct hazard to visitors"". White Island has seen several eruptions over the years, most recently in 2016 but no-one was hurt in that event.

This video can not be played General election 2019: 'If the climate was a bank we'd have bailed it out' says Bartley Tomorrow is the penultimate day of the election campaign, and as ever we'll be bringing you the latest updates throughout the day. Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Nigel Farage, Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon will all be out on the campaign trail. There will be two BBC debates in the evening â BBC Scotland will broadcast its Scotland
Leaders debate live from Pacific Quay in Glasgow, while the leaders of the
main parties in Northern Ireland take part in a debate in front of a studio
audience. Labour candidate Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who is standing in Tooting, has criticised the Conservatives for releasing a campaign video based on the same idea as hers, which she posted two weeks ago. Ms Allin-Khan had posted a spoof of a scene from the film Love Actually, when a character uses large, handwritten signs to get a message across to someone on the doorstep. (In the film, Andrew Lincoln's character is confessing his love to Keira Knightley, who is recently married to another man). Ms Allin-Khan's video went viral, being retweeted more than 8,000 times. Tonight, Boris Johnson's team produced their own version of the same scene but with the PM on the doorstep holding signs with his party's slogans, particularly on Brexit. Again, it's going viral on Twitter, with more than 2,000 retweets in the first hour it's been posted. Responding, Ms Allin-Khan tweeted: ""I won't be retweeting it - but Boris Johnson has copied my #ElectionActually video. ""Tanks. On. The. Lawn.

Don't share his version in outrage - instead, share my original version."" Several journalists have also been pointing out that the idea was done originally by Ms Allin-Khan. A councillor and party official were filmed making the comments on the election campaign trail. Read the full story here. This video can not be played Argument between Farage and Rayner on Question Time Following on from our earlier post, here are a few more of tomorrow's front pages: The Mirror says its front page from Monday - of the boy sleeping on a hospital floor - made the PM ""squirm"". The paper hopes Tuesday's edition will do the same The i says the ""hospital fracas"" has ""floored"" the PM - but it chooses to lead on the deadly volcano eruption in New Zealand The Mail leads on the prime minister's comments that the BBC's licence fee is outdated and could be scrapped The Times front page looks quite similar to the Mail's. It leads with the same image and story from New Zealand, while making a nod towards the PM's licence fee comments Lord Sugar is calling on voters to support the Conservative Party, the Sun says - using a well-known soundbite from his reality TV show, the Apprentice, as it's headline It's that time of night when we can share a few of tomorrow's front pages with you. One story in particular is dominating the newspapers... The Metro calls the situation a ""war of words"" which led to a backlash for Boris Johnson The Guardian claims Mr Johnsonâs team tried to turn the story on to Labour by wrongly briefing that a Tory aide was punched outside the hospital by a left-wing activist The Financial Times describes the situation as the ""first significant stumble"" the PM has made - and it's come in the ""final straight"" of campaigning The Telegraph looks instead at a memo which says the chances of Labour forming a coalition government have been seriously underestimated Listen back to the Question Time election special on BBC Sounds.

And Adam heads to Crewe to chat to a group of undecided voters. Listen to the episode here. This video can not be played The SNP say Scotland is losing out over Brexit Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Talking to voters around the country two big issues have had the elusive ""cut through"" in this campaign - the Tories promise to take us out of the EU at the end of next month and Labour's attack on their handling of the NHS. Of course, other subjects have been part of the conversation but those are the issues that have come up most often during the last few weeks when we've been travelling around the country. And in every election in recent history, the Labour Party has tried to sow doubts in voters' minds about whether or not the Tories can be trusted with the health service at all. That's why Boris Johnson's terrible day on the campaign trail today matters. Read more from Laura here. Emma Barnett thanks the panel and audience for coming - and that's it, the 90-minute debate is over. We've had questions on Brexit, housing, climate change and trust in politics - among other topics.

In the final exchange of the debate, Jo Swinson calls on Humza Yousaf to have an ""honesty"" about Scottish independence. Mr Yousaf - whose SNP party is calling for indyref2 - says that although he knows it won't be ""perfectly rosy"", Scotland would be economically stable if it were to become an independent country. But Ms Swinson - whose Lib Dems party is against Scottish independence - says it's only fair to be honest that, if Scottish independence were to happen, it would be ""a hit to the [Scottish] economy"".

The four key issues for voters still undecided,"Not yet made up your mind how to vote on Thursday? You're not alone. Three days before the election, many voters are struggling to find a party that offers what they want. This is a snapshot of the undecided voters of 2019. The BBC has commissioned an opinion research consultancy, Britain Thinks, to put together a sample of voters - representative in age, location, gender, race, class and voting history. Some common themes emerge: theNHS,Brexit, alack of trustin politicians andmoney. We asked our participants to fill in a survey about themselves, their voting history - and what's stopping them from making up their minds. The answers below have been edited for clarity. Then it's over to our correspondents to tell us what the answers reveal about the voters in 2019 - and why so many of them are dissatisfied with the choice on offer. For many of our participants, such asRob,Kate,RachelandLeanne(left to right, below) the NHS and its future are among their top concerns. For Sutton Coldfield residentRob, 48, the NHS is by far the most important issue of the campaign. He's a regular at the gym, and credits his wife with keeping him and their son on a healthy diet. He voted Remain in 2016, and Labour at the last three elections. The NHS is ""a fantastic service that underpins who we are as a nation"", he says. ""It deserves every penny and more that it can get from the public purse."" Thirty-six-year-oldKatealso lives in Sutton Coldfield and is frustrated with the number of people who don't turn up for NHS appointments, when she has to wait days to get one. She voted solidly Conservative in the last three elections and Leave in 2016. ""I believe they should operate a three-strikes-and-out policy. If you miss three appointments without notification or a genuine reason (eg hospitalisation), you should be charged before a doctor will see you again."" Rachel, 49, worries about over-stretched GPs and mental health services, as well as the difficulty of retaining qualified staff. Her youngest son had to wait six hours to get his suspected fractured wrist looked at. Rachel, who lives in Cheshire and works as a teaching assistant, has voted Lib Dem (2017), Labour (2015) and Conservative (2010). She didn't vote in the 2016 referendum. ""What we do not want is an American-style system,"" she says. Self-described ""fitness fanatic""Leanne, 34, is suspicious of claims that the NHS will be privatised or sold to the Americans. She voted Leave in 2016 and Conservative in 2010, 2015 and 2017. She says friends and family who work for the NHS are under enormous pressure. ""How will our NHS be managed from now on to ensure that our population is cared for correctly?"" she wants to know. The NHS has undoubtedly been one of the key issues of the election. That should come as no surprise - Lord Lawson, a former Conservative chancellor, perhaps best summed it up when he said the NHS was the ""closest thing the English people have to a religion"". The parties have tried to outdo each other with their attempts to be seen as the party of the NHS, promising extra funding, increases in staff and more money for buildings. But while the budget has been increasing over the past decade, it has not gone up fast enough to cope with demand. It has meant longer waiting times for all sorts of treatment. The NHS has also been dragged into the Brexit debate, with Labour saying it is at risk from a post-Brexit US trade deal - something the Tories deny. The US pharmaceutical industry would certainly want the NHS to pay more for drugs, but this will undoubtedly be strongly resisted. Still undecided? More background here: 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS What do parties' NHS promises really mean? NHS claims fact-checked Most of our undecideds want certainty above all. More than three years on from the referendum, the likes ofMark,Chioma,ClaireandLeslie(left to right, below) don't understand why Brexit hasn't been resolved, one way or the other. Mark, 52, owns a small childcare company in London and has two teenage children with his wife, who recently recovered from cancer. She was treated on the NHS, although she has private health insurance. For Mark, a Leave voter, Brexit is the most important issue. ""Who is going to get Brexit done so that the country can move on and business conditions can return to some semblance of normality?"" he asks. Trade, immigration, the NHS: all will be affected by Brexit, saysChioma,37, a committed Christian originally from Nigeria, now living in Scotland. For that reason, she sees it as the most important issue facing the country. She voted Conservative in 2017 but Labour in 2015 and 2010. She didn't vote in the referendum. ""How soon can Brexit be decided?"" she asks. ""So we can know what we have to work with."" Clairelives in London and teaches adults with learning disabilities. She worries about knife crime and acid attacks in her local area. Claire, who voted Remain in 2016 and Labour in two of the last three elections, thinks Brexit will be ""a disaster"" for the country and wants another referendum. ""I'm worried it's going to be a one-issue election and [I'm] scared that could be very bad for the country. At the same time I think the Brexit question is already damaging Britain and is urgent."" Cheshire-born and bred,Leslie, 64, voted UKIP in 2017, Conservative before that, and Leave in 2016. He's not sure ""which of the main two parties are telling the truth"". He works as an engineer for an Italian company, but the owners haven't wanted to invest in the UK until Brexit is resolved. ""I would like the incoming government to move forward with this issue, then we could have the investment in staff needed,"" he says. He also worries about the impact of Brexit on the NHS and whether medical supplies will be protected. The trouble with Brexit is that all parties want to make the solutions sound simple, but it's actually a very complicated process. That's because leaving the EU would make huge changes to the way our whole economy operates - and loads of other issues like security cooperation and sharing data with our nearest neighbours would need to be renegotiated as well. The Tories promise to get Brexit done but they haven't even started trade talks. Labour says it will renegotiate a better deal and hold another referendum, but it's not clear whether it wants to leave or remain. And the Liberal Democrats' manifesto proposed stopping Brexit altogether, in effect ignoring the result of the 2016 referendum without giving anyone another say. The country has been divided quite sharply - and sometimes unpleasantly - by Brexit. The idea any party will be able to click their fingers and bring those divisions to a sudden end doesn't really stand up to scrutiny.  Whatever happens in this election, Brexit is going to be a long haul. Still undecided? More background here: How Remainers and Leavers plan to vote Brexit - where do the parties stand? Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Another thread running through many of our participants' answers is trust - or the lack of it. Just askMariam,Akeel,CliveandJames(left to right, below). Even if people like what the parties are saying, they don't believe the politicians will deliver. ""Why should I vote for you? What can you do to benefit peopleâ¦ and genuinely stick to your word?""Mariam, 24, from London has a challenge for the parties. She voted Conservative in the last two elections but didn't take part in the 2016 referendum. Mariam, who has a two-year-old daughter, is leaning towards voting Labour this time but questions the sincerity of the promises from all parties. Like Mariam,Akeelabstained in the 2016 referendum. He voted Labour in 2017 and Conservative in 2015. He's a truck driver, 38 years old, who lives in Birmingham and is concerned about the cost of living. He wants a contract with the politicians to hold them to account. ""If you can't do what you say you're going to do, what compensation do the public get?"" Clive, 62, worked in the mining industry and asbestos removal before retiring through ill health. He moved from Derbyshire to London, where he's now a volunteer working with homeless people and substance abusers. His view? ""Promise after promise from Labour or more of the same under the Tories"" - he considers the Lib Dems undemocratic and thinks no other parties have a chance. ""Who is the one that is believable? At the moment none of them are."" One possible outcome after 12 December is a hung parliament. If that's the case,James, 64 and from Glasgow, wants to know who the parties would work with. ""Don't treat us like little kids as if we know nothing and we need to believe every single word that comes out of their mouths,"" he fumes. He voted for the SNP in the last two elections and Remain in the referendum. He worries about what the future holds, especially the uncertainty over Brexit. Voters have always distrusted politicians but, at the start of this election campaign, a survey suggested just 14% of British adults believed they could trust them to tell the truth. That's a fall of five percentage points in a year, with politicians displacing advertising executives at the bottom of the truthfulness index. This rise in scepticism coincides with great volatility in UK politics, as the established parties tear themselves apart over Brexit. There have been 90 switches of allegiance by MPs in the past two years, a sign of how old tribalism is weakening. The Brexit divide has cut across traditional lines and that, I think, has added to voter uncertainty as to how individual politicians and indeed political parties will behave. The tone of politics has coarsened and the campaigns appear less bound by principles of honesty and integrity. Still undecided? More background here: Trust is the burning issue at this election Do people still vote according to class? Could undecided voters change the election? There's a lot of worry about public spending and how the parties will pay for their promises, but for many, such asBetty,Amelia,HumzaandGemma(left to right, below) financial concerns lie closer to home. Betty, who lives in Glasgow, has four children and five grandchildren. A Leave voter, she switched from Labour to the SNP in 2017, as she wanted Scotland's voice to be heard. She worries about the effect of austerity and Brexit on the economy. Her question to the candidates seeking her vote? ""What will you do to ensure that I will be able to pass on my family's inheritance that I have worked hard for?"" While Betty is retired, 18-year-oldAmeliais just starting out. She's a first-time voter who'd like another Brexit referendum so that she could vote to remain in the EU. She's preparing for A-levels and, after that, university. ""The large debt for tuition fees combined with maintenance loans will stick with me for a long proportion of my life,"" she says. Humza, 20, has finished his degree and is now eyeing the next stage: buying a property. He lives with his grandmother in south London and voted Labour in 2017. ""How are we going to tackle the issue of property prices to help people buy their first home for life security?"" he wants to know. Buying a house with her boyfriend was a major milestone forGemma, who owns a cleaning business in Nantwich. She voted Leave in 2016 and Liberal Democrat in the election the year before. She thinks the Conservatives are ""more for the wealthy than helping the working/lower class"" but worries about Labour's spending plans. The undecided voter can often be swayed by what politicians promise for the pound in your pocket. Average hourly wages, after accounting for the rising cost of living, are no higher than they were at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008, and poverty is most likely to be found in working households. People have differing views on who to blame for that, but it does mean household budgets are at the front of many voters' minds. They might also consider the effect this has had on different generations. Put simply, the old have fared better than the young. All the parties confront this issue in part, particularly targeting young first-time buyers who feel they have been locked out of the property market. There are promises too for a more generous minimum wage, and plans on who to tax or not. But universal benefits for pensioners and the ""triple-lock"" state pension guarantee are untouched. Ultimately, management of the UK economy will have the greatest effect on jobs, wages, and financial prospects. There are fundamental differences between the parties on how to approach this task. The trouble is, economists at the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies say the spending plans of the biggest two - Labour and the Conservatives - are""not credible"". Still undecided? More background here: Who do you vote for if your cupboards are empty? How wealthy are you? What are the challenges for the UK's economy?

Fleabag nominated for Golden Globes,"Taron Egerton as Elton John in Rocketman British stars are well represented in this year's Golden Globe nominations, with Rocketman's Taron Egerton and Phoebe Waller-Bridge up for awards. Waller-Bridge is up for a lead actress prize for Fleabag, while her Irish co-star Andrew Scott is also nominated. Marriage Story, a Netflix production, is the most nominated film, having received six citations in all. The Irishman, another Netflix film, and Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, have five nominations each. The Crown, Chernobyl and US crime thriller Unbelievable lead the way on the TV side of things, having received four nominations apiece. Johansson and Driver play a divorcing couple in Marriage Story Marriage Story and Martin Scorsese's The Irishman are both up for best film drama, as are Joker, The Two Popes and Sam Mendes' World War I epic 1917. Tarantino's film is up for best musical or comedy, alongside Nazi satire Jojo Rabbit, murder mystery Knives Out, Elton John biopic Rocketman and comic biopic Dolemite Is My Name. Golden Globes: 2020 nominees in full Globes criticised for all-male director nominees Scorsese, Mendes and Tarantino are up for the best film director award, with Joker's Todd Phillips and Parasite's Bong Jong Ho completing the all-male line-up. The South Korean film-maker is also up for best screenplay for Parasite - a dark comedy about his homeland's social divides that is also up for best foreign language film. Netflix has been throwing huge amounts of cash at both making and marketing its awards hopefuls this year. With that kind of spending, the streamer will be hoping for not just a good, but a great return on its investment. At this stage of awards season, it potentially looks like it might pay off. The film with the most nominations is Netflix's Marriage Story, starring Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, which has six. Just behind with five, another Netflix production - Martin Scorsese's epic The Irishman starring Oscar winners Robert de Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino. It's still early days though. Last year, the Dick Cheney biopic Vice led the way with six Globe nominations and went on to win a grand total of one Academy Award (for make-up and hairstyling). Still, for the last few years, the eventual best picture winner at the Oscars has come from one of the films with either the most or almost the most nominations at the Globes. The Globes' real power comes less from those who decides on the winners but rather from its position in awards season. While it may from time to time make some unusual choices, it gives some films the chance to build momentum at the crucial time when Oscar voters are deciding not only which films to vote for, but just as importantly, which films they'll actually make time to see. And in what can be a tight race, just having a film labelled as a Golden Globe nominee or winner can make a difference. Christian Bale is in the running for the best actor in a film drama award for Ford v Ferrari - released as Le Mans '66 in the UK. Bale's competition includes fellow Brit Jonathan Pryce for The Two Popes, as well as Antonio Banderas, Adam Driver and Joaquin Phoenix for Pain and Glory, Marriage Story and Joker respectively. This video can not be played With 27 nominations, it's a strong year for British talent Daniel Craig is up for best actor in a film comedy or musical for Knives Out, as is Egerton for Rocketman and Jojo Rabbit's young British lead Roman Griffin Davis. Leonardo DiCaprio and Eddie Murphy are also nominated in this category, for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Dolemite Is My Name respectively. The best actress in a film drama shortlist includes Britain's Cynthia Erivo for Harriet, a biopic of anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman. Erivo's competition includes Scarlett Johansson for Marriage Story, Saoirse Ronan for Little Women and Judy's Renee Zellweger - widely considered to be the favourite for both this award and 2020's best actress Oscar. The best actress in a film comedy or musical shortlist includes Dame Emma Thompson for Late Night and The Farewell's Awkwafina. I'm Gonna Love Me Again, a new track written for Rocketman by Sir Elton John and Bernie Taupin, is up for the best original film song award. So is Beautiful Ghosts, written by Taylor Swift and Andrew Lloyd Webber for the upcoming film version of Cats. It is the only nomination for Cats, which has been left out of the major categoriesdespite reports,externalit was screened for voters at the last minute. Swift expressed delight on Twitter that ""one of the most fun, fulfilling creative experiences"" in her life had been recognised by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA).

Into the Unknown from Frozen 2 and Beyonce's song Spirit from Disney's The Lion King also make the cut. Both films are up for best animated film - an award The Lion King will not be eligible for at the Oscars or Baftas, as it was not submitted for consideration. The remake of Disney's 1994 animation uses computer animation to create photorealistic facsimiles of real-life animals. Olivia Colman, Helena Bonham Carter and Tobias Menzies are all up for awards for their royal roles in the latest series of The Crown. Colman is up for best actress in a TV drama, where her competition includes Killing Eve's Jodie Comer and the stars of Apple TV series The Morning Show - Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. Dame Helen Mirren, Kit Harington, Emily Watson and Sacha Baron Cohen are among other British actors who are up for TV prizes. Harington's consideration for best actor in a TV drama is the only nomination for the final series of fantasy saga Game of Thrones. Menzies, Colman and Bonham Carter play Prince Philip, The Queen and Princess Margaret in The Crown Overall there are 27 Britons in contention for the awards, which recognise both film and television. Netflix - the streaming giant behind Marriage Story, The Irishman, The Two Popes and The Crown - has 34 nominations in all - 17 each for film and TV. HBO have 15 TV nominations, four of them coming for their mini-series about the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Ricky Gervais will return to host the awards on 5 January, having previously hosted them in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2016. Tom Hanks will receive a lifetime achievement award at the event, following in the footsteps of such recent honourees as Meryl Streep and Oprah Winfrey.

Johnson's Brexit plan 'presents major challenge'A leaked government document says customs plans for Northern Ireland may not be ready in time.,"Putting Boris Johnson's plan for Brexit into action will be a ""major"" challenge for government due to new customs arrangements for Northern Ireland, according to a leaked document. The PM has said the UK will fully exit the EU by December 2020 if he wins the election and MPs approve his plan. But the document says government will struggle to deliver the infrastructure and staffing needed by that deadline. The PM did not directly comment on the report when asked. But Mr Johnson instead said his plan was a ""great deal"" for both Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and would ""give the country real momentum"". LIVE: Latest from the campaign trail Faisal Islam: Leaked document raises concerns about NI-GB trade General election 2019: A matter of mistrust? The SNP said the leak was ""just the latest evidence that Boris Johnson can't be trusted"". It comes as the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster, said Mr Johnson ""broke [his] word"" after promising there would be no checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit - a red line for her and her candidates. Throughout the election campaign, the PM has denied there will be checks in the Irish Sea, despite telling the BBC in the days after his deal was agreed that some checks would be needed. Mr Johnson's deal with the EU does mean there will be checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland but there has been confusion on whether there will be checks on goods going in the other direction. Will there be checks between Great Britain and NI? What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Mr Johnson has pledged to finalise leaving the EU by 31 January, and said a trade deal will be done with the bloc by the following December. However, he has also said if no deal is done by that deadline, the UK will still leave - meaning all transition agreements will come to an end by the close of 2020. First reported by the Financial Times,external, the document from the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) has cast doubt on whether the government will be ready to meet this proposal when it comes to new arrangements between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The BBC has also seen the document - which was circulated to senior officials in Whitehall last week - that warns of ""high levels of checks and controls"" as a result of the deal, and says there may be ""legal and political"" impacts. It reads: ""Delivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge."" DExEU said it would not comment on leaks. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak responds to leaked Brexit document But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak - who sits on the ""exit operations committee"" for Brexit planning - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had been ""incredibly impressed by all the preparations that have gone on"". He said such planning meant the UK was in ""very good shape, not just to deal with new trading relationships, but all the other things"". Commenting on the leak, the SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""Even his own civil servants know the UK government aren't in a position to deliver Brexit on his promised timescale. ""If we leave the EU, the UK faces years of difficult and contentious trade talks. If you've not liked Brexit so far, you ain't seen nothing yet."" The pro-Leave DUP has previously backed the Conservative Party, giving Theresa May a working majority in Parliament, but it has been critical of both her withdrawal agreement with the EU and Mr Johnson's. This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg grills Johnson in October on Brexit deal Speaking to Today, Ms Foster said the DUP had spoken to HMRC officials after Mr Johnson's deal was done, and they had made it ""very clear"" to her that there would need to be checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. ""This is very concerning for us as it goes to the heart of the act of union,"" she said. ""Boris wants to, in his words, 'get Brexit done', and I completely understand that. But you can't leave part of the UK in a worse-off position."" Asked repeatedly whether she could now trust anything the prime minister said, Ms Foster added: ""It is very important for us in Northern Ireland not just to have the words but the detail. It says more about the person who broke their word.""

What does a 'climate election' mean for Wales?,"Climate change issues are seen as important with younger voters Green issues have been debated in the election like never before, so what does it mean for the Welsh environment? It is an area that is largely devolved to Cardiff Bay so the promises made in a UK general election would not usually be as relevant here. But this time it is different because of two massive challenges facing the next government in Westminster - climate change and Brexit. Starting with emissions, the greenhouse gases that are driving global warming. The Welsh Government recently announced it would set anew, legally binding target for a 95% cut in emissions by 2050. It followed advice from the independent Committee on Climate Change, who said that would be an appropriate contribution to the UK as a whole reaching a 100% target - known as ""net zero"" - by the same year. It said Wales ""could not credibly reach net zero by 2050"" because it had less land available for capturing carbon through tree planting and relatively high agricultural emissions, an industry important to its rural economy. But now many of the parties fighting for your vote at the election say emissions must be cut sooner. Plaid Cymru and the Green Party would like to reach net zero by 2030, with Labour pledging to do so during that decade and the Liberal Democrats by 2045. The Conservatives have stuck with the 2050 target that was announced under Theresa May, still one of the most ambitious put in place anywhere in the world. If the UK goal changes, it follows that the Welsh target would also have to be revised. And whatever the deadline, eliminating greenhouse gases from our economy and way of life will mean huge upheaval. Just last week the Centre for Alternative Technology in Machynllethpublished a big report about what would need to happen. No more petrol and diesel cars, gas boilers ripped out and replaced with greener alternatives, and much, much more renewable energy generation. Wales will receive a funding boost based on how much is allocated in Westminster for all of this, andas you can see here - how much the parties are pledging varies significantly. This Matters: Is this the climate election? General election 2019: Climate debate fact-checked What is climate change doing to Wales? A climate change demonstration in Monmouth earlier this year It is worth paying attention to pledges on energy because the UK government still has powers over any larger schemes (over 350 MW) proposed in Wales. Things like offshore wind farms, tidal lagoons or nuclear power stations - with different parties favouring different approaches. Labour, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and Lib Dems all want to see tidal lagoons -like the stalled Swansea Bay scheme- as well as investing in other renewable forms of energy like solar and wind. The Conservatives will not support wind farms on land - despite their low cost - but are proposing more out at sea. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? All big decisions on Brexit are being taken in Westminster and this is the other issue that could shape the Welsh environment for decades to come. EU rules have had a huge influence on areas like farming, nature conservation and pollution. ""This election will have a big impact on what happens in the Welsh countryside,"" explains Arfon Williams, land use manager at RSPB Cymru. ""Westminster has a big role to play in terms of the funding and wider policies required to support how we farm, look after the environment and promote sustainable development."" Five of the party leaders took part in a Channel 4 climate debate in London at the end of November Llanelli-based nature presenter and author Dan Rouse said she was pleased the environment had become such a prominent part of the election campaign. ""It started off with, if you liked climate you voted Greens, if you wanted to conserve the world you always voted Greens, but now more parties are talking about this and seeing that it should be in their manifestos - it's one of the most important things they should be doing for our country."" ""Some are still taking it a bit more seriously than others but at least they're all thinking about it."" The change is being driven by a shift in voters' priorities after a year in which climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests have dominated headlines, suggests Rhian Barrance, research associate at the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research at Cardiff University. She said: ""There has been a lot of talk about this being a climate election - it's clear there's more interest in this election. But it will be interesting to see how much Brexit dominates the whole debate. ""It is still the main priority for voters when you look at polls. ""But the importance of the environment has definitely increased and is as important as the economy across all age groups - which is a big change. ""It's also becoming more important for young people,  unsurprising when you look at the youth climate strikes and Greta Thunberg. ""We have about 39-40% of young people, aged 18 to 24, who say the environment is an important issue. ""It becomes less important across older age groups, and for the over 65s it's about 17% who'd note that the environment is one of the most important issues.""

There will be two BBC debates in the evening â BBC Scotland will broadcast its Scotland
Leaders debate live from Pacific Quay in Glasgow, while the leaders of the
main parties in Northern Ireland take part in a debate in front of a studio
audience. Labour candidate Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who is standing in Tooting, has criticised the Conservatives for releasing a campaign video based on the same idea as hers, which she posted two weeks ago. Ms Allin-Khan had posted a spoof of a scene from the film Love Actually, when a character uses large, handwritten signs to get a message across to someone on the doorstep. (In the film, Andrew Lincoln's character is confessing his love to Keira Knightley, who is recently married to another man). Ms Allin-Khan's video went viral, being retweeted more than 8,000 times. Tonight, Boris Johnson's team produced their own version of the same scene but with the PM on the doorstep holding signs with his party's slogans, particularly on Brexit. Again, it's going viral on Twitter, with more than 2,000 retweets in the first hour it's been posted. Responding, Ms Allin-Khan tweeted: ""I won't be retweeting it - but Boris Johnson has copied my #ElectionActually video. ""Tanks. On. The. Lawn.

Don't share his version in outrage - instead, share my original version."" Several journalists have also been pointing out that the idea was done originally by Ms Allin-Khan. A councillor and party official were filmed making the comments on the election campaign trail. Read the full story here.

It leads with the same image and story from New Zealand, while making a nod towards the PM's licence fee comments Lord Sugar is calling on voters to support the Conservative Party, the Sun says - using a well-known soundbite from his reality TV show, the Apprentice, as it's headline It's that time of night when we can share a few of tomorrow's front pages with you. One story in particular is dominating the newspapers... The Metro calls the situation a ""war of words"" which led to a backlash for Boris Johnson The Guardian claims Mr Johnsonâs team tried to turn the story on to Labour by wrongly briefing that a Tory aide was punched outside the hospital by a left-wing activist The Financial Times describes the situation as the ""first significant stumble"" the PM has made - and it's come in the ""final straight"" of campaigning The Telegraph looks instead at a memo which says the chances of Labour forming a coalition government have been seriously underestimated Listen back to the Question Time election special on BBC Sounds.

The latest episode of Electioncast has dropped - and it covers the events of today. With only three days left of campaigning, Boris Johnson is criticised for initially refusing to look at a picture of a sick boy who had to sleep on the floor of a Leeds hospital. And Adam heads to Crewe to chat to a group of undecided voters. Listen to the episode here. This video can not be played The SNP say Scotland is losing out over Brexit Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Talking to voters around the country two big issues have had the elusive ""cut through"" in this campaign - the Tories promise to take us out of the EU at the end of next month and Labour's attack on their handling of the NHS. Of course, other subjects have been part of the conversation but those are the issues that have come up most often during the last few weeks when we've been travelling around the country. And in every election in recent history, the Labour Party has tried to sow doubts in voters' minds about whether or not the Tories can be trusted with the health service at all. That's why Boris Johnson's terrible day on the campaign trail today matters. Read more from Laura here. Emma Barnett thanks the panel and audience for coming - and that's it, the 90-minute debate is over. We've had questions on Brexit, housing, climate change and trust in politics - among other topics. If you missed it, you can catch up here. Emma is back on Friday, 13 December to discuss the election result.

In the final exchange of the debate, Jo Swinson calls on Humza Yousaf to have an ""honesty"" about Scottish independence. Mr Yousaf - whose SNP party is calling for indyref2 - says that although he knows it won't be ""perfectly rosy"", Scotland would be economically stable if it were to become an independent country. But Ms Swinson - whose Lib Dems party is against Scottish independence - says it's only fair to be honest that, if Scottish independence were to happen, it would be ""a hit to the [Scottish] economy"". She backs this up by pointing out that the Scottish deficit is higher than the rest of the UK. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Immigrants have contributed much more to this society than they have ever taken,"" says Mr Yousaf, which gets a clap from the audience.

Johnson targets Labour Leave seats in final push,"Boris Johnson has toured Brexit-voting Labour-held seats in north-east England, with three days to go before polling day. In a speech in Sunderland - 61% of which voted to Leave - the PM told voters: ""The Labour Party has let you down."" He attacked Parliament, saying it had ""delayed"" and ""denied"" Brexit. Mr Johnson will also travel to south-west England, where he will warn against voting for the pro-EU Lib Dems. At the event in Sunderland, Mr Johnson took questions from the public and the press. Live: Latest from the campaign trail Kuenssberg: Will the parties pull off their experiments? Election manifestos: Who should I vote for? A really simple guide to the UK general election Mr Johnson spoke of his ""oven-ready"" Brexit deal with the EU, saying the alternative to voting for the Conservatives was ""yet more delay"" and ""division and deadlock"". He criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, arguing he did not have a credible Brexit plan, adding that every Conservative election candidate had pledged to support his own withdrawal deal with the EU. Mr Johnson also challenged Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell's plans, which he said ""will put up taxes"" and be a ""recipe for disaster"". Meanwhile, Mr McDonnell promised todeliver a budget to ""end austerity""within its first 100 days if the party wins Thursday's election. In a speech in London setting out his priorities, he also pledged to get ""money moving out of Whitehall and the City"". The Conservative Party says the prime minister is intending to ""visit every region in England and Wales"" in the final three days of the election campaign, with a message that a vote for his party is a vote to ""get Brexit done and unleash Britain's potential"". Mr Johnson started the day at a fish market in Grimsby, one of a number of longstanding Labour areas that voted heavily to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum that both the Conservatives and the Brexit Party are targeting. The 13 key policies in the Conservative manifesto Where does Labour stand on Brexit? On his visit to Sunderland, Mr Johnson said it had been 1,264 days since the city voted to leave the EU. ""People voted to get out of the European Union - our democratic duty to do so. ""Our economy is suffering right now because of the uncertainty"" created by the Brexit delay, he said. Campaigners in Sunderland celebrate the 2016 EU referendum result Mr Johnson has repeatedly warned that the only alternative to a Conservative majority is a hung Parliament, with Mr Corbyn and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon forming a coalition and resulting in further referendums on Brexit and Scottish independence. Ms Sturgeonhas said she is confident an agreement on a second independence vote could be doneif Labour needed SNP support to form a government if there is a hung parliament. But Mr Corbynhas ruled out supporting a Scottish independence referendumuntil after the next Holyrood election in 2021. The Liberal Democrats are, meanwhile, pledging to table legislation to stop Brexit immediately after the election by introducing two draft bills they say would pave the way for another EU referendum. The first would enable the Electoral Commission to start the necessary consultation around a referendum question and lead campaign designation - and the second would provide a referendum on the government's Brexit deal versus remaining in the EU. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson told Radio 4's Today programme the ""most likely way"" to stop Brexit was through another vote as the possibility of her party winning power on its own and revoking Article 50 looked increasingly remote.

Johnson's Brexit plan 'presents major challenge'A leaked government document says customs plans for Northern Ireland may not be ready in time.UK Politics,"Putting Boris Johnson's plan for Brexit into action will be a ""major"" challenge for government due to new customs arrangements for Northern Ireland, according to a leaked document. The PM has said the UK will fully exit the EU by December 2020 if he wins the election and MPs approve his plan. But the document says government will struggle to deliver the infrastructure and staffing needed by that deadline. The PM did not directly comment on the report when asked. But Mr Johnson instead said his plan was a ""great deal"" for both Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and would ""give the country real momentum"". LIVE: Latest from the campaign trail Faisal Islam: Leaked document raises concerns about NI-GB trade General election 2019: A matter of mistrust? The SNP said the leak was ""just the latest evidence that Boris Johnson can't be trusted"". It comes as the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster, said Mr Johnson ""broke [his] word"" after promising there would be no checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit - a red line for her and her candidates. Throughout the election campaign, the PM has denied there will be checks in the Irish Sea, despite telling the BBC in the days after his deal was agreed that some checks would be needed. Mr Johnson's deal with the EU does mean there will be checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland but there has been confusion on whether there will be checks on goods going in the other direction. Will there be checks between Great Britain and NI? What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Mr Johnson has pledged to finalise leaving the EU by 31 January, and said a trade deal will be done with the bloc by the following December. However, he has also said if no deal is done by that deadline, the UK will still leave - meaning all transition agreements will come to an end by the close of 2020. First reported by the Financial Times,external, the document from the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) has cast doubt on whether the government will be ready to meet this proposal when it comes to new arrangements between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The BBC has also seen the document - which was circulated to senior officials in Whitehall last week - that warns of ""high levels of checks and controls"" as a result of the deal, and says there may be ""legal and political"" impacts. It reads: ""Delivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge."" DExEU said it would not comment on leaks. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak responds to leaked Brexit document But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak - who sits on the ""exit operations committee"" for Brexit planning - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had been ""incredibly impressed by all the preparations that have gone on"". He said such planning meant the UK was in ""very good shape, not just to deal with new trading relationships, but all the other things"". Commenting on the leak, the SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""Even his own civil servants know the UK government aren't in a position to deliver Brexit on his promised timescale. ""If we leave the EU, the UK faces years of difficult and contentious trade talks. If you've not liked Brexit so far, you ain't seen nothing yet."" The pro-Leave DUP has previously backed the Conservative Party, giving Theresa May a working majority in Parliament, but it has been critical of both her withdrawal agreement with the EU and Mr Johnson's. This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg grills Johnson in October on Brexit deal Speaking to Today, Ms Foster said the DUP had spoken to HMRC officials after Mr Johnson's deal was done, and they had made it ""very clear"" to her that there would need to be checks on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. ""This is very concerning for us as it goes to the heart of the act of union,"" she said. ""Boris wants to, in his words, 'get Brexit done', and I completely understand that. But you can't leave part of the UK in a worse-off position."" Asked repeatedly whether she could now trust anything the prime minister said, Ms Foster added: ""It is very important for us in Northern Ireland not just to have the words but the detail. It says more about the person who broke their word.""

This video can not be played General election 2019: 'If the climate was a bank we'd have bailed it out' says Bartley Tomorrow is the penultimate day of the election campaign, and as ever we'll be bringing you the latest updates throughout the day. Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Nigel Farage, Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon will all be out on the campaign trail. There will be two BBC debates in the evening â BBC Scotland will broadcast its Scotland
Leaders debate live from Pacific Quay in Glasgow, while the leaders of the
main parties in Northern Ireland take part in a debate in front of a studio
audience. Labour candidate Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who is standing in Tooting, has criticised the Conservatives for releasing a campaign video based on the same idea as hers, which she posted two weeks ago. Ms Allin-Khan had posted a spoof of a scene from the film Love Actually, when a character uses large, handwritten signs to get a message across to someone on the doorstep. (In the film, Andrew Lincoln's character is confessing his love to Keira Knightley, who is recently married to another man). Ms Allin-Khan's video went viral, being retweeted more than 8,000 times. Tonight, Boris Johnson's team produced their own version of the same scene but with the PM on the doorstep holding signs with his party's slogans, particularly on Brexit. Again, it's going viral on Twitter, with more than 2,000 retweets in the first hour it's been posted. Responding, Ms Allin-Khan tweeted: ""I won't be retweeting it - but Boris Johnson has copied my #ElectionActually video. ""Tanks. On. The. Lawn.

Don't share his version in outrage - instead, share my original version."" Several journalists have also been pointing out that the idea was done originally by Ms Allin-Khan. A councillor and party official were filmed making the comments on the election campaign trail. Read the full story here. This video can not be played Argument between Farage and Rayner on Question Time Following on from our earlier post, here are a few more of tomorrow's front pages: The Mirror says its front page from Monday - of the boy sleeping on a hospital floor - made the PM ""squirm"". The paper hopes Tuesday's edition will do the same The i says the ""hospital fracas"" has ""floored"" the PM - but it chooses to lead on the deadly volcano eruption in New Zealand The Mail leads on the prime minister's comments that the BBC's licence fee is outdated and could be scrapped The Times front page looks quite similar to the Mail's. It leads with the same image and story from New Zealand, while making a nod towards the PM's licence fee comments Lord Sugar is calling on voters to support the Conservative Party, the Sun says - using a well-known soundbite from his reality TV show, the Apprentice, as it's headline It's that time of night when we can share a few of tomorrow's front pages with you. One story in particular is dominating the newspapers... The Metro calls the situation a ""war of words"" which led to a backlash for Boris Johnson The Guardian claims Mr Johnsonâs team tried to turn the story on to Labour by wrongly briefing that a Tory aide was punched outside the hospital by a left-wing activist The Financial Times describes the situation as the ""first significant stumble"" the PM has made - and it's come in the ""final straight"" of campaigning The Telegraph looks instead at a memo which says the chances of Labour forming a coalition government have been seriously underestimated Listen back to the Question Time election special on BBC Sounds.

This video can not be played The SNP say Scotland is losing out over Brexit Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Talking to voters around the country two big issues have had the elusive ""cut through"" in this campaign - the Tories promise to take us out of the EU at the end of next month and Labour's attack on their handling of the NHS. Of course, other subjects have been part of the conversation but those are the issues that have come up most often during the last few weeks when we've been travelling around the country. And in every election in recent history, the Labour Party has tried to sow doubts in voters' minds about whether or not the Tories can be trusted with the health service at all. That's why Boris Johnson's terrible day on the campaign trail today matters. Read more from Laura here.

Mr Yousaf - whose SNP party is calling for indyref2 - says that although he knows it won't be ""perfectly rosy"", Scotland would be economically stable if it were to become an independent country. But Ms Swinson - whose Lib Dems party is against Scottish independence - says it's only fair to be honest that, if Scottish independence were to happen, it would be ""a hit to the [Scottish] economy"".

"Boy, 13, released over woman's stab death","Levi Davis, 25, died after being stabbed on Saturday A woman was stabbed to death in a fight following a car crash, police say. Mother-of-two Levi Davis, 25, died in Wellingborough Road, Rushden, on Saturday. She was in a VW Polo that was in collision with a Vauxhall van just before an argument broke out, Northamptonshire Police said. A man, 27, was arrested on suspicion of murder. He had serious injuries and a 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of his attempted murder. A 13-year-old boy, also arrested on suspicion of murder, was released on Sunday night with no further action to be taken. Levi Davis died at the scene in Wellingborough Road, Rushden Supt Dennis Murray said: ""The vehicles were involved in some sort of altercation before the crash. ""There was a fight and, as a result, the person died. My heart goes out to the lady's family."" He dismissed the idea Ms Davis had been the victim of a mugging, and said police believed those involved knew each other. Two other cars with smashed windows - a Fiat and a white Nissan Note, which are thought to have been in a crash further up the road - were also taken away by police. The woman died at the scene in Wellingborough Road, Rushden Floral tributes to Ms Davis, who lived on Wellingborough Road, have been left near the scene. One friend said: ""I used to walk to school with her. It is so sad."" People living nearby described how they rushed to Ms Davis's aid. One woman said: ""People tried to help, but she died very quickly."" Pattamaea Kuttppa, a 77-year-old retired aircraft engineer, said: ""I heard a big thud. At first I thought it was a car accident.

What's pledged for disability and mental health?,"This video can not be played Nikki Fox on the hurdles and options for disabled voters With 13 million disabled people in the country, plus their friends and family, the political parties have a huge community to court. Universal credit is still making headlines, while the main parties are divided on what to do with the social care system. So what is being offered to disabled voters? TheConservativeswant to continue the rollout of universal credit - the controversial six-in-one benefit, which includes employment and housing support. The party also wants to increase work allowances, a change they've estimated to be worth Â£630 a year to disabled people. They also say they will reduce the number of reassessments disabled people will have to go through to receive benefits if their condition is unlikely to change. Laboursays it will ""scrap UC"" and ""design an alternative system that treats people with dignity and respect"" instead. It wants to ""stop"" those work capability and PIP Assessments that some people report to be upsetting to go through. It would increase Employment and Support Allowance by Â£30 per week for those who are disabled or have a health condition that affects how much they can work. It's currently a maximum of Â£73.10 a week. By comparison, theLib Demssay they want to ""make the welfare system work"" by reducing the waiting time for the first payment from five weeks to five days, reversing cuts to the Employment Support Allowance (ESA) and ending work capability assessments, replacing them with ""real-world tests"" run by local authorities. TheGreen Partywants to introduce its own universal basic income, a salary for everyone, and wants to ensure nobody who takes time off work to care for loved ones ""unjustly struggles to access the state pension"". It also wants to increase the carers' allowance. Meanwhile, theBrexit Partysays it wants to reform universal credit after a 12-month review and bring in changes after two years, although it doesn't say anything beyond that. TheSNPalso wants to halt UC and immediately end the benefits freeze in Scotland, whilePlaid Cymruhas said it will push for full control of universal credit in Wales and is ""pressing"" for welfare powers to be devolved so it can take on issues including disability living allowance. Universal credit applies to the whole of the UK. What is universal credit - and what's the problem? When it comes to workplace conditions,Laboursays it wants to take the idea of a passport scheme for reasonable adjustments - smaller, achievable changes like rotas or working hours to help disabled workers move between jobs - and help crystallise what it means. They want to introduce new disability leave, which would be paid and recorded separately from sick leave. We've seen the gender pay gap regularly in the headlines - and Labour says it recognises a similar pattern between disabled and non-disabled employees. It wants to introduce a mandatory disability pay-gap report for companies with more than 250 employees. TheLib Demswant to try out some new ideas, including a pilot scheme where employers would be rewarded for investing in the mental wellbeing of their staff with reduced business rates.Plaid Cymruwants to establish ""sheltered employment schemes"" - an old-fashioned, less inclusive idea, but in this instance it's specifically for disabled people who need more support before returning to full employment. TheGreenshope to introduce job-sharing at all levels of government in the hope it will make politics more accessible. The other party manifestos -Conservative, SNPandBrexit Party- don't specifically reference work in relation to disability or mental health. This would apply across the UK. There is one pledge that unites five of the seven main parties: to put mental health care on an equal footing with that of physical health, a policy that mental health groups have wanted for many years. TheLib Demslist several ideas on how to make this happen and pledge to spend an additional Â£2.4bn after inflation on mental health by 2023-24 by improving access to therapies and mental health practitioners. They also want 24-hour services including mental health liaison teams in all hospitals. As part of their general look at mental and physical wellbeing, the party also suggests carers should be given community benefits such as free passes to leisure centres. Reduced waiting times for support are also key. Labourwants to ""improve access to psychological therapies"" with crises services being available 24/7 - something echoed in thePlaid Cymrumanifesto. And with non-emergency support in mind, theGreen Partywants to ""ensure"" everyone who needs therapies can get them within 28 days instead of the months it can take in some areas.Conservativestalk about patients having greater control over their treatment. Family is high on the agenda too, withLabourand theLib Demswanting to bring in mental health assessments for new mothers andPlaid Cymrupromising to re-open its specialist mother-and-baby units for mothers with severe mental illness, which were closed in 2013. Neither theBrexit Partynor theSNPreference mental health in their election pitches. Healthcare is devolved. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all run their own health services, but they will benefit from any extra funding. Eleven charts on why the NHS matters Is the NHS facing unprecedented demand? CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external We often hear stories about children applying for specialist school places that aren't available locally, or not getting appropriate educational support in mainstream schools. Parents may have hoped the manifestos would contain significant detail on Special Educational Needs (SEN/SEND). However, detail is scant. TheGreen Partyhas the most comprehensive plans. It wants all SEN children to experience a ""fully inclusive education"" with access to their local school, which would mean accessible buildings, an inclusive curriculum and specially trained teachers. On top of that it wants to retain specialist schools if that's a preferred option for the family. TheConservativeshave pledged to increase school funding by Â£7.1bn by 2022-23, which the party says includes more SEN places, whileLaboursays it will provide the ""necessary funding"" for school-age pupils. Additionally the party wants to recruit new SEN co-ordinators as part of 150,000 additional early years staff. Meanwhile, theLib Demswant to ""end the crisis"" of SEN funding by allocating ""additional cash to local authorities"", reducing the amount schools pay towards the cost of a child's needs, whilePlaid Cymruwants schools to have ""appropriate access"" for physically disabled pupils and better support for those with learning difficulties. TheSNPandBrexit Partymake no reference to SEN. Education is a devolved issue. Your Questions Answered: Education and tuition fees Care is a hot topic. In England and Northern Ireland, anyone with savings of Â£23,500 or more (the figure is Â£24,000 in Wales) must foot the bill for any care in their home. The threshold is the same for a care home, but also includes the value of their home. This means people may find they are in the unpalatable situation of having to sell their house to free up the money. TheConservativessay they will initially invest Â£1bn a year on both adult (and children's social care) to tackle this and the prime minister has pledged to stop individuals having to sell their homes, but has not explained how this might be done. Plaid Cymruwants to offer free social care for elderly people and those who are more vulnerable through a new National Health and Social Care Service for Wales. TheLib Demssay they'd cap the cost of care that individuals pay and would introduce a 1p increase to income tax, with some of the Â£7bn raised a year pegged to social care -Labouralso pledges to cap the same care costs.Labouris promising free personal care for older people who need it. On housing and independence,Labourwants to help autistic people and people with learning disabilities move out of ""inappropriate inpatient hospital settings"" and into their own homes as part of a wider social care policy on doubling the number of people who receive publicly funded care packages. Similarly, theGreen Partywants to introduce a legal right to independent living for disabled people and help councils draw up disability housing plans, whilePlaid Cymruwants to ensure local authorities and social landlords provide more ""disabled-friendly and lifetime housing"". TheLib Demswant to reinstate the Independent Living Fund, which financially supported disabled people who choose to live in the community rather than residential care. TheConservativesalso want to put money into finding a cure for dementia which it describes as ""one of our government's biggest collective priorities"" alongside climate change. Health and social care is a devolved issue. Why more people are talking about social care There are a couple of other interesting ideas that pop up in the manifestos. Most notably,Plaid Cymruwants to focus on the rights of autistic people and those awaiting a diagnosis so all can access support. It also plans to make neuro-divergence a protected characteristic under the Equalities Act to safeguard individuals against discrimination. Protected characteristics currently include age, disability, race and sexuality. TheConservativesplan to publish a National Strategy for Disabled People by the end of 2020 for: the benefits system, housing, education, transport and jobs. How do spending plans compare?

Has politics hijacked your local Facebook group?,"As the election draws closer, Facebook groups originally intended for gentle chat about hedgehogs and wheelie bins are being overwhelmed by bitter political arguments. ""I'm disgusted,"" says Julie Graham. As she drinks a cup of coffee in the bar of a hotel overlooking the English Channel, she becomes slightly flustered. She's trying to explain why she feels under attack simply for expressing her views online. ""If I went out in the street,"" she says, ""would these people give me the same abuse?"" Patsy, one of her Facebook sparring partners, challenges Julie. Patsy contends that their local group is a great way to hear opposing views. ""If I'm in my bubble, I'm not hearing anyone,"" she says. It's the first time Julie and Patsy have met face to face. Their online arguments happen in an unusual place. It's not a forum devoted to politics - but rather a Facebook group normally filled with pictures of beaches, posts about yoga classes and promotions for local Christmas markets. With its grand facades, wide promenades and gently sloping beach, St Leonards-on-Sea looks a bit like the French Riviera, even though it feels very different on a biting December day. The Facebook group in question,St Leonards on Sea is THE place to be!,external, was set up in 2008 to celebrate this small town nestled next to Hastings on the East Sussex coast. With those aforementioned scenic photos and yoga posts, the group collected around 6,000 members over the years. By Facebook standards that's not very many at all, but it's certainly enough to make it one of the town's main sources of information. A few years ago, the man who set up the group died. David was the sole administrator - the only one who could enforce the group's rules and keep conversations light and local. St Leonards on Sea is THE place to be! became a ""zombie group"" - one with no real oversight over what was being posted. In recent months, as the national political drama has ramped up, this once-tranquil group became overwhelmed by political argument. The power vacuum at the top allowed aggressively political users to run riot, according to Russell Hall, a plant biologist who runs a separate local politics-focused Facebook group in his spare time. In September, David's widow wrote a long post decrying the fact that the group had been ""hijacked"". ""This group was not created for this purpose,"" she wrote. ""I find the misuse of what I had hoped would be David's lasting legacy to the town he loved quite disgusting."" Her plea was ignored. When a general election was called a few weeks later, the online acrimony escalated further. St Leonards-on-Sea is part of the hotly contested constituency of Hastings and Rye, which was narrowly held by the Conservatives in 2017. As election rows hit fever pitch, several members of the Facebook group stepped in and managed to take control. There were two new rules: ""Be kind and courteous"" and ""no hate speech or bullying"". But this did not quell the shouting. The new regime also prompted pushback from members who felt the new moderators were trying to influence the direction of group. Now, with just a few days until the vote, non-political posts are few and far between. Some people clearly relish the arguments, while others want the group to return to its gentler origins. Julie Graham, Anna Keiller and Patsy Solanki (l-r) chat to Amol Rajan, the BBC's media editor. We assembled some of the feuding members for a discussion IRL (""in real life""). The three women who spoke to us all said they'd joined the group for the same general set of reasons: to find out more about local charities and upcoming events, and to share pictures of their pets with fellow residents. But as 12 December approaches, there is no hiding from politics. Anna Keiller says she was recently booted out of the group following a dispute with one of the moderators. She wants the group to stick to non-political topics, like the local wildlife: Julie Graham joined the group last week, also for non-political reasons, but within a couple of days she found herself getting embroiled in debates with the group's most active users. When she posted that she's planning to vote Conservative, sarcastically noting that this ""seems to be a crime"", the message attracted nearly 200 comments. Most were highly critical, including: ""you must be very backward"" and ""it's not a crime being sociopathic"". Julie told the BBC that along with a torrent of abusive comments she got nasty private messages. Patsy Solanki is one of the Labour supporters who responded to Julie's post, although not in an abusive way. Patsy admits there's some ""trolling"" in the group, and says it's unacceptable. But overall she's a big fan and thinks the forum is a source of ""fantastic debates and conversations"". How a misleading story about Lib Dem leader went viral Death threats circulate in Brexit Facebook groups How can you pop your filter bubble? She says it helps her hear perspectives outside her own ""filter bubble"" - a relatively insular social media community. Conservative-backing Julie disagreed with Patsy - firmly, but respectfully. In the seaside hotel bar, with the sun streaming in the windows, civility and politeness ruled - a clear contrast with overall tone of the group. Hastings and Rye is a marginal constituency in East Sussex In every region of the UK, BBC Trending has found numerous examples of local groups flooded with political content, from Flint in Wales to Walthamstow in London, from Shaftesbury in Dorset to Inverness in Scotland. But the tone - as you may have noticed in your own groups - varies wildly. About 250 miles north of St Leonards-on-Sea, another Facebook group feels more like the gentle suburbs than the Wild West. Jason Lawal runs the Stocksbridge and Surrounding Areas Community Forum. It's a typical local group focused on this town north-west of Sheffield, on the edge of the Peak District National Park. Jason Lawal sifts through messages in his Facebook group The group has around 9,500 members - equivalent to around half the local population. Jason spends his days driving around the country cleaning up devastated buildings. When he met us he had just returned from a flooded pub in Bristol. Spotted something interesting on social media?Email us,external On the internet he mitigates disasters of a different kind - political arguments that descend into abuse - and says this has become a much more intense job since the election was called. To demonstrate the eclectic mix of posts, Jason scrolls through his phone reading out some recent ones. ""There's somebody offering jewellery repairs, somebody who found a hedgehog and wants to know how to feed it, a picture of a nice reservoir... and then somebody saying 'Whoopee, the Conservatives are on course for their first South Yorkshire victory.'"" Beneath that post are hundreds of comments both for and against Jeremy Corbyn. In the group, there are even posts from local candidates, setting out their positions and answering residents' questions. ""It's like the One Show in Yorkshire,"" says Jason. ""I quite enjoy it really. At least everybody's taking an interest in local life."" Jason tries hard to keep discussion focused on local issues. He admits that in the chaos of an election campaign it's hard for him to keep up with the daily avalanche of posts, but he sees himself as an impartial arbiter, and takes that role seriously. One member, Jenny Cooke, says the group is the only way of engaging with people who have different political viewpoints. But this Labour supporter says the tone of the comments can be ""unpleasant"" and ""sometimes slightly threatening"". ""It can be quite scary because it is local and people might find out who you are or know where you live,"" she told us in a Stockbridge cafe. Stocksbridge and Penistone is a marginal seat in South Yorkshire Once upon a time people may have filed into town halls or village squares to debate the issues of the day. Now modern technology makes it easier for people to engage in political debate, especially in the depths of a British winter. But social media can also suck in those who never intended to spend their evenings arguing with strangers about politics. Unlike the village square, on Facebook you can't look someone in the eye or read the tone of their voice. That distance means people sometimes suspend their usual social niceties. The job of keeping things on track falls to volunteer moderators. It's easy for conversations to get hijacked. Those who come for the hedgehog photos may end up getting sweary rants about politics instead.

Spot the difference on the NHS,"The NHS has been one of the key focuses of the election campaign with the political parties battling it out to be seen as champions of the health service. This should come as no surprise. While many assumed this election was going to be largely about one issue - Brexit - the future of the NHS has actually been up there as the other big priority for voters. Some polls even suggest it is more important. But what separates the promises the parties are making? The three main parties in England - health is devolved so the Westminster politicians do not control policy in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland - have sought to use both their pre-manifesto announcements as well as their manifesto launches to highlight their health policies. Labour, in particular, has gone on the attack, accusing the Tories of plotting to sell off the NHS in a future post-Brexit trade deal with the US - something the Tories are insistent they will not do, even making it part of their manifesto pledges. It all suggests there is some kind of ideological difference in the approach to the NHS. But dig beneath the surface and what is quite remarkable is just how similar the policies actually are rather than how different. Let's take the most important factor first - funding. All three parties are promising above-inflation increases to the budget for front-line care. And, importantly, in each case this is at a faster rate than has been the case since the financial crash of 2008. Here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like the environment, Brexit and the NHS. General election manifesto guide 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election The Tories - being the party in government - had already set out their plans ahead of the election. During 2018 they put forward a five-year spending plan which is seeing the budget rising by 3.4% a year above inflation. It means by 2023-24 there will be Â£149bn of funding available. By comparison Labour has proposed increasing it by 3.9% - that will bring the budget to Â£155bn by 2023-24. The Lib Dems are marginally behind this coming in at Â£154bn. But some experts say the Â£6bn gap between Labour and the Tories could in fact be slightly narrower. The Treasury - under the Tories - has already promised tohelp meet the rising cost of NHS pensions, and if you factor that in, the difference could be around Â£3.5bn. That is enough to make an impact, but hardly points to a great division in approach given the size of the budget. That much is clear from the sort of things that all of the parties are promising to spend their money on: more staffing, including extra GPs and nurses in particular more support for students doing nursing degrees by bringing back maintenance grants (although Labour is also proposing to scrap tuition fees as part of its education policy) improving hospital waiting times because of the growing pressure in areas such as A&E, routine operations and cancer an increased focus on mental health with all committed to increasing the proportion of the budget spent in this area a recognition that the social care system needs reform to help relieve pressure on the NHS CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? Even when there appear to be significant differences in ambition, the truth is much more nuanced. Take nurses, for example - theTory promise of 50,000may seem to be more generous than the Labour pledge of 24,000. But the Tories have factored in improving retention (an important issue if you are going to grow the workforce) whereas Labour has not. It makes determining which plan is more ambitious incredibly difficult. But regardless of that, what is missing from all the pledges is the detail on how exactly any of this will be achieved. This lack of detail is also apparent in other areas away from the front-line budget. All three parties have talked about investing in buildings. Labour is promising to increase the annual budget to over Â£10bn by the end of the next Parliament - it is currently Â£7bn. The Lib Dems, once again, are not far behind that. The Tories say spending will increase, but are not saying by how much. Although, it is clear from their focus on buildings - Boris Johnson is constantly championing the40 new hospitals he wants to see builtover the next decade - that the budget will be going up. So when it comes to the NHS, is there actually a big decision in terms of who to vote for? At the end of the day, all you have heard during the election are promises and projections. What matters is who can deliver - and that means making judgements about competency and which party will be best for the economy. That in turn means looking at their policies on Brexit, tax and the nation's finances - in short deciding who in reality will have the most money to spend on health. It is those things that will go a long way to determining the health of the NHS in the future.

What action is being promised on climate change?,"It's been by far the greenest campaign in UK election history, with parties pledging tougher policies on the environment and climate change. But in a year ofGreta Thunberg's UN speechandSir David Attenborough's documentarieson the state of the planet, how far do the parties really go? Well, after 30 years reporting this issue, I think that some of the major parties have policies that match up to the scale of the challenge. But what do long-standing environmental pressure groups say? Friends of the Earth says the Greens, Lib Dems and Labour have manifestos that would seriously tackle climate change. The Conservatives, it says, have some strong policies too, but they don't put the environment at the heart of their manifesto, and some of their policies would be positively damaging. There is a consensus the UK must virtually eliminate its greenhouse-gas emissions in coming decades - but the deadline varies greatly.  TheGreen Partymakes the most radical pitch, pledging to ban the gases - which are created by burning fossil fuels and contribute to global warming - by 2030. This would mean swapping petrol and diesel vehicles for electric, every home effectively insulated and gas boilers phased out. Industries such as steel and chemicals would need to capture the harmful carbon they emit. The Greens say this must happen to protect the climate - but there's a serious question overwhether it can be achieved,external. Perhaps the biggest environmental surprise isLabour'spassionate warning ""we stand on the brink of unstoppable change"". The party had been flirting with a 2030 target, like the Greens', but following intervention from the unions has agreed to set a path towards ""net zero"" by 2030. TheLib Dems, meanwhile, say 2030 is impossible. Like theSNP, they say they would stop emissions by 2045 - which would itself be quite a feat. TheConservativespledge major commitments too - but their tone and ambition are more muted in many areas. They are sticking to the 2050 target announced in June. That was - and still is - a world-leading goal that will be very hard to deliver. But in the midst of the current debate, 2050 somehow looks a little tame. For politicians of all parties, though, the most immediate challenge will be to produce detailed plans showing how the economy can be transformed. How much will this be a climate change election? Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Climate policies 'will transform UK landscape' TheGreen Partysays protection of the environment must be at the heart of all government policy. They would borrow Â£100bn a year for this transformation, with mass home insulation and new industries creating clean jobs as dirty industries close down. A few years ago, that amount would have been universally ridiculed. There are questions as to whether Britain's green industries are sufficiently developed to spend all that money - butsome argue borrowing to fund a new industrial revolution,externalmakes some sense. Labouralso envisages huge government spending, promising to upgrade almost all the UK's 27 million homes. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? TheLib Dems, meanwhile, promise an emergency 10-year programme to reduce energy consumption from all buildings. But they insist massive borrowing isn't necessary to transform industry as government incentives can draw in private investment. Plaid Cymruand theSNPare also promising a green jobs revolution. And Plaid plan to borrow Â£5bn to support clean industries such as wind and tidal energy. What about theConservatives? Well, they've pleased campaigners by making fracking an unlikely prospect in the UK. The practice, which involves cracking rocks to extract gas, hasbeen causing earthquakes in Lancashire. They're also proposing improved energy efficiency for homes - although less than the other parties. And they want a big investment in offshore wind. But there's still no support for solar or for the cheapest form of energy - onshore wind,even though it's supported by almost 80% of people.,external Plaidand theGreensalso aim to tackle the consumerism they say drives so much environmental destruction. All parties say they want to improve public transport - but there's a clear division on road building. TheConservativespromise a Â£28.8bn investment in local and strategic roads. This would be popular with motorists but make cutting emissions more difficult. Labouris promising to invest in local roads but it also expresses a wish to tempt people out of their cars. TheLib DemsandGreensgo further. The Lib Dems say they want to cut the number of cars on the road and plan to spend 10% of the transport budget on walking and cycling. The Greens also want to cut car numbers overall. Both parties aim to stop the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030.Laboursay they will aim for that date while theTorieswould review their current target of 2040 (which is too late if they want zero emissions overall by 2050). TheSNPwants to the whole UK to follow its target of moving to electric vehicles by 2032. But even electric cars add to local air pollution and global water pollution, because of the particles that wear off tyres and brakes. NeitherLib DemnorLabournorConservativemanifestos acknowledge the emissions involved in eating meat. Only theGreen Partytackles this controversial issue, proposing a tax on meat and dairy products in order to curb emissions from livestock. TheTories, who have developed widely praised countryside policies, pledge to redirect farm grants to farmers who improve the environment. This may be by encouraging wildlife or capturing floodwaters on their fields and would be supported by a Â£640m ""nature for climate fund"" to support natural systems to soak up emissions.  Tree-plantingHow many trees are the parties pledging to plant? Labour: 100ma year (2bn by 2040) Greens: 70ma year Lib Dems: 60ma year SNP: 60m targeta year Conservatives: 30ma year TheLib Demswould set legally binding targets for improving water, air, soil and biodiversity, supported by at least Â£18bn over five years, with grants shifted towards smaller farmers.Labour's plans are less detailed but they too promise to improve the countryside. TheGreenshave a comprehensive plan, including an ""ecocide"" law to prevent crimes against the natural environment. Many of the pesticides blamed for the loss of insects would be banned. Measures to soak up CO2 emissions by planting are now universally accepted. TheBrexit Partyplans to plant millions of trees and lead a global initiative through the UN. Others are more specific. TheLib Demspromise to plant 60 million new trees a year, double theConservatives' pledge of about 30 million. TheSNPwould also press for a 60 million annual target.Labour, meanwhile, in a post-manifesto announcement, would commit to planting two billion new trees by 2040 - equal to 100 million per year. That's even more than theGreens' 70 million per year. Plaid Cymru, meanwhile, would end what it calls the collapse of biodiversity, pollution of waterways and the oceans, and erosion of the soil. The parties have caught the hostile public mood towards single-use plastics. TheBrexit Partywould insist on the UK recycling its own waste, making it illegal for it to be exported to be burned, buried or dumped at sea. TheLib DemsandLabourwould clamp down on single-use plastics. And theConservativeswould ban waste exports to all nations except those with adequate facilities to recycle them. All main parties are promising to tackle the housing crisis - an issue that's been deeply problematic for years. And there's a demand, too, for homes insulated to the highest standards. TheConservativesare pledging to build one million homes over the next Parliament.Labourare promoting new powers to buy land for low-cost housing and build 150,000 social homes a year. TheLib DemsandGreen Partypromise 100,000 homes for social rent a year and both want new homes to be zero carbon. This ""ultra-low energy"" housing development in Norwich won a major architectural prize this year Aviation is a predicable battleground, but some of the parties' policies are ambiguous, to say the least. TheConservatives, for instance, say there will be no more public money for a third runway at Heathrow airport but don't mention broader airport expansion.Labour- under pressure from the unions - have left the door open to more airports, although they've set a high bar for Heathrow expansion. TheLib DemsandGreensgo further. The former will ban expansion of Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted - and won't support a runway in the Thames Estuary. The Greens would stop all new runways, increase aviation taxes and ban advertising for flights. Most radically, they and the Lib Dems would impose a frequent flyer tax on people who take more than one or two return flights per year. That would penalise the wealthy 15% who do 70% of the flying. Holiday-homers, beware. Labour wants to re-nationalise the railways. But all parties are promising major investment in rail, especially in the north of England where there has been a lack of investment. Policies differ over the controversial HS2 project withLabourpromising to build it up to Scotland, theLib Demssupporting existing proposals and theConservativesreviewing the project. TheGreenswould scrap it. Promoting active transport - that's walking and cycling - is supported by all parties, in an age concerned with emissions and obesity. TheConservativesare pledging a Â£350m ""cycling infrastructure fund"". But that's dwarfed by theGreenswho want to spend Â£2.5bn a year on new cycle-ways and footpaths. Both the Conservatives and the Greens have pledged more money for cycling infrastructure Then there's the under-lying question of how these changes will be achieved. There has been a long-standing complaint from environmentalists that the Treasury has regularly blocked green schemes because they don't look to be value for money.Laboursay they want to transform the economy to make it ""fairer"" and low-carbon - but they don't say how this should be measured. TheGreenswant a deeper change, in which care for the environment is paramount. They would install a ""climate chancellor"" in 11 Downing Street and move away from the calculation that progress is driven by economic growth. Along withPlaid Cymruthey would tackle the consumerism they say is despoiling the planet. Finally - the air we breathe. All the main parties are planning new laws on air pollution. On this they can agree. The question is how many of these policies will be delivered, and how many are simply pandering to the current environmental fervour? Green groups think politics may really have changed.

Undecided voters: 'Who will help us make up our minds?',"Not yet made up your mind how to vote on Thursday? You're not alone. Three days before the election, many voters are struggling to find a party that offers what they want. This is a snapshot of the undecided voters of 2019. The BBC has commissioned an opinion research consultancy, Britain Thinks, to put together a sample of voters - representative in age, location, gender, race, class and voting history. Some common themes emerge: theNHS,Brexit, alack of trustin politicians andmoney. We asked our participants to fill in a survey about themselves, their voting history - and what's stopping them from making up their minds. The answers below have been edited for clarity. Then it's over to our correspondents to tell us what the answers reveal about the voters in 2019 - and why so many of them are dissatisfied with the choice on offer. For many of our participants, such asRob,Kate,RachelandLeanne(left to right, below) the NHS and its future are among their top concerns. For Sutton Coldfield residentRob, 48, the NHS is by far the most important issue of the campaign. He's a regular at the gym, and credits his wife with keeping him and their son on a healthy diet. He voted Remain in 2016, and Labour at the last three elections. The NHS is ""a fantastic service that underpins who we are as a nation"", he says. ""It deserves every penny and more that it can get from the public purse."" Thirty-six-year-oldKatealso lives in Sutton Coldfield and is frustrated with the number of people who don't turn up for NHS appointments, when she has to wait days to get one. She voted solidly Conservative in the last three elections and Leave in 2016. ""I believe they should operate a three-strikes-and-out policy. If you miss three appointments without notification or a genuine reason (eg hospitalisation), you should be charged before a doctor will see you again."" Rachel, 49, worries about over-stretched GPs and mental health services, as well as the difficulty of retaining qualified staff. Her youngest son had to wait six hours to get his suspected fractured wrist looked at. Rachel, who lives in Cheshire and works as a teaching assistant, has voted Lib Dem (2017), Labour (2015) and Conservative (2010). She didn't vote in the 2016 referendum. ""What we do not want is an American-style system,"" she says. Self-described ""fitness fanatic""Leanne, 34, is suspicious of claims that the NHS will be privatised or sold to the Americans. She voted Leave in 2016 and Conservative in 2010, 2015 and 2017. She says friends and family who work for the NHS are under enormous pressure. ""How will our NHS be managed from now on to ensure that our population is cared for correctly?"" she wants to know. The NHS has undoubtedly been one of the key issues of the election. That should come as no surprise - Lord Lawson, a former Conservative chancellor, perhaps best summed it up when he said the NHS was the ""closest thing the English people have to a religion"". The parties have tried to outdo each other with their attempts to be seen as the party of the NHS, promising extra funding, increases in staff and more money for buildings. But while the budget has been increasing over the past decade, it has not gone up fast enough to cope with demand. It has meant longer waiting times for all sorts of treatment. The NHS has also been dragged into the Brexit debate, with Labour saying it is at risk from a post-Brexit US trade deal - something the Tories deny. The US pharmaceutical industry would certainly want the NHS to pay more for drugs, but this will undoubtedly be strongly resisted. Still undecided? More background here: 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS What do parties' NHS promises really mean? NHS claims fact-checked Most of our undecideds want certainty above all. More than three years on from the referendum, the likes ofMark,Chioma,ClaireandLeslie(left to right, below) don't understand why Brexit hasn't been resolved, one way or the other. Mark, 52, owns a small childcare company in London and has two teenage children with his wife, who recently recovered from cancer. She was treated on the NHS, although she has private health insurance. For Mark, a Leave voter, Brexit is the most important issue. ""Who is going to get Brexit done so that the country can move on and business conditions can return to some semblance of normality?"" he asks. Trade, immigration, the NHS: all will be affected by Brexit, saysChioma,37, a committed Christian originally from Nigeria, now living in Scotland. For that reason, she sees it as the most important issue facing the country. She voted Conservative in 2017 but Labour in 2015 and 2010. She didn't vote in the referendum. ""How soon can Brexit be decided?"" she asks. ""So we can know what we have to work with."" Clairelives in London and teaches adults with learning disabilities. She worries about knife crime and acid attacks in her local area. Claire, who voted Remain in 2016 and Labour in two of the last three elections, thinks Brexit will be ""a disaster"" for the country and wants another referendum. ""I'm worried it's going to be a one-issue election and [I'm] scared that could be very bad for the country. At the same time I think the Brexit question is already damaging Britain and is urgent."" Cheshire-born and bred,Leslie, 64, voted UKIP in 2017, Conservative before that, and Leave in 2016. He's not sure ""which of the main two parties are telling the truth"". He works as an engineer for an Italian company, but the owners haven't wanted to invest in the UK until Brexit is resolved. ""I would like the incoming government to move forward with this issue, then we could have the investment in staff needed,"" he says. He also worries about the impact of Brexit on the NHS and whether medical supplies will be protected. The trouble with Brexit is that all parties want to make the solutions sound simple, but it's actually a very complicated process. That's because leaving the EU would make huge changes to the way our whole economy operates - and loads of other issues like security cooperation and sharing data with our nearest neighbours would need to be renegotiated as well. The Tories promise to get Brexit done but they haven't even started trade talks. Labour says it will renegotiate a better deal and hold another referendum, but it's not clear whether it wants to leave or remain. And the Liberal Democrats' manifesto proposed stopping Brexit altogether, in effect ignoring the result of the 2016 referendum without giving anyone another say. The country has been divided quite sharply - and sometimes unpleasantly - by Brexit. The idea any party will be able to click their fingers and bring those divisions to a sudden end doesn't really stand up to scrutiny.  Whatever happens in this election, Brexit is going to be a long haul. Still undecided? More background here: How Remainers and Leavers plan to vote Brexit - where do the parties stand? Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Another thread running through many of our participants' answers is trust - or the lack of it. Just askMariam,Akeel,CliveandJames(left to right, below). Even if people like what the parties are saying, they don't believe the politicians will deliver. ""Why should I vote for you? What can you do to benefit peopleâ¦ and genuinely stick to your word?""Mariam, 24, from London has a challenge for the parties. She voted Conservative in the last two elections but didn't take part in the 2016 referendum. Mariam, who has a two-year-old daughter, is leaning towards voting Labour this time but questions the sincerity of the promises from all parties. Like Mariam,Akeelabstained in the 2016 referendum. He voted Labour in 2017 and Conservative in 2015. He's a truck driver, 38 years old, who lives in Birmingham and is concerned about the cost of living. He wants a contract with the politicians to hold them to account. ""If you can't do what you say you're going to do, what compensation do the public get?"" Clive, 62, worked in the mining industry and asbestos removal before retiring through ill health. He moved from Derbyshire to London, where he's now a volunteer working with homeless people and substance abusers. His view? ""Promise after promise from Labour or more of the same under the Tories"" - he considers the Lib Dems undemocratic and thinks no other parties have a chance. ""Who is the one that is believable? At the moment none of them are."" One possible outcome after 12 December is a hung parliament. If that's the case,James, 64 and from Glasgow, wants to know who the parties would work with. ""Don't treat us like little kids as if we know nothing and we need to believe every single word that comes out of their mouths,"" he fumes. He voted for the SNP in the last two elections and Remain in the referendum. He worries about what the future holds, especially the uncertainty over Brexit. Voters have always distrusted politicians but, at the start of this election campaign, a survey suggested just 14% of British adults believed they could trust them to tell the truth. That's a fall of five percentage points in a year, with politicians displacing advertising executives at the bottom of the truthfulness index. This rise in scepticism coincides with great volatility in UK politics, as the established parties tear themselves apart over Brexit. There have been 90 switches of allegiance by MPs in the past two years, a sign of how old tribalism is weakening. The Brexit divide has cut across traditional lines and that, I think, has added to voter uncertainty as to how individual politicians and indeed political parties will behave. The tone of politics has coarsened and the campaigns appear less bound by principles of honesty and integrity. Still undecided? More background here: Trust is the burning issue at this election Do people still vote according to class? Could undecided voters change the election? There's a lot of worry about public spending and how the parties will pay for their promises, but for many, such asBetty,Amelia,HumzaandGemma(left to right, below) financial concerns lie closer to home. Betty, who lives in Glasgow, has four children and five grandchildren. A Leave voter, she switched from Labour to the SNP in 2017, as she wanted Scotland's voice to be heard. She worries about the effect of austerity and Brexit on the economy. Her question to the candidates seeking her vote? ""What will you do to ensure that I will be able to pass on my family's inheritance that I have worked hard for?"" While Betty is retired, 18-year-oldAmeliais just starting out. She's a first-time voter who'd like another Brexit referendum so that she could vote to remain in the EU. She's preparing for A-levels and, after that, university. ""The large debt for tuition fees combined with maintenance loans will stick with me for a long proportion of my life,"" she says. Humza, 20, has finished his degree and is now eyeing the next stage: buying a property. He lives with his grandmother in south London and voted Labour in 2017. ""How are we going to tackle the issue of property prices to help people buy their first home for life security?"" he wants to know. Buying a house with her boyfriend was a major milestone forGemma, who owns a cleaning business in Nantwich. She voted Leave in 2016 and Liberal Democrat in the election the year before. She thinks the Conservatives are ""more for the wealthy than helping the working/lower class"" but worries about Labour's spending plans. The undecided voter can often be swayed by what politicians promise for the pound in your pocket. Average hourly wages, after accounting for the rising cost of living, are no higher than they were at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008, and poverty is most likely to be found in working households. People have differing views on who to blame for that, but it does mean household budgets are at the front of many voters' minds. They might also consider the effect this has had on different generations. Put simply, the old have fared better than the young. All the parties confront this issue in part, particularly targeting young first-time buyers who feel they have been locked out of the property market. There are promises too for a more generous minimum wage, and plans on who to tax or not. But universal benefits for pensioners and the ""triple-lock"" state pension guarantee are untouched. Ultimately, management of the UK economy will have the greatest effect on jobs, wages, and financial prospects. There are fundamental differences between the parties on how to approach this task. The trouble is, economists at the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies say the spending plans of the biggest two - Labour and the Conservatives - are""not credible"". Still undecided? More background here: Who do you vote for if your cupboards are empty? How wealthy are you? What are the challenges for the UK's economy?

Polluting firms 'will be hit by climate policies',"Utilities burning fossil fuels could lose value, a study has said Carbon-intensive firms are likely to lose 43% of their value thanks to policies designed to combat climate change, a report says. Meanwhile the most progressive companies will see an uplift of 33% in their value. The forecast was commissioned by the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Representatives of fossil fuel companies told the BBC they were already adapting their businesses to take climate change into account. But the PRI study suggests major winners and losers will emerge between, and within, big sectors. Car-makers with the swiftest transition to electric vehicles (EVs), for instance, are projected to increase in value by 108%, according to the study by Vivid Economics. Manufacturers slow to move to EVs will see their value fall, as governments realise that petrol and diesel models must be phased out faster for climate targets to be met. Warning on coal Meanwhile, the study predicts that the worldâs largest listed coal companies could fall in value by 44%. And the 10 biggest firms in oil and gas could lose 31% of current value. Electric utilities with the strongest strategy for renewables could see values increase by 104%, while laggards could see them fall by two-thirds. Miners producing minerals critical for the transition may see a 54% upside, while those with the smallest share of âgreen mineralsâ will witness valuations almost halving. Car firms should switch to making electric vehicles quickly, said the study Agricultural firms with high exposure to âsustainableâ biofuels and non-beef protein sources could gain at least 10% of current value. Those exposed to under-pressure sectors such as cattle may lose between 15% and 43% - depending on their links with deforestation. The figures are inevitably speculative, and rely on an assumption that politicians will be forced to respond strongly to the growing climate crisis â which, given current political progress, remains debatable. Firms already under pressure But they do echo the warnings issued by the Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who said firms ignoring the climate challenge would go bankrupt. Already some insurance firms are refusing to offer cover to new coal-fired power stations because the risk of policy change is so great. The giant AXA, for instance, says it will stop insuring any new coal construction projects, and totally phase out existing insurance and investments in coal in the EU, by 2030. Fiona Reynolds, CEO of the  PRI, said: âThis analysis underscores the extent to which markets are under-pricing climate transition risk. âOne in five of the worldâs most valuable companies are impacted by at least 10% in either direction. âWhile the  market-level effects of an abrupt policy response to climate change may appear manageable, this masks a much more complex and significant story, with some huge winners and losers emerging between sectors and within them. âWe are calling on investors to get real on climate policy risk, and this robust modelling exercise and analysis will enable them to do that.â Industries ""already changing"" Mike Tholen, from industry body Oil and Gas UK said: âThe (oil and gas) majors targeted in this report are actively reducing their carbon footprints, pursuing technologies including Carbon Capture and Storage and diversifying their businesses into a broader mix of renewable energy. âOil and gas remain an important part of the energy mix for decades to come, and will be used in an increasingly low carbon manner to meet global energy needs.â This confident response will alarm scientists who were warning at the UN climate conference last week that emissions from oil and gas were growing strongly, as coal growth slows. And a spokesperson for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: âVehicle manufacturers and suppliers are investing vast sums in ultra-low and zero emission vehicles to help meet the same environmental goals. â[Now] we need the right conditions to encourage investment, innovation and a competitive market. âThis must include giga-scale battery production and electrified supply chains, massive skills and infrastructure investment and long-term incentives to help companies and consumers make the shift sustainably.â Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin Carbon emissions edge up as coal use falls Critical year for climate change begins in Madrid Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

This video can not be played General election 2019: 'If the climate was a bank we'd have bailed it out' says Bartley Tomorrow is the penultimate day of the election campaign, and as ever we'll be bringing you the latest updates throughout the day. Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Nigel Farage, Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon will all be out on the campaign trail. There will be two BBC debates in the evening â BBC Scotland will broadcast its Scotland
Leaders debate live from Pacific Quay in Glasgow, while the leaders of the
main parties in Northern Ireland take part in a debate in front of a studio
audience. Labour candidate Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who is standing in Tooting, has criticised the Conservatives for releasing a campaign video based on the same idea as hers, which she posted two weeks ago. Ms Allin-Khan had posted a spoof of a scene from the film Love Actually, when a character uses large, handwritten signs to get a message across to someone on the doorstep. (In the film, Andrew Lincoln's character is confessing his love to Keira Knightley, who is recently married to another man). Ms Allin-Khan's video went viral, being retweeted more than 8,000 times. Tonight, Boris Johnson's team produced their own version of the same scene but with the PM on the doorstep holding signs with his party's slogans, particularly on Brexit. Again, it's going viral on Twitter, with more than 2,000 retweets in the first hour it's been posted. Responding, Ms Allin-Khan tweeted: ""I won't be retweeting it - but Boris Johnson has copied my #ElectionActually video. ""Tanks. On. The. Lawn.

Don't share his version in outrage - instead, share my original version."" Several journalists have also been pointing out that the idea was done originally by Ms Allin-Khan. A councillor and party official were filmed making the comments on the election campaign trail. Read the full story here. This video can not be played Argument between Farage and Rayner on Question Time Following on from our earlier post, here are a few more of tomorrow's front pages: The Mirror says its front page from Monday - of the boy sleeping on a hospital floor - made the PM ""squirm"". The paper hopes Tuesday's edition will do the same The i says the ""hospital fracas"" has ""floored"" the PM - but it chooses to lead on the deadly volcano eruption in New Zealand The Mail leads on the prime minister's comments that the BBC's licence fee is outdated and could be scrapped The Times front page looks quite similar to the Mail's. It leads with the same image and story from New Zealand, while making a nod towards the PM's licence fee comments Lord Sugar is calling on voters to support the Conservative Party, the Sun says - using a well-known soundbite from his reality TV show, the Apprentice, as it's headline It's that time of night when we can share a few of tomorrow's front pages with you. One story in particular is dominating the newspapers... The Metro calls the situation a ""war of words"" which led to a backlash for Boris Johnson The Guardian claims Mr Johnsonâs team tried to turn the story on to Labour by wrongly briefing that a Tory aide was punched outside the hospital by a left-wing activist The Financial Times describes the situation as the ""first significant stumble"" the PM has made - and it's come in the ""final straight"" of campaigning The Telegraph looks instead at a memo which says the chances of Labour forming a coalition government have been seriously underestimated Listen back to the Question Time election special on BBC Sounds.

The latest episode of Electioncast has dropped - and it covers the events of today. With only three days left of campaigning, Boris Johnson is criticised for initially refusing to look at a picture of a sick boy who had to sleep on the floor of a Leeds hospital. And Adam heads to Crewe to chat to a group of undecided voters. Listen to the episode here. This video can not be played The SNP say Scotland is losing out over Brexit Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Talking to voters around the country two big issues have had the elusive ""cut through"" in this campaign - the Tories promise to take us out of the EU at the end of next month and Labour's attack on their handling of the NHS. Of course, other subjects have been part of the conversation but those are the issues that have come up most often during the last few weeks when we've been travelling around the country. And in every election in recent history, the Labour Party has tried to sow doubts in voters' minds about whether or not the Tories can be trusted with the health service at all. That's why Boris Johnson's terrible day on the campaign trail today matters. Read more from Laura here. Emma Barnett thanks the panel and audience for coming - and that's it, the 90-minute debate is over. We've had questions on Brexit, housing, climate change and trust in politics - among other topics. If you missed it, you can catch up here. Emma is back on Friday, 13 December to discuss the election result.

In the final exchange of the debate, Jo Swinson calls on Humza Yousaf to have an ""honesty"" about Scottish independence. Mr Yousaf - whose SNP party is calling for indyref2 - says that although he knows it won't be ""perfectly rosy"", Scotland would be economically stable if it were to become an independent country. But Ms Swinson - whose Lib Dems party is against Scottish independence - says it's only fair to be honest that, if Scottish independence were to happen, it would be ""a hit to the [Scottish] economy"". She backs this up by pointing out that the Scottish deficit is higher than the rest of the UK. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Immigrants have contributed much more to this society than they have ever taken,"" says Mr Yousaf, which gets a clap from the audience.

"Negotiators 'playing politics' amid climate crisisPolitical posturing is harming attempts to address key issues at the UN climate talks, participants say.Science & Environment","UN negotiators meeting in Madrid have been accused of ""playing politics"" while the climate crisis grows. The talks - now in their final week - are bogged down in technical details as key countries seek to delay efforts to increase their pledges, observers say. Ministers are due to arrive in the Spanish capital this week to try to secure an ambitious outcome. US presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg is due to attend, while Greta Thunberg will also address the meeting. This video can not be played Greta Thunberg at UN climate change talks - one year apart Up tohalf a million people took part in a march in Madridin support of rapid climate action, but according to observers, negotiators haven't got the message. ""The problem is while hundreds of thousands of people are marching outside in Madrid, and school children are striking, countries are playing politics with the negotiations,"" said Mohammed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a climate and energy think tank based in Nairobi, who's an observer at these talks. Download the BBC Energy Briefing, from October 2019 (10.7MB),external Greta: 'They try so desperately to silence us' Climate summit told of nation's 'fight to death' Critical year for climate change begins in Madrid ""We need ministers to arrive this week and make some real progress."" Negotiators huddle to try and find common ground Inside the convention centre, the central question of increasing country pledges to cut their carbon has been pushed aside as negotiators resort to protecting  national interests. Back in 2015, everyone signed up to the Paris agreement and put new plans on the table that are due to run from 2020. However the richer countries were supposed to undertake specific carbon cutting actions in the years between 2015 and 2020, which many haven't yet achieved. Here in Madrid a group of countries including China, India and Saudi Arabia are pushing for these pre-2020 commitments be adhered to - even if it means achieving them post-2020. Observers believe this is partly a negotiating tactic designed to put pressure on richer nations in any discussions about improving pledges in the period after 2020. Michael Bloomberg is expected to arrive at the talks this week There is frustration that countries are focussing on trying to get advantages in the talks, instead of working together to increase ambition. ""The Paris agreement is clear: all countries agreed to deliver new climate targets by 2020, and as the recent UNEP emissions gap report made clear, the onus is on the top 10 polluters to deliver,"" said Laurence Tubiana, one of the key architects of the Paris agreement, now with the European Climate Foundation. ""I know leaders in Brussels, Delhi, Beijing, Tokyo and Ottawa care about global action, but we need them to deliver this week. We need their leadership to deliver on their Paris commitments."" As well as the pre-2020 question, the talks are stuck on two tricky, technical issues - one about the question of loss and damage, the other about carbon markets. Article 6 of the Paris climate agreement deals with the trading of emissions reductions credits that might arise from a country beating its own pledges or from a public or private initiative that cut emissions, such as a renewable energy plant or the restoration of a forest. Here in Madrid, as last year in Katowice, countries are struggling to agree the rules of how these markets would work. A number of countries including Brazil want to carry over credits that were created under previous versions of this scheme. The worry is that many of these historical credits are not real reductions. If they are used by countries to meet part or all of their pledges they simply dilute real efforts to cut carbon. The question of loss and damage sees developing countries looking for a new facility in the UN talks that would deal with the impacts of events like sea level rise or major storms that have a climate component. They argue that the poorest are the ones feeling the impacts of a climate they didn't create. Rich countries have long resisted the idea feeling they will be on the hook for billions of dollars for centuries to come. Up to now these discussions have been led by civil servants, but the arrival of ministers will likely clarify if both can be resolved by political horse trading. It's possible that a compromise could be arrived at that would see both issues resolved here. Or not! Delegates from Easter Island arrive at the talks While the interventions of Michael Bloomberg and Greta Thunberg will likely gain headlines, there is still uncertainty over whether a final decision can be taken here that will be ambitious and set out a clear timeline for countries to get their pledges on the table ahead of COP26 in Glasgow in November 2020. There is hope that a large number of countries will sign up to long term net-zero emissions targets, and if that happens it will be significant progress. But many eyes here will be closely watching Brussels this week where the new EU commission is due to present a European Green Deal.

Four tiger foetuses found in 'poacher' arrests,"The skin of an adult tiger was found along with the foetuses Five people in Indonesia have been arrested for poaching after authorities found the skin of a protected Sumatran tiger and four foetuses in a jar. Sumatran tigers are critically endangered, withfewer than 400,externalbelieved to be left in the wild. It's not clear if the foetuses were taken from the adult tiger whose skin was taken. Tiger cubs are born blind and are totally dependent on their mother for the first few months of their lives. An official from the Environment and Forestry Ministry said the suspects, from Riau province, were arrested after police received a tip-off. Two suspects are believed to have been acting as sellers. They face a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of 100 million rupiah ($7100; Â£5403). The Sunda subspecies of tiger was once found on the Indonesian islands of Java, Bali, and Sumatra. They are now found only on Sumatra. According to the WWF: ""Accelerating deforestation and rampant poaching mean this noble creature could end up extinct like its Javan and Balinese counterparts. ""In Indonesia, anyone caught hunting tigers could face jail time and steep fines. ""But despite increased efforts in tiger conservation - including strengthening law enforcement and anti-poaching capacity - a substantial market remains in Sumatra and other parts of Asia for tiger parts and products."" Half of tigers rescued from Thai temple have died Hunting Thailand's farm tiger traffickers According to wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic, poaching for trade is responsible for almost 80% of Sumatran tiger deaths - amounting to 40 deaths a year. Some parts of the tiger, like the bones, are believed to have medicinal values in parts of Asia.

Ding beats Maguire to win third UK snooker title,"This video can not be played Ding wins UK title in stunning final - best shots China's Ding Junhui won his third UK Championship by dispatching Scotland's Stephen Maguire 10-6 in an absorbing final featuring seven century breaks. Ding, 32, had not won a ranking event since 2017 and last lifted the UK trophy a decade ago - four years after his first triumph as a teenager. Back-to-back centuries secured a 5-3 first-session lead and he sealed victory with successive tons. Maguire made three tons in four frames, but his poor start proved costly. Ding, who won the first four frames in a confident start, becomes only the fifth player to win the UK title on three or more occasions. He joins snooker greats Ronnie O'Sullivan (7), Steve Davis (6), Stephen Hendry (5) and John Higgins (3) on an elite list and collected a tournament record Â£200,000 in prize money. 'You have to keep believing' - Ding after ending trophy drought Relive Ding's victory as it happened ""This is very special,"" Ding told BBC Sport. ""It has been two years and I have done nothing but I have played very well this week. ""I worried about not doing well and asked myself 'can I win again?' ""But this week I played so well and when I beat Ronnie on the way to the final I started to believe I could lift the trophy again. ""My family give me full support and take the pressure off. I want to do my best for my daughter so that when she grows up she has the best daddy."" Ding has consistently been his country's best player since winning his first ranking title aged 18 at his home China Open event in 2005, before ascending to become the number one player in the world in 2014. China has since seen numerous players break through into the top 32 but none has come close to matching Ding's achievements - Yan Bingtao, 19, is the latest rising star but he was easily beaten by Ding in the semi-finals. The Sheffield-based player has admitted feeling the burden of pressure from the huge audiences in his homeland and has struggled with confidence and commitment issues over the last couple of years -  becoming a father for the first time in August 2018 may well have played a part in his turnaround. His last silverware came at the 2017 World Open and he remains one of the sport's best players never to have won the world title. Ding's fragile mental strength has often been called into question, his record in majors not matching his undoubted talent as this was just his fourth success at a Triple Crown event, and first since winning the 2011 Masters. He has suffered three first-round defeats this season but was back to his devastating best with impeccable cueball control, notching 10 centuries during the tournament, including four in the final. His place in the top 16 was under threat at the start of the tournament, but the run to the title allowed him to leap seven places to ninth in the world and drew him alongside world number one Judd Trump on 14 ranking events. Trump to face Murphy in Masters first round Saudi Arabia to host ranking event Glasgow's Maguire, 38, won the title 15 years ago and has arguably underachieved in his career, winning just five ranking titles in his career, the last of them at the 2013 Welsh Open. He has, though, been in decent form this season, winning the World Cup team event in June alongside Higgins and beating his countryman in the Six-red World Championship in September. His fiery temperament has often let him down but it has been kept well in check this year, and he produced a sensational 6-0 thrashing of Northern Ireland's Mark Allen in the last four in York, saying afterwards he ""can't remember ever playing like that"". At times in the tournament he was visibly struggling with the fractured foot he suffered in China in October and, against Ding, his high-scoring run came too late as Ding proved too good. ""Every time you let him in he scores 100,"" said Maguire. ""I told him a couple of frames ago 'it's not darts we're playing, it's snooker'. ""I thought if I get in I could maybe do it but it's tough when his safety is good as well. I've had a great week. The Barbican has been great, York's been great, the crowd were unreal and I've competed with the best."" Ding, who beat defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan in the last 16, snatched a 30-minute opening frame and fired in further breaks of 56, 105 and 128 for a 4-0 lead. Maguire hit back after the mid-session interval by taking another frame that lasted over half an hour and counter-attacked with an important 67 break after Ding broke down on 49. The Glaswegian took the next as well to trail by a single frame and had the chance to square the contest at 4-4 but missed a blue to the middle, allowing Ding to make 66 to lead by two frames. The standard of snooker rose in the evening session. Ding opened with 83 and Maguire missed a red on 53 allowing his opponent to pinch the next for a 7-3 lead, but Maguire hit back by fluking a red and stroking in 103. Ding made 67 to close in on victory, but Maguire compiled another 103 and then an even better 124 to stay in the contest. However, Ding's nerveless 131 clearance in the 15th frame and 103 to win the match - the fifth century in the last six frames - secured victory to a standing ovation. Seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry told BBC Sport:""This is almost like a second part of Ding's career. I didn't know if we'd see him winning major titles again. He didn't look happy at the table and didn't seem to be enjoying the pressure but his performance today was incredible."" Six-time world champion Steve Davis:""A lot of people had written Ding off for the World Championship but that has been blown right open now. ""I think Ding on his best form is a match for anybody in the world. He's a headache for the other top players.""

Ding beats Maguire to win third UK title,"This video can not be played Ding wins UK title in stunning final - best shots China's Ding Junhui won his third UK Championship by dispatching Scotland's Stephen Maguire 10-6 in an absorbing final featuring seven century breaks. Ding, 32, had not won a ranking event since 2017 and last lifted the UK trophy a decade ago - four years after his first triumph as a teenager. Back-to-back centuries secured a 5-3 first-session lead and he sealed victory with successive tons. Maguire made three tons in four frames, but his poor start proved costly. Ding, who won the first four frames in a confident start, becomes only the fifth player to win the UK title on three or more occasions. He joins snooker greats Ronnie O'Sullivan (7), Steve Davis (6), Stephen Hendry (5) and John Higgins (3) on an elite list and collected a tournament record Â£200,000 in prize money.

What's pledged on disability and mental health?,"This video can not be played Nikki Fox on the hurdles and options for disabled voters With 13 million disabled people in the country, plus their friends and family, the political parties have a huge community to court. Universal credit is still making headlines, while the main parties are divided on what to do with the social care system. So what is being offered to disabled voters? TheConservativeswant to continue the rollout of universal credit - the controversial six-in-one benefit, which includes employment and housing support. The party also wants to increase work allowances, a change they've estimated to be worth Â£630 a year to disabled people. They also say they will reduce the number of reassessments disabled people will have to go through to receive benefits if their condition is unlikely to change. Laboursays it will ""scrap UC"" and ""design an alternative system that treats people with dignity and respect"" instead. It wants to ""stop"" those work capability and PIP Assessments that some people report to be upsetting to go through. It would increase Employment and Support Allowance by Â£30 per week for those who are disabled or have a health condition that affects how much they can work. It's currently a maximum of Â£73.10 a week. By comparison, theLib Demssay they want to ""make the welfare system work"" by reducing the waiting time for the first payment from five weeks to five days, reversing cuts to the Employment Support Allowance (ESA) and ending work capability assessments, replacing them with ""real-world tests"" run by local authorities. TheGreen Partywants to introduce its own universal basic income, a salary for everyone, and wants to ensure nobody who takes time off work to care for loved ones ""unjustly struggles to access the state pension"". It also wants to increase the carers' allowance. Meanwhile, theBrexit Partysays it wants to reform universal credit after a 12-month review and bring in changes after two years, although it doesn't say anything beyond that. TheSNPalso wants to halt UC and immediately end the benefits freeze in Scotland, whilePlaid Cymruhas said it will push for full control of universal credit in Wales and is ""pressing"" for welfare powers to be devolved so it can take on issues including disability living allowance. Universal credit applies to the whole of the UK. What is universal credit - and what's the problem? When it comes to workplace conditions,Laboursays it wants to take the idea of a passport scheme for reasonable adjustments - smaller, achievable changes like rotas or working hours to help disabled workers move between jobs - and help crystallise what it means. They want to introduce new disability leave, which would be paid and recorded separately from sick leave. We've seen the gender pay gap regularly in the headlines - and Labour says it recognises a similar pattern between disabled and non-disabled employees. It wants to introduce a mandatory disability pay-gap report for companies with more than 250 employees. TheLib Demswant to try out some new ideas, including a pilot scheme where employers would be rewarded for investing in the mental wellbeing of their staff with reduced business rates.Plaid Cymruwants to establish ""sheltered employment schemes"" - an old-fashioned, less inclusive idea, but in this instance it's specifically for disabled people who need more support before returning to full employment. TheGreenshope to introduce job-sharing at all levels of government in the hope it will make politics more accessible. The other party manifestos -Conservative, SNPandBrexit Party- don't specifically reference work in relation to disability or mental health. This would apply across the UK. There is one pledge that unites five of the seven main parties: to put mental health care on an equal footing with that of physical health, a policy that mental health groups have wanted for many years. TheLib Demslist several ideas on how to make this happen and pledge to spend an additional Â£2.4bn after inflation on mental health by 2023-24 by improving access to therapies and mental health practitioners. They also want 24-hour services including mental health liaison teams in all hospitals. As part of their general look at mental and physical wellbeing, the party also suggests carers should be given community benefits such as free passes to leisure centres. Reduced waiting times for support are also key. Labourwants to ""improve access to psychological therapies"" with crises services being available 24/7 - something echoed in thePlaid Cymrumanifesto. And with non-emergency support in mind, theGreen Partywants to ""ensure"" everyone who needs therapies can get them within 28 days instead of the months it can take in some areas.Conservativestalk about patients having greater control over their treatment. Family is high on the agenda too, withLabourand theLib Demswanting to bring in mental health assessments for new mothers andPlaid Cymrupromising to re-open its specialist mother-and-baby units for mothers with severe mental illness, which were closed in 2013. Neither theBrexit Partynor theSNPreference mental health in their election pitches. Healthcare is devolved. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all run their own health services, but they will benefit from any extra funding. Eleven charts on why the NHS matters Is the NHS facing unprecedented demand? CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external We often hear stories about children applying for specialist school places that aren't available locally, or not getting appropriate educational support in mainstream schools. Parents may have hoped the manifestos would contain significant detail on Special Educational Needs (SEN/SEND). However, detail is scant. TheGreen Partyhas the most comprehensive plans. It wants all SEN children to experience a ""fully inclusive education"" with access to their local school, which would mean accessible buildings, an inclusive curriculum and specially trained teachers. On top of that it wants to retain specialist schools if that's a preferred option for the family. TheConservativeshave pledged to increase school funding by Â£7.1bn by 2022-23, which the party says includes more SEN places, whileLaboursays it will provide the ""necessary funding"" for school-age pupils. Additionally the party wants to recruit new SEN co-ordinators as part of 150,000 additional early years staff. Meanwhile, theLib Demswant to ""end the crisis"" of SEN funding by allocating ""additional cash to local authorities"", reducing the amount schools pay towards the cost of a child's needs, whilePlaid Cymruwants schools to have ""appropriate access"" for physically disabled pupils and better support for those with learning difficulties. TheSNPandBrexit Partymake no reference to SEN. Education is a devolved issue. Your Questions Answered: Education and tuition fees Care is a hot topic. In England and Northern Ireland, anyone with savings of Â£23,500 or more (the figure is Â£24,000 in Wales) must foot the bill for any care in their home. The threshold is the same for a care home, but also includes the value of their home. This means people may find they are in the unpalatable situation of having to sell their house to free up the money. TheConservativessay they will initially invest Â£1bn a year on both adult (and children's social care) to tackle this and the prime minister has pledged to stop individuals having to sell their homes, but has not explained how this might be done. Plaid Cymruwants to offer free social care for elderly people and those who are more vulnerable through a new National Health and Social Care Service for Wales. TheLib Demssay they'd cap the cost of care that individuals pay and would introduce a 1p increase to income tax, with some of the Â£7bn raised a year pegged to social care -Labouralso pledges to cap the same care costs.Labouris promising free personal care for older people who need it. On housing and independence,Labourwants to help autistic people and people with learning disabilities move out of ""inappropriate inpatient hospital settings"" and into their own homes as part of a wider social care policy on doubling the number of people who receive publicly funded care packages. Similarly, theGreen Partywants to introduce a legal right to independent living for disabled people and help councils draw up disability housing plans, whilePlaid Cymruwants to ensure local authorities and social landlords provide more ""disabled-friendly and lifetime housing"". TheLib Demswant to reinstate the Independent Living Fund, which financially supported disabled people who choose to live in the community rather than residential care. TheConservativesalso want to put money into finding a cure for dementia which it describes as ""one of our government's biggest collective priorities"" alongside climate change. Health and social care is a devolved issue. Why more people are talking about social care There are a couple of other interesting ideas that pop up in the manifestos. Most notably,Plaid Cymruwants to focus on the rights of autistic people and those awaiting a diagnosis so all can access support. It also plans to make neuro-divergence a protected characteristic under the Equalities Act to safeguard individuals against discrimination. Protected characteristics currently include age, disability, race and sexuality. TheConservativesplan to publish a National Strategy for Disabled People by the end of 2020 for: the benefits system, housing, education, transport and jobs. How do spending plans compare?

10 reasons why we're not a divided nation,"Much of the talk since the Brexit referendum has been of a nation divided, split by geography, income, education and age. But despite the Remainer v Leaver rhetoric, most people in the UK actually appear to agree on a wide variety of subjects, and share an increasingly socially liberal outlook. Here are 10 subjects that unite most of us in Britain, according to recent polling. Almost all of us Britons - 99% - feel ""some"" or ""significant"" responsibility to be faithful to our partners, a ComRes survey for BBC News suggests. Women appear more likely to feel significant responsibility than men - of those surveyed, 86% of women felt significant responsibility, compared with 79% of the men. Among the men surveyed, those in older age brackets were more likely to feel significant responsibility than those in younger groups. Some 87% of the men over the age of 55 felt this level of responsibility, compared with 66% of those aged 16-24. Why we need to talk about cheating Quiz: How do your morals compare? There is almost universal support for the principle of equal pay between men and women, the annual British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey suggests. Of those surveyed, about nine in 10 of us (89%) said it was wrong for men to be paid more than women doing the same job in the same company.,external There were differences in the strength of opinion between men and women, however, with 78% of the women surveyed considering this pay inequality ""very wrong"", compared with 57% of the men. Is equal pay even possible? Three-quarters of Britons reject the idea women should be ""homemakers"" and men should be ""breadwinners"",external, according to BSA data. Not only did those surveyed see women as having a role outside the home, they were also unlikely to see particular roles as being men's or women's work. Most of us also think men and women are mostly equally suited to working in a wide range of roles, including doctor, councillor and MP, the BSA survey suggests. About half said men and women were ""equally suited"" to ""all"" or ""almost all jobs"", with a further third saying men and women were equally suited to ""most jobs"". Four in 10 said a mother should take most of a parental leave period, with the father taking some. A third said it should be shared equally between both parents. Nancy Kelley, deputy chief executive of Natcen Social Research, which carries out the British Social Attitudes survey, says the shifts in attitudes towards women's roles and rights, as well as sexual relationships, are one of the ""most striking stories"" seen in the survey over the past few decades. And while it may appear politically divided right now, particularly around Brexit, the country remains ""very, very united"" on a number of social issues. ""On all of those kinds of things we've become increasingly socially liberal,"" she says. ""This is very different from the US, where alongside very political divides, you see what you might describe as a 'culture war' - we don't see that at all in our data."" Such trends are longstanding and researchers expect them to continue, she adds, suggesting Britons will continue to agree on some of the fundamental social issues in the UK. Raising girls 'changes fathers' views on gender stereotypes' Two-thirds of Britons say sex between two adults of the same sex is ""not wrong at all"",external, according to the BSA survey, an increase of almost 50% since the question was first asked, in 1983. It suggests approval for same-sex relationships has risen steadily after a fall in the mid-1980s - the time of the Aids crisis and the government's ""Don't die of ignorance,"" campaign. According to the BSA researchers, this rise is not just down to a generational change: older people too have become more liberal in their views, and so have those who do not follow a religion. However, the BSA survey does note theliberalisation in attitudes to sexual relationships appears to be slowing down.,external The proportion of respondents stating sexual relations between two adults of the same sex are ""not wrong at all"" has remained at about two-thirds (64%, 68% and 66%) for the past three years. Researchers say this suggests a significant minority of people remain uncomfortable with same-sex relationships. This is, perhaps, ""reflecting the marked divides between the attitudes of religious and non-religious people"", they say. Same-sex couples recorded as living together up by 50% There is near unanimous support (92% in 2016) for abortions when a woman's health is in danger, according to the BSA survey. And since 2005, support for allowing an abortion if the woman does not wish to have a child has increased from 60 to 69%. The women 'shouting' their abortions More than eight in 10 Britons trust university scientists ""to do their work with the intention of benefitting the public"" and 67% trust company scientists to do the same, according to the BSA survey. An even higher percentage - 94% - believe medical research in particular will ""lead to an improvement in the quality of life"" over the coming decades. Graduates and those in managerial and professional occupations have a particularly high level of trust in university scientists at 90%, compared with 73% of those with no qualifications. There is little evidence of a ""disenfranchised population turning against the institutions of science"", BSA researchers say, despitepopular accounts of declining trust in ""experts"". Why you should mostly trust what science tells you Almost eight in 10 people (77%) believe the NHS is crucial to British society,external, according to a survey by Ipsos Mori for the King's Fund think-tank. This support has remained constant through changes in government and fluctuations in the economy. About 90% also support the NHS's three founding principles - that it should be free at the point of delivery; provide a comprehensive service available to everyone; and be primarily funded through taxation. Perhaps more surprisingly, two-thirds are also prepared to pay more tax to maintain the level of spending needed to keep the NHS going. However, satisfaction with the service appears to be dropping, according to the British Social Attitudes Survey. Overall satisfaction was 53% in 2018 - a three percentage point drop from the previous year and the lowest level since 2007. How unhappy is the public with the NHS? More than seven in 10 Britons believe it is ""very"" or ""quite important"" for the country to continue to have a monarchy, according to the BSA survey. However, the size of this majority did shrink significantly between the 1980s and 1990s, before growing again in the 2000s. In 1983, more than 86% were in favour of the monarchy. But this figure fell to 66% in 1994 - around the time of the Prince of Wales' separation from Diana, Princess of Wales, and ahead of her death in a car accident, in 1997. But public opinion rose again following a low in 2003, to reach 76% in 2012 - the year of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Britain has marked a number of other royal milestones in the past few years: the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding, in 2011, and that of the the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, in 2018, as well as a number of royal births. Why does the UK love the monarchy? As many as 95% of Britons think climate change is at least partly due to human activity, according to the 2018 European Social Survey (which conducts research across Europe). Some 36% say it is ""mainly"" or ""entirely"" due to human activity, while 53% think human and natural causes are equally to blame. Just 2% say climate change ""definitely is not happening"". What is climate change? When it comes to things - rather than social views - celebrities, charities and food dominate the collective most-loved list, according to YouGov. David Attenborough comes top, with a massive 87% approval, its polling suggests.,external And he is followed on its most-popular-things list by a number of health charities, including the St John Ambulance Brigade (87%) and Macmillan Cancer Support (86%) and actor Tom Hanks (84%). 10 reasons why we're not a divided nation Overall, 19 of the top 100 entries are charities. A quarter are people - mainly actors - and a quarter are foods. A study by Dr Paul Hanel, research associate at Bath University's department of psychology, suggeststhose on either side of the Brexit argument actually agree on a wide range of subjects.,external His research indicates the views of Leavers and Remainers are actually 90% similar across a number of topics, including poverty, climate change, housing, British identity, life satisfaction, the importance of involvement in communities. Even on subjects viewed as the most divisive, such as attitudes to immigrants and national identity, the two groups showed more than 50% similarity, Dr Hanel says. He says a focus on ""differences"" means we overstate the gap between Leavers and Remainers, and that the evidence that they have more in common may help heal the wounds caused by the Brexit debate. ""Its easier to talk to someone else if there are more similarities between you than you might expect,"" , Mr Hanel says. Design by Mark Bryson, Joy Roxas and Sana Jasemi.

Your Questions: How will UK wildlife be saved?,"With concerns about the environment a major theme in the election, what are the parties' plans on green issues? Here, we answer a selection of readers' questions. More than a quarter of UK mammals - including the Scottish wildcat, the frosted green moth and the pine marten - are facing extinction, according toa report published in October 2019. It added that 97% of the UK's wildflower meadows have been lost in the last 100 years. Inits environmental manifesto,external, Labour details how it will spend nearly Â£10bn over the next 10 years on restoring nature and protecting the environment. It also wants to create 10 new national parks. The Liberal Democrats will introduce a Nature Act to restore the natural environment. This will set targets for improving water, air, soil, and wildlife and its habitat. This will cost at least Â£18bn over five years. The Green Party has a raft of policies on wildlife. Among these are a new law to prevent crimes against the natural environment. The Greens would also introduce an environmental protection commission to enforce the protection of wildlife and habitat. The Tory manifesto does not mention UK wildlife specifically, although it does pledge to work with other countries on issues such as deforestation, wildlife protection and the oceans. The BBC's Blue Planet II series sparked a debate about single-use plastics, and it's also featured in this election campaign. The Liberal Democrats and the Green Party would clamp down on single-use plastics, banning them outright. The Greens would ban their production and extend the plastic bag tax to cover plastic bottles and other single-use plastics as well. Parties have also made promises on plastic waste. The Conservatives want to set up a Â£500m ""Blue Planet"" fund dedicated to tackling pollution in the oceans. Labour has promised to invest in the recyling and reusing of plastics. The government is set to introducenew rules on single-use plasticnext year. Bars and restaurants will not be allowed to display plastic straws or automatically hand them out, and plastic stirrers will be subject to a total ban. Several parties want to ban the export of plastic waste, including the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party. Plaid Cymru has committed to making Wales a single-use plastic-free nation by 2030. Some of the largest contributors,externalto the UK's emissions of greenhouse gases - in particular, carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming - include transport, energy supply and parts of industry. So, cutting emissions from ""heavy"" industry - things like oil, mining, steel or machine manufacturing - is a big challenge. The Conservatives have said they would invest Â£500m to help energy-intensive industries move to low-carbon techniques. Labour and the Lib Dems say they would offer support for ways of making steel that use less carbon. Jeremy Corbyn has also promised a ""windfall tax"" on oil firms. The SNP has called for a pot of money for places heavily reliant on oil, such as Falkirk or Aberdeen, to help diversify their economies as the UK looks to reduce its carbon emissions. The Green Party has promised to invest in training to help people get new jobs in manufacturing for the renewable energy sector. Plaid says it would start what is called a ""green jobs revolution"" by investing in renewable energy and transport infrastructure. Making sure the UK sticks to EU rules about water, air, waste and wildlife is currently monitored and enforced by institutions includingthe European Commission and Court of Justice,external. Government ministers haven't yet guaranteed that the UK will stick to the same standards if Brexit happens. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external IN-DEPTH:More general election explainers and features The government has saidit would set up a new Office for Environmental Protection to make sure ministers hit their targets. But critics have pointed out this body won't be independent, as it will answer to government and not to Parliament. It's also been suggested the government wouldn't be able to issue fines, as the EU previously has. Leaving the EU also won't affect the UK's commitments under the Climate Change Act. This set legally binding targets to reduce the UK's carbon dioxide emissions by at least 80% by 2050, although since then a law has passed to reach zero-carbon emissions in the same time frame. Sending goods by rail can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 76% compared to using road transport. However, only about 9% of goods in the UK are carried by rail. Some parties have made specific commitments about rail freight, while others are more general. The Conservatives have pledged to invest an extra Â£100m in roads and rail, while Labour says it wants to find more environmentally friendly ways of running the railways. United Kingdom 9.1%of freight goes by rail Â£1.7bnannual economic contribution 60 HGVsequivalent carried per train 76%less CO2 emissions than road Â£30bnvalue of goods carried per year The Lib Dems say they will shift more freight transport from road to rail. They will also make the electrification of rail lines from major sea ports a priority. The Greens have pledged to have more freight carried by rail. They say there is ""enormous scope"" to cut emissions. In May 2019, the SNP-run Scottish governmentannounced a new rail freight fund,external. Up to Â£25m will be made available to upgrade track and other areas of the rail network. Only the Green Party has made promises in this area. It wants to change the payments made to farmers to help them move away from the intensive farming of livestock, like beef cattle. It would also introduce a tax on meat and dairy products. This would, it says, shift people towards plant-based diets, benefitting health and animal welfare, and combating global warming. Other parties have made wider pledges about agriculture. The Conservatives have said that - in return for funding - farmers must work in a way that protects and enhances the natural environment, with high animal welfare standards. Labour has pledged to have net-zero carbon food production in Britain by 2040. It says it will help farmers change the way they work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions The Lib Dems want farmers to focus more on restoring nature, with targets for water, air and soil quality. They would introduce a National Food Strategy, to promote healthy, sustainable and affordable food, and cut food waste. Do party leaders have to publish their tax returns?

Will there be checks between GB and NI?,"The claim:Boris Johnson said goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would only be checked if they are expected to be moved onwards into the Republic of Ireland. He told Sky News ""the only checks that there would be, would be if something was coming from GB via Northern Ireland and was going on to the Republic, then there might be checks at the border into Northern Ireland"". Reality Check verdict:Some goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain will have to be checked even if they are staying in Northern Ireland. The Brexit Withdrawal Agreement signed in October means that Northern Ireland will remain part of a ""single regulatory zone"" with the Republic of Ireland, a zone that will apply EU rules. A Treasury documentleaked a few days agosuggested this would mean new checks on goods being traded between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. For example, the EU has particularly strict rules on importing ""products of animal origin"" - that is to say meat, fish and dairy products. Those products must enter the EU through a border inspection post where all shipments are subject to document checks and a high proportion are physically checked. Products of animal origin from Great Britain entering Northern Ireland would be subject to these checks whether they are destined to remain there or be moved to the Republic of Ireland. The island of Ireland is already a single regulatory zone for animal health. This means that all livestock entering Northern Ireland from GB is currently checked at the point of entry. What is in Boris Johnson's new deal with the EU? Johnson insists no NI-GB goods checks post-Brexit A few countries, such as New Zealand, have a deal with the EU where only 1% of consignments of meat and dairy product are checked. It is possible that the UK could negotiate a similar deal but it would not be able to get rid of checks entirely unless the whole of the UK was going to stay in the single market. The current political declaration, which sets out the broad shape of the future EU-UK relationship, suggests that is unlikely . What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

John Pienaar: A matter of mistrust?,"Are pork pies more common than humble pie in modern politics? Do party leaders and politicians - British ones, mind you, not just dodgy foreigners - ever lie? Well, you could perhaps duck the question and argue that our political leaders sometimes distort the truth. Or you could say they like to present only a useful portion of the whole picture. And you'd be right about that. But do they lie? Is the Queen's Speech required viewing in the Corbyn household? This week, if you even try to argue politicians never lie, you'd have to accept that Jeremy Corbyn, a dedicated, life-long republican, sits in front of the TV at home on 25 December and dutifully watches Her Majesty's Christmas message. Then you'd have to believe his loyal colleague Angela Rayner was right to say her boss maybe watched the Queen's Message on catch-up TV on Boxing Day. That was to explain Mr Corbyn's apparent claim that he somehow watched in the morning, hours before it's broadcast. What did the PM hear in Hertfordshire? Then, you'd need to accept Boris Johnson's word that, at the Nato summit in Hertfordshire on Friday, he had somehow never heard a word of his fellow national leaders huddling together in Buckingham Palace the previous evening, mocking US President Donald Trump. He was captured on camera standing with them at the time, and joining in the joke. I could go on. But I won't, because you'd arguably be asking the wrong question. Mr Johnson's critics coyly accuse him of maintaining a ""casual relationship with the truth"". But in fact it's fairer to say our politicians often have a transactional relationship with the truth. In different ways, they constantly trade-off their duty of service to honesty against their personal and political advantage and disadvantage. Sometimes it's a fine judgement. When it comes to such things as Mr Corbyn's viewing habits on Christmas Day, or whether Mr Johnson should have freely admitted gently mocking Donald Trump to the world's media at an international summit, how much do we really blame them? How high are Jo Swinson's hopes as the campaign comes to a close? If we're being honest, that is. So, maybe the real question this week is: has the line between truth and untruth been consciously blurred to the point that whatever may be left of any trust between people and politics is now in jeopardy? The answer to that, it's fair to argue this week, could be yes. If watching TV on Christmas Day or ducking a potentially embarrassing question about Mr Trump are forgivable, or a least understandable, the prime minister was taking a risk again on Sunday when he insisted in his Sky News interview with Sophy Ridge that there would be no border checks between Britain and the island of Ireland under his Brexit deal. Experts and his own fellow ministers admit that there'd have to be checks to comply with EU and international law, to guard against smuggling of endangered species, say, or unlawful trade with sanctioned regimes. They can't all be right. If Mr Johnson ends up back in office, and requiring the support of the Democratic Unionist Party to stay there, he'll have to confront the truth of this question and it won't be a comfortable moment. Mr Corbyn and his party's claim that Labour will tax only the richest 5% of society to pay for their expensive promises could also lead to a reckoning. The Institute for Fiscal Studies judges that the claim is implausible. John Swinney said Trident was a ""red line"" for the SNP All of this could perhaps be discounted were it not for the fact that the relationship between people and politics is already close to breaking point. A Kantar poll this week found around half (48%) of those intending to vote Conservative on Thursday felt the Tories were ""the best of a bad bunch"". About the same proportion (49%) said the same of Labour. The parties are running out of rope. To be fair, the Liberal Democrats' early campaign claim to be running to install Jo Swinson in Downing Street can't really be described as a lie. Just faintly absurd. She now says her aim is to make ""real progress"". In theory, the Lib Dems could gain only a small handful of seats on Thursday, even lose a couple, and still be very influential in a hung Parliament. And for the SNP, Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinneytold me on Pienaar's Politics on BBC 5 livethat his party's demand for unilateral nuclear disarmament and the removal of the Trident nuclear submarine base at Faslane would be a ""red line"" in negotiations with Labour, if Mr Corbyn ends up casting around for support. If it happens, that would be an interesting negotiation. Trace the leaders' travel map this week and Mr Johnson moved away from the North and towards the South-East and East for the first time. His poll ratings look reasonably good, but five of his six visits this week were to Conservative-held seats. Ms Swinson went to her first Lib Dem seat in Edinburgh West. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon visited her first Labour seat at Midlothian. Is there a subtext here? Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn prioritised visual impact over parliamentary maths. He spoke of big tech, for example, at an Amazon depot, and he talked about inequality in front of a statue of Robin Hood. Subtlety has its place. Just not on an election campaign.

Parties clash in 'Everything but Brexit' TV debate,"Representatives from Labour, the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have taken part in a TV debate The Tories and Brexit Party both declined to join Channel 4's 'Britain Decides: The Everything But Brexit Debate' Politicians have been making their final pitches to voters on the morning's political programmes Boris Johnson insisted there would be no checks on goods going between NI and GB under his deal John McDonnell said he worried that the anti-Semitism row may cost Labour votes on Thursday Nigel Farage said the Brexit Party will change its name to the Reform Party after the UK leaves the EU On the campaign trail, the Conservatives are today focusing on their ""Australian points-based system"" Labour are setting more detail on their plans for social care, including a National Care Service And the Liberal Democrats are talking about investment in infrastructure projects outside London Dulcie Lee, Francesca Gillett and Sam Tonkin It was a rather quiet Sunday considering there are only four days to go before the election. The parties were on their respective campaign trails and leaders made their final pitches to the morning's political shows andtonight's Channel 4 debate. Here are the main moments from earlier:  Join us tomorrow for more news from the campaign trail. Boris Johnson will visit four Brexit-voting Labour-held seats across Humber and north-east England on Monday, with three days to go before polling day. In a speech in Sunderland - 61% of which voted to Leave - the PM is expected to tell voters: ""The Labour party has let you down."" Read more here John McDonnell will promise to deliver a Budget to ""end austerity"", in a speech setting out Labour's priorities for its first 100 days in government. The shadow chancellor will also vow to get ""money moving out of Whitehall and the City"" if Labour win the election. Read more here:Labour vows Budget 'to end austerity' in first 100 days Tomorrow's newspaper front pages have come in and many lead with election stories. ""Corbyn will betray Brexit, says Johnson as he takes fight to Labour's heartlands,"" says the front page of the Daily Telegraph. The Financial Times doesn't lead on a domestic story, but its lead picture is from Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid's call centre session at party headquarters this morning. ""Johnson outlines plans for points-based immigration,"" says its headline. ""PM blasts Labour Brexit betrayal,"" is the lead headline of Monday's Daily Mail. ""Corbyn in last-dich drive to focus on voters' finances,"" says the Guardian. ""Johnson to blitz seats in Labour heartlands,"" says the Times. ""Boris: The last chance to save Brexit and Britain,"" reads the splash on the Daily Express. A Jeremy Corbyn government would be a ""nightmare,"" says the Sun. ""Desperate,"" says the Daily Mirror which reports a four-year-old boy was treated on the floor of an NHS hospital. The i paper says the extent of rising NHS waiting times has been covered up with the use of misleading data. The debate took place at the Queen's Film Theatre in Belfast on Sunday evening The five main Stormont parties have clashed over Brexit, healthcare and the collapse of the assembly in the UTV election debate. Some 18 Westminster seats in Northern Ireland are at stake next week. Giving her verdict on the debate, our Northern Ireland political reporter Jayne McCormack says: ""No-one landed any major blows, but the tone in this debate was more aggressive than what we've witnessed for most of the campaign."" Read the story in full here. During an election campaign, politicians of all stripes are keen to get their faces in as many places as possible - and today was no exception. They may not quite matchOscar selfie standards, but here's what today's leaders had to offer: Boris Johnson snapped a photo with his cabinet colleagues during a campaigning session at the Conservative Party's headquarters in London. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson stopped for a snap as she took to the streets in Sheffield for a canvassing session. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn posed with supporters at a party rally in Colwyn Bay, north Wales. James Cleverly says an investigation into prejudice in his party will get under way before the end of the year. Philippa Whitford, who is the SNP's health spokesperson in Westminster, says the problem with children living in poverty is that ""it will affect their entire lives"". Allow Twitter content?

Tonight's 90-minute debate on everything other than Brexit has finished, with five of the main parties taking part. Here are some of the things we learnt: Addressing the question of trust, which was put to each of the candidates, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""Back in 2010, we got this fundamentally wrong on tuition fees."" Presenter Cathy Newman interjects to say the Lib Dems broke a promise. ""We did,"" Ms Swinson says. ""We absolutely got it wrong."" ""I remember the feeling that I had when I sat in the meeting and it became clear to me what was going to happen,"" she says, adding she felt ""nauseous"". ""I vowed that never again was I going to be in that situation without speaking out."" The Lib Dem leader says she's learned she needs to be ""really clear that what I say is what I can do"". Channel 4 Cathy Newman cites a poll commissioned by Channel 4 which found just 10% of people surveyed felt politicians had been honest and trustworthy during the election campaign. Questions from the audience centre on the trustworthiness of politicians. The SNP's Philippa Whitford says she thinks it is ""a shame we don't have a representative from the Conservatives"". ""You need to look back at people who you elected last time or in 2010. Did they deliver what they said then? ""The Conservatives said that they would deliver 5,000 extra GPs but actually there's fewer."" Asked when was the last time that she lied, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""I have been known to be less than frank with my son about how many chocolate biscuits are left, it has to be said."" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson comes under fire from her counterparts as she talks about poverty and hunger. She says there's still ""much more money"" that needs to go intouniversal credit - the major (and heavily criticised) welfare reform launched in 2010. And she tells a story about her child's school, which has started handing out bagels before classes begin in the morning to ensure no child starts the day hungry. The Lib Dems don't want to scrap universal credit - but Ms Swinson says she wants to see the policy of limiting welfare benefits to two children scrapped - something she describes as ""one of those cruellest measures"". Labour's Angela Rayner then interrupts her to say: ""You can't go here saying 'this is terrible, this is terrible', you voted for austerity, you created the bedroom tax."" (If you need a reminder, the so-called bedroom tax, introduced during the coalition government, sees working-age families in council or housing association homes docked housing benefit if they are deemed to have more bedrooms than they need). Angela Rayner says Ms Swinson ""voted for austerity"" ""They don't want a bagel, they want a decent job so they can feed their own children!"" Ms Rayner says. ""They do, they do,"" Ms Swinson replies, adding that she's been ""very honest"" about the ""things we've got wrong"" in coalition. ""I'm absolutely sorry about the bedroom tax,"" she says. The SNP's Philippa Whitford joins in, saying ""wrong"" is wearing clothes that don't match and she says ""destroyed"" lives is ""a bit more than wrong"". Ms Swinson responds saying the Conservatives have showed ""many"" of their true colours after the coalition ended, adding she's sorry she didn't ""win all the battles"" when she was in government. We're back after another break (with some light relief with a trailer for the film Cats) and the next question for the five parties is on social care. A doctor from Bradford asks: ""We have an ageing population, do you think it is fair some people will have to sell their houses to pay for social care? ""We want a system where the funds can be there,"" says Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. ""At the moment it is far too stretched. ""We need to have a mature debate across the country about how we are going to fund this. ""But we need to be able to do that on a cross-party basis, because this is a long-term issue."" Would she join Boris Johnson's cross-party social care talks? ""Absolutely,"" says Ms Swinson. Angela Rayner responds: ""I'm kind of hoping we'll be the one in government doing those discussions."" She adds that the discussion about social care is ""not just an economic argument"". She says ""it's about what type of country"" we want to be. ""When my nan was dying of cancer she said if I was a dog, you'd put me down,"" Ms Rayner adds. ""No old person should feel that way."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price wants social care to be funded in the same way as the NHS, by taxation. He asks Ms Rayner: ""Will you commit to free social personal care in Wales?"" She replies that Wales would have the funding to do that. The SNP's Philippa Whitford, who spent years working as a breast cancer surgeon on the NHS, says: ""You can't sort the problems in the NHS unless you're sorting the problems in social care."" She says: ""Free personal care is something that is cost-effective in the picture of the whole of the NHS. ""But it's also about the dignity of citizens."" Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party is pledging free personal care for the over 65s. But he says there is a wider discussion which will require some ""bold"" political decisions. ""We have got to talk about wealth and how we get that wealth back from the rampant inequality,"" he says. Reality Check The Channel 4 debate has been addressing a question on sentencing and prison numbers. The prison population in England and Wales is around 83,000, which is around 8,000 above the prisons service's own overcrowding limits. Channel 4 Another short break and the next question facing the party representatives is: ""Should we be taxing the top 5% earners more?"" The audience member might be referring to Labour's policy of raising income taxes for people earning over Â£80,000(you're in the top 5% of income taxpayers if your salary is Â£81,000 and above). ""Well you won't be shocked from me to say, yes,"" says Labour's Angela Rayner. She says she believes the country ""won't mind paying a little bit more"" if it means helping others such as the four million children living in poverty. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and Angela Rayner go on to clash over whether their parties have costed some of their plans. ""You're making a plan for policies that if you get into government you cannot deliver,"" says Ms Swinson, while Ms Rayner says the Lib Dems' plan for free child care is not costed. Meanwhile, Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party would save money by - among other policies - not renewing Trident nuclear deterrent, or through fossil fuel subsidies. ""If the climate were a bank, we would have bailed it out by now,"" he adds. Reality Check Angela Rayner says there are ""four million children living in poverty in our country"". There's no single measure of poverty but it's true to say there are around four million children living in low-income households, and it has increased slightly in the last few years. The question of how to tackle climate change is up next. The Greens'Jonathan Bartleysays he wants to see a carbon tax and wants the UK to be carbon-free by 2030. He says he was ""astonished"" how the topic didn't come up in the BBC's head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson last week. ""There seems to be a lot of rhetoric but not much substance,"" he says. Labour'sAngela Raynerpoints out that Friends of the Earth ranked her party's manifesto as the greenest. But Mr Bartley quickly intervenes to say Greenpeace gave his Green Party the highest score. ""No, we're ambitious Jonathan, come on side,"" Ms Rayner shoots back. The Lib Dem'sJo Swinsonsays it's false to present tackling environmental problems as expensive. ""Actually saving the planet needn't cost the earth,"" she says. ""It really can be a win-win for us to tackle this climate emergency."" She gives the example of how tackling air pollution can save money as it reduces health problems. Plaid Cymru'sAdam Priceis quizzed about a potential tax on meat and the impact that might have on Welsh beef. ""Farmers shouldn't be demonised here, farmers care deeply about the environment,"" he says. ""They can make a positive contribution to decarbonisation."" But he says the issue of climate change is ""bigger than party politics"". ""We agree with that!"" says the Greens' Mr Bartley. Reality Check Privatisation and the NHS and the amount of money that goes to private providers have been raised in the Channel 4 debate. Out of a budget of more than Â£120bn a year, 7.3% was spent on private providers in England in 2017-18, according to government accounts. That's up from 5.3% in 2011-12. Reality Check Asked about nurses, Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the government cut the nursing bursary"". Nursing bursaries were cut in England. There's been a fall in people accepting places on courses since 2016. They've gone up in Scotland and Wales where the bursary remains. Channel 4 Everyone's had a quick break while the adverts have been on, but now we're back with host Cathy Newman who is asking the audience what they want to hear. The next question is on the subject of crime. Should convicted terrorists serve the whole of their sentence without the chance of early release? Plaid Cymru's Adam Price answers first, saying ""public protection needs to be at the heart of the policy"". But he adds that, in the most recent case at London Bridge, the lessons will only be known once there has been an investigation into what happened. ""So I think it's important not to rush to judgement in terms of that specific case."" Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the most important thing is that the public are kept safe"". She says prisons are ""overstuffed"" and ""lots of people re-offend on petty crime doing time for that"". She gets a brief clap after saying that if convicted terrorists need to spend 10 or 20 years in prison ""they should do that"" - but adds that rehabilitation must be part of the justice system. Ms Rayner says that when people are allowed out, then ""they have to be watched and monitored"". Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says there must be a proper assessment ""before anyone is released"". ""One of those grieving parents, David Merritt, he has called on politicians not to politicise his son's death,"" says Ms Swinson. Ms Rayner interjects: ""That's why I didn't mention that."" Ms Swinson says she is angry at Boris Johnson for ignoring Mr Merritt's request. Â© 2025 BBC.
