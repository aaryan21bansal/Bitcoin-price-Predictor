Ashleigh Barty wins Australian Open,"Ashleigh Barty was presented with the Australian Open trophy by her idol Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who won the title four times between 1974 and 1977 Australian Open 2022 Dates:17-30 JanuaryVenue:Melbourne Park Coverage:Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries online; TV highlights from middle Saturday. Ashleigh Barty beat Danielle Collins to win the Australian Open title, ending the home nation's 44-year wait for a Grand Slam women's singles champion. Top seed Barty fought back from 5-1 down in the second set to win 6-3 7-6 (7-2) on a jubilant Rod Laver Arena. The 25-year-old Queenslander has won the title without dropping a set in Melbourne this fortnight. ""This is a dream come true for me. I am so proud of being Aussie,"" said world number one Barty. ""As an Aussie, the most important part of this tournament has been being able to share this experience with the fans. ""This crowd is one of the most fun I've played in front of."" Addressing the crowd, she added: ""You relaxed me and forced me to play my best tennis. Thank you."" After winning the 2019 French Open and last year's Wimbledon title, Barty has now claimed three of the four majors.

In between, there were anxious moments as Collins, troubling Barty with her powerful returning, earned a double break in the second set. But Barty had dropped only 21 games on her way to the final and, although the second set looked to have got away from her, she regained her composure brilliantly to turn the match back in her favour. Among those watching was Chris O'Neil, the last Australian to win the men's or women's singles title in Melbourne. Barty, rarely overcome by emotion, shouted with delight when she clinched the title with a cross-court forehand winner. Virtually everyone inside Rod Laver Arena jumped to their feet, roaring their approval, many with camera phones in hand to capture a long-awaited moment for the nation's sports fans. The world number one's relief was clear. Barty clenched both fists as she dropped to her haunches, before running over to the side where she beckoned former doubles partner Casey Dellacqua, now a television analyst, on to court for a warm hug. After reaching the Melbourne semi-finals in 2020, with quarter-final defeats coming in the years either side, Barty finally landed the prize she really wanted. Victory continued her supreme form in 2022, and she has now won all 11 of her singles matches this year. After beating three top-20 players to win the Adelaide International title, she has continued that dominance in Melbourne. Barty, who took a break from tennis in 2014 to pursue a professional cricket career, has often paid tribute to Dellacqua's influence on her success and the kiss on her friend's forehead indicated her gratitude. There was another special moment for Barty - and the home fans - when the player's idol, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, came on to court to present her with the Daphne Akhurst trophy. Since O'Neil's triumph in 1978, four players - Kim Warwick, Wendy Turnbull, Pat Cash and Lleyton Hewitt - had lost in the men's or women's singles final. There had been home success in the wheelchair and quad events, through David Hall and Dylan Alcott, and in the doubles events. Danielle Collins will move into the world's top 10 after reaching the Melbourne final In her first Grand Slam final, American 27th seed Collins was aiming to spoil the Barty party. Few, at least outside Australia, would have begrudged her claiming a major title after a difficult journey of her own. In April, she said she was taking an indefinite break from tennis as she prepared to have surgery for endometriosis. Collins returned to action two months later and, after surgery and helped by medication, says she is now having less painful periods and is able to train more consistently. That resulted in a brilliant run in Melbourne, where she demonstrated her incredible power and will-to-win. Against Barty, Collins looked to settle quickly and exploit any nerves the home favourite might be feeling. The first break point of the match came the American's way at 2-2 when Barty hit a loose forehand long, only for the Australian to save it with a gutsy forehand on to the line. After holding with an ace, Barty settled down and was helped into a 4-2 lead when Collins threw in an double fault on break point. Barty sealed the set to the sound of a rapturous crowd and, having only dropped serve once in the entire tournament, looked in a commanding position. Collins, however, broke for a 2-0 lead in the second, leading to a passionate celebration from the American. A double hand fist-pump squat perfectly illustrated her combative and competitive on-court personality. The crowd started getting edgy as Collins moved 5-1 ahead and she was two points away from levelling the match at 5-3 30-0. But Barty produced two forehand winners to unsettle her opponent and that sparked the fight-back that ended in Australian sporting immortality. Allow Twitter content?

PM mulls bigger troop offer amid Ukraine crisis,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson was briefed on his options by Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin last Wednesday The UK is considering offering to double its number of troops deployed in Eastern Europe, as ministers weigh up options to increase pressure on Russia amid heightened tensions over Ukraine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the possible deployment would send a ""clear message to the Kremlin"". The defence and foreign secretaries are preparing to meet their counterparts in Moscow to encourage de-escalation. Mr Johnson will phone Russian President Vladimir Putin in the coming days. Why is the UK worried about Ukraine? The prime minister, who will also visit Eastern Europe this week, said the UK would not tolerate Russian ""destabilising activity, and we will always stand with our Nato allies"". He added: ""If President Putin chooses a path of bloodshed and destruction, it will be a tragedy for Europe. Ukraine must be free to choose its own future. ""I have ordered our armed forces to prepare to deploy across Europe next week, ensuring we are able to support our Nato allies on land, at sea and in the air."" Russia has placed about 100,000 troops, tanks, artillery and missiles near Ukraine's border, but denies it plans to invade the former Soviet republic, which borders both Russia and the EU. The UK has more than 900 military personnel based in Estonia, more than 100 in Ukraine as part of a training mission, while a light cavalry squadron numbering about 150 is deployed to Poland. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? What is Nato and why doesn't Russia trust it? Ukraine: How big is Russia's military build-up? The Foreign Office is expected announce tougher sanctions against Russia's strategic and financial interests in Parliament on Monday. Meanwhile, UK officials will be sent to Brussels to finalise the details of the latest UK offer as ministers discuss military options. In addition to bolstering troop numbers, No 10 said this could involve sending defensive weapons to Estonia. Fast jets, warships and military specialists could also be sent to protect the UK's Nato allies. Ukraine is not part of Nato and Russia wants the West to promise it will never join the military alliance, seeing it as a direct threat to its security. Nato's 30 members include the US, UK, and Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia - former Soviet republics that border Russia. Members agree to come to another's aid in the event of an armed attack. Last month, Russia made three demands of Nato: Ukraine should be barred from joining; it should end military activity in eastern Europe; and should not deploy missiles in countries near or bordering Russia. The UK already has more than 100 troops providing training in Ukraine as part of Operation Orbital. Orbital has trained 22,000 Ukrainian troops since 2015, and more military trainers were sent to the country earlier this month to support the training of Ukrainian forces to use 2000 missiles sent from the UK. Mr Johnson has also asked defence and security chiefs to consider further defensive military options in Europe during a high-level intelligence briefing on the situation last week. Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin will brief Cabinet on the situation on Tuesday. A second trip for the prime minister to meet Nato member counterparts is also being planned for early next month, No 10 said.

Johnson and Sunak confirm National Insurance rise,"A planned Â£12bn rise in National Insurance from April is ""the right plan"" and ""must go ahead"", Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have said. Inan article in the Sunday Times,external, the PM and chancellor said the rise - which applies to employees and employers - will help clear the NHS backlog. Despite opposition, including from some Tory MPs, they say it is ""progressive"" because higher earners pay more. With inflation rising sharply, there had been calls to scrap the tax rise. What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? Why are prices rising so quickly? NI rise to squeeze budgets and risk growth - CBI Under the plans, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April 2022 for a year. After that, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. The changes to National Insurance will see an employee on Â£20,000 a year pay an extra Â£89 in tax. Someone on Â£50,000 will pay Â£464 more. From April, people earning under Â£9,880 a year, or Â£823 a month, will not have to pay National Insurance and will not have to pay the new levy. Critics have said the increase will have a higher impact on the lower-paid and could contribute to inflation when household budgets are under pressure from rising energy prices and food bills. And business leaders have warned that firms could offset the tax rise by raising prices. Inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - is already at a 30-year high,reaching 5.4% this month. Shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy called on the government to ""rethink"" the planned rise, adding Labour would be ""doing everything that we can over the next few weeks to try and appeal to Tory MPs' consciences"". She told BBC One's Sunday Morning programme: ""You can't possibly hit people with more taxes at the moment. It's just simply not possible for a lot of people to survive."" Robert Halfon, one of the Tory MPs calling on the government not to go ahead with the rise, said ministers should make the cost of living their ""number one priority"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he suggested money for the NHS could instead be raised from thetaxes on capital gains- profits made from selling certain assets - or by raising taxes on oil companies. Senior backbench Tories Robert Jenrick and Mel Stride have also called for the increase to be delayed, with Mr Jenrick saying that 2022 would already be ""exceptionally hard"" for families. The government has said the changes, announced at last year's Budget, are expected to raise Â£12bn a year, which will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS. A proportion will then be moved into social care system over the next three years as the Covid backlog subsides. The National Insurance rise wasapproved by the Commons in September, with the Health and Social Care Levy written into law in a separate vote. Despite confirming the tax rise, Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak described themselves in the Sunday Times as ""tax-cutting Conservatives"" and ""Thatcherites"". They added: ""We believe passionately that people are the best judges of how to spend their own money. ""We want to get through this Covid-driven phase, and get on with our agenda, of taking advantage of our new post-Brexit freedoms to turn the UK into the enterprise centre of Europe and the world. ""We want lighter, better, simpler regulation, especially in those new technologies in which the UK excels. We are also Thatcherites, in the sense that we believe in sound money. ""There is no magic money tree."" The article will be seen as a show of unity between the pair, after widespread criticism of Mr Johnson over claims of parties in Downing Street during lockdown. Mr Sunak is a leading candidate to replace Mr Johnson if a leadership contest is triggered before the next election. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is also seen as a possible leadership candidate, defended the tax rises but accepted they are ""never popular"". Also speaking to the Sunday Morning programme, she said the country was in a ""very difficult situation"" because of money spent supporting the economy during Covid. ""As soon as possible, we want to be in a position to lower our tax rates, we want to drive economic growth, because ultimately that is what will make our country successful,"" she added. Meanwhile, the government confirmed on Friday that the earnings threshold at which graduates in England start repaying student loans would be frozen in April. The freeze, which would see a graduate earning Â£30,000 repay Â£113 more a year than expected, has beendescribed as a ""stealth"" tax rise for those affected.

What will the tax rises cost me?,"The government's reversal of the 1.25p in the pound rise in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect. It means many people will keep more of their pay. NI went up by 1.25p in the pound in April and went back to its previous level on 6 November. For employees under pension age who earn less than Â£12,570 a year, the move will make no difference - because they don't pay NI. Above that income level, the amount saved increases as earnings do. So higher earners stand to benefit more than people on lower incomes - although higher earners will still contribute more tax overall. The majority of businesses will also see a reduction in their NI bills. Each business will save an average of Â£9,600 each in 2023-24,according to the government,external. National Insurance rise to be reversed in November NI is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed: employees pay NI on their wages as well as income tax employers pay extra NI contributions for staff the self-employed pay NI on their profits NI contributes to the cost of benefits and the state pension. However, the government can borrow from the NI fund to help pay for other projects. NI raises a lot of money: Â£158bn last yearaccording to HMRC,external. Whether you receive the full state pensiondepends on your NI record,external. Why do we pay National Insurance? Since 6 April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound. The increase was part of the government's plan to fund the NHS and social care. It took the rate of NI to 13.25%. That meant the government went back on its 2019 election manifesto promise not to raise the tax. The NI increase was due to be replaced by a new Health and Social Care Levy - at a rate of 1.25% - in April 2023. But the government has now scrapped these plans, putting the NI rate back to 12%. That rate is paid by employees earning between Â£12,570 a year and just over Â£50,000 a year. Above that level, the rate has gone back down from 3.25% to 2.0%. The 1.25 percentage point increase in NI was supposed to raise Â£12bn a year. The government said the extra money would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS. Some would then be moved into the social care system. This mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The government has said that funding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as if the levy was in place. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. A proportion of the NI increase was supposed to fund the social care system. The social care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the effects of the pandemic. At the same time, it has also been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending. The government wants to ensure that people in England pay no more than Â£86,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food). People with assets - such as a home, savings or investments - worth less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay for care out of those assets, but may still have to contribute from their income. Those with assets worth between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 may have their care costs subsidised. What could care changes cost you and your family? Social care: Nine challenges facing the system NI is a UK-wide tax. Although the government decided to increase it in order to fund health and social care in England, the tax increase was also expected to raise extra money that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could have chosen to spend on those services.

Why are prices rising so quickly?,"Prices in the UK went up by 2.6% in the 12 months to November, the highest level for eight months. It means inflation has been above the Bank of England's target for two months in a row. The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and cut twice in 2024, taking rates to 4.75%. Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 but is Â£1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This virtual ""basket of goods"" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, withvinyl records and air fryersadded in 2024, and hand sanitiser removed. The ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation. The main inflation measure is called theConsumer Prices Index (CPI),external, and the latest figure is published every month. CPIrose by 2.6% in the year to November 2024, up from 2.3% in the 12 months to October. The November figure is the highest rate since March 2024. This was largely as a result of increased fuel and clothing prices. Inflation has fallen significantly since it hit 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years. However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly. Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine. It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of high food prices. Some parts of the economy, like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers - are still seeing significant price rises. UK inflation rise - what does it mean for me? When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high. The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more. In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises. But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy. For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals. Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment. The Bank of England cut rates twice in 2024 - to 5% in August, and againto 4.75% in November. As expected,it held rates at 4.75% at its December meeting. The Bank also considersother measures,external, such as ""core inflation"" when deciding whether and how to change rates. Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. The measure was 3.5% in November, up from 3.3% in the year to October. In October, the Bank governor Andrew Bailey said itcould be a ""bit more aggressive"" at cutting borrowing costs, if inflation remained under control. However, after the Budget at the end of that month, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained -includingan increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers- would lift inflation slightly as businesses passed on their increased costs through higher prices. Announcing the November rate decision, Mr Baileysaid the path for rates would likely be ""downward from here"" but warned cuts would be gradual. After the December meeting, he said ""a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right"", but added ""with the heightened uncertainty in the economy, we can't commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year."" The next interest rate decision will be on Thursday 6 February. Will UK interest rate cut make my mortgage cheaper?

Gay veteran's flashbacks over 'sadistic' treatment,"Simon Hinchley-Robson was discharged from RAF Brawdy in Pembrokeshire in 1986 when it was still illegal to be LGBT in the armed forces A gay veteran said being starved, denied sleep and subjected to ""sadistic"" internal examinations on an RAF station has left him with flashbacks and depression 35 years on. Simon Hinchley-Robson was discharged from RAF Brawdy in Pembrokeshire in 1986 after requesting an Aids test. However, Capt Hannah Graf said she had a positive experience of coming out as transgender while in the Army in 2013. The Ministry of Defence said it was important to learn from LGBT veterans. Areview is under wayinto the impact of a law that made it illegal to be gay in the British military until 2000. The rule is thought to have affected about 5,000 people. LGBT veterans to share impact of military ban in review, 20 years on LGBT military ban: Ex RAF navigator speaks of trauma Veterans 'need more help for civilian life Mr Hinchley-Robson, from Blackheath, London, was working as a chef at the former RAF satellite station when he became unwell and was diagnosed with glandular fever. Simon Hinchley-Robson, left, with his husband Dave After seeing theinfamous Aids campaign TV advertsfeaturing crashing headstones, he decided to ask his doctor for an Aids test. He said what followed led him to live with depression, anxiety and flashbacks more than 35 years later. ""This doctor went absolutely ballistic - he called me from a pig to a dog,"" he said. He said he was immediately transferred to a civilian hospital where he remained for 10 days before being returned to RAF Brawdy where he was arrested by a station warrant officer at the gates. He was informed he had admitted being gay by asking for an Aids test. The next four days were spent being interrogated while being denied food and sleep, being hit, laughed at and subjected to an internal examination every four to five hours, he said. Simon Hinchley-Robson says he was told he was a disgrace to the air force ""It was awful,"" he said. ""They left me in such a state that I was physically bleeding. They did it for sadistic gratification, it was for nothing else."" He said despite threats of an 18-months prison sentence he was eventually discharged, with the station warrant officer publicly ripping his rank off his uniform and telling him he was a disgrace to the air force. He was left with no home, no job and had no choice but to reveal his sexuality to his family. Now he wants answers from the review: ""I want to know who authorised it, why did they authorise it and for them to stand up and say 'we were wrong, I'm sorry'."" He claimed he also knew of four or five men serving in the RAF at the same time as him who killed themselves after being outed as LGBT and said he wanted justice for their families. ""They need to contact their families and say 'we were wrong and here's your son's pension, here's your daughter's pension',"" he said. He wants his pension reinstated, to be allowed to wear his uniform at the cenotaph, a full apology and admission of wrongdoing: ""I want them to stand up and say 'we're wrong, we're sorry and we will make it right'."" Capt Hannah Graf says she was lucky others in the military had transitioned before her In 2013, Capt Hannah Graf, from Cardiff, came out as a transgender woman, becoming one of the highest ranking transgender soldiers in the Army. ""I was expecting to lose the respect of my peers, people l commanded, my senior officers,"" she said. ""I really thought my career was going to take a huge downturn, but luckily for me there were people before me who had transitioned and paved some that groundwork for me and I think the Army in that time was certainly much more open and willing to accept people for who they were and so we went on this journey of acceptance and actually the whole thing was very positive for me."" She said there were ""a lot of jokes [but] I'd say that with the vast majority, I was in on it"". Capt Graf came out as transgender 13 years after the ban on LGBT personnel had been revoked ""The Army has a lot of banter and it does fall into that thing of lad culture, but generally speaking I found it quite inclusive humour and actually I find that humour is a great way to break down some of the barriers."" She said she became ""talk of the town for a little while"" but most of the comments were well-intentioned. ""There were people who didn't quite know how to talk to a transgender woman because they've never been put in that situation before,"" she said. ""It wasn't that they were bigoted or had anything against me personally, but it was just a situation they haven't come across. ""I judge people on their intent, rather than their actual actions, as long as they learn from it."" In 2019, Capt Graf was made a Member of the British Empire (MBE) for services to the LGBT+ community in the military She is aware that many LGBT personnel who were outed before the ban was revoked had a completely different experience. ""It's nothing short of horrific,"" she said. ""It wasn't just that it was illegal, it was the fact that there were parts of the Army whose job was to find these people and kick them out, it was very targeted and I think it's so sad."" Capt Graf has left the Army and is married with a child ""It is heart-breaking to think of the personal cost for those people who did nothing other than try and serve their country."" She is keen the review puts LGBT veterans ""in the front and centre and think 'what damage did we cause them and what compensation are we able to give them'?"" ""Apologies are certainly a very important thing but that may not be everything."" Charity Fighting With Pride wants the review to go further than reparations to pensions and compensation Navy veteran Craig Jones from Brighton said the ban was an ""unremedied national disgrace"", which had led to decades of shame, loneliness, and financial strife for many. He said as a gay man he spent many years ""looking over my shoulder, waiting for the day that the militia police might catch me - thankfully they didn't"". He is joint chief executive of Fighting With Pride along with Flt Lt Caroline Paige, who was the first transgender officer to serve openly in the UK armed forces. Craig Jones says he spent years looking over his shoulder while in the Royal Navy He said the review must go further than reparations to pensions and compensation. ""An apology on behalf of the nation, letters which makes sure that people understand that they can wear items of uniform like their beret at the cenotaph or they can use their military titlesâ¦ things that will bring them back into the armed forces family,"" he said. Caroline Paige feels lucky to have been able to keep her job after coming out as transgender Caroline Paige joined the RAF in 1980 after growing up on military bases and said she spent her childhood hiding who she was. After training at RAF Valley on Anglesey she rose up the ranks as a navigator on fast jets and battlefield helicopters but was not happy. ""I wasn't living my life, I was hiding it and living to everybody else's expectations and I decided to do something about it,"" she said. After seeking professional help outside of the military she spoke to her medical officer who she said became her first ally. Despite the ban still being in place, a decision was made she could stay in the military. But it was not easy for her: ""There was an awful lot of hostility - people were demanding I get thrown out of the air force, there was no place for somebody like me and I'd be a danger to my friends and danger to colleagues on operations."" She left the air force in 2014 and after getting involved with the charity became determined to help veterans who had not been allowed to stay on. ""I was a lucky person, I got to serve 16 years openly as Caroline but all of those individuals who were outed or discovered as being LGBT+ before the ban was lifted didn't fare so well and nothing had been done to support them."" Fighting With Pride hosts activity weekends in Snowdonia for LGBT veterans She is very keen for LGBT veterans to get in touch so they can share their experiences, be brought ""back into the military family"" and have their service respected. One way the charity is trying to rebuild community for LGBT veterans is through activity breaks in Llanberis in Snowdonia, Gwynedd, where groups of 10 have been meeting up to have fun and share their experiences. The UK's Minister for Defence People and Veterans Leo Docherty said the modern military ""embraces the LGBT community"" but it was important to learn from the experiences of LGBT veterans who were affected by the pre-2000 ban. ""This review will allow the voices of veterans to be heard and importantly will help us better tailor support to the community,"" he said. The UK's Minister for Equalities Mike Freer said: ""This government is committed to righting the wrongs of the past. ""Our armed forces have given us freedom and peace and I am proud to stand alongside every LGBT veteran.""

'Environmental vandalism' claim over Snowdonia path,"Some people living nearby have described the work as ""environmental vandalism"" Resurfacing works on a Snowdonia path have been described as ""environmental vandalism"" by some walkers after parts were gravelled over. Snowdonia National Park said essential repairs were needed to the bridleway from Capel Curig to Crafnant. But some walkers claim the smoother path looks ""alien"" and has destroyed the nature of the area. The national park said once repairs were complete the path would be made to look more natural. Record-breaking numbers of visitors headed to the national park as travel wasrestricted and more people holidayed in the UK during the coronavirus pandemic. Call to respect mountain amid spike in visitors Huge queues at Snowdon's summit The park's head of warden services Adam Daniel said with more walkers using the route and damage caused by climate change, the original path had eroded badly, to the point walkers had widened it significantly by forging their own routes to avoid boggy areas. ""We're tackling those issues to ensure the path is there for users for the future, and to ensure that the habitat either side doesn't get encroached any further,"" he said. But while some hikers have welcomed the firmer path as more accessible, the changes have sparked concerns it will lead to more problems with cyclists being able to move faster on the path shared with walkers and horse riders. Local community councillor Shan Ashton criticised the work Shan Ashton said improving the path with well-placed stone work would be more suitable Capel Curig community councillor, Shan Ashton, who regularly walks the route said while maintenance had to be carried out, it was not suitable. ""They've carved out the land completely, changed the way the earth drains, and the water has begun to gather already,"" she said. Ms Ashton said improving the path with well-placed stone work would be more suitable - and that its ruggedness was part of the area's appeal. ""If you go up to the mountains, you go to the mountains, this isn't a path through the middle of town - it doesn't need a perfect surface, it's going to be wet, muddy and rocky,"" she said. ""We accept that there's a need to maintain the current paths, but there's a way of doing so without spoiling the character of the whole valley."" Nick Livesey said the area could have been improved in a more sensitive way Nick Livesey, who lives nearby, described the work as ""environmental vandalism"". ""The way the path has been done has been really intrusive and alien, and what that's resulted in is the feel of the valley's completely changed, what was once a beautiful little path has now been completely destroyed,"" he said. He added: ""Part of the path sometimes became waterlogged, but some sensitive stone work would have sorted that out rather than bulldozing a couple of kilometres of road through what was a wild-feeling valley and very unspoilt."" However some walkers who were hiking along the remote route told BBC Wales the improvements made it more accessible. Gillian Beeson said it meant people like her can come and enjoy the countryside Pauline Ward said: ""I love walking in the mountains, and this path has been done well, it's easy to walk, there isn't any mud or water - it makes coming out with friends much easier."" Another walker Gillian Beeson said she appreciated a path that was firmer under foot. Mr Daniel said it would have been ""irresponsible"" for the park not to act to safeguard the path for future generations. Adam Daniel said it would have been ""irresponsible"" not to have acted ""We now have more walkers using the path, we're facing challenges with climate change, so there needs to be significant investment in the foundation and the water courses,"" he said. He added  work would be done to make the path look more natural once the work had been completed, as had been done with other nearby paths. The park said it consulted with Capel Curig community council and the highways department of Conwy council before starting the work. But Mr Daniel acknowledged some residents were unaware of the plans until they had begun, and that the park would look to consult more widely on similar projects in the future.

Town celebrates Star Wars links in new exhibition,"The finished Millennium Falcon during filming for The Empire Strikes Back in 1979 The role a Welsh town played in creating Star Wars' spaceship, the Millennium Falcon, is to be made into a permanent exhibition. Luckily, fans of the franchise will only have to venture to Pembrokeshire, rather than a galaxy far, far away. Work to construct a hush-hush life-size model in Pembroke Dock in 1979 actually became the town's""worst kept secret"". Pembroke Dock Heritage Trust has just landed a bounty to share the saga of the town's links with the films. The model was built by workers from an engineering firm in a World War Two aircraft hangar. It was supposed to have taken place under a veil of secrecy, with the construction project given its own code name, The Magic Roundabout. Star Wars-themed funeral for major fan Star Wars figure in rare packaging sells for Â£9,400 Photographer shoots Star Wars Lego in cinematic style ""It was the worst kept secret in Pembroke Dock,"" said Gareth Mills, a trustee from Pembroke Dock Heritage Trust. ""Everybody in the town knew they were building a UFO in the hangar and that period of time and that story is an important part of the town's living memory."" The life-size model was built in Pembroke Dock in 1979 before being shipped to movie studios The giant prop took three months to build before being transported to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, where The Empire Strikes Back was filmed. It was a box office smash around the world when the movie was released in 1980. Star Wars enthusiast Mark Williams, who will oversee the heritage project, said: ""George Lucas set a new standard in both storytelling and filmmaking with Star Wars and the story of the Millennium Falcon being built in Pembroke Dock was big news at the time. ""The whole world knew about it, then the story faded into legend."" Old photographs of the Millennium Falcon construction project will feature in the new exhibition An Â£8,000 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund will go towards creating a permanent display at Pembroke Dock Heritage Centre. It will include a walk-through display with photographs, film, props and costumes, amid plans to widen the exhibition in the future. ""I love that such an iconic, beloved ship was built in the town where my mum was born and in the county where I grew up,"" said Lynwen Brennan, Lucasfilm executive vice-president. ""And I'm hopeful this exhibit will become a new destination for fans around the world."" THE TUCKERS ARE BACK:They might not always be on the right side of the law, but who's telling?

Africa storm shows climate crisis reality - UN,"Storm Ana made tens of thousands homeless across Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique The deadly storm that hit southern African countries this week has shown the reality of the climate crisis, a UN official has said. The death toll from the destruction caused by Storm Ana has risen to 86. Rescue workers are trying to reach tens of thousands who have been cut off as roads and bridges have been washed away in Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi. Authorities are now watching to see if a second storm - Batsirai - will hit the continent next week. In Mozambique, where 18 people have been killed and 120,000 people affected, Maria Luisa Fornara, from the UN children's fund Unicef, described Storm Ana as a ""blunt reminder"" of the impact that climate change is having. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said more investment was needed to ""protect and save lives"". In one neighbourhood of Madagascar's capital, Antananarivo, people are having to use canoes to reach their flooded homes ""I lost my fishing boat, it was swept away by the strong wind,"" Abdul Ibrahim, a fisherman in Mozambique's Nampula province told AFP news agency. ""I have never seen anything like this before. It will be difficult for me to recover."" Seeking temporary shelter in a classroom for her and her two children, Maria Jose told AFP that the first winds had blown away her house. ""I have nothing left, I lost everything."" Some of the infrastructure that had been rebuilt after Cyclone Idai in 2019 has been destroyed again. In Madagascar, which was the first country to be hit on Monday, the death toll now stands at 48 and some 72,000 are reported to have lost their homes. ""I am very sad because we work like crazy to make money and now our house is destroyed,"" one woman said surveying the damage that was caused. Many people in Malawi, like elsewhere in the region, are now having to rebuild their destroyed homes Malawi's President, Lazarus Chakwera, declared a state of emergency in the wake of the storm which left 20 people dead in the country. The disaster management agency said families had been forced to carry the dead to burials because roads had been cut off. A resident in the southern town of Chikwawa, described how fellow villagers spent two days holding on to trees as the waters swept through. The weather authorities are keeping a close eye on Tropical Storm Batsirai which has formed in the Indian Ocean and is moving westwards.

Peru tsunami oil spill worse than first thought,"Spanish oil firm Repsol says it is trying to clean the spill up ""a quickly as possible"" An oil spill off the Peruvian coast earlier this month was twice as big as previously reported, according to the country's government. Environment Minister Ruben Ramirez said Friday that almost 12,000 barrels of oil leaked into the sea on 15 January. Officials described the spill as an ""ecological disaster"" to blame for the deaths of local fish and seabirds. It happened when tanker at the La Pampilla refinery was hit by waves linked to a volcanic eruption on Tonga. The site, about 30km (19 miles) north of Lima, is owned by Spanish oil company Repsol. Peru has demanded compensation and prosecutors have opened an investigation into Repsol's role in the incident. A judge granted a request on Friday to bar four executives from the firm leaving the country for 18 months amid the ongoing probe. In a statement to the AFP news agency, Repsol said it would ""fully cooperate with any criminal investigation"" and said it was already aiding in the preliminary stages. ""Our main concern is cleaning up the environment. Repsol is putting all its efforts into cleaning up as quickly as possible,"" the company added. BACKGROUND:Peru oil spill 'an ecological disaster' Repsol said it had calculated the oil spilled to be equivalent to 10,396 barrels, after a revised government estimate that put the number at 11,900 - up from the 6,000 previously reported. In an update on Friday, the environment ministry said a third of the spilled oil has been recovered from the ocean and across 20 beaches. Some local fisherman have staged protests because they are unable to go out to sea and work because of the disaster. Repsol previously blamed the leak on unusual waves triggered by a massive volcanic eruption in Tonga, more than 10,000km away. The Mare Doricum, the Italian-flagged tanker involved in the spill, has also been banned from setting sail. La Pampilla is built just off the town of Ventanilla in the Lima region and is Peru's largest refinery. It provides for more than half of the local fuel market.

About 33,500 have had their power restored but some were facing spending the night without electricity. The worst affected area is the north-east of Scotland, where about 20,000 homes were expected to be without power overnight. Earlier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said engineers were struggling to get access to faults due to a fallen trees blocking roads. A number of welfare centres were opened for people needing showers and power, while hot food trucks were sent to areas most in need. Homes in the Borders and Lothian were also affected. Northern Powergrid, which supplies power to about 3.9m homes in the north east of England and Yorkshire, said 36,000 customers were still without power as result of Storm Malik, predominantly in Northumberland and County Durham areas.

"Concrete Snowdonia path 'is environmental vandalism'Some walkers say works to improve a route are ""alien"", but the national park say they are essential.Wales","Some people living nearby have described the work as ""environmental vandalism"" Resurfacing works on a Snowdonia path have been described as ""environmental vandalism"" by some walkers after parts were gravelled over. Snowdonia National Park said essential repairs were needed to the bridleway from Capel Curig to Crafnant. But some walkers claim the smoother path looks ""alien"" and has destroyed the nature of the area. The national park said once repairs were complete the path would be made to look more natural. Record-breaking numbers of visitors headed to the national park as travel wasrestricted and more people holidayed in the UK during the coronavirus pandemic. Call to respect mountain amid spike in visitors Huge queues at Snowdon's summit The park's head of warden services Adam Daniel said with more walkers using the route and damage caused by climate change, the original path had eroded badly, to the point walkers had widened it significantly by forging their own routes to avoid boggy areas. ""We're tackling those issues to ensure the path is there for users for the future, and to ensure that the habitat either side doesn't get encroached any further,"" he said. But while some hikers have welcomed the firmer path as more accessible, the changes have sparked concerns it will lead to more problems with cyclists being able to move faster on the path shared with walkers and horse riders. Local community councillor Shan Ashton criticised the work Shan Ashton said improving the path with well-placed stone work would be more suitable Capel Curig community councillor, Shan Ashton, who regularly walks the route said while maintenance had to be carried out, it was not suitable. ""They've carved out the land completely, changed the way the earth drains, and the water has begun to gather already,"" she said. Ms Ashton said improving the path with well-placed stone work would be more suitable - and that its ruggedness was part of the area's appeal. ""If you go up to the mountains, you go to the mountains, this isn't a path through the middle of town - it doesn't need a perfect surface, it's going to be wet, muddy and rocky,"" she said. ""We accept that there's a need to maintain the current paths, but there's a way of doing so without spoiling the character of the whole valley."" Nick Livesey said the area could have been improved in a more sensitive way Nick Livesey, who lives nearby, described the work as ""environmental vandalism"". ""The way the path has been done has been really intrusive and alien, and what that's resulted in is the feel of the valley's completely changed, what was once a beautiful little path has now been completely destroyed,"" he said. He added: ""Part of the path sometimes became waterlogged, but some sensitive stone work would have sorted that out rather than bulldozing a couple of kilometres of road through what was a wild-feeling valley and very unspoilt."" However some walkers who were hiking along the remote route told BBC Wales the improvements made it more accessible. Gillian Beeson said it meant people like her can come and enjoy the countryside Pauline Ward said: ""I love walking in the mountains, and this path has been done well, it's easy to walk, there isn't any mud or water - it makes coming out with friends much easier."" Another walker Gillian Beeson said she appreciated a path that was firmer under foot. Mr Daniel said it would have been ""irresponsible"" for the park not to act to safeguard the path for future generations. Adam Daniel said it would have been ""irresponsible"" not to have acted ""We now have more walkers using the path, we're facing challenges with climate change, so there needs to be significant investment in the foundation and the water courses,"" he said. He added  work would be done to make the path look more natural once the work had been completed, as had been done with other nearby paths. The park said it consulted with Capel Curig community council and the highways department of Conwy council before starting the work. But Mr Daniel acknowledged some residents were unaware of the plans until they had begun, and that the park would look to consult more widely on similar projects in the future.

What is Russia's Nato problem?,"US President-elect Donald Trump has called on Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national incomes on defence. That is more than double the military alliance's current target of 2%. Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte has also told member countries to boost military spending as part of a new ""wartime mindset"". Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in Washington DC in 1949 by 12 countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK and the US. Nato was founded in Washington DC in April 1949 Nato'sprimary purpose,externalwas to block expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union - a group of communist republics which included Russia. Members agree thatif one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.,external Nato does not have its own army, but member states can take collective military action in response to crises. For instance, the body supported the UN by intervening in the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2004. It alsoco-ordinates military plans and carries out joint military exercises.,external Nato has 32 members across Europe and North America - the original 12 founders plus 20 countries which have joined since 1949. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries became members, including Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024. Having been neutral for decades,both applied to Nato in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia have also asked to join. Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders. However, in 2008, the alliancesaid that Ukraine could eventually join,external. Former Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine can join in ""the long-term"" After Russia's invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for this process to be fast-tracked. Although then Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg reconfirmed Ukraine could join ""in the long term"", he said this would not happen until after the war ended. Nato currently asks every member country to spend at least 2% of national income - also known as GDP - on defence. It is thought that23 countries met that target in 2024, compared to only three in 2014. The countries which spend the largest share of GDP on defence are the US and those close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic states. In July 2024, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmersaid the UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. In December 2024, Nato secretary general Rutte said that member stateswould have to ""shift to a wartime mindset"" and spend ""considerably more than 2%"" on defence,external. During his first term as US president, Trump persuaded many Nato members to increase defence spending. In 2018 he said thatall countries in the alliance should be committing 4% of GDP. At a press conference at his Florida home in January 2025,Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5%,external, telling reporters: ""They can all afford it."" While campaigning for his second presidential term, Trumpsaid he might encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough, remarks which were strongly condemned by the White House and former Nato chief Stoltenberg. How much do Nato members spend on defence? Nato said Russia's invasion of Ukraine posed the""most significant and direct threat to allies' security"".,external The alliance has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia. However, individual member states have supplied arms and equipment. German research organisationthe Kiel Institute,externalsaid that the US had allocated 59.9bn euros (Â£49.7bn) for military support to Ukraine between February 2022 and October 2024. European Nato members provided 52.6bn euros (Â£43.7bn) over the same period. The US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have sent anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems such as Patriot, artillery guns, tanks and drones. The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles such as Atacms and Storm Shadow/Scalp. Atacms missiles can reach up to 300km (186 miles) and are hard to intercept due to their high speed In August 2024,Ukraine received two US-made F16 fighter jets- the first of more than 60 pledged by Nato member states. Since November 2024,the US and UK have allowed Ukraine to use their missiles to hit targets within Russian territory. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia In January and February 2025, Nato forces will take part in a military  exercise calledSteadfast Dart 25,externalin Bulgaria and Romania, led by a UK army division. Troops will practise how toreinforce the alliance's eastern borders ahead of an enemy attack,external. In 2023, Nato's commanders agreed detailed plans for countering possible Russian attacks anywhere in the Arctic, the North Atlantic, Eastern Europe or the Mediterranean Sea region. It increased the number of troops in Europe on high alert from 40,000 to more than 300,000, and bolstered its defences on Russia's borderswith eight battlegroups,external.

Where are Britain's missing million workers?,"There could be as many as a million missing workers in the UK job market, experts say. Latest figures suggest that the vast majority of livelihoods survived the end of the furlough scheme, designed to protect the economy from the ravages of Covid. Fears of a huge spike in unemployment when the support was withdrawn have failed to materialise. On the contrary: with vacancies at a record high of 1.2 million, many employers are struggling to cope with a shortage of skilled workers. On Thursday, the government announcedplans to get 500,000 jobseekers into jobs by the end of June, with those claiming Universal Credit having to look for jobs outside their chosen field more quickly or face sanctions. Â£150,000 starting salaries as firms fight for staff Pay rises fail to keep up with the cost of living According to the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, Tony Wilson, the problem is that the pandemic has caused the UK labour market to shrink. ""We're seeing unemployment falling, but we're also seeing employment quite a lot lower than it was before the crisis began,"" he told the BBC. Well, since the onset of coronavirus, there has been a big rise in the number of people classed as ""economically inactive"" - that is, people who are not looking for jobs and are not available for work. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reckons that there are 400,000 more people in that category than there were before the virus hit. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, says that total ""increased sharply"" at the beginning of the pandemic, a rise he describes as ""understandable"". ""If you lost your job then, there was little point in looking for one, given the economy was closed,"" he told the BBC. But since then, the number of economically inactive people has proved ""far stickier"" than the number of people out of work, he adds. ""We have not seen falls like we've seen in unemployment, and this is particularly the case for those over 50,"" he said. That, of course, includes some people who have chosen to take early retirement, although others may feel the choice has been made for them. Recent research,externalby the Resolution Foundation think-tank also suggests that fewer young men are now economically active, perhaps due to fear of illness or suffering with long Covid, while more women have taken up roles due to the rise in flexible working. Tony Wilson of the IES says students are also a factor. ""A lot of young people decided to stay in education instead of entering the labour market a year ago,"" he said. ""But actually, more recently it's been growing because of longer-term ill-health"" - a problem that includes people suffering from the after-effects of the virus known as ""long Covid"". ""All told, we think because the labour market was growing pretty consistently over the last few decades, the fact that it's now gone into reverse means that this gap, this half a million gap in employment, is even larger when you account for the growth in the labour market that we were seeing,"" Mr Wilson says. ""We think there's a gap of about a million people between what the labour market would have been like without Covid and where it is now."" Many of the labour shortages in particular sectors have been attributed to a decline in the number of foreign workers in the UK. Because of a combination of Covid and Brexit, many EU nationals who worked in the UK have returned to their countries of origin. Mr Wilson of the IES believes that the lack of migrant workers is responsible for the one-third of the shortfall in the labour market, while the rise in economic inactivity accounts for the other two-thirds. Kate Shoesmith, deputy chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), says the run-up to Christmas was ""a touch-and-go moment"" for many businesses, with Covid and recruitment problems coming together. ""It was a combination of the lowest candidate availability we've ever known and absence rates creeping up,"" she told the BBC. Now Covid sickness rates are settling down, but shortages are still ""a big sticking point"", she says. She singles out healthcare as one of the worst-affected sectors currently, with the NHS and private providers trying to woo a limited pool of skilled workers amid high demand for services. ""Sometimes the NHS will be paying more to retain staff, because the NHS and the private sector are competing on wages,"" she says. Elsewhere in the economy, efforts to address the chronic shortage of lorry drivers have borne fruit, but at the price of attracting people from other sectors, such as fork-lift truck drivers or warehouse workers, she says. ""You have to look at the supply chain as a whole. There's a sense that we're robbing Peter to pay Paul."" And the beleaguered hospitality sector is under renewed pressure to raise wages, while not having had the chance to replenish cash reserves over the festive season because of Plan B Covid restrictions, she adds. Ms Shoesmith says the answer lies in persuading the economically inactive to return to the job market. But doing it properly, she says, will require a joint effort between the public and private sectors. Jobcentres and recruitment agencies ""working hand in hand"" could rebuild the confidence of people who have dropped out of the job market and help them back into work, she adds. ""After the 2007-08 crash, there was a shared sense of purpose, a combined effort,"" Ms Shoesmith says. ""Jobcentres can get people in, while recruiters can offer deep understanding of a sector,"" she says. ""We've done it before and we can do it again.""

The couple and their dog were not injured, though they are now without power. Having heard tragic stories across the region, Natalie, who works in communications, said they feel ""very lucky"".

""We're without power but it will get sorted at some point - we will be last on a long list but that's OK with us, we've got a fire and lots of snacks. The house is absolutely fine, all that can be built again. There's no point being upset about it."" Train services were suspended between Dundee-Aberdeen, Aberdeen-Inverness, Inverness-Kyle/Wick/Thurso and on the West Highland line north of Helensburgh. And people were urged not to travel by rail between Edinburgh and Newcastle due to the disruption caused by the storm.

Barty triumphs to end Australian wait,"Ashleigh Barty was presented with the Australian Open trophy by her idol Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who won the title four times between 1974 and 1977 Australian Open 2022 Dates:17-30 JanuaryVenue:Melbourne Park Coverage:Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries online; TV highlights from middle Saturday. Ashleigh Barty beat Danielle Collins to win the Australian Open title, ending the home nation's 44-year wait for a Grand Slam women's singles champion. Top seed Barty fought back from 5-1 down in the second set to win 6-3 7-6 (7-2) on a jubilant Rod Laver Arena. The 25-year-old Queenslander has won the title without dropping a set in Melbourne this fortnight. ""This is a dream come true for me. I am so proud of being Aussie,"" said world number one Barty. ""As an Aussie, the most important part of this tournament has been being able to share this experience with the fans. ""This crowd is one of the most fun I've played in front of."" Addressing the crowd, she added: ""You relaxed me and forced me to play my best tennis. Thank you."" After winning the 2019 French Open and last year's Wimbledon title, Barty has now claimed three of the four majors. Read more: 'A wholesome character who everyone thinks is their mate' Relive Barty's Australian Open triumph This video can not be played Australian Open: Ashleigh Barty makes history with win over Danielle Collins in final With a partisan 12,000-strong crowd and a home nation watching on, Barty started and ended the final looking unburdened by the weight of expectation. In between, there were anxious moments as Collins, troubling Barty with her powerful returning, earned a double break in the second set. But Barty had dropped only 21 games on her way to the final and, although the second set looked to have got away from her, she regained her composure brilliantly to turn the match back in her favour. Among those watching was Chris O'Neil, the last Australian to win the men's or women's singles title in Melbourne. Barty, rarely overcome by emotion, shouted with delight when she clinched the title with a cross-court forehand winner. Virtually everyone inside Rod Laver Arena jumped to their feet, roaring their approval, many with camera phones in hand to capture a long-awaited moment for the nation's sports fans. The world number one's relief was clear. Barty clenched both fists as she dropped to her haunches, before running over to the side where she beckoned former doubles partner Casey Dellacqua, now a television analyst, on to court for a warm hug. After reaching the Melbourne semi-finals in 2020, with quarter-final defeats coming in the years either side, Barty finally landed the prize she really wanted. Victory continued her supreme form in 2022, and she has now won all 11 of her singles matches this year. After beating three top-20 players to win the Adelaide International title, she has continued that dominance in Melbourne. Barty, who took a break from tennis in 2014 to pursue a professional cricket career, has often paid tribute to Dellacqua's influence on her success and the kiss on her friend's forehead indicated her gratitude. There was another special moment for Barty - and the home fans - when the player's idol, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, came on to court to present her with the Daphne Akhurst trophy. Since O'Neil's triumph in 1978, four players - Kim Warwick, Wendy Turnbull, Pat Cash and Lleyton Hewitt - had lost in the men's or women's singles final. There had been home success in the wheelchair and quad events, through David Hall and Dylan Alcott, and in the doubles events. Danielle Collins will move into the world's top 10 after reaching the Melbourne final In her first Grand Slam final, American 27th seed Collins was aiming to spoil the Barty party. Few, at least outside Australia, would have begrudged her claiming a major title after a difficult journey of her own. In April, she said she was taking an indefinite break from tennis as she prepared to have surgery for endometriosis. Collins returned to action two months later and, after surgery and helped by medication, says she is now having less painful periods and is able to train more consistently. That resulted in a brilliant run in Melbourne, where she demonstrated her incredible power and will-to-win. Against Barty, Collins looked to settle quickly and exploit any nerves the home favourite might be feeling. The first break point of the match came the American's way at 2-2 when Barty hit a loose forehand long, only for the Australian to save it with a gutsy forehand on to the line. After holding with an ace, Barty settled down and was helped into a 4-2 lead when Collins threw in an double fault on break point. Barty sealed the set to the sound of a rapturous crowd and, having only dropped serve once in the entire tournament, looked in a commanding position. Collins, however, broke for a 2-0 lead in the second, leading to a passionate celebration from the American. A double hand fist-pump squat perfectly illustrated her combative and competitive on-court personality. The crowd started getting edgy as Collins moved 5-1 ahead and she was two points away from levelling the match at 5-3 30-0. But Barty produced two forehand winners to unsettle her opponent and that sparked the fight-back that ended in Australian sporting immortality. Allow Twitter content?

Priti Patel approves extradition of UK tech tycoonMike Lynch lost a multibillion-dollar fraud action on Friday over the sale of Autonomy in 2011.,"Home Secretary Priti Patel has approved the extradition of a British tech tycoon to the US to face criminal fraud charges. The decision comes after Mike Lynch, the founder of Autonomy, lost a multibillion-dollar fraud action in London on Friday. His firm was sold to US giant Hewlett Packard for $11bn (Â£8bn) in 2011. He is accused of manipulating its accounts to inflate the value of the company before its sale. In 2012, just over a year after the purchase, HP announced an $8.8bn write-down (reduction in estimated value) of the value of Autonomy. HP sued Autonomy's founder and former chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, for about $5bn, claiming they ""artificially inflated Autonomy's reported revenues, revenue growth and gross margins"". Mr Justice Hildyard said HP had ""substantially won"" its case, more than two years after the start of what was believed to be the UK's biggest civil fraud trial - which was heard over nine months in 2019. But he said the company was likely to receive ""substantially less"" than the amount claimed in damages. Mr Lynch always denied the accusations and said on Friday that he would appeal. His former chief financial officer Mr Hussain was convicted in April 2018 in the US of wire fraud and other crimes related to Autonomy's sale and wasjailed for five years. HP wins multibillion-dollar fraud case over UK firm UK tech giant founder arrested over US extradition Autonomy boss in 'deliberate fraud' The decision in court on Friday coincided with a midnight deadline on the same day for the home secretary to decide whether or not Mr Lynch should be extradited to the US to face criminal trial for 14 counts of conspiracy and fraud. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Under the Extradition Act 2003, the secretary of state must sign an extradition order if there are no grounds to prohibit the order being made. Extradition requests are only sent to the home secretary once a judge decides it can proceed after considering various aspects of the case. ""On 28 January, following consideration by the courts, the extradition of Dr Michael Lynch to the US was ordered."" Kelwin Nicholls, of law firm Clifford Chance, representing Mr Lynch, said in a statement on Friday evening: ""Dr Lynch firmly denies the charges brought against him in the US and will continue to fight to establish his innocence. ""He is a British citizen who ran a British company in Britain subject to British laws and rules and that is where the matter should be resolved. This is not the end of the battle - far from it."" The lawyer also confirmed that Mr Lynch would file an appeal to the High Court in London. The company was founded in 1996by Mr Lynch out of a specialist software research group called Cambridge Neurodynamics. Autonomy developed software that could extract useful information from ""unstructured"" sources such as phone-calls, emails or video. The software could then do things such as suggest answers to a call-centre operator or monitor TV channels for words or subjects. It gained a listing on the US Nasdaq exchange in May 2000 at the height of the technology boom and was listed in London six months later. The company suffered when the technology bubble burst, dropping out of the FTSE 100 and having to issue a profit warning in 2001. But it grew rapidly and opened joint head offices in Cambridge and San Francisco, with other offices worldwide, to serve 65,000 customer companies. Autonomy was sold to Hewlett Packard for $11bn (Â£8bn) in 2011. Mr Lynch left the company in 2012. Cambridge graduateMr Lynch,external, 56, built Autonomy up to be one of the top 100 UK public companies. In 2006, he was awarded an OBE for services to enterprise. A fellow of the Royal Society, Mr Lynch, who lives in Suffolk, previously advised the government and sat on the boards of the British Library and the BBC.

"British 'hitman' guilty of plotting to kill activistMuhammad Gohir Khan is found guilty of agreeing to kill a Pakistani military critic for Â£100,000.Asia","Muhammad Gohir Khan was offered Â£100,000 to carry out the murder A British ""hitman"" has been found guilty of conspiring to kill a Pakistani dissident in the Netherlands. A court in London heard Muhammad Gohir Khan was offered Â£100,000 (about $134,000) to carry out the murder in Rotterdam last year. However he failed to track his target down, and was arrested on his return to the UK. Now a jury has given a unanimous guilty verdict of conspiracy to murder and he is set be sentenced in March. The intended victim, Waqass Goraya, has told the BBC he is sure the Pakistani intelligence services were ultimately behind the plot and that it forms part of a wider crackdown on dissenting voices both inside and outside Pakistan. Pakistani officials would not comment on the case. Gohir Khan, from east London, had racked up debts of more than Â£200,000 whilst running a cargo company. He was working as a delivery driver for a supermarket, but reacted enthusiastically when he was contacted about a ""job"" in Europe by a contact in Pakistan. Khan was captured on CCTV buying a knife in Rotterdam Khan claimed in court that he initially did not know what the job entailed, but he used fishing analogies in a WhatsApp conversation with a middleman man named as Muzzamil who was to take 20% of the fee. ""Is it a deep sea fish or just tuna?"" Khan asked. Muzzamil, who was also known as ""Papa"" because of his resemblance to cartoon character ""Papa Smurf"", replied, ""just tuna, but not uk tuna, european tuna"". Their grim intent was made clear when Khan discussed needing a ""tool"" or gun for the job, whilst at another point Muzzamil wrote about the target: ""It's not a SHARKâ¦ A little fishâ¦ Little knife / hook / worm with a string is enough."" The man they planned on killing was Waqass Goraya, a prominent social media activist and critic of the Pakistani military and government, living in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. He was abducted and tortured whilst visiting Pakistan in January 2017 by suspected members of the intelligence services, and told the BBC he was convinced they had now attempted to have him killed in Europe. Waqass Goraya says someone has to stand up to the military in Pakistan ""They don't like being called out for enforced disappearances or their torture cells,"" he said, adding: ""It shows their cowardice. They are scared of people talking. People who are unarmed, with nothing but a pen or keyboard. They are more scared of them than the people with guns."" Pakistan's powerful military did not respond to requests for comment, whilst the country's information minister refused to discuss the case. Government officials claim there is no clampdown on freedom of speech in Pakistan and the army denies interfering in politics, but human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns about a series of violent attacks in Pakistan on journalists and activists who accuse the military of manipulating the country's electoral system. The threat to Pakistani dissidents extends to those outside the country too. Ayesha Siddiqa is an academic who has written extensively about the Pakistani military. In January 2019 she received a visit and letter from police in Britain warning of ""credible information"" that her life was in danger if she travelled back to Pakistan. Ayesha Siddiqa says she has a contract on her head, even though she is in the UK Dr Siddiqa shared the letter with the BBC, and said her own inquiries had led her to find out, ""there was a contract on my head given to some Afghan warlords to be eliminated on return to Pakistanâ¦ if the temperature was raised I could be targeted in the UK as well."" Like Mr Goraya, Dr Siddiqa told the BBC she believed the Pakistani intelligence services were behind the threat. ""I have no one else to suspect."" Three other Pakistanis living in the UK confirmed to the BBC they had contact with the police over the possibility of them being targeted in Britain. One of them, Fazal Khan, is a lawyer whose 14 year-old son Sahibzada Umer Khan was amongst the victims of a massacre at a school in the northern Pakistani city of Peshawar by militants in 2014. Since then, he has filed numerous court petitions involving Pakistan's military authorities, most recently criticising them for their soft treatment of one notorious former militant leader, who was kept under ""house arrest"" before mysteriously escaping. As a result of his activism Mr Khan has faced threats from extremists and, he believes, the security services. In July 2020 Mr Khan survived an assassination attempt in Pakistan and later fled to the UK. Last April, British police warned him of a threat to his life, advising him to maintain a ""low profile"" and not to venture into public places. Fazal Khan is now in the UK, saying he lives in fear of his life for speaking out Mr Khan told the BBC two plainclothes officers gave him an ""emergency police number"" and said, ""you are in our system, if you feel anything abnormal then give us a call and an armoured vehicle will arrive to rescue you"". The officers did not specify the exact nature of the threat, but Mr Khan believes it must be linked to the Pakistani security services, describing being forced to live ""a life of fear"". Others elsewhere in Europe have also been warned by Western intelligence agencies, including Taha Siddiqui, ajournalist who escaped an abduction attempt in Islamabadand now lives in France. Activist says Pakistan tortured him Abducted activist points finger at Pakistan security Where reporters face beatings, threats and death At Kingston Crown Court, the jury heard Gohir Khan and the middleman Muzzamil discussed the possibility of further ""jobs"" after killing Mr Goraya. Waqass Goraya had been told in 2018 of threats to his life by the FBI. In February last year, before Gohir Khan had even travelled to the Netherlands, he was rushed out of his home in Rotterdam by Dutch intelligence agents and taken to a secure location. The operation targeting him at times appeared amateur and poorly organised, with Khan bemoaning delays in the process as ""dysfunctional"". Meanwhile, Khan produced fake doctored receipts and invented a fictional ""crew"" accompanying him in order to try to extract more money for the hit. Testifying in court, Khan, who was at times tearful, came across as a bumbling opportunist, describing for example how he crashed a car in Rotterdam within minutes of renting it as he wasn't used to driving on the right hand side of the road. When attempting to bypass Covid travel restrictions in order to travel to the Netherlands in June 2021, Khan asked a contact to pretend to be his brother living there. On arrival, however, he was questioned by a border official who called the ""brother"" on the phone and asked him how old Khan was in order to verify his identity. Unable to answer, Khan's ""brother"" hung up, and Khan was denied entry to the country. A few days later, Khan made the trip for a second time and was finally able to reach Rotterdam. He purchased a 19-inch knife and staked out what he believed was Mr Goraya's home. However, he soon realised the address he had been provided with was wrong. Muzzamil assured him that his ""boss"" had received a video of Mr Goraya at the address around six months earlier, but unable to locate him Khan returned to London. On leaving Rotterdam he was questioned by a Dutch border force officer about his trip. Struggling for an answer, Khan replied that he had been ""touristing"", leading the officer to refer him to police in Britain. They arrested him and eventually found his message history with Muzzamil. In court, Khan insisted he never planned to go ahead with the murder and simply wanted to extract money from Muzammil, telling police he only bought a knife in Rotterdam to cut bread and fruit with. The prosecution argued he fully intended to carry out the killing and the jury agreed, convicting him of conspiracy to murder. The Pakistan-based ""client"" who had ordered the hit was never named in court, though Muzzamil referred to a ""big boss"" who gave a green light to the operation and who he had worked with for around 20 years. Muzzamil's full identity has not been disclosed either, though he appears to be a British national living in Pakistan. Police officials said the case remains an ""active investigation"" and appealed for anyone with information about Muzammil to contact them. Mr Goraya is urging the UK authorities to further investigate the case and all those involved. ""It should not stop hereâ¦ They have to go after the people who transferred the money, who ordered the hit."" He has no doubt that trail will eventually lead to the same Pakistani intelligence services he accuses of torturing him five years ago. He, along with other campaigners, also want Swedish and Canadian officials to re-open investigations into the deaths of two Baloch dissidents in 2021, both of which were found not to be suspicious. Pakistani rights activist found dead in Toronto Swedish police find body of Pakistani journalist Some activists worry Britain's close diplomatic relationship and co-operation with the Pakistani authorities on counter-terrorism will lead them to play down the significance of the episode. Mr Goraya, however, is determined, not to be silenced. ""Threats and intimidation don't work,"" he told the BBC. ""It makes people resilient. It makes their voice louder.""

Where is Sue Gray's report?,"The expectation across Whitehall was that Sue Gray's long-anticipated report would be passed to Downing Street on Wednesday. So why hasn't it appeared, and what is it likely to find when it does? The announcement of the Met Police investigation has inserted a spanner in the works - especially as all contentious evidence had been given to the police by the cabinet office last week. And there had been liaison throughout the internal inquiry. It's understood the Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick examined the evidence at the weekend. While the Met has not objected to the report being published - since any action they take could be limited to issuing fixed penalty notices, and not lead to a criminal trial - Downing Street has said reassurances were now being sought that none of the content would cut across police work. Met seeks limits to Sue Gray No 10 parties report Sue Gray report: What exactly is she looking at? What action could police take over No 10 parties? I am told by Whitehall sources that Sue Gray is determined that the report she submits to Downing Street will be in a form that can allow for it to be published by No 10 in full. What she wants to avoid are last-minute redactions, or a report that focuses on the least egregious events, while leaving everything that's contentious to the police. But now the Met has said it wants Ms Gray's report to make ""minimal reference"" to the events it is looking into, in order ""to avoid any prejudice to our investigation"". It has not, however, called for any delay to publication. But it is not yet clear what this will mean for the timing of the report, or the prospect of an impasse between the Met and the Cabinet Office team - because while Sue Gray seems willing to make minimal changes to her report to satisfy any police concerns, it would be a rather major change to make only minimal mention of the potentially most egregious events. Ms Gray was the director general in charge of propriety and ethics in Whitehall Sue Gray has built a formidable reputation within the civil service and will not want to be undermined by allegations of a whitewash, or a less than thorough job. So it is perfectly possible that minor redrafting or reworking could be undertaken which achieves the twin aims of ensuring the police would have no last minute objections, while not skirting round some of the findings about more controversial gatherings in government buildings. According to sources close to the Gray team, there has not been any political interference to adjust the content, so that is not the cause of delay. The prime minister will certainly see the full report before it is published but will not have a veto over its content. And there has been no attempt by civil service trade unions to delay the report or ask for retractions. Only very senior civil servants will be named and those who will be named have already been informed. But it's not impossible that more junior staff individually may have raised concerns that while they are not going to be identified, the information in the report might make them nonetheless too easy to identify. Insiders also maintain that while the whole process has been a difficult one for Ms Gray, she would push back against any informal attempts by other senior civil servants to alter the tone of the report, or to dilute the findings. According to those who know Sue Gray's track record - as the former director general in charge of propriety and ethics in Whitehall - she holds her fellow civil servants to very high standards. From those close to the process, it would be difficult for her to conclude that Downing Street is being well run. While she cannot recommend any action be taken against politicians, she can be very critical about the civil service leadership in Downing Street, and of the culture in the building. She is unlikely to mince words, and her report could subsequently trigger disciplinary action against some staff. Police party investigation ups pressure on PM Downing Street party: What is Sue Gray investigating? It will almost certainly make difficult reading for senior people - including some who have so far not been mentioned prominently in public. Of course, there is little doubt that supporters of Boris Johnson would find it convenient to blame the advisers and indeed the longer any delay, some of those supporters may go on the front foot and call for reforms in the operation. As for the prime minister, the terms of reference which Sue Gray was given may work to his advantage. As head of propriety and ethics, when she dealt with complaints against ministers she would form a judgement on whether the minister or the complainant was the more reliable witness. But as she has been restricted now to establishing the facts, she will reach no such judgment. So, for example, if the former aide Dominic Cummings told her that Boris Johnson was warned that the 20 May 2020 gathering was a rule-breaking social event and the prime minister maintains he was not, she will not form a judgement on who is most likely to be telling the truth. Of course, if she were to have written evidence in the form of a WhatsApp or email message read by the prime minister, simply setting out the facts could be damaging for Boris Johnson. But those close to the ""save Boris"" operation aren't expecting a ""smoking gun"" - instead, they say, it's more likely there will be 'contestable' claims. While the prime minister hasn't seen the report, he will have a sense of where it is going through the interviews he and staff have given to the inquiry. Those who expect very firm conclusions - especially where politicians are concerned - are likely to be disappointed. And those internal and external opponents of Boris Johnson slavering at the prospect of WhatsApp messages and potentially embarrassing photographs from inside Downing Street being made public are likely to remain unsated. Sue Gray won't be publishing all the evidence she has received, or handed to the police. But those close to the process say it could be that some of the evidence could be incorporated verbatim into the report where it fits the narrative and perhaps provides a salient example of the prevailing culture. Ultimately any decision on law-breaking is for the police, not for Sue Gray - so it is perfectly possible that hers will not be the final word in this political drama.
