Man stabbed to death in front of his children,"Christopher Nicol was found in the flat after reports of a disturbance A man who was murdered in a Greenock flat was ""violently"" stabbed in front of his children, police have said. Christopher Nicol, 27, was attacked inside the property on Maple Road at about 21:05 on Thursday. Officers believe the killer had wrongly thought there was a large sum of cash in the flat, and had intended to rob Mr Nicol. Police said the victim's children, who are aged five and six, were receiving professional support. Officers have launched a murder inquiry, and believe the killer knew Mr Nicol. He entered the property after barging past Mr Nicol's girlfriend when she answered the door. The attacker has been described as being white, aged 20-30, about 5ft 9in tall, with a slim build. He had a local accent, and an unkempt, reddish, brown beard and moustache. Officers say he also had bad teeth, with some visibly missing. He was wearing a black beanie hat with a logo, possibly Timberland, a black top and black jeans or bottoms. Det Ch Insp Martin Fergus described the killing as ""absolutely sickening"". ""At this time we believe that the motive for this was robbery, and that Christopher was targeted specifically because his attacker thought there was a large sum of money in the house - which was not the case. ""For whatever the reason, to carry out such a brutal attack in front of such young children is absolutely sickening. It shows an absolute disregard for their safety or suffering.  This callous killer must be caught. Det Ch Insp Fergus said a public appeal for witnesses and information had been ""disappointing"". ""I believe that the answer to this murder lies in the local community and I am in no doubt that there are people out there who have vital information on this incident, who have not yet come forward,"" he said. ""I would urge them to look to their conscience and contact us. I would like to hear from local people in Greenock to give us details of anyone they know who was out and about in the Maple Road area on Thursday evening. ""The man responsible has quite a distinctive description, so if you have any idea of his identity, then please contact us as soon as possible."" Anyone with information has been urged to contact Police Scotland via their non-emergency line.

PM: UK offering 'constructive' Brexit plans,"This video can not be played PM: Irish customs checks after Brexit can be ""absolutely minimal"" Boris Johnson says the government is offering the EU ""very constructive and far-reaching proposals"" to break the Brexit impasse. Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, he confirmed the UK's plan would include some customs checks on the island of Ireland after Brexit. But they would be ""absolutely minimal"" and ""won't involve new infrastructure"". The EU says it has ""not received any proposals from the UK"" yet that could replace the backstop. The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 October. Mr Johnson has said the exit will go ahead with or without a deal - despite MPs passing a law last month forcing him to ask for an extension from the EU if Parliament hasn't voted in favour of a specific deal or leaving without one. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland has been a contentious part of the Brexit negotiations since day one. At present there are no checks on goods moving across it and the backstop was agreed between former PM Theresa May and the EU as an insurance policy to make sure that does not change - and that no infrastructure like cameras or security posts can be installed in the future. If used, the backstop would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks was agreed. However, the government says it is ""undemocratic"" and unacceptable. Full transcript of PM's interview Would a Brexit delay cost the UK Â£400m a week? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Speaking on day three of the Conservative conference, Mr Johnson said he believed the UK was offering enough to win the EU round and more detail would be made public soon. ""Yes, I absolutely do,"" he insisted. ""So, with great respect to all those who are currently anxious about it - and particularly in Ireland - we do think that our proposals are good and creative. ""But I accept also... there may be hard yards ahead."" He added: ""That is going to be where the argument is going to be - and that's where the negotiations will be tough."" This video can not be played ""Keep hope alive"" for a Brexit breakthrough, PM urges The PM said there would ""have to be a system for customs checks away from the border"". ""If the EU is going to insist on customs checks... then we will have to accept that reality,"" he added. When it was put to him that it was not the EU who were insisting on customs checks, the PM replied: ""Well, let's see where we get to. And as you know, we made some very constructive and far-reaching proposals."" The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there would need to be checks at ports, airports and perhaps at the border. Conference pledges but Brexit is the key for the PM Theresa May has 'no regrets over career' But he said that would only be the case if the UK left without an agreement, telling the Dail: ""We've never been in the position of signing up to checks as part of a deal."" Mr Johnson told Laura Kuenssberg he always knew ""things would get choppy"" in the lead up to the Brexit deadline. But the PM believed ""fevers would cool"" and ""tempers would come down"" once that moment had passed. ""There's no way of getting Brexit done without... displeasing people who don't want Brexit to get done,"" he said. ""[There is] no way of delivering Brexit sort of 52% Brexit and 48% Remain - that's just logically impossible."" Mr Johnson added: ""I think once we get it done, and once we can begin building a new partnership with our new friends... we can start thinking about how we can do things differently."" At a reception hosted by the DUP at the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Tuesday night, Mr Johnson said the UK had made progress in the negotiations, adding: ""I hope very much in the next few days we are going to get there."" The prime minster said that Northern Ireland should remain part of the United Kingdom ""forever"". Please upgrade your browser The government has made a number of policy announcements at the conference, from raising the National Living Wage over the next five years to toughening prison sentences for the worst offenders. But the plans have been overshadowed by allegations that Mr Johnson squeezed the thigh of journalist Charlotte Edwardes under a table at a lunch in 1999. Mr Johnson has repeatedly denied the incident, telling the BBC: ""It's simply not true."" He would not answer whether he thought Ms Edwardes - who has stood by her claims - lied or whether he remembered the lunch. And while the PM said such allegations should be taken seriously, he did not agree to an investigation, saying he wanted to ""get on with delivering on... [the] important issue of our domestic agenda"".

Johnson to set out details of 'final' Brexit offer,"This video can not be played PM: Boris Johnson: ""It (no deal) is not an outcome we want... but is an outcome for which we are ready"" The government's final Brexit proposals will include customs checks on the island of Ireland. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said Boris Johnson's plans will see Northern Ireland ""in a different relationship with the EU to the rest of the UK"". Boris Johnson is addressing the Tory conference before submitting the new proposals to the EU. The European Commission said they will ""examine it objectively"" and ""listen carefully to the UK"". The Commission's president, Jean-Claude Juncker will talk to the PM on the phone later, while negotiating teams will meet in Brussels. In his first speech at the event as prime minister, he will call it a ""fair and reasonable"" Brexit compromise, and say only by leaving the EU on 31 October can the UK ""move on"". Mr Johnson will also claim the public will no longer be ""taken for fools"" by those who want to delay or block the process. Tory Chairman James Cleverly said the UK had been ""flexible and pragmatic"", and now the EU must be the same. On the eve of his speech, Mr Johnson told a conference fringe meeting in Manchester, hosted by the DUP, that he hoped to reach a deal with the EU over the course of ""the next few days"". The government has insisted it will not negotiate a further delay beyond the Halloween deadline, saying this would be unnecessary and costly for the UK. What are the Brexit backstop options? PM: UK offering 'constructive' Brexit plans Would a Brexit delay cost the UK Â£400m a week? However, under the terms of a law passed by Parliament last month, the PM faces having to request another extension unless MPs back the terms of withdrawal by 19 October - two days after a summit of European leaders. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson dismissed leaked reports that customs posts could be set up on either side of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. He said suggestions the UK wanted ""clearance zones"" for goods as part of a package of alternative arrangements to replace the Irish backstop were wide of the mark. While he conceded some customs checks would be needed as the UK leaves the EU's customs union and single market, he said technology could keep them to an ""absolute minimum"". The issue of the Irish border - and how to keep it free from border checks when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU - has been a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations. Mr Johnson says the solution reached by the EU and Theresa May, the backstop, is ""anti-democratic"" and ""inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK"", claiming it offered no means for the UK to unilaterally exit and no say for the people of Northern Ireland over the rules that would apply there. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the new offer from Mr Johnson included some new customs checks on the island of Ireland, and would leave Northern Ireland in a different relationship with the EU to the rest of the UK in some ways. She said the plans were ""based on the notion of consent"", giving more powers to Northern Ireland's devolved Parliament - the Stormont Assembly - to shape its future relationship with the EU - despite the fact the assembly is approaching 1,000 days without sitting. The proposals also suggest a time period for when the relationship between Northern Ireland and the EU could move on. But the full and precise details of Mr Johnson's plan twill not be clear until after the prime minister's speech at conference. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Mr Cleverly appeared to put the ball in the EU's court. ""We have been in negotiating for some while,"" he said. ""The UK has been flexible, but a negotiation means both parties need to be flexible. ""What we need to see now is the EU be flexible - and if they can be pragmatic and flexible, we can leave with a deal on 31 October. But we are going to leave on 31 October whatever."" Irish Fine Gael senator Neale Richmond told Today that the PM's plans were a ""big move"" from the withdrawal agreement made by Theresa May. Mr Richmond said, under the plan, Northern Ireland would leave the customs union and ""come out of the single market in all areas, apart from agri-food products and industrial products, and indeed it only stays in those areas for four years"". This, he added, would require ""additional checks"" on the island of Ireland - something he described as ""extremely disappointing"". Laura Kuenssberg said there was a ""real expectation and belief"" in No 10 that ""this is now the crunch point"". She said: ""This is the momentâ¦where the EU will have to respond and say [either] there is something that is a basis of a deal here, or not. ""And what Boris Johnson is trying to suggest is if the answer is not, then for him, that means no-deal."" The EU needs to see the precise details of Boris Johnson's proposals, but the direction of travel that has been coming through is different. The very idea of customs check between Ireland and Northern Ireland, the promise of the use of technologies to ease the process that haven't yet been tried and tested, or don't even exist yetâ¦that is a big no-no for the EU. The bloc will look at the proposals carefully. They need to try as they do want a deal, and also they need to be seen to be trying. But it is fundamentally misunderstanding the EU if the prime minister thinks at this stage the 26 EU leaders will turn round on the Irish prime minister and say: ""Listen, you are going to have to accept this because we just want to have a deal."" It is also fundamentally misunderstanding the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, her attachment to EU unity and the integrity of the single market. And also it is misunderstanding that the EU sees this in a bigger picture. If suddenly now they were to back down to all of the prime minister's demands how would that look to other trade partners across the globe. So EU leaders will be very careful not to rubbish the prime minister's ideas, to talk about them as a basis for an agreement, but if it is take it or leave it, they will be leaving at this point. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was particularly important Mr Johnson secured the support of the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs. He said: ""I think it is very clear this deal is not going to fly unless Boris Johnson can bring the DUP along with him... one way or another he has to make sure they're on board."" BBC Northern Ireland political editor Mark Devenport said sources fromthe DUP were supportive of the proposalsand had been kept informed during their development. However, the party's leader, Arlene Foster, declined to say whether she had seen the PM's proposals. She told the BBC: ""What we are doing with this prime minister is working very closely with him and we will continue to work closely with him over the next couple of hours and days. ""I hope we do get a deal that is acceptable to the European Union and one that is good for the whole of the United Kingdom."" This video can not be played PM: Irish customs checks after Brexit can be ""absolutely minimal"" Speaking in Manchester, Mr Johnson will suggest voters are ""desperate"" for the country to focus on other priorities and will contrast his determination to leave on 31 October with the ""years of uncertainty"" that he says would result from a Labour government promising another referendum. ""What people want, what Leavers want, what Remainers want, what the whole world wants - is to move on,"" he is expected to say. ""I am afraid that after three-and-a-half years people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools. ""They are beginning to suspect that there are forces in this country that simply don't want Brexit delivered at all. ""And if they turn out to be right in that suspicion then I believe there will be grave consequences for trust in democracy. ""Let's get Brexit done on October 31 so in 2020 our country can move on.""

Meghan talks about tackling violence against women,"The Duchess of Sussex has spoken about the importance of supporting victims of gender-based violence. Meghan was speaking to girls and campaigners in Johannesburg on the penultimate day of her and Prince Harry's South Africa tour. The duchess said the country was in a ""crisis state"" when it comes to gender-based violence, after a spate of attacks against women in the country. She also emphasised the importance of mental health support in aftercare. The Sussexes are on a 10-day tour in whichPrince Harry has visited a minefieldand Meghan andtheir baby son Archie met Archbishop Desmond Tutu. At a visit to ActionAid on Tuesday, Meghan said the age range of those experiencing violence was ""really staggering"" and agreed that men and boys should be held accountable for their actions. During her visit she also heard from charity workers how many girls feel unsafe at school. ""The trouble is as a young girl if you are not feeling safe at school and not feeling safe at home, where does that leave you? And that really is systemic. That is a huge issue,"" Meghan said. ""You will feel very displaced."" The duchess, who was taking part in a discussion, also said it was important victims feel supported when they report such violence. ""And when they tell somebody, someone does something. That's the other issue right? It's so key being able to feel that they can communicate what's happening when something goes wrong, whatever it is,"" she said. Meghan: I'm in South Africa as your sister Meghan and Harry visit South Africa's oldest mosque Baby Archie makes appearance on royal tour Earlier, Meghan spoke to students and academics during another discussion on gender issues at the University of Johannesburg. She said support was needed for women in higher education in South Africa. ""When a women is empowered it changes absolutely everything in the community,"" she told the group. The duchess announced three new ""gender grants"" for the University of Johannesburg, Stellenbosch University and the University of Western Cape at the beginning of Tuesday's discussion with the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU). It is the penultimate day of the Sussexes' overseas tour Well-wishers cheered Meghan on at the University of Johannesburg ""The goal here is to be able to have gender equality, to be able to support women as they are working in research and higher education roles,"" she told the discussion group. ""True to what you said, when a women is empowered it changes absolutely everything in the community and starting an educational atmosphere is really a key point of that,"" she added. Meghan said she was only able to go to university herself because of financial help from a scholarship and ""families chipping in"". ""If you don't have the support that is necessary that you feel that you can keep taking the next step then you're stunted in growth,"" she said. Meghan attended a roundtable discussion about the challenges faced by young women in accessing higher education Well-wishers cheered as the duchess was greeted by the ACU's secretary general, Dr Joanna Newman, and Prof Tshilidzi Marwala, vice chancellor of the university. Meanwhile, the Duke of Sussex told a group of young people to ""hold on to your dreams"" as he visited a health centre in a remote village in Malawi. Sitting outside the Mauwa Health Centre, they discussed sexual health but also touched on climate change and conservation. A health official said: ""They asked him what challenges he faced when growing up and he did have challenges but he said they were not similar as the context was different. The official added that the prince also urged the youngsters to ""show kindness, empathy and work together."" Prince Harry was speaking in a village in rural Malawi The prince had travelled to the village near Blantyre to see the pharmacy-in-a-box project, funded by the UK and US governments. The pharmacies are prefabricated, solar-powered and air-conditioned storage facilities for medicines, which keep drugs secure, held at the right temperature, and stocked up. At the health centre, patients can access a range of services from malaria treatment to a maternity unit, as well as HIV testing and aftercare for those who have the virus. Speaking about the drugs used to treat an HIV patient, Prince Harry said: ""You need to know your status and know there's medication, so you can have a happy and healthy life.""

It is the first time the four-month-old has been seen in public on the couple's 10-day tour of Africa. Archie was seen smiling in his mother's arms and was held up on her lap. Prince Harry and Meghan joked about their son's time in front of the cameras as they greeted the archbishop and his daughter Thandeka Tutu-Gxashe. ""He's an old soul,"" said Meghan, while Harry remarked: ""I think he is used to it already.""

She told the women: ""It's so important we're able to share what's worked for our family and know that you're all in this together with each other. So we wanted to share something from our home to yours."" On their tour so far, the duke and duchess have also visited South Africa's oldest mosque and visited a charity which provides mental health support for young people.

Varadkar reacts to latest UK Brexit moves,"The proposals could mean customs sites created on both sides of the border Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said the Republic is ""not going to allow ourselves to be dragged out of the single market"". Speaking in the DÃ¡il, he also welcomed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's rejection of a proposal for custom sites near to the border. The taoiseach said the UK government should not ""impose"" customs checks ""against the will of the people"". He was echoing calls made by Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney. Johnson rejects leaks over Irish border plan UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiations Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Responding to a question from People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, Mr Varadkar said the Republic would not be left in the ""worst of all worlds"" but not introducing border checks in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The taoiseach has said the Republic will not be ""dragged out"" of the single market He said not doing so could mean Irish businesses ""facing checks in Rotterdam, and in Zeebrugge, and in Calais"". ""We certainly can't allow ourselves out of belligerence to end up in a situation whereby we are surrounded by a border on all sides, and that is certainly not a situation we want to be in,"" he said. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. On Monday night,Irish national broadcaster RTÃ,externalsaid the UK suggested 'customs clearance zones' on both sides of the Irish border could replace the backstop. However, on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsondenied tabling that proposal. But, in a separate interview, he accepted that some kind of customs checks would be necessary. Proposals for reaching a Brexit deal had been expected ahead of a crucial EU summit on 17 October. The BBC understands that any further customs inspections would be very limited. Political correspondent Iain Watson said they could be conducted either at new locations or at existing business premises. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The proposals would mean posts created on both sides of the border, potentially five to 10 miles back from the land frontier. RTÃ said consignments would be checked and cleared at the sites, with data being provided to the customs authorities on both sides of the border. Goods moving from a customs clearance site on the northern side of the border to a similar site on the southern side would be monitored in real time using GPS via mobile phone data or tracking devices placed on trucks or vans. In the Lords on Tuesday, former Police Ombudsman Baroness Nuala O'Loan said the risk of attack on any physical infrastructure was very high. She told the chamber dissident republicans are very active, while recent comments from the UVF indicate they could enter into violence if the situation deteriorates. The ideas are believed to be contained in one of four so-called non-papers submitted by UK officials during recent technical discussions in Brussels. In a tweet, TÃ¡naiste (Ireland's deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney said the proposals were a ""non-starter"", adding Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ""deserve better"". A spokesman for the Irish government said: ""The EU Task force has indicated that any non-papers it has received from the UK to date fall well short of the agreed aims and objectives of the backstop."" Reaction to 'customs clearance zones' suggestion BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said if the customs sites plan was to become the official UK position, it would be dismissed and rejected by the EU as insufficient. Julian Smith said customs facilities were ""not possible"" in many locations in Northern Ireland However, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith said he had not seen reports about custom clearance centres and did not know where the claims had come from. ""The border in Northern Ireland is not just the border, it's the area around the border so I'm very clear on that,"" Mr Smith told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. He added that the prime minister was ""fully committed"" to the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly said Monday night's reports had caused ""surprise and dismay"" to many in Northern Ireland. She asked the minister to engage with Northern Ireland businesses in order to make it clear that creating facilities set back from the border is not government policy as this would constitute a hard border. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, and Mr Johnson has said this will happen whether or not there is a new deal with Brussels. Currently, there are no border posts, physical barriers or checks on people or goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The backstop is a measure in the withdrawal agreement, between Theresa May and the EU, which is designed to ensure that continues after the UK leaves the EU. It comes into effect only if the deal deciding the future relationship between the UK and EU is not agreed by the end of the transition period. UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiations What are the Brexit backstop options? 8% of border freight 'could be checked' Currently, there are no border posts, physical barriers or checks on people or goods crossing the border 'Smugglers' charter' Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary-Lou McDonald told the BBC's Today programme the plan was ""essentially the re-imposition of a hard border on Ireland"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the proposals failed to meet the UK's obligations to avoid physical infrastructure. ""It doesn't matter if it's a mile, five miles or 10 miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable,"" he said. AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said if the proposals were true, they showed the government had not listened to business in Northern Ireland. He also said the move ""ripped up"" the joint declaration of December 2017 between the EU and UK. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Tractor protest sparks 'worst Dutch rush hour'There were about 1,100km (700 miles) of jams as farmers reacted to plans to cut nitrogen emissions.Europe","This video can not be played Dutch farmers clogged up more than 1,000km of roads with their tractors Tractor-driving farmers taking to the streets to demand greater recognition caused the worst ever Dutch morning rush hour on Tuesday, according to motoring organisation ANWB. There were 1,136km (700 miles) of jams at the morning peak, it said. Farmers reacted angrily to claims that they were largely responsible for a nitrogen oxide emissions problem. A report has called for inefficient cattle farms to be shut down and some speed limits lowered to cut pollution. Farming groups believe they are being victimised while the aviation industry is escaping scrutiny. The tractors arrived early on Tuesday, some of them knocking down fences to get there. Three people were arrested, according to public broadcaster NOS. Thousands of farmers, many on their tractors, took part in the protest in a field in the centre of The Hague. Police said 2,200 farmers joined the protest. Hague mayor Pauline Krikke warned of an ""unsafe situation"" but no further trouble was reported and drone pictures showed dozens more tractors parked on Scheveningen beach while their owners joined the demonstration. Anna Holligan, BBC News, The Hague Amber lights flashing, horns blaring, the ""green army"" rolled in and their message was unambiguous.

The sports minister said he was hopeful that measures to tackle nitrogen emissions would not affect the race.

Gigi Hadid marches gatecrasher off the catwalk,"Supermodel Gigi Hadid confronted an intruder on the catwalk at the Chanel show during Paris Fashion Week. Comedian Marie S'Infiltre - real name Marie Benoliel - climbed onto the runway wearing a Chanel-style dog tooth-patterned outfit and a black hat. After getting most of the way round the runway, Gigi Hadid stepped in and led her away. It seems to have been a publicity stunt rather than protest.

Torrential rain brings floods across Britain,"This video can not be played Residents were trapped in their homes in the village of Laxey on the Isle of Man More rain and winds are expected in parts of the country later this week as the remnants of ex-Hurricane Lorenzo arrive in the UK. The storm -the most powerful hurricane ever recordedin the far east Atlantic - will have lost most of its power by the time it arrives on Thursday. It comes after torrential rain brought flash flooding and led to some places being evacuated on Tuesday. On the Isle of Man amajor incident was declaredwith people trapped indoors. Elsewhere, some areas in the Midlands, Wales and southern England were hit by a week's rain in just an hour, as thunderstorms swept across the UK. Roads and railways were closed and some flights from London's Heathrow Airport were delayed on Tuesday evening due to the bad weather. Dozens of flood warnings and alertsremain in place,externalacross England. Major incident as people trapped by flooding Hurricane Lorenzo breaks record in mid-Atlantic How do hurricanes form? Louise Lear, from BBC Weather, said temperatures would turn colder on Wednesday before an area of low pressure - carrying gale-force gusts and the remnants of former Hurricane Lorenzo - approached Northern Ireland on Thursday. The low pressure would move eastwards and south during Thursday and into Friday, bringing ""a spell of wet and windy weather"", she said. Thursday and Friday will see wind and rain hit western parts of the UK, BBC Weather said The Met Office said Northern Ireland, western Scotland, Wales and south-west England will most likely be affected. On Tuesday, the Met Office issued issued a yellow warning for heavy rain across large parts of central and southern England and Wales. On the Isle of Man,the village of Laxey was cut offafter its second major flood in four years. The river that gave the village its name burst its banks, leaving people trapped in their homes and washing away cars. The fire service helped to evacuate several houses, while a coastguard helicopter was flown in on standby. The village was previously flooded in 2015, when a 200-year-old stone bridge was washed away. One villager told the BBC that this year's flooding was the worst he had seen. Local residents make their way through floodwater in Cossington, Leicester Also in Cossington, a clean-up operation is under way at a flooded home Flights from Heathrow were delayed on Tuesday evening because of ""poor weather conditions across London and the South East"", a spokeswoman for the airport said. And the Thames Barrier closed for the second time in a week to protect London from flooding. In Cornwall, floods caused by a coastal surge meant people were told to leave caravans and seaside properties.

By Tuesday afternoon, the highest hourly rainfall was 25.6mm, recorded at Pennerley in Shropshire. That part of the country normally receives just 96mm of rain in the whole of October. But the localised nature of the downpours means the heaviest rainfall may not be recorded by a weather station, the Met Office said. Worcestershire was one place that experienced torrential rainfall, with the fire and rescue service issuing a warning to drivers after a car was submerged in floods. Allow Twitter content?

Banksy shop appears in Croydon town centre,"This video can not be played Banksy shop featuring Stormzy stab vest has appeared in London Elusive artist Banksy has set up a shop in south London featuring the stab vest he designed for Stormzy's headline act at the Glastonbury Festival. A Tony the Tiger rug and a cradle surrounded by CCTV cameras are also on show as part of the venture, at a disused retail outlet in Croydon. The shop appeared overnight on Church Street. ""I'm opening a shop today,"" the artist said on Instagram. ""Although the doors don't actually open."" Banksy said he was going to sell products online and people could visit the shop for the next two weeks. Items that will be available to buy are on display in Croydon He added he was being ""forced"" to launch the online shop  - called Gross Domestic Product - because a greeting cards company was attempting to legally trade using his name. The artist is being advised that opening a shop which sold his merchandise would help him protect the trademark on his art. In a statement, Banksy said: ""A greetings cards company is contesting the trademark I hold to my art, and attempting to take custody of my name so they can sell their fake Banksy merchandise legally. ""I think they're banking on the idea I won't show up in court to defend myself."" The exhibition has been called Gross Domestic Product The grime artist is from Croydon Items being sold in the shop include welcome mats made from life vests salvaged from the shores of the Mediterranean, which have been hand-stitched by women in detainment camps in Greece. There are also disco balls made from police riot helmets and a toddler's counting toy where children are encouraged to load wooden migrant figures inside a haulage truck. Banksy said proceeds would go towards buying a new migrant rescue boat to replace one allegedly confiscated by Italian authorities. He said despite trying to defend his artistic rights in this particular case, he had not changed his position on copyright. ""I still encourage anyone to copy, borrow, steal and amend my art for amusement, academic research or activism. I just don't want them to get sole custody of my name."" Rats often appear in Banksy's work Tony the Tiger, a character used on a cereal box, is depicted as a rug It comes as one of Banksy's paintings which shows the House of Commons packed with chimpanzees isset to be auctioned at Sotheby's on Thursday. Kevin Zuchowski-Morrison, owner of street art gallery Rise, said: ""It's incredible that we have this work, very clearly the work of a very famous artist who we all kind of love. It couldn't be any more authentic."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

"Man stabbed to death in front of his childrenChristopher Nicol's children, aged five and six, were in the flat in Greenock when he was violently attacked.Glasgow & West Scotland","Christopher Nicol was found in the flat after reports of a disturbance A man who was murdered in a Greenock flat was ""violently"" stabbed in front of his children, police have said. Christopher Nicol, 27, was attacked inside the property on Maple Road at about 21:05 on Thursday. Officers believe the killer had wrongly thought there was a large sum of cash in the flat, and had intended to rob Mr Nicol. Police said the victim's children, who are aged five and six, were receiving professional support. Officers have launched a murder inquiry, and believe the killer knew Mr Nicol. He entered the property after barging past Mr Nicol's girlfriend when she answered the door. The attacker has been described as being white, aged 20-30, about 5ft 9in tall, with a slim build. He had a local accent, and an unkempt, reddish, brown beard and moustache. Officers say he also had bad teeth, with some visibly missing. He was wearing a black beanie hat with a logo, possibly Timberland, a black top and black jeans or bottoms. Det Ch Insp Martin Fergus described the killing as ""absolutely sickening"". ""At this time we believe that the motive for this was robbery, and that Christopher was targeted specifically because his attacker thought there was a large sum of money in the house - which was not the case. ""For whatever the reason, to carry out such a brutal attack in front of such young children is absolutely sickening. It shows an absolute disregard for their safety or suffering.  This callous killer must be caught. Det Ch Insp Fergus said a public appeal for witnesses and information had been ""disappointing"". ""I believe that the answer to this murder lies in the local community and I am in no doubt that there are people out there who have vital information on this incident, who have not yet come forward,"" he said. ""I would urge them to look to their conscience and contact us. I would like to hear from local people in Greenock to give us details of anyone they know who was out and about in the Maple Road area on Thursday evening. ""The man responsible has quite a distinctive description, so if you have any idea of his identity, then please contact us as soon as possible.""

Johnson: Irish customs checks will be 'reality',"This video can not be played Johnson: ""Critical moment of choice"" on Irish border Boris Johnson says the ""reality"" of Brexit is there will need to be customs checks on the island of Ireland after the UK leaves the EU. But the PM rejected claims that would effectively mean a hard border, in the form of a series of customs posts set five or 10 miles back. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""A sovereign united country must have a single customs territory."" He refused to give details, but said formal proposals would be made soon. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Brexit minister James Duddridge said the government would ""set out more detail on an alternative to the backstop in the coming days"". He also said he wanted to ""assure the House there will be no infrastructure checks or controls at the border"". The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 October. Mr Johnson has said the exit will go ahead with or without a deal - despite MPs passing a law last month forcing him to ask for an extension from the EU if Parliament hasn't voted in favour of a specific deal or leaving without one. The issue of the Irish border - and how to keep it free from border checks when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU - has been a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations. The current government says the solution reached by the EU and Theresa May,the backstop,is unacceptable and an alternative to it must be found. Would a Brexit delay cost the UK Â£400m a week? UK government to reveal detailed Brexit proposals Laura Kuenssberg: Brexit is the key for the PM Mr Johnson was speaking at the start of the third day of the Conservative Party conference in Manchester where ministers have made a raft of policy announcements, including raising the National Living Wage. But the plans have been overshadowed by allegations that Mr Johnson squeezed the thigh of journalist Charlotte Edwards under a table at a lunch in 1999. Asked about the accusation, the PM told BBC Breakfast it was ""not true"", butit was ""inevitable"" he would face ""shot and shell"" because of his stance on Brexit. According to leaked proposals, the government has accepted there must be customs checks on the island of Ireland, but they would be conducted away from the border - mostly where goods originate or at their final destination. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Irish broadcaster RTE had reported that a ""string of customs posts perhaps five to 10 miles away from the frontier"" had been floated by the UK. The prime minister told Breakfast: ""They are not talking about the proposals that we are actually going to be tabling. ""They are talking about some stuff that went in previously."" Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit What will happen in the next month? Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the UK government had promised Ireland and the EU there would be no hard border as a result of Brexit, and they expected that commitment to be honoured. ""No British government should seek to impose customs posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland against the will both of the people in Northern Ireland and the people here in the Republic of Ireland,"" he said. Mr Varadkar went on to say that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there would be checks at ports and airports. Government sources accused unnamed individuals in the European Commission of leaking the suggestion in an effort to create ""a hostile reaction"" to their revised Brexit deal. A European Commission spokesperson said they would not be commenting on the reports, but their position remained that they had ""not received any proposals from the UK that meet all the objectives of the backstop"". Mr Johnson told the BBC he would not reveal details of the proposals to be put to the EU at this stage, but the UK would be making ""a very good offer"". Allow Twitter content?

We don't have the exact proposals from the UK government, but we're beginning to get the shape of it. Yes, there will be customs checks, but no, there won't be a hard border, and no, these checks won't be done five or 10 miles away from the border. The government is saying we can do most of them in the depots and warehouses before lorries even leave. In some instances, there will be physical inspections, but then it will be up to customs authorities to decide where to do them - it might be at the depots or they might want their own physical area to carry them out. The problem with that is the Irish government and the EU don't want any checks at all, because they view them as a hardening of the border even if it isn't a hard border. The view of the British government is that life can't just carry on the same as before because we are leaving and we want to have our own trade policy. Labour's Hilary Benn asked an urgent question in the Commons about the government's plans for the island of Ireland. ""Today there are no border posts or checks on goods crossing the border... and the backstop is there to ensure that remains the case after Brexit. ""The government's position now, however, is that the reality of Brexit will require customs check on the island of Ireland - that is the inexorable logic of the prime minister's statement this morning."" He added: ""It is unacceptable for us to be kept in the dark about what is being proposed in our name on such an important matter."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson spoke to BBC Breakfast about new border proposals. The Northern Irish DUP MP, Gregory Campbell, supported the government and said the House should ""draw a little comfort"" from the fact the EU appeared to have shifted somewhat from its previous position of refusing point blank to re-open the withdrawal agreement. ""At least that is a glimmer of light,"" he said. But the SNP's Peter Grant said the ""future of peace and normality on the island of Ireland will critically depend on the action of this prime minister"" and claimed governments around the EU were beginning to believe Mr Johnson ""could not be trusted"". Earlier, Tory MP and chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group Steve Baker said there would be ""some additional checks"" after Brexit, but that was ""inescapable"". He told BBC News: ""I'm absolutely confident this can be a world class border with a real minimisation of inconvenience to businesses and individuals - consistent with the kind of approach adopted today.""

'Drug poisoning' driving homeless death rise,"Deaths of homeless people have risen by a fifth in a year, the ONS has said. Drug poisoning has contributed to the biggest rise in deaths of homeless people in England and Wales since records began. About 726 homeless people died in 2018, a rise of 22% in one year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Deaths from drugs have more than doubled in the six years the ONS has been recording the data. Housing minister Luke Hall said the figure was ""heartbreaking"" and funding to help rough sleepers was increasing. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said the number of deaths ""shames us all in a nation as decent and well-off as Britain today"". Ben Humberstone from the ONS said the rise was mainly due to an increase in ""drug poisoning"". Kane Walker was found by paramedics in Pershore Street, Birmingham Alexandra Davis lost her brother Kane Walker,who died after taking a fatal dose of heroin in Birmingham city centrein February. She said it was important for people to know how difficult homeless people found it to get help. At Mr Walker's inquest senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull Louise Hunt said help was offered to him, but he had not fully engaged with services. ""I've lost someone that I love,"" Ms Davis said. ""I think the positive thing about talking out about it is to be able to help other people that are on the street struggling with drug addiction. ""There just wasn't enough help out there for him."" Kenneth Lowry has been volunteering in Birmingham for three years feeding the homeless Kenneth Lowry, 46, volunteers with the Birmingham section of the charity CERT UK that serves hot meals to people on the streets. He said the group often feeds more than 140 people and he had served Kane Walker in the past. Mr Lowry said many of the homeless people he had spoken to had ""hit rock bottom"" after falling out with their families. ""The drugs and alcohol numb the pain of the reasons why they are homeless,"" he said. Mr Lowry, who spent a year homeless himself after leaving the army in 2001, said currently there ""wasn't enough support"" available from local authorities and the government. ""They need accommodation,"" he said, adding: ""They're just left on the street to fend for themselves."" Peter Caine (far left) and his group provide supplies for the homeless around Birmingham Charity volunteer Peter Caine said people on the streets were using drugs to get to sleep. ""When you're cold you can't sleep, your body won't let you,"" said the 33-year-old, who works with Helping the Homeless in Birmingham. ""Then somebody says to you 'use this, it'll help you sleep' and they sleep like a baby. It's a very hard thing to resist without the right support."" Mr Caine said with ""fewer police on the streets"" drugs were ""easier to get hold of"". Deaths related to drug poisoning among the homeless increased 55% between 2017 and 2018, compared to a rise of 16% among the population as a whole, the ONS said. Of the 294 estimated deaths from drug poisoning in 2018, the substance detected the most was heroin or morphine, which was identified in 99 cases. This was followed by alcohol, which appeared in 75 cases. The number of deaths where heroin or morphine was detected in 2018 was more than double the number recorded in 2013, while cases where cocaine was identified tripled over the same period. The government said it had brought forward ""new training"" this year for frontline staff in the dangerous effects of new psychoactive substances, such as spice, to help ""engage with and support rough sleepers"" under the influence. The statistics include people sleeping rough or using emergency accommodation such as homeless shelters and hostels at or around the time of death. Government figures suggest there were 4,677 peoplesleeping rough in England in autumn 2018. This was a slight fall on the year before, down 74, but still more than double the number recorded in 2010. The figures are collected by local councils, some of which count people they see sleeping rough on a given night and others provide estimates. In Wales local authorities counted158 people sleeping rough in 2018, down 16% on 2017. Street counts and estimates in Northern Ireland found38 rough sleepers in November 2018,external. The Scottish Government reported2,876 people who applied for help with homelessnesshad slept rough at least once during the three months their application in 2018-19.

""As well as seeing a radical overhaul of social housing provision, we need to ensure that our health services are adequately resourced to provide innovative and integrated models of care for the homeless population."" He described the deaths as ""unacceptable and completely avoidable"". Polly Neate, from the housing charity Shelter, called for all political parties to commit to building the social homes we need to form the bedrock of a more humane housing system."" A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said the figures were a ""sombre reminder"" there was ""still much more to do to tackle homelessness and end rough sleeping for good"". ""Drugs can devastate lives, ruin families and damage communities, which is why we are undertaking a comprehensive review which will help protect the most vulnerable - including homeless individuals - from the harms that drugs cause and give them a chance to recover and turn their lives around,"" he said. ""We are also investing Â£1.2bn to tackle all forms of homelessness and have made the most ambitious change to legislation in a decade,"" the spokesman added.

'No safe system in place' when rail workers killed,"Gareth Delbridge (L) and Michael Lewis (R) were hit by a train in July There was ""no safe system in place"" when two rail workers were hit and killed by a train in July, an initial report has found. Gareth Delbridge, 64, and Michael ""Spike"" Lewis, 58, died on 3 July after being struck near Margam, Port Talbot. A Network Rail and Great Western Railway probe said six staff were working on the line and separated of their own accord into groups of three. This meant there was no official lookout. A person was appointed unofficial lookout, but they became involved in the rail work before the train struck Mr Delbridge, from Kenfig Hill, Bridgend and Mr Lewis, from North Cornelly, Bridgend. The report said it was ""generally accepted"" groups can be about 20 yards apart during work, but the workers split and worked 150 yards apart. The group was working with the line open to trains, with the lookout expected to give 30 seconds' warning time if a train was approaching, the report said. But their distance apart compromised the number of lookouts available and a safe system of working. A Swansea to London Paddington train approached the group at about 70mph, hitting and killing the two workers. A third technician suffered severe shock. The men had been instructed to work on freeing, oiling and retightening bolts by the unofficial person in charge, who was also to act as a lookout. There was a problem with a bolt, meaning the lookout became involved in the rail work and suggested putting further oil on the bolt, despite being instructed to remain in a position of safety. Soon afterwards, Mr Lewis and Mr Delbridge were struck. The report added the team believed they were working in the ""most effective way"" with an experienced team and no evidence of near-misses or accidents. An investigation was launched after the men were killed This ""potentially led to overconfidence and a culture that delivered work 'their way',"" the report said, adding that the work they were undertaking should have required more than three members of staff. The workers were, according to witness statements, all wearing ear defenders, and despite the train driver sounding the horn a number of times, they did not hear it. The report said the driver used a high-low tone of train horn, before two long, continuous blasts in the low tone. Rail death families 'overwhelmed' by support Killed rail workers 'could not hear train' Rail worker killed by train 'loved by everyone' The train involved was the 09:29 from Swansea to London Paddington However, the rule book said: ""Give a series of short, urgent danger warnings to anyoneâ¦who does notâ¦appear to move clear out of the way of the train."" The report said it was ""uncertain"" if using short high-tone warnings could have resulted in track workers becoming aware of the train earlier. The report also found the controller of site safety (COSS) was ""undermined"" by the working group of six splitting into threes, and the COSS had not been involved in preparing the site before their arrival. It stated the safe system of work was ""inadequate"" and resources were ""insufficient"" to apply a safe system of work after the larger group were divided.Â About 180 passengers were on the train at the time of the incident, Great Western Railway said Martin Frobisher, Network Rail's safety director, said:  ""The whole railway family shares the loss of Gareth and Spike. ""Nothing will lessen the pain but understanding what went wrong and learning from that will, I hope, go some way to reassure all those affected that we will do all we can to stop it ever happening again. ""Today is the first step in that journey as we share an initial investigation into what happened. ""We will continue for several months to look deeper into the root causes before we make recommendations for our organisation and all of our people for the future."" Investigators are continuing to gather evidence about the several factors of the report, including the appointment of key roles, the separation of groups, why the team undertook work on the crossing bolts and the intuitiveness in the use of the train warning horn in an emergency.Â The interim report, which has not been finalised, added a series of investigated events over recent years had been identified, with some common circumstances to the key facts found at Margam East Junction.

PM: UK offering 'constructive' Brexit proposals,"This video can not be played PM: Irish customs checks after Brexit can be ""absolutely minimal"" Boris Johnson says the government is offering the EU ""very constructive and far-reaching proposals"" to break the Brexit impasse. Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, he confirmed the UK's plan would include some customs checks on the island of Ireland after Brexit. But they would be ""absolutely minimal"" and ""won't involve new infrastructure"". The EU says it has ""not received any proposals from the UK"" yet that could replace the backstop. The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 October. Mr Johnson has said the exit will go ahead with or without a deal - despite MPs passing a law last month forcing him to ask for an extension from the EU if Parliament hasn't voted in favour of a specific deal or leaving without one. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland has been a contentious part of the Brexit negotiations since day one. At present there are no checks on goods moving across it and the backstop was agreed between former PM Theresa May and the EU as an insurance policy to make sure that does not change - and that no infrastructure like cameras or security posts can be installed in the future. If used, the backstop would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks was agreed. However, the government says it is ""undemocratic"" and unacceptable. Full transcript of PM's interview Would a Brexit delay cost the UK Â£400m a week? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Speaking on day three of the Conservative conference, Mr Johnson said he believed the UK was offering enough to win the EU round and more detail would be made public soon. ""Yes, I absolutely do,"" he insisted. ""So, with great respect to all those who are currently anxious about it - and particularly in Ireland - we do think that our proposals are good and creative. ""But I accept also... there may be hard yards ahead."" He added: ""That is going to be where the argument is going to be - and that's where the negotiations will be tough."" This video can not be played ""Keep hope alive"" for a Brexit breakthrough, PM urges The PM said there would ""have to be a system for customs checks away from the border"". ""If the EU is going to insist on customs checks... then we will have to accept that reality,"" he added. When it was put to him that it was not the EU who were insisting on customs checks, the PM replied: ""Well, let's see where we get to. And as you know, we made some very constructive and far-reaching proposals."" The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there would need to be checks at ports, airports and perhaps at the border. Conference pledges but Brexit is the key for the PM Theresa May has 'no regrets over career' But he said that would only be the case if the UK left without an agreement, telling the Dail: ""We've never been in the position of signing up to checks as part of a deal."" Mr Johnson told Laura Kuenssberg he always knew ""things would get choppy"" in the lead up to the Brexit deadline. But the PM believed ""fevers would cool"" and ""tempers would come down"" once that moment had passed. ""There's no way of getting Brexit done without... displeasing people who don't want Brexit to get done,"" he said. ""[There is] no way of delivering Brexit sort of 52% Brexit and 48% Remain - that's just logically impossible."" Mr Johnson added: ""I think once we get it done, and once we can begin building a new partnership with our new friends... we can start thinking about how we can do things differently."" At a reception hosted by the DUP at the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Tuesday night, Mr Johnson said the UK had made progress in the negotiations, adding: ""I hope very much in the next few days we are going to get there."" The prime minster said that Northern Ireland should remain part of the United Kingdom ""forever"". Please upgrade your browser The government has made a number of policy announcements at the conference, from raising the National Living Wage over the next five years to toughening prison sentences for the worst offenders. But the plans have been overshadowed by allegations that Mr Johnson squeezed the thigh of journalist Charlotte Edwardes under a table at a lunch in 1999. Mr Johnson has repeatedly denied the incident, telling the BBC: ""It's simply not true."" He would not answer whether he thought Ms Edwardes - who has stood by her claims - lied or whether he remembered the lunch. And while the PM said such allegations should be taken seriously, he did not agree to an investigation, saying he wanted to ""get on with delivering on... [the] important issue of our domestic agenda"".

Brexit customs plan 'non starter',"The proposals could mean customs sites created on both sides of the border Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said the Republic is ""not going to allow ourselves to be dragged out of the single market"". Speaking in the DÃ¡il, he also welcomed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's rejection of a proposal for custom sites near to the border. The taoiseach said the UK government should not ""impose"" customs checks ""against the will of the people"". He was echoing calls made by Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney. Johnson rejects leaks over Irish border plan UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiations Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Responding to a question from People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, Mr Varadkar said the Republic would not be left in the ""worst of all worlds"" but not introducing border checks in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The taoiseach has said the Republic will not be ""dragged out"" of the single market He said not doing so could mean Irish businesses ""facing checks in Rotterdam, and in Zeebrugge, and in Calais"". ""We certainly can't allow ourselves out of belligerence to end up in a situation whereby we are surrounded by a border on all sides, and that is certainly not a situation we want to be in,"" he said. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. On Monday night,Irish national broadcaster RTÃ,externalsaid the UK suggested 'customs clearance zones' on both sides of the Irish border could replace the backstop. However, on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsondenied tabling that proposal. But, in a separate interview, he accepted that some kind of customs checks would be necessary. Proposals for reaching a Brexit deal had been expected ahead of a crucial EU summit on 17 October. The BBC understands that any further customs inspections would be very limited. Political correspondent Iain Watson said they could be conducted either at new locations or at existing business premises. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The proposals would mean posts created on both sides of the border, potentially five to 10 miles back from the land frontier. RTÃ said consignments would be checked and cleared at the sites, with data being provided to the customs authorities on both sides of the border. Goods moving from a customs clearance site on the northern side of the border to a similar site on the southern side would be monitored in real time using GPS via mobile phone data or tracking devices placed on trucks or vans. In the Lords on Tuesday, former Police Ombudsman Baroness Nuala O'Loan said the risk of attack on any physical infrastructure was very high. She told the chamber dissident republicans are very active, while recent comments from the UVF indicate they could enter into violence if the situation deteriorates. The ideas are believed to be contained in one of four so-called non-papers submitted by UK officials during recent technical discussions in Brussels. In a tweet, TÃ¡naiste (Ireland's deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney said the proposals were a ""non-starter"", adding Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ""deserve better"". A spokesman for the Irish government said: ""The EU Task force has indicated that any non-papers it has received from the UK to date fall well short of the agreed aims and objectives of the backstop."" Reaction to 'customs clearance zones' suggestion BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said if the customs sites plan was to become the official UK position, it would be dismissed and rejected by the EU as insufficient. Julian Smith said customs facilities were ""not possible"" in many locations in Northern Ireland However, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith said he had not seen reports about custom clearance centres and did not know where the claims had come from. ""The border in Northern Ireland is not just the border, it's the area around the border so I'm very clear on that,"" Mr Smith told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. He added that the prime minister was ""fully committed"" to the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly said Monday night's reports had caused ""surprise and dismay"" to many in Northern Ireland. She asked the minister to engage with Northern Ireland businesses in order to make it clear that creating facilities set back from the border is not government policy as this would constitute a hard border. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, and Mr Johnson has said this will happen whether or not there is a new deal with Brussels. Currently, there are no border posts, physical barriers or checks on people or goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The backstop is a measure in the withdrawal agreement, between Theresa May and the EU, which is designed to ensure that continues after the UK leaves the EU. It comes into effect only if the deal deciding the future relationship between the UK and EU is not agreed by the end of the transition period. UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiations What are the Brexit backstop options? 8% of border freight 'could be checked' Currently, there are no border posts, physical barriers or checks on people or goods crossing the border 'Smugglers' charter' Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary-Lou McDonald told the BBC's Today programme the plan was ""essentially the re-imposition of a hard border on Ireland"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the proposals failed to meet the UK's obligations to avoid physical infrastructure. ""It doesn't matter if it's a mile, five miles or 10 miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable,"" he said. AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said if the proposals were true, they showed the government had not listened to business in Northern Ireland. He also said the move ""ripped up"" the joint declaration of December 2017 between the EU and UK. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The border blocking Brexit,"This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists ""there is a way"" to avoid checks along the Irish border after Brexit. But why has the Irish border remained a major sticking point in the Brexit negotiations? If Brexit happens, the 310-mile Irish border will represent the only land border between the UK and the EU. As well as no longer being in the EU, Northern Ireland is likely to end up with different rules and standards to its neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. That's because the UK intends to leave the customs union and single market - arrangements designed to make trade easier between EU countries. Lorries travelling to the EU from Northern Ireland would be required to stop at the border for document checks and some product inspections. This would be to ensure their goods meet EU standards. Following incidents likefoot-and-mouth disease,externaland thehorse meat scandal, the EU is very strict about these requirements. In theory, such checks would mean things like cameras and security posts, creating a so-called ""hard border"". Concerns have been raised that the return of a hard border couldjeopardise the Good Friday Agreement. This helped bring the period of violence in Northern Irelandknown as ""The Troubles""to an end. Boris Johnson says there are ""abundant"" technological solutions UK and EU Brexit negotiators came up with a solution - known as the Irish backstop - to avoid border checks. If used, the backstop would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks is agreed. However, the backstop proved unacceptable to many Conservative MPs, who feared the UK would be trapped in it indefinitely. Their opposition eventually led toTheresa May's resignation as prime minister. Boris Johnson, the new prime minister, said a revised Brexit deal must include ""the abolition of the backstop"". He says the current solution would mean ""signing away"" the UK's ""economic independence"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A ""wealth of solutions"" including technology could replace the the backstop and avoid the need for a hard border, Boris Johnson said during the Tory leadership campaign. Supporters say custom checks could be done at warehouses before lorries set off. Mobile phone technology or microchips on lorries, would track goods and avoid the need for border posts. However, the EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has said it will consider other solutions to the Irish border problem, but only once the current Brexit deal has been signed off. It has also expressed doubts about a technological solution. The problem with just relying on technology, is that EU law also require some products to be physically checked - chemicals and food are among them. Single UK-Irish food zone suggested by report Border technology 'could take 10 years' Why are vets being recruited in Ireland? Alongside technology, Mr Johnson has also talked about a trusted trader scheme. Businesses would be allowed to by-pass checks once they've proven to be trustworthy and have met certain standards. For it to work, the UK would need to persuade the EU to recognise it. But setting up such a scheme would a take a lot of time and cost a lot of money. The UK would also need to come up with an effective way of enforcing it and prevent smuggling. Another solution that has been proposed is to allow agriculture checks to take place in""mobile units away from the border"".,external However, existing EU law states that animal checks must take place at designated Border Inspections Posts (BIPs)""in the immediate vicinity of the point of entry"",external- which would include the Irish border. The EU says ""geographic constraints"" are the only exception (eg mountains, cliffs, valleys, rivers). In these cases, ""a certain distance from the point of introduction may be tolerated."" So getting the EU to allow checks to take place away from the border, for non-geographic reasons, would require a change in the rules. DUP leader Arlene Foster also believes technology and other solutions can prevent a hard border after Brexit Mr Johnson has also suggested the idea ofan all-Ireland food standards zone. In other words, Northern Ireland would keep the same food and animal standards as the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. However, it's unclear how food and animal products would be separated from other trade in order to prevent smuggling. If smuggling was to occur, it could threaten the integrity of the single market. But some say the UK could go further and agree a Northern Ireland-only backstop. This would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union and parts of the single market - eliminating the need for any cross-border checks. But the DUP, which supports the Conservatives in government, has previously rejected the idea of a Northern Ireland backstop on the basis it would create checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. No-one has started building border posts and the UK and Irish governments say they do not want a hard border. So there is a very real question, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, about who would actually install the border posts if the EU insist they're necessary.

Flood warnings issued as rain lashes UK,"This video can not be played Residents were trapped in their homes in the village of Laxey on the Isle of Man More rain and winds are expected in parts of the country later this week as the remnants of ex-Hurricane Lorenzo arrive in the UK. The storm -the most powerful hurricane ever recordedin the far east Atlantic - will have lost most of its power by the time it arrives on Thursday. It comes after torrential rain brought flash flooding and led to some places being evacuated on Tuesday. On the Isle of Man amajor incident was declaredwith people trapped indoors. Elsewhere, some areas in the Midlands, Wales and southern England were hit by a week's rain in just an hour, as thunderstorms swept across the UK. Roads and railways were closed and some flights from London's Heathrow Airport were delayed on Tuesday evening due to the bad weather. Dozens of flood warnings and alertsremain in place,externalacross England. Major incident as people trapped by flooding Hurricane Lorenzo breaks record in mid-Atlantic How do hurricanes form? Louise Lear, from BBC Weather, said temperatures would turn colder on Wednesday before an area of low pressure - carrying gale-force gusts and the remnants of former Hurricane Lorenzo - approached Northern Ireland on Thursday. The low pressure would move eastwards and south during Thursday and into Friday, bringing ""a spell of wet and windy weather"", she said. Thursday and Friday will see wind and rain hit western parts of the UK, BBC Weather said The Met Office said Northern Ireland, western Scotland, Wales and south-west England will most likely be affected. On Tuesday, the Met Office issued issued a yellow warning for heavy rain across large parts of central and southern England and Wales. On the Isle of Man,the village of Laxey was cut offafter its second major flood in four years. The river that gave the village its name burst its banks, leaving people trapped in their homes and washing away cars. The fire service helped to evacuate several houses, while a coastguard helicopter was flown in on standby. The village was previously flooded in 2015, when a 200-year-old stone bridge was washed away. One villager told the BBC that this year's flooding was the worst he had seen. Local residents make their way through floodwater in Cossington, Leicester Also in Cossington, a clean-up operation is under way at a flooded home Flights from Heathrow were delayed on Tuesday evening because of ""poor weather conditions across London and the South East"", a spokeswoman for the airport said. And the Thames Barrier closed for the second time in a week to protect London from flooding. In Cornwall, floods caused by a coastal surge meant people were told to leave caravans and seaside properties.

A woman wades through floodwater in Alum Rock, Birmingham Commuters shelter from the rain under umbrellas in Queen Square, Bristol Up to 50mm (2 ins) of rain fell in a couple of hours in some places. By Tuesday afternoon, the highest hourly rainfall was 25.6mm, recorded at Pennerley in Shropshire. That part of the country normally receives just 96mm of rain in the whole of October. But the localised nature of the downpours means the heaviest rainfall may not be recorded by a weather station, the Met Office said. Worcestershire was one place that experienced torrential rainfall, with the fire and rescue service issuing a warning to drivers after a car was submerged in floods. Allow Twitter content?

Meghan calls for gender equality in SA universities,"The Duchess of Sussex has spoken about the importance of supporting victims of gender-based violence. Meghan was speaking to girls and campaigners in Johannesburg on the penultimate day of her and Prince Harry's South Africa tour. The duchess said the country was in a ""crisis state"" when it comes to gender-based violence, after a spate of attacks against women in the country. She also emphasised the importance of mental health support in aftercare. The Sussexes are on a 10-day tour in whichPrince Harry has visited a minefieldand Meghan andtheir baby son Archie met Archbishop Desmond Tutu. At a visit to ActionAid on Tuesday, Meghan said the age range of those experiencing violence was ""really staggering"" and agreed that men and boys should be held accountable for their actions. During her visit she also heard from charity workers how many girls feel unsafe at school. ""The trouble is as a young girl if you are not feeling safe at school and not feeling safe at home, where does that leave you? And that really is systemic. That is a huge issue,"" Meghan said. ""You will feel very displaced."" The duchess, who was taking part in a discussion, also said it was important victims feel supported when they report such violence. ""And when they tell somebody, someone does something. That's the other issue right? It's so key being able to feel that they can communicate what's happening when something goes wrong, whatever it is,"" she said. Meghan: I'm in South Africa as your sister Meghan and Harry visit South Africa's oldest mosque Baby Archie makes appearance on royal tour Earlier, Meghan spoke to students and academics during another discussion on gender issues at the University of Johannesburg. She said support was needed for women in higher education in South Africa. ""When a women is empowered it changes absolutely everything in the community,"" she told the group. The duchess announced three new ""gender grants"" for the University of Johannesburg, Stellenbosch University and the University of Western Cape at the beginning of Tuesday's discussion with the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU). It is the penultimate day of the Sussexes' overseas tour Well-wishers cheered Meghan on at the University of Johannesburg ""The goal here is to be able to have gender equality, to be able to support women as they are working in research and higher education roles,"" she told the discussion group. ""True to what you said, when a women is empowered it changes absolutely everything in the community and starting an educational atmosphere is really a key point of that,"" she added. Meghan said she was only able to go to university herself because of financial help from a scholarship and ""families chipping in"". ""If you don't have the support that is necessary that you feel that you can keep taking the next step then you're stunted in growth,"" she said. Meghan attended a roundtable discussion about the challenges faced by young women in accessing higher education Well-wishers cheered as the duchess was greeted by the ACU's secretary general, Dr Joanna Newman, and Prof Tshilidzi Marwala, vice chancellor of the university. Meanwhile, the Duke of Sussex told a group of young people to ""hold on to your dreams"" as he visited a health centre in a remote village in Malawi. Sitting outside the Mauwa Health Centre, they discussed sexual health but also touched on climate change and conservation. A health official said: ""They asked him what challenges he faced when growing up and he did have challenges but he said they were not similar as the context was different. The official added that the prince also urged the youngsters to ""show kindness, empathy and work together."" Prince Harry was speaking in a village in rural Malawi The prince had travelled to the village near Blantyre to see the pharmacy-in-a-box project, funded by the UK and US governments. The pharmacies are prefabricated, solar-powered and air-conditioned storage facilities for medicines, which keep drugs secure, held at the right temperature, and stocked up. At the health centre, patients can access a range of services from malaria treatment to a maternity unit, as well as HIV testing and aftercare for those who have the virus. Speaking about the drugs used to treat an HIV patient, Prince Harry said: ""You need to know your status and know there's medication, so you can have a happy and healthy life.""

'Banksy' display appears in Croydon town centre,"This video can not be played Banksy shop featuring Stormzy stab vest has appeared in London Elusive artist Banksy has set up a shop in south London featuring the stab vest he designed for Stormzy's headline act at the Glastonbury Festival. A Tony the Tiger rug and a cradle surrounded by CCTV cameras are also on show as part of the venture, at a disused retail outlet in Croydon. The shop appeared overnight on Church Street. ""I'm opening a shop today,"" the artist said on Instagram. ""Although the doors don't actually open."" Banksy said he was going to sell products online and people could visit the shop for the next two weeks. Items that will be available to buy are on display in Croydon He added he was being ""forced"" to launch the online shop  - called Gross Domestic Product - because a greeting cards company was attempting to legally trade using his name. The artist is being advised that opening a shop which sold his merchandise would help him protect the trademark on his art. In a statement, Banksy said: ""A greetings cards company is contesting the trademark I hold to my art, and attempting to take custody of my name so they can sell their fake Banksy merchandise legally. ""I think they're banking on the idea I won't show up in court to defend myself."" The exhibition has been called Gross Domestic Product The grime artist is from Croydon Items being sold in the shop include welcome mats made from life vests salvaged from the shores of the Mediterranean, which have been hand-stitched by women in detainment camps in Greece. There are also disco balls made from police riot helmets and a toddler's counting toy where children are encouraged to load wooden migrant figures inside a haulage truck. Banksy said proceeds would go towards buying a new migrant rescue boat to replace one allegedly confiscated by Italian authorities. He said despite trying to defend his artistic rights in this particular case, he had not changed his position on copyright. ""I still encourage anyone to copy, borrow, steal and amend my art for amusement, academic research or activism. I just don't want them to get sole custody of my name."" Rats often appear in Banksy's work Tony the Tiger, a character used on a cereal box, is depicted as a rug It comes as one of Banksy's paintings which shows the House of Commons packed with chimpanzees isset to be auctioned at Sotheby's on Thursday. Kevin Zuchowski-Morrison, owner of street art gallery Rise, said: ""It's incredible that we have this work, very clearly the work of a very famous artist who we all kind of love.

"'Drug poisoning' driving homeless death riseThe Office for National Statistics says there has been a ""significant rise"" in the deaths of homeless people.England","Deaths of homeless people have risen by a fifth in a year, the ONS has said. Drug poisoning has contributed to the biggest rise in deaths of homeless people in England and Wales since records began. About 726 homeless people died in 2018, a rise of 22% in one year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Deaths from drugs have more than doubled in the six years the ONS has been recording the data. Housing minister Luke Hall said the figure was ""heartbreaking"" and funding to help rough sleepers was increasing. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said the number of deaths ""shames us all in a nation as decent and well-off as Britain today"". Ben Humberstone from the ONS said the rise was mainly due to an increase in ""drug poisoning"". Kane Walker was found by paramedics in Pershore Street, Birmingham Alexandra Davis lost her brother Kane Walker,who died after taking a fatal dose of heroin in Birmingham city centrein February. She said it was important for people to know how difficult homeless people found it to get help. At Mr Walker's inquest senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull Louise Hunt said help was offered to him, but he had not fully engaged with services. ""I've lost someone that I love,"" Ms Davis said. ""I think the positive thing about talking out about it is to be able to help other people that are on the street struggling with drug addiction. ""There just wasn't enough help out there for him."" Kenneth Lowry has been volunteering in Birmingham for three years feeding the homeless Kenneth Lowry, 46, volunteers with the Birmingham section of the charity CERT UK that serves hot meals to people on the streets. He said the group often feeds more than 140 people and he had served Kane Walker in the past. Mr Lowry said many of the homeless people he had spoken to had ""hit rock bottom"" after falling out with their families. ""The drugs and alcohol numb the pain of the reasons why they are homeless,"" he said. Mr Lowry, who spent a year homeless himself after leaving the army in 2001, said currently there ""wasn't enough support"" available from local authorities and the government. ""They need accommodation,"" he said, adding: ""They're just left on the street to fend for themselves."" Peter Caine (far left) and his group provide supplies for the homeless around Birmingham Charity volunteer Peter Caine said people on the streets were using drugs to get to sleep. ""When you're cold you can't sleep, your body won't let you,"" said the 33-year-old, who works with Helping the Homeless in Birmingham. ""Then somebody says to you 'use this, it'll help you sleep' and they sleep like a baby. It's a very hard thing to resist without the right support."" Mr Caine said with ""fewer police on the streets"" drugs were ""easier to get hold of"". Deaths related to drug poisoning among the homeless increased 55% between 2017 and 2018, compared to a rise of 16% among the population as a whole, the ONS said. Of the 294 estimated deaths from drug poisoning in 2018, the substance detected the most was heroin or morphine, which was identified in 99 cases. This was followed by alcohol, which appeared in 75 cases. The number of deaths where heroin or morphine was detected in 2018 was more than double the number recorded in 2013, while cases where cocaine was identified tripled over the same period. The government said it had brought forward ""new training"" this year for frontline staff in the dangerous effects of new psychoactive substances, such as spice, to help ""engage with and support rough sleepers"" under the influence. The statistics include people sleeping rough or using emergency accommodation such as homeless shelters and hostels at or around the time of death. Government figures suggest there were 4,677 peoplesleeping rough in England in autumn 2018. This was a slight fall on the year before, down 74, but still more than double the number recorded in 2010. The figures are collected by local councils, some of which count people they see sleeping rough on a given night and others provide estimates. In Wales local authorities counted158 people sleeping rough in 2018, down 16% on 2017. Street counts and estimates in Northern Ireland found38 rough sleepers in November 2018,external. The Scottish Government reported2,876 people who applied for help with homelessnesshad slept rough at least once during the three months their application in 2018-19.

""As well as seeing a radical overhaul of social housing provision, we need to ensure that our health services are adequately resourced to provide innovative and integrated models of care for the homeless population."" He described the deaths as ""unacceptable and completely avoidable"". Polly Neate, from the housing charity Shelter, called for all political parties to commit to building the social homes we need to form the bedrock of a more humane housing system."" A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said the figures were a ""sombre reminder"" there was ""still much more to do to tackle homelessness and end rough sleeping for good"". ""Drugs can devastate lives, ruin families and damage communities, which is why we are undertaking a comprehensive review which will help protect the most vulnerable - including homeless individuals - from the harms that drugs cause and give them a chance to recover and turn their lives around,"" he said. ""We are also investing Â£1.2bn to tackle all forms of homelessness and have made the most ambitious change to legislation in a decade,"" the spokesman added.

"Man stabbed to death in front of his childrenChristopher Nicol, 27, was found inside the property on Maple Road in Greenock on Thursday.Glasgow & West Scotland","Christopher Nicol was found in the flat after reports of a disturbance A man who was murdered in a Greenock flat was ""violently"" stabbed in front of his children, police have said. Christopher Nicol, 27, was attacked inside the property on Maple Road at about 21:05 on Thursday. Officers believe the killer had wrongly thought there was a large sum of cash in the flat, and had intended to rob Mr Nicol. Police said the victim's children, who are aged five and six, were receiving professional support. Officers have launched a murder inquiry, and believe the killer knew Mr Nicol. He entered the property after barging past Mr Nicol's girlfriend when she answered the door. The attacker has been described as being white, aged 20-30, about 5ft 9in tall, with a slim build. He had a local accent, and an unkempt, reddish, brown beard and moustache. Officers say he also had bad teeth, with some visibly missing. He was wearing a black beanie hat with a logo, possibly Timberland, a black top and black jeans or bottoms. Det Ch Insp Martin Fergus described the killing as ""absolutely sickening"". ""At this time we believe that the motive for this was robbery, and that Christopher was targeted specifically because his attacker thought there was a large sum of money in the house - which was not the case. ""For whatever the reason, to carry out such a brutal attack in front of such young children is absolutely sickening. It shows an absolute disregard for their safety or suffering.  This callous killer must be caught. Det Ch Insp Fergus said a public appeal for witnesses and information had been ""disappointing"". ""I believe that the answer to this murder lies in the local community and I am in no doubt that there are people out there who have vital information on this incident, who have not yet come forward,"" he said. ""I would urge them to look to their conscience and contact us. I would like to hear from local people in Greenock to give us details of anyone they know who was out and about in the Maple Road area on Thursday evening. ""The man responsible has quite a distinctive description, so if you have any idea of his identity, then please contact us as soon as possible.""

Brexit border customs plan 'non starter',"The proposals could mean customs sites created on both sides of the border Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said the Republic is ""not going to allow ourselves to be dragged out of the single market"". Speaking in the DÃ¡il, he also welcomed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's rejection of a proposal for custom sites near to the border. The taoiseach said the UK government should not ""impose"" customs checks ""against the will of the people"". He was echoing calls made by Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney. Johnson rejects leaks over Irish border plan UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiations Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Responding to a question from People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, Mr Varadkar said the Republic would not be left in the ""worst of all worlds"" but not introducing border checks in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The taoiseach has said the Republic will not be ""dragged out"" of the single market He said not doing so could mean Irish businesses ""facing checks in Rotterdam, and in Zeebrugge, and in Calais"". ""We certainly can't allow ourselves out of belligerence to end up in a situation whereby we are surrounded by a border on all sides, and that is certainly not a situation we want to be in,"" he said. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. On Monday night,Irish national broadcaster RTÃ,externalsaid the UK suggested 'customs clearance zones' on both sides of the Irish border could replace the backstop. However, on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsondenied tabling that proposal. But, in a separate interview, he accepted that some kind of customs checks would be necessary. Proposals for reaching a Brexit deal had been expected ahead of a crucial EU summit on 17 October. The BBC understands that any further customs inspections would be very limited. Political correspondent Iain Watson said they could be conducted either at new locations or at existing business premises. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The proposals would mean posts created on both sides of the border, potentially five to 10 miles back from the land frontier. RTÃ said consignments would be checked and cleared at the sites, with data being provided to the customs authorities on both sides of the border. Goods moving from a customs clearance site on the northern side of the border to a similar site on the southern side would be monitored in real time using GPS via mobile phone data or tracking devices placed on trucks or vans. In the Lords on Tuesday, former Police Ombudsman Baroness Nuala O'Loan said the risk of attack on any physical infrastructure was very high. She told the chamber dissident republicans are very active, while recent comments from the UVF indicate they could enter into violence if the situation deteriorates. The ideas are believed to be contained in one of four so-called non-papers submitted by UK officials during recent technical discussions in Brussels. In a tweet, TÃ¡naiste (Ireland's deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney said the proposals were a ""non-starter"", adding Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ""deserve better"". A spokesman for the Irish government said: ""The EU Task force has indicated that any non-papers it has received from the UK to date fall well short of the agreed aims and objectives of the backstop."" Reaction to 'customs clearance zones' suggestion BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said if the customs sites plan was to become the official UK position, it would be dismissed and rejected by the EU as insufficient. Julian Smith said customs facilities were ""not possible"" in many locations in Northern Ireland However, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith said he had not seen reports about custom clearance centres and did not know where the claims had come from. ""The border in Northern Ireland is not just the border, it's the area around the border so I'm very clear on that,"" Mr Smith told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. He added that the prime minister was ""fully committed"" to the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly said Monday night's reports had caused ""surprise and dismay"" to many in Northern Ireland. She asked the minister to engage with Northern Ireland businesses in order to make it clear that creating facilities set back from the border is not government policy as this would constitute a hard border. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, and Mr Johnson has said this will happen whether or not there is a new deal with Brussels. Currently, there are no border posts, physical barriers or checks on people or goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The backstop is a measure in the withdrawal agreement, between Theresa May and the EU, which is designed to ensure that continues after the UK leaves the EU. It comes into effect only if the deal deciding the future relationship between the UK and EU is not agreed by the end of the transition period. UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiations What are the Brexit backstop options? 8% of border freight 'could be checked' Currently, there are no border posts, physical barriers or checks on people or goods crossing the border 'Smugglers' charter' Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary-Lou McDonald told the BBC's Today programme the plan was ""essentially the re-imposition of a hard border on Ireland"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the proposals failed to meet the UK's obligations to avoid physical infrastructure. ""It doesn't matter if it's a mile, five miles or 10 miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable,"" he said. AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said if the proposals were true, they showed the government had not listened to business in Northern Ireland. He also said the move ""ripped up"" the joint declaration of December 2017 between the EU and UK. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iran court sentences âUS spyâ to death,"The announcement comes at a time of escalating tension between Iran and the US Iran's judiciary says it has convicted three people of spying for the US, sentencing one of them to death, and another person of spying for the UK. Spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said two men, Ali Nafariyeh and Mohammadali Babapour, had received 10-year prison sentences for working for the CIA. Mohammad Amin Nasab was jailed for 10 years for aiding British intelligence. Mr Esmaili said he would not identify the person sentenced to death because the verdict was subject to appeal. It was not clear if any of those convicted were among17 people who Iran's intelligence ministry said had been arrested for spying for the CIA earlier this year.

Mr Esmaili also confirmed on Tuesday that the Iranian authorities had arrested the British-Iranian anthropologist Kameel Ahmady. Kameel Ahmady's wife said he was arrested at their home in western Iran in August Mr Ahmady was being investigated on suspicion of ""links to foreign countries and institutes affiliated with foreign [intelligence] services"", he said.

Farah's ex-coach Salazar gets four-year ban,"Salazar (centre) alongside Farah (right) and training partner Galen Rupp (left) at the London 2012 Olympics Alberto Salazar - Mo Farah's former athletics coach - has been banned from the sport for four years after being found guilty of doping violations. Salazar runs the Nike Oregon Project - home to British four-time Olympic champion Farah from 2011 until 2017. The decision follows a four-year investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) and a two-year court battle behind closed doors. American Salazar said he was ""shocked"" by the outcome and would appeal. ""The Oregon Project has never and will never permit doping,"" the 61-year-old added. ""I will appeal and look forward to this unfair and protracted process reaching the conclusion I know to be true."" Dr Jeffrey Brown, a Nike-paid endocrinologist who treated many of Salazar's athletes, has also been banned for four years. Farah split with Salazar in 2017, which the BBC can reveal was the same year the coach was first charged by Usada. The 36-year-old, also a six-time world champion, said: ""I'm relieved that Usada has, after four years, completed their investigation into Alberto Salazar. ""I left the Nike Oregon Project in 2017 but, as I've always said, I have no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line. I'm glad there has finally been a conclusion."" The Briton has never failed a drugs test and has always strongly denied breaking any rules. The inside story of Salazar's downfall The investigation began after aBBC Panorama programme in 2015. An independent panel found Salazar and Brown possessed and trafficked a banned performance-enhancing substance and administered or attempted to administer a prohibited method to multiple track and field athletes. It added that Salazar ""tampered and/or attempted to tamper with the doping control process"". The panel also said Salazar and Brown ""communicated repeatedly about the athletes of the Nike Oregon Project's (NOP) performance and medical conditions, exchanging information without any apparent formal authorisation by the athletes at the NOP or distinction between Dr Brown's role as an athlete's physician and NOP consultant. ""[Salazar] and Brown shared information with the aim of improving the athletes' performance via medical intervention, with a particular interest in increasing testosterone levels."" Usada chief executive Travis Tygart praised athletes for having the ""courage to speak out and ultimately expose the truth"". ""While acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr Salazar and Dr Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect,"" a statement added. Doping charges against Salazar and Dr Brown were brought by Usada in June 2017. The pair contested the charges, supported by Nike-paid lawyers, and the case went to the American Arbitration Association. The Panorama programme, a joint investigation with the American website ProPublica, revealedallegations of doping and unethical practicesat the US training base in Beaverton, Oregon in 2015. UK Athletics (UKA), the sport's UK governing body, conducted its own review into the claims, and gave Farah the green light to continue working with Cuban-born Salazar. Farahannounced he was leaving Salazarin October 2017, the same year he was knighted, but denied his decision was to do with the doping claims. During his time at the NOP, 5,000m and 10,000m runner Farah won six world titles and four Olympic gold medals. Farah quit running track races in 2017, deciding to concentrate on the marathon, but earlier this year said he might return to the track for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Salazar, who coaches several athletes at the World Athletics Championships in Doha but has had his accreditation revoked, added: ""Throughout this six-year investigation my athletes and I have endured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from Usada. ""This is demonstrated by the misleading statement released by Travis Tygart stating that we put winning ahead of athlete safety. This is completely false and contrary to the findings of the arbitrators, who even wrote about the care I took in complying with the world anti-doping code. ""I have always ensured the World Anti-Doping Agency code is strictly followed."" Nikesaid the decision had ""nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete"". ""As the panel noted, they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the World Anti-Doping code,"" it said. ""We support Alberto in his decision to appeal and wish him the full measure of due process that the rules require. Nike does not condone the use of banned substances in any manner."" UK Athleticssaid it ""acknowledged the announcement made by Usada"" and ""will now review the arbitration decision in full prior to making any further comment"". It added: ""It should be noted that at all times UK Athletics fully cooperated with both Usada and UK Anti-doping throughout the investigations. ""Furthermore, the Performance Oversight Committee's own investigation in 2015 was restricted to the interaction of the Nike Oregon Project with Mo Farah and not an anti-doping investigation. Such investigations can and should only be undertaken by the relevant anti-doping authorities. ""UK Athletics is 100% committed to clean athletics."" British former heptathleteDenise Lewis, who won gold at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, has described the news as ""very disappointing"", adding that is casts ""a shadow over the World Athletics Championships"". She told BBC Breakfast: ""I looked at the Usada report and it makes for very grim reading. ""If he is guilty of these allegations, then I really think it's a very sad indictment and sad that a coach who is so reputable and has had the trust of so many athletes over the years has gone down this route. ""On the positive, it is good news that coaches are finally being sanctioned and banned from the sport, even though it's only four years.""

Conference pledges but Brexit is the key for the PM,"Conferences are always a parallel universe. But this week in Manchester takes that to the extreme. On theconference platformspeaker after speaker is outlining the promises the Tory party is presenting as a rough draft of their election manifesto - ""schools, cops and docs"" one cabinet minister joked. But the chances of the Tory party with Boris Johnson as its leader having an uneventful week at a time like this were always extremely low. That's not just because theprime minister has to confront allegationsabout his own behaviour in years gone by. But also because it's Brexit that will make or break this prime minister, and potentially this party too. And the conversations that will decide the fate of that process are taking place elsewhere. UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiations How are the UK's talks with the EU going? What are the Brexit backstop options? Despite the briefing wars of the last few weeks between London and Brussels, this process is (again you might wonder) about to reach a point of decision. Not the final decision on whether there is a deal, but whether both sides are going genuinely to try to find a conclusion. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has been holding talks with the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier I understand the government has now  completed alegal text of the dealthey believe could be done, after the ""non-paper"" papers process, which dipped the toes in the water last week. That will be put in front of the EU in the next few days and senior government figures talk of proposals and activity being stepped up by the end of this week. And once a proposed deal is on the table,  the hope on the UK side is that the negotiators enter ""the tunnel"" - the process Theresa May's officials went into when the deal that was finally agreed was hammered out. Much to the frustration of the outside world (journalists included), the to and fro of the briefing war, and the pantomime was called off during that time to enable the final bits of negotiation to be completed with a relatively low level of political noise outside. The hope then, is that could allow both sides to budge a little to reach an agreement. And while not cheerful about the prospects of achieving an agreement, government insiders say repeatedly, perhaps wrong headedly, that the tone in private is distinctly more positive than the public criticisms of any proposals the UK has put forward. We'll see. It is perfectly possible that the EU takes a look at the text once it lands and concludes that it just does not go far enough to meet its objectives - or shrinks back from the agreement they made with Theresa May too much to make it palatable. The EU has real concerns about protecting Ireland and also the single market. But the decision that will be made in the next few days on whether to try to get a deal over the line is a political choice as well as a policy decision. Will they consider it worth giving Mr Johnson's deal a try? Or is it better to wait until the outcome of a likely election to make a decision. One figure involved in the talks told me the EU's habits up until now suggest they are more likely to sit it out - wait and see. It's not necessarily that that EU is not willing to make even tiny concessions ever, but there is  consideration over when it is the right time to do so, when the political situation in the UK is so unstable. One diplomatic source, when asked if there was a way to tweak the deal, to use the political phrase, put lipstick on the pig, told me, ""we do have a lipstick in our pocket, but we can only use it once"". Timing and trust may be everything. And we may know in a matter of days, not weeks, if there is a real chance of Boris Johnson achieving a deal.

Harland and Wolff saved from closure,"Belfast's Harland and Wolff shipyard has been sold, saving it from closure. The yard, best known for building the Titanic, was bought for Â£6m by the London-based energy firm, InfraStrata. Harland and Wolff went into administration in August, putting about 120 jobs at risk, after the collapse of its Norwegian parent company. InfraStrata said it will retain the 79 workers who are still employed. It also hopes to increase the workforce by ""several hundred"" over five years. The troubled history of Belfast's shipyard Shipyard crisis a 'commercial issue' 'Positive talks' over shipyard future The trade union, Unite, said it expects people to return to work as early as this week. This video can not be played The history of the Belfast shipyard InfraStrata will initially focus on metal fabrication for its energy projects. The company's main project is a gas storage project at Islandmagee in County Antrim where it hopes to begin construction enabling works before the end of the year. It is also planning a separate, floating gas storage facility, but there are complications, including planning permission requirements and opposition from local residents. InfraStrata has said the Islandmagee Gas Storage Project will initially provide the bulk of the work for the shipyard. It is a plan to hollow out large caverns under Larne Lough to store gas, something that has been talked about since 2012. The proposal has some planning permissions, but a key plank of approval is not yet in place. A marine licence, necessary for work on the seabed in the North Channel off Portmuck, is still outstanding. Without it, the necessary seabed work can not proceed and the process of securing it can sometimes prove a lengthy one. There is also considerable local opposition to the gas storage plan on environmental grounds. The Islandmagee Gas Storage Project has been discussed since 2012 In particular conservationists worry about part of the construction process. Salt water would be used to hollow out the gas caverns, before the brine solution created would be pumped out to sea. It has been claimed that brine solution could be harmful to sealife in its immediate vicinity. The company said it would quickly be diluted and disperse and would not be harmful. An added complication is that the area of the proposed brine outfall has recently been made a protected area. The North Channel Marine Protected Area has been designated for its important population of harbour porpoises. Infrastrata will have to supply environmental information on the impact of the proposal as part of the application process, and there will have to be a public consultation. InfraStrata chief executive John Wood said: ""Harland and Wolff is a landmark asset and its reputation as one of the finest multi-purpose fabrication facilities in Europe is testament to its highly skilled team in Belfast."" The news follows a nine-week occupation of the shipyard by workers, supported by their unions. Unite regional officer Susan Fitzgerald said the workers had ""defied the cynics"". ""As well as safeguarding their own futures, the workers have sent a message that will be heard across Northern Ireland, most immediately by Wrightbus workers in Ballymena,"" she said. The Belfast shipyard in numbers 35,000workers employed at its peak during World War Two Â£1bnof taxpayers' money was pumped into it to keep it afloat 79jobs have been retained following its sale in October 2019 Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith said he was ""delighted"" by the news and the fact that the skills and experience of the existing workforce would be retained. ""I firmly believe that the shipyard has a promising future and InfraStrata's plans present an exciting opportunity for both Belfast and Northern Ireland's manufacturing and energy sectors,"" he said. The Titanic in dry dock at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in February 1912 Accountancy firm BDO, who had been formally appointed to oversee the Belfast shipyard when it entered administration, said the ""agreed terms of sale will include the transfer of the remaining employees on their existing terms and conditions to the purchaser upon completion"". ""In the interim, it is intended that the remaining employees will be able to return to work in the coming days to facilitate the remaining steps required for the completion of a sale,"" a BDO spokesperson said. ""This is a very positive step towards securing a sale of the shipyard and protecting and safeguarding the employment of the workforce."" East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson welcomed news of the sale. He said: ""The last two months have been uncertain for the workforce, but their fortitude and indeed, the support from their Unions and the wider community, has been incredible. ""Today's announcement not only brings comfort for the workforce who kept their dignified presence at the yard, but Infrastrata have also outlined ambitious plans for growth in the future.""

Flood warnings issued as rain lashes UKPeople in the south-west of England are advised to avoid seafronts amid high tides and winds.UK,"This video can not be played Residents were trapped in their homes in the village of Laxey on the Isle of Man More rain and winds are expected in parts of the country later this week as the remnants of ex-Hurricane Lorenzo arrive in the UK. The storm -the most powerful hurricane ever recordedin the far east Atlantic - will have lost most of its power by the time it arrives on Thursday. It comes after torrential rain brought flash flooding and led to some places being evacuated on Tuesday. On the Isle of Man amajor incident was declaredwith people trapped indoors. Elsewhere, some areas in the Midlands, Wales and southern England were hit by a week's rain in just an hour, as thunderstorms swept across the UK. Roads and railways were closed and some flights from London's Heathrow Airport were delayed on Tuesday evening due to the bad weather. Dozens of flood warnings and alertsremain in place,externalacross England. Major incident as people trapped by flooding Hurricane Lorenzo breaks record in mid-Atlantic How do hurricanes form? Louise Lear, from BBC Weather, said temperatures would turn colder on Wednesday before an area of low pressure - carrying gale-force gusts and the remnants of former Hurricane Lorenzo - approached Northern Ireland on Thursday. The low pressure would move eastwards and south during Thursday and into Friday, bringing ""a spell of wet and windy weather"", she said. Thursday and Friday will see wind and rain hit western parts of the UK, BBC Weather said The Met Office said Northern Ireland, western Scotland, Wales and south-west England will most likely be affected. On Tuesday, the Met Office issued issued a yellow warning for heavy rain across large parts of central and southern England and Wales. On the Isle of Man,the village of Laxey was cut offafter its second major flood in four years. The river that gave the village its name burst its banks, leaving people trapped in their homes and washing away cars. The fire service helped to evacuate several houses, while a coastguard helicopter was flown in on standby. The village was previously flooded in 2015, when a 200-year-old stone bridge was washed away. One villager told the BBC that this year's flooding was the worst he had seen. Local residents make their way through floodwater in Cossington, Leicester Also in Cossington, a clean-up operation is under way at a flooded home Flights from Heathrow were delayed on Tuesday evening because of ""poor weather conditions across London and the South East"", a spokeswoman for the airport said. And the Thames Barrier closed for the second time in a week to protect London from flooding. In Cornwall, floods caused by a coastal surge meant people were told to leave caravans and seaside properties.

A woman wades through floodwater in Alum Rock, Birmingham Commuters shelter from the rain under umbrellas in Queen Square, Bristol Up to 50mm (2 ins) of rain fell in a couple of hours in some places. By Tuesday afternoon, the highest hourly rainfall was 25.6mm, recorded at Pennerley in Shropshire. That part of the country normally receives just 96mm of rain in the whole of October. But the localised nature of the downpours means the heaviest rainfall may not be recorded by a weather station, the Met Office said. Worcestershire was one place that experienced torrential rainfall, with the fire and rescue service issuing a warning to drivers after a car was submerged in floods. Allow Twitter content?

315 billion-tonne iceberg breaks off AntarcticaThe Amery Ice Shelf in Antarctica produces its largest iceberg in more than 50 years.Science & Environment,"The EU's Sentinel-1 satellite system captured these before and after images The Amery Ice Shelf in Antarctica has just produced its biggest iceberg in more than 50 years. The calved block covers 1,636 sq km in area - a little smaller than Scotland's Isle of Skye - and is called D28. The scale of the berg means it will have to be monitored and tracked because it could in future pose a hazard to shipping. Not since the early 1960s has Amery calved a bigger iceberg. That was a whopping 9,000 sq km in area. Amery is the third largest ice shelf in Antarctica, and is a key drainage channel for the east of the continent. The shelf is essentially the floating extension of a number of glaciers that flow off the land into the sea.Losing bergs to the ocean is how these ice streams maintain equilibrium, balancing the input of snow upstream. So, scientists knew this calving event was coming. What's interesting is that much attention in the area had actually been focussed just to the east of the section that's now broken away. This is a segment of Amery that hasaffectionately become known as ""Loose Tooth"",externalbecause of its resemblance in satellite images to the dentition of a small child. Both ice areas had shared the same rift system. Nasa space laser tracks water depths from orbit 'No role' for climate in Halley iceberg Antarctic instability 'is spreading' Loose Tooth pictured in the early 2000s. D28 is seen forming to the left But although wobbly, Loose tooth is still attached. It's D28 that's been extracted. ""It is the molar compared to a baby tooth,"" Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography told BBC News. Prof Fricker had predicted back in 2002,externalthat Loose Tooth would come off sometime between 2010 and 2015. ""I am excited to see this calving event after all these years. We knew it would happen eventually, but just to keep us all on our toes, it is not exactly where we expected it to be,"" she said. The Scripps researcher stressed that there was no link between this event and climate change. Satellite data since the 1990s has shown that Amery is roughly in balance with its surroundings, despite experiencing strong surface melt in summer. ""While there is much to be concerned about in Antarctica, there is no cause for alarm yet for this particular ice shelf,"" Prof Fricker added. Amery experiences a lot of summer surface melt, but the data indicates it is in equilibrium The Australian Antarctic Division will however be watching Amery closely to see if it reacts at all. The division's scientists have instrumentation in the region. It's possible the loss of such a big berg will change the stress geometry across the front of the ice shelf. This could influence the behaviour of cracks, and even the stability of Loose Tooth. D28 is calculated to be about 210m thick and contains some 315 billion tonnes of ice. The name comes from a classification system run by the US National Ice Center, which divides the Antarctic into quadrants. The D quadrant covers the longitudes 90 degrees East to zero degrees, the Prime Meridian. This is roughly Amery to the Eastern Weddell Sea. D28 is dwarfed by the mighty A68 berg, which broke away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in 2017. It currently covers an area more than three times as big. Nearshore currents and winds will carry D28 westwards. It's likely to take several years for it to break apart and melt completely.

UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit talks,"Stephen Barclay and Michel Barnier met for Brexit talks in Brussels on Friday The government has prepared the legal text of an updated Brexit deal, government sources have told the BBC. It is expected to make more of the plans public in the next few days, a senior government figure says. The government has suggested creating ""customs clearance zones"" in Northern Ireland and Irish Republic, as part of the proposals put to the EU. But Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveneysaid the plans were a ""non-starter"". In atweet,external, Mr Coveney said Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ""deserve better"" than the proposals, which wereoriginally reported by Irish state broadcaster RTE,external. Proposals for reaching a Brexit deal had been expected ahead of a crucial EU summit on 17 October. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson says this will happen whether or not there is a new deal with Brussels. Laura Kuenssberg: Brexit is the key for the PM Brexit border customs plan 'non starter' Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? What will happen with Brexit in the next month? Mr Johnson says that he would prefer leaving with a deal. At the Conservative Party conference on Monday, he said: ""I'm cautiously optimistic. We have made some pretty big moves, we are waiting to see whether our European friends will help us and whether we can find the right landing zone."" MPs have passed a law, known as the Benn Act, requiring Mr Johnson to seek an extension to the deadline from the bloc if he is unable to pass a deal in Parliament, or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit, by 19 October. With the detailed proposals on the table, the UK side hopes that by the end of the week, both the EU and UK would be in a period of intense negotiations where both sides thrash out a final text. But there is no certainty over whether the EU will accept the premise of the plans in order to move to the next phase of talks. The biggest obstacle to a deal is the backstop - the plan to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The policy - agreed to by former PM Theresa May in her withdrawal deal with the EU, which was rejected three times by Parliament - is unacceptable to many Conservative MPs. Since becoming prime minister, Mr Johnson has stressed to EU leaders the backstop would have to be replaced if any deal was to be passed by Parliament. Mr Johnson has argued that the backstop would keep the UK too closely aligned with EU rules after Brexit. What are the Brexit backstop options? UK shares Brexit documents with EU How are the UK's talks with the EU going? The EU Commission has said it is willing to look at new proposals but these must achieve the same aims as the backstop - and be legally enforceable. Sources involved in the negotiations with the EU say the checks proposed would not be at the Irish border, and suggestions there would be a series of checkpoints along the border are a misunderstanding. The proposals were rejected by political parties in Dublin and non-unionist politicians in Belfast, with the SDLP's Colum Eastwood saying there would be ""economic and security challenges that are unacceptable"". Lisa Chambers, the Fianna Fail Brexit spokeswoman described it as ""effectively a border with a buffer zone"", while Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said it was ""further evidence of Tory recklessness and belligerence towards Ireland"". ""Anything that causes there to be customs, tariffs, checks anywhere represents a hardening of the border,"" she told Radio 4'sTodayprogramme. ""[It] goes against all of the commitments that have been entered into by the British government at the get-go of this Brexit process to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to ensure no hardening of the border, to respect the Irish economy, Irish society - to do nothing that would in anyway threaten or destabilise the situation,"" she added. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer described the proposals as ""utterly unworkable"". Talks have continued between the UK and EU, at a technical level. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier met on Friday. The BBC has learnt the proposals will accept the need for customs checks on the island of Ireland - but insist these checks, as the government previously pledged, would be conducted away from the border. Customs formalities would be carried out mostly where goods originate or at their final destination. The UK government maintains that any further customs inspections would be very limited - and these could be conducted either at new locations or at existing business premises. The Irish broadcaster RTE had reported that a ""string of customs posts perhaps five to 10 miles away from the frontier"" had been floated by the UK. However, government sources have denied that UK officials had proposed a series of inspection posts on either side of the Irish border. Leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson told the Today programme the proposals showed Mr Johnson was ""not serious"" about getting a deal. ""He knows that this is going to be rejected,"" she said. Ms Swinson also said cross-party talks continued about how to ensure the Benn Act was ""watertight"". She raised concerns that although Mr Johnson has promised to respect the rule of law, he has also promised to deliver Brexit on 31 October, with or without a deal. ""Those two things can't simultaneously be true,"" she said.

Johnson rejects leaks over Irish border plan,"This video can not be played Johnson: ""Critical moment of choice"" on Irish border Boris Johnson says the ""reality"" of Brexit is there will need to be customs checks on the island of Ireland after the UK leaves the EU. But the PM rejected claims that would effectively mean a hard border, in the form of a series of customs posts set five or 10 miles back. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""A sovereign united country must have a single customs territory."" He refused to give details, but said formal proposals would be made soon. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Brexit minister James Duddridge said the government would ""set out more detail on an alternative to the backstop in the coming days"". He also said he wanted to ""assure the House there will be no infrastructure checks or controls at the border"". The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 October. Mr Johnson has said the exit will go ahead with or without a deal - despite MPs passing a law last month forcing him to ask for an extension from the EU if Parliament hasn't voted in favour of a specific deal or leaving without one. The issue of the Irish border - and how to keep it free from border checks when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU - has been a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations. The current government says the solution reached by the EU and Theresa May,the backstop,is unacceptable and an alternative to it must be found. Would a Brexit delay cost the UK Â£400m a week? UK government to reveal detailed Brexit proposals Laura Kuenssberg: Brexit is the key for the PM Mr Johnson was speaking at the start of the third day of the Conservative Party conference in Manchester where ministers have made a raft of policy announcements, including raising the National Living Wage. But the plans have been overshadowed by allegations that Mr Johnson squeezed the thigh of journalist Charlotte Edwards under a table at a lunch in 1999. Asked about the accusation, the PM told BBC Breakfast it was ""not true"", butit was ""inevitable"" he would face ""shot and shell"" because of his stance on Brexit. According to leaked proposals, the government has accepted there must be customs checks on the island of Ireland, but they would be conducted away from the border - mostly where goods originate or at their final destination. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Irish broadcaster RTE had reported that a ""string of customs posts perhaps five to 10 miles away from the frontier"" had been floated by the UK. The prime minister told Breakfast: ""They are not talking about the proposals that we are actually going to be tabling. ""They are talking about some stuff that went in previously."" Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit What will happen in the next month? Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the UK government had promised Ireland and the EU there would be no hard border as a result of Brexit, and they expected that commitment to be honoured. ""No British government should seek to impose customs posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland against the will both of the people in Northern Ireland and the people here in the Republic of Ireland,"" he said. Mr Varadkar went on to say that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there would be checks at ports and airports. Government sources accused unnamed individuals in the European Commission of leaking the suggestion in an effort to create ""a hostile reaction"" to their revised Brexit deal. A European Commission spokesperson said they would not be commenting on the reports, but their position remained that they had ""not received any proposals from the UK that meet all the objectives of the backstop"". Mr Johnson told the BBC he would not reveal details of the proposals to be put to the EU at this stage, but the UK would be making ""a very good offer"". Allow Twitter content?

We don't have the exact proposals from the UK government, but we're beginning to get the shape of it. Yes, there will be customs checks, but no, there won't be a hard border, and no, these checks won't be done five or 10 miles away from the border. The government is saying we can do most of them in the depots and warehouses before lorries even leave. In some instances, there will be physical inspections, but then it will be up to customs authorities to decide where to do them - it might be at the depots or they might want their own physical area to carry them out. The problem with that is the Irish government and the EU don't want any checks at all, because they view them as a hardening of the border even if it isn't a hard border. The view of the British government is that life can't just carry on the same as before because we are leaving and we want to have our own trade policy. Labour's Hilary Benn asked an urgent question in the Commons about the government's plans for the island of Ireland. ""Today there are no border posts or checks on goods crossing the border... and the backstop is there to ensure that remains the case after Brexit. ""The government's position now, however, is that the reality of Brexit will require customs check on the island of Ireland - that is the inexorable logic of the prime minister's statement this morning."" He added: ""It is unacceptable for us to be kept in the dark about what is being proposed in our name on such an important matter."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson spoke to BBC Breakfast about new border proposals. The Northern Irish DUP MP, Gregory Campbell, supported the government and said the House should ""draw a little comfort"" from the fact the EU appeared to have shifted somewhat from its previous position of refusing point blank to re-open the withdrawal agreement. ""At least that is a glimmer of light,"" he said. But the SNP's Peter Grant said the ""future of peace and normality on the island of Ireland will critically depend on the action of this prime minister"" and claimed governments around the EU were beginning to believe Mr Johnson ""could not be trusted"". Earlier, Tory MP and chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group Steve Baker said there would be ""some additional checks"" after Brexit, but that was ""inescapable"". He told BBC News: ""I'm absolutely confident this can be a world class border with a real minimisation of inconvenience to businesses and individuals - consistent with the kind of approach adopted today.""

Kuenssberg: Brexit key for PM,"Conferences are always a parallel universe. But this week in Manchester takes that to the extreme. On theconference platformspeaker after speaker is outlining the promises the Tory party is presenting as a rough draft of their election manifesto - ""schools, cops and docs"" one cabinet minister joked. But the chances of the Tory party with Boris Johnson as its leader having an uneventful week at a time like this were always extremely low. That's not just because theprime minister has to confront allegationsabout his own behaviour in years gone by. But also because it's Brexit that will make or break this prime minister, and potentially this party too. And the conversations that will decide the fate of that process are taking place elsewhere. UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiations How are the UK's talks with the EU going? What are the Brexit backstop options? Despite the briefing wars of the last few weeks between London and Brussels, this process is (again you might wonder) about to reach a point of decision. Not the final decision on whether there is a deal, but whether both sides are going genuinely to try to find a conclusion. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has been holding talks with the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier I understand the government has now  completed alegal text of the dealthey believe could be done, after the ""non-paper"" papers process, which dipped the toes in the water last week. That will be put in front of the EU in the next few days and senior government figures talk of proposals and activity being stepped up by the end of this week. And once a proposed deal is on the table,  the hope on the UK side is that the negotiators enter ""the tunnel"" - the process Theresa May's officials went into when the deal that was finally agreed was hammered out. Much to the frustration of the outside world (journalists included), the to and fro of the briefing war, and the pantomime was called off during that time to enable the final bits of negotiation to be completed with a relatively low level of political noise outside. The hope then, is that could allow both sides to budge a little to reach an agreement. And while not cheerful about the prospects of achieving an agreement, government insiders say repeatedly, perhaps wrong headedly, that the tone in private is distinctly more positive than the public criticisms of any proposals the UK has put forward. We'll see. It is perfectly possible that the EU takes a look at the text once it lands and concludes that it just does not go far enough to meet its objectives - or shrinks back from the agreement they made with Theresa May too much to make it palatable. The EU has real concerns about protecting Ireland and also the single market. But the decision that will be made in the next few days on whether to try to get a deal over the line is a political choice as well as a policy decision. Will they consider it worth giving Mr Johnson's deal a try? Or is it better to wait until the outcome of a likely election to make a decision. One figure involved in the talks told me the EU's habits up until now suggest they are more likely to sit it out - wait and see. It's not necessarily that that EU is not willing to make even tiny concessions ever, but there is  consideration over when it is the right time to do so, when the political situation in the UK is so unstable. One diplomatic source, when asked if there was a way to tweak the deal, to use the political phrase, put lipstick on the pig, told me, ""we do have a lipstick in our pocket, but we can only use it once"". Timing and trust may be everything. And we may know in a matter of days, not weeks, if there is a real chance of Boris Johnson achieving a deal.

Reaction to 'customs clearance zones' suggestion,"The UK government has suggested creating ""customs clearance zones"" along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, as part of proposals for reaching a Brexit deal. Goods could be declared and cleared at the sites, then their movement would be monitored possibly via mobile phone GPS data or tracking devices. The ideas are contained in one of four so-called non-papers,extracts of which have been seen by RTÃ,external, submitted by UK officials during recent technical discussions in Brussels. However they have not gone down well with some politicians and business leaders, who regard the backstop as a necessary protection. Deputy Irish prime ministerSimon Coveney tweeted,external: ""Non-Paper = Non-Starter. Time the EU had a serious proposal from the UK Govt if a #Brexit deal is to be achievable in October. NI and IRE deserves better!"" Sinn FÃ©in presidentMary-Lou McDonald tweeted,externalthe proposal to ""reimpose a hard border on our island... is out of the question"".

What will happen this month?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Farah's ex-coach Salazar banned for four yearsAlberto Salazar has been banned from athletics after being found guilty of doping violations.BBC Sport,"Salazar (centre) alongside Farah (right) and training partner Galen Rupp (left) at the London 2012 Olympics Alberto Salazar - Mo Farah's former athletics coach - has been banned from the sport for four years after being found guilty of doping violations. Salazar runs the Nike Oregon Project - home to British four-time Olympic champion Farah from 2011 until 2017. The decision follows a four-year investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) and a two-year court battle behind closed doors. American Salazar said he was ""shocked"" by the outcome and would appeal. ""The Oregon Project has never and will never permit doping,"" the 61-year-old added. ""I will appeal and look forward to this unfair and protracted process reaching the conclusion I know to be true."" Dr Jeffrey Brown, a Nike-paid endocrinologist who treated many of Salazar's athletes, has also been banned for four years. Farah split with Salazar in 2017, which the BBC can reveal was the same year the coach was first charged by Usada. The 36-year-old, also a six-time world champion, said: ""I'm relieved that Usada has, after four years, completed their investigation into Alberto Salazar. ""I left the Nike Oregon Project in 2017 but, as I've always said, I have no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line. I'm glad there has finally been a conclusion."" The Briton has never failed a drugs test and has always strongly denied breaking any rules. The inside story of Salazar's downfall The investigation began after aBBC Panorama programme in 2015. An independent panel found Salazar and Brown possessed and trafficked a banned performance-enhancing substance and administered or attempted to administer a prohibited method to multiple track and field athletes. It added that Salazar ""tampered and/or attempted to tamper with the doping control process"". The panel also said Salazar and Brown ""communicated repeatedly about the athletes of the Nike Oregon Project's (NOP) performance and medical conditions, exchanging information without any apparent formal authorisation by the athletes at the NOP or distinction between Dr Brown's role as an athlete's physician and NOP consultant. ""[Salazar] and Brown shared information with the aim of improving the athletes' performance via medical intervention, with a particular interest in increasing testosterone levels."" Usada chief executive Travis Tygart praised athletes for having the ""courage to speak out and ultimately expose the truth"". ""While acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr Salazar and Dr Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect,"" a statement added. Doping charges against Salazar and Dr Brown were brought by Usada in June 2017. The pair contested the charges, supported by Nike-paid lawyers, and the case went to the American Arbitration Association. The Panorama programme, a joint investigation with the American website ProPublica, revealedallegations of doping and unethical practicesat the US training base in Beaverton, Oregon in 2015. UK Athletics (UKA), the sport's UK governing body, conducted its own review into the claims, and gave Farah the green light to continue working with Cuban-born Salazar. Farahannounced he was leaving Salazarin October 2017, the same year he was knighted, but denied his decision was to do with the doping claims. During his time at the NOP, 5,000m and 10,000m runner Farah won six world titles and four Olympic gold medals. Farah quit running track races in 2017, deciding to concentrate on the marathon, but earlier this year said he might return to the track for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Salazar, who coaches several athletes at the World Athletics Championships in Doha but has had his accreditation revoked, added: ""Throughout this six-year investigation my athletes and I have endured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from Usada. ""This is demonstrated by the misleading statement released by Travis Tygart stating that we put winning ahead of athlete safety. This is completely false and contrary to the findings of the arbitrators, who even wrote about the care I took in complying with the world anti-doping code. ""I have always ensured the World Anti-Doping Agency code is strictly followed."" Nikesaid the decision had ""nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete"". ""As the panel noted, they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the World Anti-Doping code,"" it said. ""We support Alberto in his decision to appeal and wish him the full measure of due process that the rules require. Nike does not condone the use of banned substances in any manner."" UK Athleticssaid it ""acknowledged the announcement made by Usada"" and ""will now review the arbitration decision in full prior to making any further comment"". It added: ""It should be noted that at all times UK Athletics fully cooperated with both Usada and UK Anti-doping throughout the investigations. ""Furthermore, the Performance Oversight Committee's own investigation in 2015 was restricted to the interaction of the Nike Oregon Project with Mo Farah and not an anti-doping investigation. Such investigations can and should only be undertaken by the relevant anti-doping authorities. ""UK Athletics is 100% committed to clean athletics."" British former heptathleteDenise Lewis, who won gold at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, has described the news as ""very disappointing"", adding that is casts ""a shadow over the World Athletics Championships"". She told BBC Breakfast: ""I looked at the Usada report and it makes for very grim reading. ""If he is guilty of these allegations, then I really think it's a very sad indictment and sad that a coach who is so reputable and has had the trust of so many athletes over the years has gone down this route.

Kuenssberg: Brexit is the key for PM,"Conferences are always a parallel universe. But this week in Manchester takes that to the extreme. On theconference platformspeaker after speaker is outlining the promises the Tory party is presenting as a rough draft of their election manifesto - ""schools, cops and docs"" one cabinet minister joked. But the chances of the Tory party with Boris Johnson as its leader having an uneventful week at a time like this were always extremely low. That's not just because theprime minister has to confront allegationsabout his own behaviour in years gone by. But also because it's Brexit that will make or break this prime minister, and potentially this party too. And the conversations that will decide the fate of that process are taking place elsewhere. UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiations How are the UK's talks with the EU going? What are the Brexit backstop options? Despite the briefing wars of the last few weeks between London and Brussels, this process is (again you might wonder) about to reach a point of decision. Not the final decision on whether there is a deal, but whether both sides are going genuinely to try to find a conclusion. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has been holding talks with the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier I understand the government has now  completed alegal text of the dealthey believe could be done, after the ""non-paper"" papers process, which dipped the toes in the water last week. That will be put in front of the EU in the next few days and senior government figures talk of proposals and activity being stepped up by the end of this week. And once a proposed deal is on the table,  the hope on the UK side is that the negotiators enter ""the tunnel"" - the process Theresa May's officials went into when the deal that was finally agreed was hammered out. Much to the frustration of the outside world (journalists included), the to and fro of the briefing war, and the pantomime was called off during that time to enable the final bits of negotiation to be completed with a relatively low level of political noise outside. The hope then, is that could allow both sides to budge a little to reach an agreement. And while not cheerful about the prospects of achieving an agreement, government insiders say repeatedly, perhaps wrong headedly, that the tone in private is distinctly more positive than the public criticisms of any proposals the UK has put forward. We'll see. It is perfectly possible that the EU takes a look at the text once it lands and concludes that it just does not go far enough to meet its objectives - or shrinks back from the agreement they made with Theresa May too much to make it palatable. The EU has real concerns about protecting Ireland and also the single market. But the decision that will be made in the next few days on whether to try to get a deal over the line is a political choice as well as a policy decision. Will they consider it worth giving Mr Johnson's deal a try? Or is it better to wait until the outcome of a likely election to make a decision. One figure involved in the talks told me the EU's habits up until now suggest they are more likely to sit it out - wait and see. It's not necessarily that that EU is not willing to make even tiny concessions ever, but there is  consideration over when it is the right time to do so, when the political situation in the UK is so unstable. One diplomatic source, when asked if there was a way to tweak the deal, to use the political phrase, put lipstick on the pig, told me, ""we do have a lipstick in our pocket, but we can only use it once"". Timing and trust may be everything. And we may know in a matter of days, not weeks, if there is a real chance of Boris Johnson achieving a deal.
