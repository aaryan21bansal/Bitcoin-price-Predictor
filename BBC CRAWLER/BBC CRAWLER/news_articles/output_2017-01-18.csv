Hamilton backs new team-mate Bottas,"Nico Rosberg, middle, retired after winning the world title for the first time last season Lewis Hamilton has backed Mercedes replacing Nico Rosberg with Valtteri Bottas, says team boss Toto Wolff. Mercedessigned the Finn this weekafter agreeing a deal to buy him out of his Williams contract to replace Rosberg, who retired after winning last year's world title. Wolff said: ""Lewis said he thought Valtteri was a nice guy. ""One of the guys he actually got along with well in Formula 1 and he felt he was a good option."" Wolff, who was talking to Finnish commentator Oskari Saari for a podcast, said he believed there might be less tension between Hamilton and the 27-year-old Finn than there was between the triple world champion and Rosberg. ""I think that works well,"" he added. ""It was OK already between Nico and Lewis, but there was the luggage of the past... Now it is a completely new relationship and there is no animosity. ""There will be moments where it is going to be difficult, but I think that how the personalities are for the team it's going to be a good situation and one that is maybe a bit easier to handle than the past. But I could be wrong."" BBC Sport revealed on Monday that Bottas hadsigned a one-year contract,with options to extend it into subsequent seasons. Wolff said that was because a number of leading drivers' contracts were up for renewal at the end of the 2017 season - including multiple world champions Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso of Ferrari and McLaren - and Mercedes wanted to keep their options open. ""We wouldn't have chosen Valtteri if we thought that he was not good enough to continue with the team,"" said Wolff. ""But, as a matter of fact, the market is very dynamic at the moment. Next year options open - young drivers, Sebastian, Fernando, Valtteri, many of them. So it is about understanding that - and Valtteri does. ""Equally we have great faith and confidence in him that he can stay with us for a long time, but now we need to see how the season goes.""

SportFormula 1 sale approved by FIA18 January 2017 (18:06:10),"Chase Carey, chairman of Liberty Media and F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone Formula 1's governing body the FIA has approved the sale of the sport's commercial rights to Liberty Media. The US company is in the process of finalising a purchase of a controlling interest in Formula 1. The FIA's approval was the final regulatory hurdle before the sale, which will see Liberty take over from investment group CVC Capital Partners. The FIA believed its partnership with Liberty will ""ensure the continued success and development"" of F1. Liberty is expected to complete its takeover of the sport within the next few weeks. It bought just over 18% of the shares in Delta Topco, the holding company of the F1 Group, in September. Liberty Media says it wants to protect the sport's historic European races - such as the Italian GP - which have been under threat as they struggle to make money Liberty announced before Christmas that it had cleared all regulatory hurdles and had the necessary approvals for the purchase. And on Tuesday in Colorado, the company's shareholders approved the buy-out. Its purchase of its second tranche of shares, to take its holding to 35.3%, is due to be completed within the next few weeks. Liberty has said it wants to protect F1's historic European races, establish new races in the USA and Latin America and grow the sport through the exploitation of digital media.

Brexit memo: Don't mention the War,"Basil Fawlty discovered that some subjects were taboo Like some latter-day Basil Fawlty, Boris Johnson mentioned the War and didn't get away with it. The foreign secretary urged the French president not to ""administer punishment beatings"" on Britain for choosing to escape the EU ""rather in the manner of some World War Two movie"". Not surprisingly, uproar has ensued. Former Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Johnson had shown once again that he could be ""supremely clever and yet immensely stupid"". To some Britons, Mr Johnson's remarks will be seen as colourful but unexceptional language that echoes the popular World War Two film The Great Escape. To many of Mr Johnson's generation, these films were part of their childhood and are subject to frequent cultural reference. Former Prime Minister David Cameron has seen The Guns of Navarone more than 17 times and once quoted a line from the film in a party conference speech. I know one former Conservative cabinet minister who can quote reams from Where Eagles Dare. (Full disclosure, so can I). Yet this hinterland of war films from the 1960s and 1970s, seen by some today as jingoistic, can create a tin ear among some Britons when it comes to recognising how sensitive many Europeans remain towards this period in their history. The foreign secretary has form on this. During the referendum campaign last year he compared the EU to Nazi Germany, telling the Daily Telegraph both were attempting to unify Europe: ""Napoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically."" This caused a flurry of headlines and a social media storm that passed quickly. Yet the impact on EU politicians was lasting. One EU diplomat explained it to me like this: ""You Brits don't understand us when we talk about European values. To us they are important because they are not Nazi values, they are not Vichy values, they are not fascist values, not the values of the Greek junta. They are the values of a different Europe. ""So for that clown to compare us to the Nazis, well, that hurts and will not be forgotten."" In other words, the global conflict from which the EU's forerunner emerged - and was ultimately designed to prevent recurring - lingers long in the mind on the continent. So perhaps the foreign secretary might take the advice of Gisela Stuart, the German-born Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, who said she was sure her fellow Brexit campaigner did not mean to be offensive but added: ""For the next two yearsâ¦ just don't mention the war."" Or maybe Mr Johnson might remember the last line of the Fawlty Towers episode when a ranting Basil is being led away by the nurses and one of the stunned German guests asks: ""However did they win?""

Arron Banks launches news website,"This video can not be played Amol Rajan reports on the launch of the Westmonster website Arron Banks, the former UKIP donor who bankrolled the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, is making a move into the media sector by backing an anti-establishment news website. I can reveal thatWestmonster,externalis co-owned by Michael Heaver, former press adviser to Nigel Farage. The 27-year-old, who together with Mr Banks will own 50% of the website, will edit it day to day. Modelled on theDrudge Report,external, the American aggregator site that generates huge traffic, Westmonster will be powered by the social media reach of Leave.EU, the campaign to which Mr Banks gave close to Â£7m - the largest donation in British political history. Leave.EU has nearly800,000 followers,externalon Facebook and Mr Heaver believes he can use that base to generate substantial traffic from day one. Westmonster will publish some original news, and Mr Heaver hopes to enlist more celebrity writers than backbench MPs. The site will launch with an article from Nigel Farage, and Mr Heaver is open about wanting to ape the opinionated, anti-establishment, highly provocative tone ofBreitbart.,external This launch is significant for several reasons. It shows that the anti-establishment media which helped to power the campaign of Donald Trump is coming to Britain. It's no coincidence that Westmonster is launching the day before Mr Trump's inauguration - an event that will be attended, almost alone among Brits, by Nigel Farage, Arron Banks, and Mr Banks's business associate Andy Wigmore, who are together hosting a celebratory party on Saturday night in a hotel across the road from the White House. Banks has booked out an entire floor of the Hay-Adams Hotel on Saturday night, and - logistics permitting - the plan is for the new President to attend, along with his close friend the Governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant. It also marks a significant acceleration of Mr Banks's involvement in British public life. I spent time with him in the nondescript offices of his insurance company on the edge of Bristol on Tuesday, with a Premier Inn on one side and the M4-M5 junction on the other. Arron Banks donated millions to the Brexit campaign He is an extremely intriguing character, as thissuperb profilefor Radio 4 pointed out. Hetweets vigorously,externaland his politics do not fit into the anachronistic right-left spectrum through which so much of Westminster is still naively interpreted. For instance, he favours nationalisation of Britain's railways and some utilities over their present near-monopoly status, harbours a visceral hatred of many Tories, and has had several conversations with Labour MPs about wooing them over to the populist Momentum-style movement that he intends to launch in the coming months. I alsorevealed in Decemberthat he has expressed interest in more traditional media - that is, The Daily Telegraph. Now, as I put to him yesterday, he has become Britain's latest media baron. He helps to show how the rise of digital media has not so much blurred the distinction between media and politics as abolished it; how the culture wars raging in the US are being imported here; and how traditional media - including the BBC - face ferocious competition like never before.

Kevin Connolly: Europe mulls May's Brexit credo,"May's confidence surprised some in Europe If Brexit is going to end up feeling like a long toe-to-toe boxing match then at last we can say that the first round is over. Theresa May has come out jabbing -offering crisp points about the UK's plans to leave the single marketand its readiness to walk away from a bad deal if that's all that's on offer. The European side for the moment is still acting as if what we've seen so far this week is just the posturing and chest-beating you see at the pre-fight weigh-in rather than the fight itself. Their big-hitters - politicians like the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and his equivalent at the European Council Donald Tusk - have confined themselves to a little nifty defensive work pointing to the likely difficulty of the talks, hoping for a fair outcome and reiterating that until Britain formally triggers the departure process everything is mere shadow boxing. None of that of course will stop individual MEPs and commentators from offering their assessment of where the balance lies between the EU and the UK after Theresa May's Brexit declaration. Brexit at-a-glance: What we learned from Theresa May Why Brexit is still undefined One German colleague said to me jokingly: ""I didn't realise that the EU had decided to leave the UK until I heard your prime minister's speech."" And elsewhere in the corridors of the European Parliament you heard plenty of surprise at the confidence of the tone coming from London, the crispness of the decision to leave the single market and the sudden shafts of clarity after weeks in which the UK had appeared to not know what it wanted. Shafts of clarity about the UK's position in the corridors of the European Parliament? That's not to say of course that everyone has been impressed, even though Mrs May was praised in some quarters both for realism and for clarity. It's worth remembering that most mainstream politicians in Europe view Brexit as an act of madness to be spoken of with hostility and incomprehension. Britain in this analysis has taken the decision to walk away from an institution that's been an engine of peace and prosperity. Hence these remarks from the German MP Norbert Roettgen, who represents Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats. He said: ""The UK's two main economic weaknesses are its considerable trade deficit and a big budget deficit. As such [UK Chancellor Philip] Hammond's threats with duties and tax cuts would primarily damage the UK and should be regarded as an expression of British cluelessness."" That dismissal of an option Britain is keeping in reserve - the option of operating as a low-tax base for business if Europe refuses to cut an attractive deal - would be seen in Strasbourg as one weakness in the Theresa May strategy. From elsewhere on the German political spectrum came an alternative strand of criticism - not that the UK was trying to set up a kind of low-tax magnet for foreign investment into Europe but simply that it was cutting ties in too brutal a fashion. Too much, too fast? Yes, says German Greens MP Ska Keller For Bruno Gollnisch, MEP for the French far-right National Front (pictured left, next to party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen last year) the UK can return to days of yore Ska Keller represents the German Greens in the European parliament. She told us: ""My overall impression is that May wants to go for a super-hard Brexit. She wants to cut all ties and I don't think that's going to fly well on the rest of the continent. Theresa May didn't really make friends in the last couple of days here in the overall European Union."" To the right of that broad European mainstream of course, things are seen rather differently. France's far-right National Front looks at the success of the Leave campaign in the UK with a degree of envy. It doesn't like the EU either and would like to see its core treaties renegotiated. Its senior MEP Bruno Gollnisch said: "" I do think that in the end Britain could settle down to a situation rather like what it had before Brexit - after all in those days we managed things like exchanges of school pupils. And the UK will have commercial ties that reflect its specific Anglo-Saxon nature. There is no real reason why not."" So there has been a sense in Strasbourg this week that a phase in a kind of phoney war has finally ended and after months of speculating about what Britain might or might not want, a degree of clarity has emerged about British ambitions towards the single market and to a lesser extent the custom unions. So far in this cautious round it was the UK which came out swinging rather than the European side. But there is a very long way to go in this negotiation and by the end of it both sides will have endured defeats and disappointments alongside their occasional moments of triumph. The UK might feel for now that its ahead on points, but everyone knows there's a long way - a very long way - to go.

Jonathan Josephs - All aboard China-to-London freight train,"The train left China two weeks ago It's not on a boat, it's not on a plane, it's on a train. The newest way to send your freight from China to Europe involves spending 15 days on a train that doesn't have a buffet car in sight. On 3 January in Yiwu in eastern China, a bright orange locomotive pulling 44 containers laden with suitcases, clothes and an assortment of household goodsset off on a 7,500-mile (12,000km) journeyto western Europe. Ten containers were taken off at the German cargo hub of Duisburg. The rest made up the first cargo train from China to arrive in London at Barking's Eurohub freight terminal. London is the 15th European city to find its way on to the ever-expanding map of destinations for China's rail cargo. Last year, 1,702 freight trains made the voyage to Europe, more than double the 2015 figure. This video can not be played Travelling from China to London Yiwu Timex Industrial Investments, which is running this service with China's state-run railways, says prices are half that of air cargo and cut two weeks off the journey time by sea. The UK's biggest supermarket, Tesco, doesn't have any goods on this particular train but does use rail to carry toys, electrical goods, homeware and clothing from China to European rail hubs such as Bratislava in Slovakia and Krasnaje in Belarus. Alistair Lindsay, Tesco's head of global logistics, says the supermarket prefers shipping its goods because this is the most environmentally friendly way, as well as offering the best value for money, but that ""where we need to move products quicker we have that option to do it by rail"". This decision would normally be driven by customer demand for particular products, he says. It demonstrates how market demand and the realities of globalisation are increasingly allowing China's President Xi Jinping to realise his ambitious plan to revive the ancient Silk Road. For centuries the fabled trade route from the ancient capital of Xian provided a link to the bustling markets of European cities such as Istanbul and Venice. In the 21st Century China has become the world's biggest exporter, withthe export of goods totalling $2.28 trillion (Â£1.85tn) in 2015,external. The Silk Road provided a link to the markets of European cities like Istanbul and Venice This rail expansion is part of President Xi's ""One Belt, One Road"" (OBOR) trade policy. For Beijing it offers another way to sustain its economic growth. Kazakhstan is one of the countries on the route and it was there that Mr Xi first outlined his vision in aspeech in 2013,externalsaying, ""This will be a great undertaking benefiting the people of all countries along the route."" Extolling the virtues of globalisation was atheme he repeated againat Davos this week. For some, this is as much political as economic, offering Beijing the chance to project soft power as well as demonstrating it has the influence to thread disparate nations from Russia to Spain together. China is also pushing its version of a ""maritime silk road for example"", by building a $1.4bn port city in Sri Lanka ""[OBOR] is set to become Xi Jinping's grand legacy,"" says Dr Sam Beatson, of King's College London. ""Regardless of the returns on offer... the policies will continue to be pushed as a means of seeking to fulfil Xi's dream under his leadership."" One of the other legacies President Xi is trying to tackle is China's pollution problem. While rail cargo is not as green as sea transport it emits less carbon dioxide (CO2) than air travel. Freight transport accounts for about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions This is the ""first argument when trying to get our customers to re-evaluate their options"", says Johan Ignell, rail freight manager at Swedish cargo firm Greencarrier. It calculates that a 40ft (12m) container with 20 tonnes of cargo would account for just 4% of the CO2 emissions it would take to move it by air (though emissions would be more than halved again if it were moved by sea). Freight transport accounts for about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but it is ""fraught with difficulty"" to compare emissions from different transport modes, says Prof Alan McKinnon of Germany's Kuehne Logistics University. Prof McKinnon, one of the authors of a 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC),external, says ""load factor, energy efficiency and power sources all make a difference and can be hard to ascertain"". China is now the world's biggest exporter He adds: ""While shifting air cargo to rail will certainly cut emissions, container shipping will continue to command a significant carbon advantage over transcontinental rail, particularly now that most vessels are slow steaming to save fuel."" There is also a business case for this emerging trade route to grow. Not least among European companies looking to export to China. At the moment there are no plans to run a return train service from London but that could change quickly. China is already the European Union's second biggest export market - though there is an EU trade deficit in goods of about $190bn. For UK companies facing up to the reality of Brexit, China is an attractive proposition and the train carries new opportunities. Brand Avenue is a company that already exports British-made goods including cosmetics and jewellery to China, and chief executive Jody Jacobs says he's exploring moving to rail. ""We deal a lot in goods which weigh a lot in comparison to their volume [which is] where airfreight becomes expensive, such as cosmetics and baby food. ""So for us a service which is quicker than sea and cheaper than air is a great middle ground."" For UK companies facing up to the reality of Brexit, China is an attractive proposition For established cargo companies rail also offers the potential for growth. Shipping lines have seen profits fall because of overcapacity attributed to the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The world's biggest shipping company, Maersk, told the BBC it is investigating ""possible opportunities"" in long-distance rail, though it sees them as supplementary to sea and air routes. China is planning another 20 European routes for rail freight, and with the world's demand for consumer goods continuing to grow, all the ingredients seem to be there for rail to help the global economy steam ahead in 2017 and beyond.

Why does the Kremlin favour Trump?,"The question of whether Russia's leader Vladimir Putin has got material with which he could blackmail Donald Trump is for now unknowable and misses the point by a country mile: the two men think alike. Mr Trump's belief in American traditionalism and dislike of scrutiny echo the Kremlin's tune: nation, power and aversion to criticism are the new (and very Russian) world order. You could call this mindset Trumputinism. The echo between the Kremlin and Trump Tower is strong, getting louder and very, very good news for Mr Putin. As Trump signalled to Michael Gove on Monday,,externala new nuclear arms reduction deal seems to be in the offing linked to a review of sanctions against Russia. The dog that did not bark in the night is Mr Trump's peculiar absence of criticism of Mr Putin, for example, on the Russian hacking of American democracy, his land-grab of Crimea and his role in the continuing war in Eastern Ukraine. What is odd is that Mr Trump, in his tweets, favours the Russia line over, say, the CIA and the rest of the American intelligence community. But why on earth criticise the world leader with whom you most agree? Three men have egged along Trumputinism: Nigel Farage, who is clear that the European Union is a far bigger danger to world peace than Russia; his friend, Steve Bannon, who is now Mr Trump's chief strategist; and a Russian ""penseur"", Alexander Dugin. With his long hair and iconic Slavic looks, Mr Dugin is variously described as ""Putin's Brain"" or ""Putin's Rasputin"". Alexander Dugin is described as ""Putin's Brain"" He has his own pro-Kremlin TV show which pumps out Russian Orthodox supremacy in a curious mixture of Goebbels-style rhetoric and Songs of Praise. Mr Dugin is widely believed to have the ear of the Kremlin. He is also under Western sanctions for the ferocity of his statements in favour of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has cost 10,000 lives to date. Messrs Farage, Bannon and Dugin are all united that the greatest danger for Western civilisation lies in Islamist extremism. Mr Bannon aired his views in a right-wing mindfest on the fringes of the Vatican in 2014. He claimed that so-called Islamic State has a Twitter account ""about turning the United States into a 'river of blood'"". ""Trust me, that is going to come to Europe,"" he added. ""On top of that we're now, I believe, at the beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism."" The danger is that in allying yourself with the Kremlin in the way they fight ""Islamist fascism"" in say, Aleppo, you end up siding with what some have called ""Russian fascism"" or, at least, abandoning democratic values and the rules of war and, in so doing, become a recruiting sergeant for ISIS. It is a risk on which Mr Dugin does not seem willing to reflect. My interview with him in Moscow did not end well. Dugin posted a critical blog entry after walking out of his interview with John Sweeney First, he dismissed the chances that the Russians hacked American democracy as ""strictly zero"". I asked him about the depth of Mr Putin's commitment to democracy. ""Please be careful,"" he responded. ""You could not teach us democracy because you try to impose to every people, every state, every society, their Western, American or so-called American system of values without askingâ¦and it is absolutely racist; you are racist."" Too many of Mr Putin's critics end up dead - around 20 since he took power in 2000. I have met and admired three: Anna Politkovskaya, Natasha Estemirova and Boris Nemtsov. Boris Nemtsov was murdered close to the Kremlin in 2015 Mr Nemtsov was shot just outside the Kremlin's walls. I asked Mr Dugin what his death told us about Russian democracy. ""If you are engaged in Wikileaks you can be murdered,"" he countered. I then invited Mr Dugin to list the American journalists who have died under Barack Obama. Mr Dugin did not oblige but told me that ours was a ""completely stupid kind of conversation"" and walked out of the interview. Later, he posted a blog to his 20,000 followers, illustrated with my photograph and accusing me of manufacturing ""fake news"" and calling me ""an utter cretin... a globalist swine"". Such is the language of the new world order. A few days later I watched the press conference when Mr Trump closed down a question from a CNN reporter by accusing him of manufacturing ""fake news"".

Formula 1 sale approved by FIA,"Chase Carey, chairman of Liberty Media and F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone Formula 1's governing body the FIA has approved the sale of the sport's commercial rights to Liberty Media. The US company is in the process of finalising a purchase of a controlling interest in Formula 1. The FIA's approval was the final regulatory hurdle before the sale, which will see Liberty take over from investment group CVC Capital Partners. The FIA believed its partnership with Liberty will ""ensure the continued success and development"" of F1. Liberty is expected to complete its takeover of the sport within the next few weeks. It bought just over 18% of the shares in Delta Topco, the holding company of the F1 Group, in September. Liberty Media says it wants to protect the sport's historic European races - such as the Italian GP - which have been under threat as they struggle to make money Liberty announced before Christmas that it had cleared all regulatory hurdles and had the necessary approvals for the purchase. And on Tuesday in Colorado, the company's shareholders approved the buy-out. Its purchase of its second tranche of shares, to take its holding to 35.3%, is due to be completed within the next few weeks. Liberty has said it wants to protect F1's historic European races, establish new races in the USA and Latin America and grow the sport through the exploitation of digital media.

Why the NHS is performing miracles,"It has been a remarkable few weeks for the health service hasn't it? The worst waiting times in A&E for over a decade. Patients left for hours on trolleys. Vital cancer operations being cancelled. Hospitals across the country declaring major alerts. A humanitarian crisis in the making, says the Red Cross. But amid all this what we haven't heard is just how well the health service is coping. Given what it is facing, the NHS and, in particular, hospitals are performing miracles. How? Let me explain. The NHS is in the middle of the most sustained squeeze on its funding in its history. Until 2010, the budget increased by an average of about 4% a year once inflation is taken into account to help it cope with rising pressures. Since then, the average annual rise has been around 1% - and that will continue until 2020. The only period that comes close is the early 1950s when there was a cut in the NHS budget, prompting charging to be brought in for dentistry, prescriptions and spectacles. And that was pretty quickly followed by large cash injections to get the NHS back on track. There's nothing like that this time. Instead, the health service is being asked to carry on as normal with fewer doctors, nurses and hospital beds than many other developed countries - as the graphs below illustrate. Now international comparisons can be difficult. You could argue, for example, that Germany only has so many more beds because its counts long-stay beds reserved for elderly people in its health figures whereas in the NHS they come under the nursing home sector, which is separate. Nonetheless they pose an interesting question: are we simply expecting too much of the NHS? Anita Charlesworth, a health economist at the Health Foundation think tank and former Treasury official, thinks so. She says the NHS is being asked to provide ""world class access"" without the corresponding levels of funding and staff. Looked at like that, it puts the recent performance in a slightly different light. Faced with rising numbers coming in the front door (A&E) and increasing difficulty getting patients out the back (because of cuts to social care services), hospitals in England have found themselves full-to-bursting. In recent weeks, bed occupancy rates have hit 95%. Now that may not sound like the definition of being full, but it is well above the 85% recommended threshold for a hospital to work effectively. Above this level hospitals start to unravel, patients end up in the wrong places, infection rates start to rise and a backlog of patients builds up in corridors, in A&E and outside in ambulances dropping patients off. Yes, some of this has started happening, but in many respects you would have expected performance to deteriorate even more than it has. During the first week of the year - the most difficult so far this winter - more than three-quarters of patients arriving in A&E were still seen in four hours. Yes the rate of-called ""trolley waits"" - where patients admitted as an emergency are left waiting more than four hours for a bed - doubled to one in five patients. But the number of ""dire"" 12-hour waits only amounted to 0.5%. A week later bed occupancy rates had risen slightly - and guess what happened? Performance actually improved on many measures. Ask anybody working in the health service and they will say this is down to the dedication and hard work of hospital staff. Lord Kerslake, chairman of King's College Hospital in London and a former senior civil servant, has described the efforts of staff at his hospital as ""extraordinary"", while the BBC coverage over the past week or so has been full of doctors, nurses and managers recounting how everyone is pulling together. But there is more to it than that. The NHS has become very adept at managing pressure points. Daily reports are sent from hospitals to NHS Improvement, a newly-created regulator, about everything from the number of ambulances queuing outside A&Es to how many patients are stuck on trolleys inside. It means when there is a problem resources are immediately deployed by bosses at the centre. Extra managers are deployed, GPs and council care staff geed up and beds at local nursing homes used to move patients out of hospital. The result has been that the NHS has been able to - by and large - prevent the situation spiralling completely out of control and into a full-blown national crisis. Those involved in the process speak in admiration of the way the regulator has managed the situation. But make no mistake, this is fire-fighting and, as such, it can only last so long. An outbreak of flu or a sustained cold snap could alter the picture completely. And if it does not happen this winter, what about next? Or the one after that?

Success in sunken ship watch appeal,"The museum appealed for information about the owner of the watch An appeal for information about the original owner of a watch gifted to a Scottish museum has helped reunite members of his family. Sidney Worrall was a cook on board the SS Athenia, the first British ship to be sunk by Germany in World War Two. He gave his watch to a Canadian passenger and almost 80 years later it ended up at Glasgow's Riverside Museum. Sixteen members of his family responded to the museum curator's plea for more details about Mr Worrall. The SS Athenia was a transatlantic passenger liner built in Glasgow which sailed between the UK and Canada. The ship was sunk by a torpedo from a German submarine in September 1939, off the coast of Ireland. Mr Worrall was badly injured in the attack, which killed 117 people, and passed his watch to a Canadian man who was in the same lifeboat, Gerry Hutchinson. When Mr Hutchinson died, his son Rob donated the watch to the Riverside Museum. Family members Cath Muir and Dr Ernie Worrall were introduced when they viewed the watch at the Riverside Museum The Hutchisons believed Mr Worrall had died but the museum later learned he survived his injuries. He went on to marry and have a daughter and died in 1973. Family members said he never mentioned the watch he had left in the hands of a stranger. Among those to come forward in response to the museum's appeal for information were his granddaughter Cath Muir and nephew Dr Ernie Worrall, who did not know each other. Ms Muir said: ""What a surprise it was when by husband told me there was an appeal for information on my grandfather. I remember him as a child. He was very badly burned when the Athenia was attacked and had many skin grafts on his face and legs. He told us that they were his maps of the world. ""After returning from Galway he was pensioned out of the Merchant Navy due to the injuries he sustained, but he returned to sea to serve in the war, he felt it was his duty to do so, but that meant he had to forgo part of his pension.  After the war he worked as a hospital porter in Law Hospital, Lanarkshire. ""I am indebted to Gerry for keeping my grandfather's watch safe all these years and I look forward to bringing my own grandchildren to Riverside to see it on display soon."" The seaman's nephew, Dr Worrall, added: ""I was made aware of Riverside's search for my uncle Sid. My father had told me all about him being caught up in the torpedoing of the Athenia. ""A day or so after the sinking, my grandmother's neighbour was at the cinema and saw on the Pathe newsreel that night my uncle being landed as a survivor in Galway. At the end of the picture show she told my grandmother, who at that point would have been unaware whether her son had been killed or had been rescued. ""My grandmother hot-footed it down to the cinema just as the manager was closing up for the night and he kindly opened up and re-ran the newsreel for her while she sat in this empty cinema and was able to be reassured that he was indeed alive."" He added: ""Not only has Emily's detective work allowed me to learn more about my family's history, it has put me in touch with Cath and family I didn't know before."" Rob Hutchison donated the watch to Glasgow's Riverside Museum Rob Hutchinson, who gifted the watch to the Riverside, said: ""I am delighted that the museum has been able to draw together the two ends of this very long story. ""I look forward to one day seeing the museum's display and possibly meeting Sid's family. My father would have been so pleased."" The watch will go on display as part of an updated SS Athenia exhibition at the Riverside which is expected to open in summer 2017. Curator Emily Malcolm said: ""It is wonderful to welcome Cath and Ernie to Riverside, to show them Sid's watch and to introduce them to Rob in Canada. I am so pleased they got in touch. ""We are delighted the family is happy to help Glasgow Museums complete Sid's story and put the watch on display. It's good that something so positive has come from such a disaster.""

GCHQ seeks teenage girls for cyber fight,"The CyberFirst competition aims to get more girls to consider a career fighting online crime Teenage girls who spend a lot of time online and on social media could become the UK's spies of the future, Britain's intelligence agency hopes. GCHQ is launching a competition with the aim of encouraging more girls to think about a career in cyber security. Girls aged 13 to 15 will compete in tests that will also cover logic and coding, networking and cryptography. Women currently only make up 10% of the global cyber workforce, the agency says. The competition is part of a five-yearNational Cyber Security Strategy announced in November 2016, and will be overseen by the new National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Working in teams of four, the girls will complete online tasks remotely on their school computers, with each stage being harder than the previous one. The 10 groups with the highest scores will then be invited to theCyberFirst competition,externalfinal in London to investigate a complex cyber threat. CyberFirst's winning team will be awarded Â£1,000 worth of computer equipment for their school, as well as individual prizes. The NCSC was set up to be the main body for cyber security at a national level. It manages national cyber security incidents, carries out real-time threat analysis and provides advice. An NCSC spokeswoman said: ""Women can, and do, make a huge difference in cyber security - this competition could inspire many more to take their first steps into this dynamic and rewarding career."" Government Communications Headquarters director Robert Hannigan said:  ""I work alongside some truly brilliant women who help protect the UK from all manner of online threats. ""The CyberFirst Girls competition allows teams of young women a glimpse of this exciting world and provides a great opportunity to use new skills."" Have you got what it takes to be a spy?

Is free trade good or bad?,"Trade makes the world go round, but how free can it remain? Free trade is something of a sacred cow in the economics profession. Moving towards it, rather slowly, has also been one of the dominant features of the post-World War Two global economy. Now there are new challenges to that development. The UK is leaving the European Union and the single market - though in her speech this week, British Prime Minister Theresa May promised topush for the ""freest possible trade"" with European countriesand to sign new deals with others around the world. Most obviously Donald Trump has raised the possibility of quitting various trade agreements, notably Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. Even the World Trade Organization (WTO) has proposed new barriers to imports. In Europe, trade negotiations with the United States and Canada have run into difficulty, reflecting public concerns about the impact on jobs, the environment and consumer protection. The WTO's Doha Round of global trade liberalisation talks has run aground. The World Trade Organization is based in Geneva and came into being in 1995 The case for trade without government imposed barriers has a long history in economics. Adam Smith, the 18th Century Scottish economist who many see as the founding father of the subject, was in favour of it. But it was a later British writer, David Ricardo in the 19th Century, who set out the idea known ascomparative advantage,externalthat underpins much of the argument for freer trade. It is not about countries being able to produce more cheaply or efficiently than others. You can have a comparative advantage in making something even if you are less efficient than your trade partner. When a country shifts resources to produce more of one good there is what economists call an ""opportunity cost"" in terms of how much less of something else you can make. You have a comparative advantage in making a product if the cost in that sense is less than it is in another country. Economic arguments over free trade date back to the 19th Century If two countries trade on this basis, concentrating on goods where they have a comparative advantage they can both end up better off. Another reason that economists tend to look askance at trade restrictions comes from an analysis of the impact if governments do put up barriers - in particular tariffs or taxes - on imports. There are gains of course. The firms and workers who are protected can sell more of their goods in the home market. But consumers lose out by paying a higher price - and consumers in this case can mean businesses, if they buy the protected goods as components or raw materials. The textbook analysis says that those losses add up to more than the total gains. So you get the textbook conclusion that it's best to avoid protection. Many lower-skilled workers in developed economies feel they have lost out in the drive to globalisation And this conclusion is regardless of what other countries do. The 19th Century French economist Frederic Bastiat set it out it like this: ""It makes no more sense to be protectionist because other countries have tariffs than it would to block up our harbours because other countries have rocky coasts."" The implication is that unilateral trade liberalisation makes perfect sense. A more recent theory of what drives international trade looks at what are called economies of scale - where the more a firm produces of some good, the lower cost of each unit. The associated specialisation can make it beneficial for economies that are otherwise very similar to trade with one another. This area is known as new trade theory and the Nobel Prize winnerPaul Krugman,externalwas an important figure in developing it. The basic idea that it's good to have freer trade has underpinned decades of international co-operation on trade policy since World War Two. Free trade has been a cornerstone of the post-war world The period since 1945 has been characterised by a gradual lowering of trade barriers. It happened in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which began life in 1948 as a forum for governments to negotiate lower tariffs. Its membership was initially small, but by the time it was replaced by the World Trade Organization in 1995, most countries had signed up. The motivation was to end or reduce the protectionism or barriers to trade that went up in the 1930s. It is not generally thought that those barriers caused the Great Depression, butmany do think they aggravated and prolonged it.,external The process of post-wartrade liberalisation,externalwas driven largely by a desire for reciprocal concessions - better access to others' markets in return for opening your own. But what is the case against free (or at least freer) trade? First and foremost is the argument that it creates losers as well as winners. What Ricardo's theory suggested was that all countries engaging in trade could be better off. But his idea could not address the question of whether trade could create losers as well as winners within countries. Economic theory says if governments adopt protectionism, total losses will outweigh total gains Work by two Swedish Nobel Prize winners, Eli Hecksher and Bertil Ohlin, subsequently built on by the American Paul Samuelson developed the basic idea of comparative advantage in a way that showed that trade could lead tosome groups losing out,external. Putting it very briefly, if a country has a relatively abundant supply of, for example, low-skilled labour, those workers will gain while their low-skilled counterparts in countries where it is less abundant will lose. There has been a debate about whether this approach fits the facts, but some do see it as a useful explanation of how American industrial workers (for example) have been adversely affected by the rise of competition from countries such as China. A group of economists includingDavid Autor,externalof the Massachusetts Institute of Technology looked at the impact on areas where local industry was exposed to what they call the China shock. ""Adjustment in local labour markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labour-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commences. At this week's World Economic Forum, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned against isolationist moves that could spark a trade war ""Exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income."" Still if you accept that overall countries gain, then the winners could in principle fully compensate the losers and still be better off. Such programmes do exist. Countries that have unemployment benefits provide assistance to people who have lost their jobs. Some of those people will have been affected by competition from abroad. The United States has a programme that is specially targeted for people who lose their jobs as a result of imports, called Trade Adjustment Assistance. But is it enough?Lawrence Mishel,externalof the Economic Policy Institute, a think-tank in Washington writes: ""The winners have never tried to fully compensate the losers, so let's stop claiming that trade benefits us all."" Which arguments will Donald Trump be listening to in the White House? In any case, it is not clear that compensation would do the trick. AsMark Carney,,externalthe Bank of England governor noted, they may lose their jobs and also ""the dignity of work"". He is keen on maintaining open markets for trade, but recognises the need to do something about what you might call the side effects. To return to recent political developments - Donald Trump clearly did get support from many of those people in areas of the US where industry has declined. We don't yet know how he will address those issues when he takes his place in the White House. Perhaps his threats to introduce new tariffs are just that - threats. But the post-war trend towards more liberalised international trade looks more uncertain than it has for many years.

How safe is Sophie the Giraffe?,"It has been a favourite with children, and parents, for generations. But after mould was found inside the toy by some parents, people online and at home are asking: ""Just how safe is my Sophie the Giraffe?"" First launched in 1961, it is a squeaky toy giraffe, made from 100% natural rubber. Children seem to enjoy chewing on it, especially when they are teething. Tens of millions have been sold over the years, and its easy-to-grab shape means that paediatricians, as well as dentists have recommended it. There have been at least two cases reported of parents finding mould in the toy. And because Sophie is so ubiquitous, the issue has become a real talking point. Dentist Dana Chianese from New Jersey reported noticing air coming out of a hole in the toy that smelled musty. So she cut it open, only to find ""smelly, ugly mould"",externalliving in the toy. And almost a year ago, Stephanie Oprea from the US posted areview on Amazon,externalreporting a similar problem. ""Beware. If you have a drooly baby, moisture will get in the hole and you'll end up with mould. We've had ours for two years and the entire inside is coated with black mould,"" she wrote. This week - after her review was picked up by media - she added: ""I realise this will not be everyone's experience, but it was mine."" Sophie has a hole that lets air in and out, and which makes the toy squeezable. But that also means moisture can get inside. This liquid is usually either the saliva of a child chewing the giraffe, or the result of parents cleaning it. Mould needs two things to grow - water and warmth - and so over time, mould can grow inside the toy. Mould spores are in the air that we breathe every day, so most people, babies and adults, can deal with them. Most doctors agree that while it is not ideal that children are exposed to mould, most moulds are fairly harmless unless the child has an extremely susceptible immune system. Dr Richard Loh, a consultant immunologist at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Perth, Western Australia said that in his more than 20 years in the field, he was not aware of any research linking mould on toys to health concerns. ""Mould is all around us. If your child is in the park, picking up leaves and bits of grass, licking them and chewing them, there'll be mould there. We encounter mould a lot and in general we do not get ill. ""Would I knowingly give a child a toy with mould on it? Of course not. But if I discovered it afterwards, there'd be no need to be horrified or worried."" Dr Loh added there were extremely rare cases where people were allergic to mould. And he stressed severely mouldy environments, such as rooms left damp after flooding, could pose a health risk. Sophie the Giraffe is made by French firm Vuilli, (which incidentally calls it Sophie la Girafe). Vuilli said it had not been sent the mouldy toys for inspection, but that complaints were taken seriously and that children's safety, along with parental satisfaction, were its main priorities. It also said there were clear instructions on how to clean the toy correctly - including wiping with a damp cloth rather than immersing it in water and not putting it in the microwave or steam steriliser. Giraffes aren't the only animals at risk It seems not. ""If you take any bath toy that has been in the water and played with for a long time, then you cut it open, there's a good chance you'll find mould,"" Dr Loh said. And so while the giraffe seems to be at the heart of this particular story, things like rubber ducks are also susceptible.

Looking for $8m ideas,"Charles Chen Yidan is putting his technology fortune back into education A Chinese technology billionaire is offering the world's most valuable education prize. The Yidan Prize will award nearly $8m (Â£6.64m) every year to two research projects that have the potential to ""transform"" global education. Charles Chen Yidan, who co-founded China's internet company, Tencent, wants to use the prize to scale up innovative education research projects and replicate them across the world. Universities, governments and think tanks have reacted enthusiastically to the prize, and leading US institutions like Harvard and MIT have already submitted several nominations. But the winner might not necessarily be a household name in education. Even a local project could win the prize, if it can prove it has been effective. ""As long as an idea is replicable in other regions, we can give them an award,"" says Mr Chen. Mr Chen, now aged 45, became one of China's richest men after co-founding Tencent in 1998. In 2013, he stepped down to focus on educational philanthropy. His interest in education came from his family. His grandmother was illiterate but insisted that Mr Chen's father got a good education. The internet billionaire founded Wuhan College, with an emphasis on more than exam grades Mr Chen himself studied applied chemistry as an undergraduate at Shenzhen University and took a master's degree in economic law at Nanjing University. His educational philosophy has also been shaped by the ""tremendous pressure"" he felt while studying for China's ""gaokao"" higher education entrance examinations. So he set up Wuhan College, a private university in China, which focuses on ""whole-person development"" rather than rote-learning and examinations. More stories from theBBC's Global education series,externallooking at education from an international perspective, andhow to get in touch. You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. The college aims to train talented students to join China's technology industry. Executives from Tencent helped to design the college's curriculum, recruit students and teach classes, so that its graduates are trained in the skills required by employers. But Mr Chen was frustrated that this college only reached a limited number of students. So he decided a global education prize would be the best way to improve education for millions of young people. Mr Chen, speaking on a tour of Europe to promote the prize to universities, governments, NGOs and think tanks, says he has already been inundated with nominations. He wants the prize to focus the attention of universities and governments on future trends in education. Looking for creativity: Fine art exam in Wuhan this autumn ""We find that no matter whether people come from a rich or developing country, in the east or the west, they are talking about similar concerns,"" says Mr Yidan. These are questions about children from rich families having the best access to education, and whether students in some countries face too many exams. The prize-winners will be chosen by an independent committee of educational experts led by Dr Koichiro Matsuura, former director-general of Unesco. They are looking for nominations that are innovative and sustainable, that reform existing educational structures, and that respond to what might be the future challenges for education. But Mr Chen also has his own ideas about how to improve global education. Speaking through a translator but occasionally breaking into English to reinforce a point, he said he wants to find ways to make the most of the expertise of retired teachers. Mr Yidan, launching the prize, called for better use of the talents of retired teachers ""They are a valuable resource that we need to make better use of,"" he says. He thinks that collecting ""big data"" on students can improve the education that individual students receive. ""By analysing big data, we can find bespoke ways to help pupils in need,"" he says. Unsurprisingly for the co-founder of an internet company, he believes that technology will transform education. This latest education prize is now the most valuable. The Global Teacher Prize, run by the Varkey Foundation, gives $1m (Â£830,000) annually to a teacher who has made an ""outstanding contribution"" to education. The Broad Prize for Urban Education, which ran from 2002 to 2014, gave $1m every year to a school district in the US that significantly improved the academic performance of low-income and minority students. The WISE Prize for education, supported by the Qatar Foundation, awards $500,000 (Â£415,000) to the winning laureate. But is a prize really the best way to improve education? Dan Sarofian-Butin, founding dean of the school of education and social policy at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, says that prize money can be a poor way of achieving change. ""Rather than give a one-off cash prize, I hope the Yidan Prize will nurture and sustain its winners over a period of years,"" he says. Hanan Al Hroub who teaches refugee children has been named as the world's best teacher ""If you look at the TV show Dragons' Den, or Shark Tank in the US, what the winners really get is not just the investment money from the sharks, but their expertise, their network of contacts and firms, their foot in the door with many companies, and their national exposure. ""Likewise, a really powerful education prize would create a mechanism that fostered exactly such mentoring, networking, and sustainability."" Andreas Schleicher, education director at the OECD, welcomes the Yidan Prize as an incentive for innovation in education. ""When we surveyed teachers, less than a quarter of them said they would be recognised for greater levels of innovation,"" he said. ""The highly industrial and compliance-based organisation of education generally means that even where good ideas are generated, they don't scale and spread."" Nominations close at the end of March,externaland the winners will be announced in September.

Filling Buble's shoes,"With only five weeks to go, it looks like the Brit Awards have no host. Canadian crooner Michael Buble was due to present - but that's been in doubt since his three-year-old son Noah was diagnosed with cancer last year. At the time, the distraught singercancelled all future engagements,saying he was determined to focus on caring for his eldest child. It was hoped he'd be able to return for the Brit Awards, butmedia reports,externalaresuggesting,externalhe's pulled out for good - and understandably so. So, who could take the helm at the O2 Arena on 22 February? Here are a few suggestions... Ant (stands on the left, a bit wacky), and Dec (stands on the right, giggles) were hardly at their best when they hosted the Brits last year. The nadir was the moment when Ant ""mistakenly"" appeared on stage in a dress. Because a man in a dress is hilarious, right? Coming so soon after a video tribute to androgyny-embracing pop lizard David Bowie, it felt particularly dated. But with a better scriptwriter they're a safe pair of hands - and, crucially, able to draw a big audience. Back in 2008 when Katy Perry was a relatively new and untested pop star, she took the helm of the MTV Europe Music Awards in Liverpool and totally stole the show. Cheeky and energetic, she kept the event moving at a frenetic pace, racing through 10 costume changes and more than a few memorable moments. ""Girls. Just a reminder,"" she said, while riding on top of a giant banana. ""It's not how big the banana is - it's how you sit on it."" With new music to promote in 2017, could the star be coaxed into a repeat performance? If only so they can go: ""On your marks, get set, DRAKE!"" By hiring Michael Buble, the Brits were making a statement of intent: we want some showbiz, and we want a host a global audience will recognise. Adele is one of the only other stars that fits the bill. In many ways, Adeleisthe Brits. From the stop-you-in-your-tracks performance of Someone Like You to the moment last year when she tearfully accepted an award from Tim Peake in outer space. She's funny, she's charismatic, and there's 0% chance she'll do it. Which will be a relief for the person who works the bleep button. He's already winning the Brits Icon Award, so they won't need to book an extra cab. His propensity to go off-script might cause organisers a few headaches - but a double-header with his bff Olly Murs would be worth tuning in for. Before he swanned off to become a US chat show host, Corden presented the Brits five times (including a stint with Kylie in 2009). He stood down three years ago, telling the Radio Times he didn't want to outstay his welcome. ""There are award shows where it actually becomes a plus that it's hosted by the same person,""he said,external. ""But the Brits should always have an energy about them that is fresh and new and exciting."" But imagine if the whole Brits ceremony was an extended episode of Carpool Karaoke? No pizzazz, no fireworks, no music industry ""suits"" - just a rotating cast of megastars in the passenger seat, with Corden fishing the occasional trophy out of his glove compartment. TV Gold. But, seeing as he'salready presenting the Grammysa week before, extremely unlikely. The Brits have often looked to comedians to provide a bit of frisson - notably Russell Brand, who outraged (some) viewers in 2007 with his references to the Queen's ""naughty bits"" and Amy Winehouse's drinking problem (""her surname's beginning to sound like a description of her liver"".) Of the current crop of stand-ups, Jack Whitehall has both the profile and the requisite irreverence. His UK tour might get in the way of rehearsals but, by coincidence, he has a day off on 22 February. In the year thatgrime took over the Brits, Julie Adenuga would be a brave but bold choice. The Beats 1 DJ is one of the genre's biggest champions (as well as being sister to three-time nominee Skepta) but eminently knowledgeable about music from all walks of life. Apple Music is also sponsoring two of the awards - best British male and best British female - so there's also a commercial reason to use one of their presenters on the night. However, she's untested as a live TV presenter, so unlikely to make the cut. On second thoughts, no. X Factor host and hot buttered crumpet Dermot O'Leary makes live television look like a walk in the park - when in reality it's a race through a field full of knives, on one leg, in the dark, tethered to an excited donkey. Amazingly, he's never presented the Brits, but given his role as a new music champion on Radio 2, he's a perfect fit. Big Brother host Emma Willis did a great job fronting the Brits nominations show on Saturday night, attracting a respectable 1.6 million viewers to ITV. She told the BBC she was planning to watch the main ceremony from the audience - but if the call comes, she can recreate her favourite ever Brit moment, when ""Cat Deeley flew in on a champagne bottle"" in 2004.

May on Brexit: Then and now,"Theresa May giving a pro-EU speech in April (left) and delivering her Brexit address Theresa May has said the UK will emerge from Brexit as a ""great, global trading nation"", becoming ""safer, more secure and more prosperous"". But in April - before the EU referendum - the then home secretary gave aspeech,externalwarning of the implications of a vote to leave the EU. Here's how some of the key quotes compare: April 2016: ""So, if we do vote to leave the European Union, we risk bringing the development of the single market to a halt, we risk a loss of investors and businesses to remaining EU member states driven by discriminatory EU policies, and we risk going backwards when it comes to international trade. ""But the big question is whether, in the event of Brexit, we would be able to negotiate a new free trade agreement with the EU and on what terms."" January 2017: ""I respect the position taken by European leaders who have been clear about their position, just as I am clear about mine. So an important part of the new strategic partnership we seek with the EU will be the pursuit of the greatest possible access to the single market, on a fully reciprocal basis, through a comprehensive free trade agreement."" April 2016:""The reality is that we do not know on what terms we would win access to the single market. We do know that in a negotiation we would need to make concessions in order to access it, and those concessions could well be about accepting EU regulations, over which we would have no say, making financial contributions, just as we do now, accepting free movement rules, just as we do now, or quite possibly all three combined. ""It is not clear why other EU member states would give Britain a better deal than they themselves enjoy."" January 2017: ""If we were excluded from accessing the single market, we would be free to change the basis of Britain's economic model. ""But for the EU, it would mean new barriers to trade with one of the biggest economies in the world. It would jeopardise investments in Britain by EU companies worth more than half a trillion pounds... and I do not believe that the EU's leaders will seriously tell German exporters, French farmers, Spanish fishermen, the young unemployed of the eurozone, and millions of others, that they want to make them poorer, just to punish Britain and make a political point."" The PM said China had expressed an interest in a trade deal with the UK April 2016:""It is tempting to look at developing countries' economies, with their high growth rates, and see them as an alternative to trade with Europe. But just look at the reality of our trading relationship with China - with its dumping policies, protective tariffs and industrial-scale industrial espionage. And look at the figures. We export more to Ireland than we do to China, almost twice as much to Belgium as we do to India, and nearly three times as much to Sweden as we do to Brazil. It is not realistic to think we could just replace European trade with these new markets."" ""And while we could certainly negotiate our own trade agreements, there would be no guarantee that they would be on terms as good as those we enjoy now. There would also be a considerable opportunity cost given the need to replace the existing agreements - not least with the EU itself - that we would have torn up as a consequence of our departure."" January 2017:""We want to get out into the wider world, to trade and do business all around the globe. Countries including China, Brazil, and the Gulf States have already expressed their interest in striking trade deals with us."" This video can not be played Theresa May on EU and immigration April 2016 (responding to a question from the BBC):""What matters is that we have brought about changes in the free movement rules as a result of the negotiation."" January 2017:""As home secretary for six years, I know that you cannot control immigration overall when there is free movement to Britain from Europe."" April 2016:""With no agreement, we know that WTO rules would oblige the EU to charge 10% tariffs on UK car exports, in line with the tariffs they impose on Japan and the United States. They would be required to do the same for all other goods upon which they impose tariffs.  Not all of these tariffs are as high as 10%, but some are considerably higher."" January 2017:""And while I am confident that this scenario need never arise - while I am sure a positive agreement can be reached - I am equally clear that no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain. ""Because we would still be able to trade with Europe. We would be free to strike trade deals across the world. And we would have the freedom to set the competitive tax rates and embrace the policies that would attract the world's best companies and biggest investors to Britain.""

Trump and the nuclear codes,"On 20 January, inauguration day in the United States, a nameless, unknown military aide was seen accompanying President Barack Obama to the handover ceremony at the US Capitol in Washington. That military aide was carrying a satchel over his or her shoulder containing a briefcase known as ""the nuclear football"". Inside was a piece of digital hardware measuring 3in (7.3cm) by 5in, known as ""the biscuit"". This contained the launch codes for a strategic nuclear strike. The briefing for the incoming president on how to activate them had already taken place out of public sight, but the moment President-elect Donald Trump took the oath of office that aide, and the satchel, moved quietly over to his side. From then on, Donald Trump has had sole authority to order an action that could result in the deaths of millions of people in under an hour. The question on a lot of people's minds is, given his thin skin and impulsive temperament, what are the safeguards, if any, to prevent an impetuous decision by one man with catastrophic consequences? First off, it should be said that Donald Trump has previously rowed back on some of his earlier, provocative comments on the use of nuclear weapons. He stated he would be ""the last person to use them"", although he did not rule it out. Donald Trump: US must greatly expand nuclear capabilities Russia's top spin doctor in nuclear warning North Korea's nuclear programme: How advanced is it? Other senior figures are also involved in the chain of command, such as the US Secretary of Defence, retired US Marine Gen James Mattis, But Mark Fitzpatrick, a nuclear non-proliferation expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Washington, says that ultimately, the sole authority to launch a strike rests with the president. ""There are no checks and balances on the president's authority to launch a nuclear strike,"" he says. ""But between the time he authorises one and the time it's carried out there are other people involved."" The idea of a rogue president taking such a monumental decision on his own is unrealistic. He gives the order and the secretary of defence is constitutionally obliged to carry it out. The secretary of defence could, in theory, refuse to obey the order if he had reason to doubt the president's sanity, but this would constitute mutiny and the president can then fire him and assign the task to the deputy secretary of defence. Donald Trump says the US should ""greatly strengthen and expand"" its nuclear capabilities Under the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution a vice-president could, in theory, declare the president mentally incapable of taking a proper decision, but he would need to be backed by a majority of the cabinet. So how would it work in practice? Inside that briefcase, the ""nuclear football"" that never leaves the president's side, is a ""black book"" of strike options for him to choose from once he has authenticated his identity as commander-in-chief, using a plastic card. Washington folklore has it that a previous president temporarily mislaid his identification card when he left it inside a jacket that was sent to the dry cleaners. Once the president has selected his strike options from a long-prepared ""menu"", the order is passed via the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Pentagon's war room and then, using sealed authentication codes, on to US Strategic Command HQ in Offutt Airbase in Nebraska. The order to fire is transmitted to the actual launch crews using encrypted codes that have to match the codes locked inside their safes. This video can not be played Which countries have nuclear weapons? The US and Russia both possess enough nuclear missiles to destroy each other's cities several times over - there are reported to be 100 US nuclear warheads aimed at Moscow alone. The two countries' arsenals account for more than 90% of the world's total number of nuclear warheads. As of September 2016 Russia had the most, with an estimated 1796 strategic nuclear warheads, deployed on a mixed platform of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and strategic bombers. Under a programme ordered by President Vladimir Putin, Moscow has recently invested billions of roubles in upgrading its strategic nuclear missile force, keeping an arsenal of constantly mobile ballistic missiles travelling through tunnels deep beneath the forests of Siberia. America had, in September 2016, 1,367 strategic nuclear warheads, similarly deployed in land-based underground missile silos, which by their static nature are vulnerable to a first strike, at sea onboard submarines, where they are harder to detect, and at airbases, where they can be loaded on to bombers. The UK has about 120 strategic warheads, of which only a third are deployed at sea. The Royal Navy always keeps a portion of the nation's Trident nuclear force somewhere in the world's oceans, maintaining what is known as the continuous at sea deterrent. The Topol is one of Russia's mobile ICBMs ICBMs travel at a speed of over 17,000mph (Mach 23), flying high above the Earth's atmosphere before descending towards their pre-programmed targets at four miles a second. The flight-time for land-based missiles flying between Russia and the US is between 25 and 30 minutes. For submarine-based missiles, where the boats may be able to approach a coast covertly, the flight time could be considerably shorter, even as little as 12 minutes. This does not leave a president much time to decide whether it is a false alarm or imminent Armageddon. Once ICBMs have been launched they cannot be recalled, but if they remain in their silos they will probably be destroyed by the inbound attack. A former senior White House official told me recently that much would depend on the circumstances in which a nuclear strike was being considered. If this was a long-term, measured policy decision to say, carry out a pre-emptive strike on country X, then a lot of people would be involved. The vice-president, National Security Adviser, and much of the cabinet would all be likely to be included in the decision-making process. But if there was an imminent strategic threat to the United States, i.e. if an inbound launch of ICBMs from a hostile state had been detected and were minutes from reaching the US then, he said, ""the president has extraordinary latitude to take the sole decision to launch.""

11 key points from the May speech,"Ambassadors from other EU countries were invited to hear Theresa May's speech With her Brexit speech, Theresa May has for the first time revealed some key details about her approach to negotiations with the EU. Here's what we know now: What it is:The single market aims to make it easy for EU nations to trade with one another. It allows free movement of goods, workers, services and capital around the EU, without any tariffs, pretty much as if it was all one country. While it remains in the EU, the UK is a full member of the single market, and much of the Brexit debate has been about what will happen when it leaves. Some non-EU countries - such as Norway - have arrangements with the EU that allow them to be part of the single market if they meet certain conditions. UK government position:Having previously not publicly committed either way, Theresa May confirmed the UK cannot remain a member of the single market after it leaves the EU. She said this was because, as European leaders have stressed, the UK would have to accept EU rules and regulations and be bound by the European Court of Justice. Instead, she said, the UK will push for a new ""comprehensive free trade agreement"", giving it ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Theresa May said ""elements"" of the single market could remain for financial services The deal might contain ""elements"" of the current arrangements, she said, singling out the the motor trade and financial services as examples. What it is:A customs union is an arrangement between countries who agree not to impose tariffs on each other's goods. They also agree to impose common external tariffs on goods from countries outside their customs union. Setting common external tariffs is what distinguishes a customs union from a free trade area, where members are able to set their own tariffs on goods from the rest of the world. As an EU member, the UK is currently part of its customs union. What we know:The PM specified that the UK will leave the EU customs union, saying elements of it (the Common Commercial Policy and the Common External Tariff) prevented the UK from striking trade deals around the world. At the same time, she said she wanted the UK ""to have a customs union agreement with the EU"". She added: ""Whether that means we must reach a completely new customs agreement, become an associate member of the customs union in some way, or remain a signatory to some elements of it, I hold no preconceived position."" The 28 member states are in the EU customs union, but the EU also has separate customs union agreements - which vary in scope, for example in relation to the type of goods covered, with a number of other countries. The government has made clear that there will be restrictions to EU migration as a result of the referendum. This was reiterated by Mrs May in her speech, saying: ""The message from the public before and during the referendum campaign was clear: Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe. And that is what we will deliver."" But the precise model to be used has not yet been confirmed. During the referendum campaign, Vote Leave called for a ""points-based"" system, similar to that used in Australia. But this model, which would involve applications being accepted on the basis of skills, has been rejected by Mrs May, who says it would not give sufficient control to the government. An alternative, which Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said is under consideration, is to require migrants to have a work permit before coming to work in the UK, with ministers able to prioritise different sectors. The government has said all possibilities are being considered. The fate of EU citizens currently living in the UK and of UK citizens living in the rest of the EU has become another pressing question. The government has repeatedly stated that the UK could not make commitments on the right of EU citizens to remain in the UK without securing a reciprocal deal for British citizens living abroad in Europe. ""I have said on many occasions that I expect to be able to, and wish to be able to, guarantee their status here in the UK, but we do need reciprocity - we need to have care and concern for UK citizens who are living in the European Union,"" Mrs May told MPs last month. In her speech, she said many countries wanted a deal, but ""one or two others do not"", and called for a resolution as soon as possible. Mrs May confirmed: ""l will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and the EU to a vote in both Houses of Parliament, before it comes into force."" After her speech, Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs the UK would be leaving the EU whatever the outcome of the vote. The government will also be forced to consult Parliament before starting negotiations if it loses the legal challenge over Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The prime minister has been clear the UK will no longer be bound by the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice, which ensures the application of EU legislation, after Brexit. ""We are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,"" she told the Conservative Party conference. ""That's not going to happen."" There has been much talk of an interim deal between the UK and the EU before the final terms are agreed. But different versions of what this could mean have been put forward. In her speech, Mrs May said there would be no ""unlimited transitional status"", which would leave the UK in ""some kind of permanent political purgatory"". However, she proposed a ""phased process of implementation"" after a deal has been reached, to allow each element of the deal to be introduced. As it will not be in the single market, the UK will not pay ""huge sums"" to EU budgets, Theresa May said. In some circumstances it may have to make an ""appropriate contribution"" to be part of European schemes, she said. ""But the principle is clear: the days of Britain making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end."" The PM gave her strongest warning yet to her opposite numbers ahead of the negotiations, saying a ""punitive deal that punishes Britain"" would be ""an act of calamitous self-harm for the countries of Europe"" and would ""not be the act of a friend"". She added that ""no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain"". There was another warning for the EU in the PM's speech, as she told leaders to ""respect difference"", rather than ""trying to hold things together by force, tightening a vice-like grip that ends up crushing into tiny pieces the very things you want to protect"". The government had already set itself a Brexit deadline - Theresa May will give notice of the UK's departure from the EU under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty before the end of March. This allows two years for the negotiations to be completed before the UK leaves. The government has insisted neither a pending Supreme Court judgement nor the political upheaval in Northern Ireland will delay its timetable. What will happen to EU funding currently given to projects and different regions across the UK? We know that during negotiations with the EU, all rights and obligations from EU membership will continue as normal. This means that the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget and that all projects in the UK that currently benefit from EU funding will continue to do so while the UK remains a member of the EU. In August, the Treasury said it would guarantee to back EU-funded projects signed before the Autumn Statement (23 November). Agricultural funding now provided by the EU will also continue until 2020. In October, Chancellor Philip Hammond told the Conservative Party conference the Treasury would guarantee payments for multi-year EU funding secured before Brexit after Britain left the EU.

Melania Trump's hometown celebrates,"This video can not be played What was Melania Trump like in Slovenia? The President Burger is presented with a flourish - on a wooden board, surrounded by circular ""dollar fries"" and topped with a yellow crust of cheese ""hair"" which looks as if it might fly away at any moment. As tributes to the US President-elect go, it may not be the most respectful. But it is offered with the affection and gentle humour which it soon becomes apparent is a hallmark of Sevnica, a Slovenian town which just happens to be the place where Donald Trump's first-lady-to-be, Melania, spent most of her childhood. ""We formed the burger so it would resemble Trump a little bit,"" chuckles Bruno Vidmar, the chef-proprietor of Rondo, a restaurant in the newer part of Sevnica. ""It has hot peppers, because Trump's statements are hot - and it comes with dollar fries because he's a successful entrepreneur."" The owner of the Rondo restaurant designed this burger to resemble Donald Trump The presidential tie-in seems to be serving Rondo well: on a weekday morning, the place is buzzing with an early lunch crowd from the nearby furniture and textile factories. Meanwhile a table full of smartly-dressed young women order another of Bruno's culinary creations dreamt up with Sevnica's most famous daughter in mind. ""The 'Melanija' dessert is made out of sponge, then there's a layer of mascarpone and strawberries. It's light enough for a model - and we have it on good authority that Melania loves strawberries."" Sevnica is a small place - so Bruno probably did not have to search long to find an authority on what Melania likes for pudding. Or, at least, what she did like when she was growing up as Melanija Knavs in this town of fewer than 5,000 people. Bar the addition of a branch of Lidl on the outskirts, little seems to have changed since she left for Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, as a teenager. The old castle - parts of which date back to the 12th Century - still overlooks Sevnica from its hilltop perch. The town itself is a tidy place with new and old sections, sitting alongside the River Sava and surrounded by forested hills. The Slovenian Tourist Board suggests that Sevnica is ""an excellent destination for those who enjoy picnics and outings, hiking, cycling or fishing"". If the roads had been less icy, it would certainly have been an enjoyable ride through the trees to GostiÅ¡Äe Ob Ribniku, a restaurant and guesthouse next to a small lake. Inside the traditional wooden chalet, you can chat to one of the people who can shed some light on the future first lady's early years. Sevnica is ""an excellent destination for those who enjoy picnics and outings, hiking, cycling or fishing"" according to the Slovenian Tourist Board ""We were next door neighbours - and we used to go the same way to school,"" says Mateja Zalezina, who runs GostiÅ¡Äe Ob Ribniku with her husband, Dejan. ""In the afternoon when we came back we used to hang out in front of the apartment block. Even then she was quite busy, because her mother was a fashion designer and Melania was one of the models for the Jutranjka company that did fashion for kids."" Mateja laughs at the idea that she could have spotted that her neighbour would go a long way from Sevnica - never mind all the way to the White House. But she says that Melania could not help but stand out. ""She was really good at school. She and her sister Ines were studying really hard. After school, we played a game called 'gumi-twist', an elastic band game, and she was really good at that. She had the figure of a model - really long legs - and she always won!"" The restaurant is offering a three-course ""Melanija Menu"" in honour of Mateja's former playmate. But, like Rondo's eponymous offering, this does not feel like a culinary cash-in, just a low-key tribute, delivered with affection. ""I'm really happy for her - she's achieved the maximum,"" says Dejan. ""I hope everyone in Sevnica will watch the inauguration. We will be here at the restaurant with friends and will raise a glass to them both."" Melania's former neighbour says America's next first lady studied ""really hard"" at school Back in the old town, beneath the castle, Sevnica's mayor Srecko Ocvirk is not planning any special events to mark the start of the Trump era. But he hopes the publicity will bring the town's charms to the attention of tourists. ""The first visitors who came were journalists like you,"" he admits. ""But we're now seeing there are rising numbers of tourists. We're also expecting more organised tour groups after the inauguration. Sevnica and the region will become better known because of this."" At the town's primary school, one of the staff has certainly achieved a degree of local celebrity. Art teacher Nena Bedek was best friends with Melania until the future Mrs Trump left to finish her schooling in Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana. Now Nena fields questions from her students about her friendship with Sevnica's most famous former resident - and marvels at the different paths their lives have taken. ""It's a 'wow' effect for us and for me,"" she says. Melania's childhood best friend has fond memories ""She was a reliable girl and a very good friend. But she never wished to stand out - even though she was beautiful and hard-working. She loved to read and draw. She was brought up in a very artistic manner - she knew what was beautiful - due to her mother's job as a fashion designer. I have very fond memories and keep her very close in my heart."" As for the town's various tributes - which include wine, slippers and honey as well as the culinary offerings - Nena believes they are in keeping with the Sevnica spirit. ""They are very sympathetic and sweet - none of them are bad things - and it's also funny. I think it's still within limits - all in all it's sweet and nice."" Rather like Sevnica itself, perhaps.

Clearest idea yet of deal PM wants,"It cannot be said Britain will begin its exit from the EU with no destination in mind. After today we have the clearest idea of the deal Theresa May wants:UK access to the European Single Marketbut no membership of it; a tariff-free customs union with the EU but freedom to sign trade deal with other countries; some sort of bridging arrangement between membership of the EU and life outside it to avoid ""a disruptive cliff edge"", to use Theresa May's phrase; a close security relationship with the EU. Most strikingly, while the Prime Minister's speech tried to soothe friction between the UK and the EU by stressing the need for friendly mutual co-operation she had a blunt warning for the EU too. Britain will not sign a deal at any price. ""A punitive deal would be a calamitous act of self-harm"", she told the audience of EU ambassadors gathered in the splendour of Lancaster House. But it is for the decision to take Britain out of the single market that historians will remember this speech. Brexit Live: Reaction to Theresa May's speech The most important words May will ever deliver? All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU The clues had been there for months. While claiming not to want a running commentary Theresa May has said many times Britain's break from the EU must result in control over EU migration and freedom from the jurisdiction of EU law. It was there in her speech to the Conservative Party conference in October. Those political choices could only mean one outcome: Leaving the European Single Market. It is the most important economic decision Britain has taken for years. It was at the same venue 28 years ago that Margaret Thatcher made a speech praising the embryonic single market. ""A single market without barriers - visible or invisible - giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people"", the former prime minster said. The trading options explained May: UK to leave single market Thatcher pioneered its creation (though later criticised the social dimension of the internal market) and the main political parties have been committed to it ever since. The 2015 Conservative manifesto contained the following: ""We benefit from the Single Market.... We want to preserve the integrity of the Single Market....We want to expand the Single Market"". Of course, it also contained the promise of an EU referendum. And the Brexit vote has trumped continued membership of the single market. The government could have made a different choice. Norway is an example of a country outside the EU that is a member of the single market. However, it has to pay a contribution to the EU budget, accept the freedom of EU citizens to live and work in Norway, is subject to European Court of Justice oversight and has no formal say in EU decision making. For Number 10 that was a non-starter. For a start, this speech was not a full blueprint for Brexit for the obvious reason that Number 10 does not want to spell out its negotiation strategy before talks with the EU begin. Crucially, the final shape of Britain's post-Brexit relationship with the EU can only be known after it has been agreed by the remaining 27 member states and European Parliament. They too will approach the talks with demands, red lines and guiding principles. Today Chancellor Angela Merkel told German businesses that conditions for access to the single market could not be ""loosened"" otherwise every EU country would try and ""cherry pick"" a new deal. The big question is how flexible Theresa May's starting principles become when negotiations begin. And huge unknowns remain. What budget payments will the EU demand for single market access? Will EU workers have some freedom to work in the UK? Will the EU allow partial membership of the customs union?

Europe reacts to speech,"A UK Brexit deal requires approval by 27 other countries Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit speech is being seen in Europe as the ""hard"" option of full UK withdrawal - and there is some relief that the British position is clearer now. ""Finally we have a little more clarity re the British plans,"" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said. Germany also wanted a ""close and trusting relationship"", he said. The Czech Europe Minister, Tomas Prouza,tweeted,external: ""UK's plan seems a bit ambitious"". ""Trade as free as possible, full control on immigration... where is the give for all the take?"" he asked. The Italian daily La Repubblica commented: ""Out of the EU, out of common market, out of everything. It appears that Theresa May's intention through negotiations with the EU at the end of March is 'a hard Brexit' - a very hard Brexit indeed."" BBC live coverage in full here. May: UK must leave EU single market One of the top EU officials, European Council president Donald Tusk, voiced regret but some relief too in atweet,external: ""Sad process, surrealistic times but at least more realistic announcement on #Brexit."" Belgian liberal Guy Verhofstadt, named as the European Parliament's lead negotiator on Brexit, warned that any deal for the UK would be worse than EU membership. He said it was an ""illusion"" for Mrs May to suggest ""that you can go out of the single market, that you can go out of the customs union and that you can cherry-pick, that you can have still a number of advantages - I think that will not happen"". Mrs May's mention of a possible alternative economic model for the UK was a ""threat"", he said, that could obstruct the negotiations. Norway's Aftenposten daily said Mrs May's speech signalled ""a clear rejection of a Norwegian-type involvement in the [EU] internal market"". Norway hasvery close ties to the EU- as a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) it has open, tariff-free access to the EU single market, though Norwegian fisheries and agriculture are excluded. The price for that advantage is high Norwegian contributions to the EU budget and automatic acceptance of most EU laws. Gatwick airport border control: Mrs May has pledged to curb immigration from the EU ""Even though she rejects the term, it is indeed a hard Brexit,"" commented France's Le Figaro daily. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front (FN) in France praised Mrs May's speech. FN vice-president Florian Philippottweeted,external: ""Bravo to T. May who respects her people with a 'clear and clean' Brexit. Sovereignty cannot be a half-measure. French independence soon!"" Michael Fuchs, a close conservative ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, accused Mrs May of ""cherry-picking"" in her speech, Sky News reported in atweet,external. EU politicians have stressed that they will not let the UK ""cherry-pick"" parts of its EU membership terms. They insist that the single market's four freedoms - covering goods, services, capital and labour - cannot be diluted. The Dutch daily Algemeen Dagblad called Mrs May's speech ""not just a bit of Brexit but the full whack"". ""Bye bye EU... the unspoken, big threat from London is creating a tax paradise in front of the gates of Europe,"" it said. Sweden's former Foreign Minister Carl Bildttweeted,external: ""I regret the approach the UK government has taken. ""I think most of the EU would have preferred a closer relationship with the UK.""

Trump inauguration boycott escalates,"Mr Trump tweeted this photo with the caption: ""Writing my inaugural address at the Winter White House, Mar-a-Lago, three weeks ago. Looking forward to Friday"" A sizeable number of Democratic lawmakers have said they are boycotting President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration at the US Capitol. More than 50 House Democrats are refusing to watch as Mr Trump is sworn in as the 45th US president. Many of the boycotters are motivated by a feud between the newly-elected president and the civil rights activist and congressman, John Lewis. Mr Lewis, a revered veteran of the 1960s struggle, sparked controversy last Friday when he called Mr Trump's victory illegitimate because of Russia's alleged interference in the election. He also announced he was joining a boycott by what was then fewer than a dozen Democratic colleagues. The president-elect hit back on Twitter, attacking the Georgia lawmaker as ""all talk, talk, talk - no action or results"", which prompted a wave of outrage from people saying if anyone embodied action, it was the 76-year-old. Dozens more members of Congress then announced they would skip the event. This video can not be played Dozens of Democrats are refusing to attend inauguration ""I will not celebrate a man who preaches a politics of division and hate,""Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota tweeted,externalfollowing the row. ""Skipping Inauguration. @RepJohnLewis a civil rights hero. Enormous responsibility to be POTUS. I respect the office, can't tolerate disrespect,"" Maryland RepresentativeAnthony G Brown also tweeted.,external Many gave other reasons, such as Mr Trump's comments about women, Russian interference in the election and the president-elect's perceived conflicts of interest. Others still said they disliked pageantry and one California congresswoman, Karen Bass, said she had pulled out after conducting a Twitter poll of her constituents. The number grew to more than 40 over the Martin Luther King holiday weekend, but that did not stop Mr Trump from continuing to rail against the civil rights icon on Tuesday. The president-elect tweeted that Mr Lewis had falsely claimed this would be the first inauguration he has missed since joining Congress in 1987. This video can not be played Congressman Mark Takano explains to the Today programme why he is boycotting Trump's inauguration ""WRONG (or lie)!""Mr Trump tweeted,external, saying Mr Lewis had skipped George W Bush's inauguration in 2001. Mr Lewis' office confirmed that he did miss Mr Bush's ceremony. ""His absence at that time was also a form of dissent,"" said spokeswoman Brenda Jones. ""He did not believe the outcome of that election, including the controversies around the results in Florida and the unprecedented intervention of the US Supreme Court, reflected a free, fair and open democratic process."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Although everything connected with President Donald Trump seems unprecedented, this isn't the first time an opposition party has boycotted a presidential inauguration in sizable numbers. According to Arizona State University historian Brooks Simpson, 80 lawmakers missed Richard Nixon's 1973 swearing-in ceremony. Representative John Lewis, a vocal Trump critic who plans to stay at home on Friday, also sat out George W Bush's 2001 event, along with some other members of the Congressional Black Caucus. This video can not be played Democrat lawmaker, Mark DeSaulnier, tells the BBC why he is boycotting Trump's inauguration Nothing quite compares to the harsh glare of today's media spotlight, however, and coverage of today's protesting politicians is only being amplified by Mr Trump's Twitter broadsides against his critics. As with any such partisan show of defiance, there's a risk the move will cause wavering Republicans to rally around their embattled president. At this point - with conservatives holding sway in Washington, DC - party unity is perhaps the most important factor in whether Republicans can successfully enact their policy agenda. While making a show of sitting out the inauguration might be a feel-good moment for liberals with few arrows in their political quiver, going forward their success will depend on finding ways to fracture Republican ranks, not steel their opponents' resolve. Mr Trump's team has welcomed the congress members' empty seats, saying that they will be given back out ""to the people"". ""As far as other people not going, that's OK, because we need seats so badly,"" Mr Trump said in a Fox News interview on Wednesday. Trump's transition team have reportedly been unable to attract A-list celebrities to the event, but Mr Trump said they were ""never invited"". ""I don't want the celebrities, I want the people, and we have the biggest celebrities in the world there,"" he said. Trump's team have been running adverts on Facebook and Twitter ""personally inviting"" people to come visit Washington for the inauguration and featuring a video of Mr Trump promising that the concert will be ""really fantastic"". An estimated 800,000 to 900,000 people are expected to flood the nation's capital on Friday for the inauguration, but it is unclear whether they will be there in celebration or protest, officials said. President Barack Obama drew an estimated 1.8 million people to Washington when he took office eight years ago. The ""level of enthusiasm"" and demand for hotel rooms has not reached that of previous inaugurations, according to Elliott Ferguson, president of Destination DC, the city's convention and tourism bureau. In fact, some hotels have reduced the minimum-night stay from four nights to two. Members of the US military stand in front of the Trump International Hotel, located just blocks from the White House Other hotels are only 50% full, but higher-end hotels appeared to have more bookings, he added. ""It's been much, much slower than anyone would have anticipated for a first-term president,"" Mr Ferguson said. Mr Trump's swearing-in comes at a time when the nation appears deeply divided after the contested election. Though Mr Trump swept the electoral college, his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by almost 2.9 million more votes. The tweets that say so much and reveal so little Trump on Twitter: A history of the man and his medium Will Trump's election lead to more women in politics? Some Clinton supporters have said they are leaving the city. Robert York, a 48-year-old charity specialist who lives in the Washington suburbs, has booked a cruise because he says he cannot stay and support a president who attacks a hero like Lewis. He says the majority of his friends are also leaving. ""The mass exodus of DC residents is simple - people are fearful of this incoming administration, and we have a president-elect who has shown he is not ready to lead this great nation."" Recent polls have also suggested historically low marks for any presidential transition. A new ABC News/Washington Post poll found just 40% of Americans view Mr Trump favourably compared with the 79% President Obama received in 2009. A CNN/ORC survey released on Tuesday also indicated that Mr Trump had a 40% approval rating compared with the 84% Mr Obama had in 2009. A Gallup poll conducted two weeks before the inauguration found 51% of respondents disapproved of how he is handling the presidential transition compared with 44% who approved. But the president-elect on Tuesdaydismissed the polls,externalas ""phony"" and ""rigged"",insisting that,external""people are pouring into Washington in record numbers"". An estimated 200,000 people are also expected to convene in Washington a day later for the Women's March on Washington. Nearly 200 activist groups and organisations have signed on to support the grassroots march. It sets out to demonstrate for racial and gender equality, affordable healthcare, abortion rights and voting rights - issues perceived to be under threat from a Trump presidency.

Trump and the nuclear codesMelania Trump's hometown celebratesWhy does the Kremlin favour Trump?Trump inauguration boycott escalates,"On 20 January, inauguration day in the United States, a nameless, unknown military aide was seen accompanying President Barack Obama to the handover ceremony at the US Capitol in Washington. That military aide was carrying a satchel over his or her shoulder containing a briefcase known as ""the nuclear football"". Inside was a piece of digital hardware measuring 3in (7.3cm) by 5in, known as ""the biscuit"". This contained the launch codes for a strategic nuclear strike. The briefing for the incoming president on how to activate them had already taken place out of public sight, but the moment President-elect Donald Trump took the oath of office that aide, and the satchel, moved quietly over to his side. From then on, Donald Trump has had sole authority to order an action that could result in the deaths of millions of people in under an hour. The question on a lot of people's minds is, given his thin skin and impulsive temperament, what are the safeguards, if any, to prevent an impetuous decision by one man with catastrophic consequences? First off, it should be said that Donald Trump has previously rowed back on some of his earlier, provocative comments on the use of nuclear weapons. He stated he would be ""the last person to use them"", although he did not rule it out. Donald Trump: US must greatly expand nuclear capabilities Russia's top spin doctor in nuclear warning North Korea's nuclear programme: How advanced is it? Other senior figures are also involved in the chain of command, such as the US Secretary of Defence, retired US Marine Gen James Mattis, But Mark Fitzpatrick, a nuclear non-proliferation expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Washington, says that ultimately, the sole authority to launch a strike rests with the president. ""There are no checks and balances on the president's authority to launch a nuclear strike,"" he says. ""But between the time he authorises one and the time it's carried out there are other people involved."" The idea of a rogue president taking such a monumental decision on his own is unrealistic. He gives the order and the secretary of defence is constitutionally obliged to carry it out. The secretary of defence could, in theory, refuse to obey the order if he had reason to doubt the president's sanity, but this would constitute mutiny and the president can then fire him and assign the task to the deputy secretary of defence. Donald Trump says the US should ""greatly strengthen and expand"" its nuclear capabilities Under the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution a vice-president could, in theory, declare the president mentally incapable of taking a proper decision, but he would need to be backed by a majority of the cabinet. So how would it work in practice? Inside that briefcase, the ""nuclear football"" that never leaves the president's side, is a ""black book"" of strike options for him to choose from once he has authenticated his identity as commander-in-chief, using a plastic card. Washington folklore has it that a previous president temporarily mislaid his identification card when he left it inside a jacket that was sent to the dry cleaners. Once the president has selected his strike options from a long-prepared ""menu"", the order is passed via the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Pentagon's war room and then, using sealed authentication codes, on to US Strategic Command HQ in Offutt Airbase in Nebraska. The order to fire is transmitted to the actual launch crews using encrypted codes that have to match the codes locked inside their safes. This video can not be played Which countries have nuclear weapons? The US and Russia both possess enough nuclear missiles to destroy each other's cities several times over - there are reported to be 100 US nuclear warheads aimed at Moscow alone. The two countries' arsenals account for more than 90% of the world's total number of nuclear warheads. As of September 2016 Russia had the most, with an estimated 1796 strategic nuclear warheads, deployed on a mixed platform of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and strategic bombers. Under a programme ordered by President Vladimir Putin, Moscow has recently invested billions of roubles in upgrading its strategic nuclear missile force, keeping an arsenal of constantly mobile ballistic missiles travelling through tunnels deep beneath the forests of Siberia. America had, in September 2016, 1,367 strategic nuclear warheads, similarly deployed in land-based underground missile silos, which by their static nature are vulnerable to a first strike, at sea onboard submarines, where they are harder to detect, and at airbases, where they can be loaded on to bombers. The UK has about 120 strategic warheads, of which only a third are deployed at sea. The Royal Navy always keeps a portion of the nation's Trident nuclear force somewhere in the world's oceans, maintaining what is known as the continuous at sea deterrent. The Topol is one of Russia's mobile ICBMs ICBMs travel at a speed of over 17,000mph (Mach 23), flying high above the Earth's atmosphere before descending towards their pre-programmed targets at four miles a second. The flight-time for land-based missiles flying between Russia and the US is between 25 and 30 minutes. For submarine-based missiles, where the boats may be able to approach a coast covertly, the flight time could be considerably shorter, even as little as 12 minutes. This does not leave a president much time to decide whether it is a false alarm or imminent Armageddon. Once ICBMs have been launched they cannot be recalled, but if they remain in their silos they will probably be destroyed by the inbound attack. A former senior White House official told me recently that much would depend on the circumstances in which a nuclear strike was being considered. If this was a long-term, measured policy decision to say, carry out a pre-emptive strike on country X, then a lot of people would be involved. The vice-president, National Security Adviser, and much of the cabinet would all be likely to be included in the decision-making process. But if there was an imminent strategic threat to the United States, i.e. if an inbound launch of ICBMs from a hostile state had been detected and were minutes from reaching the US then, he said, ""the president has extraordinary latitude to take the sole decision to launch.""

Melania Trump's hometown celebratesWhy does the Kremlin favour Trump?Trump inauguration boycott escalates,"This video can not be played What was Melania Trump like in Slovenia? The President Burger is presented with a flourish - on a wooden board, surrounded by circular ""dollar fries"" and topped with a yellow crust of cheese ""hair"" which looks as if it might fly away at any moment. As tributes to the US President-elect go, it may not be the most respectful. But it is offered with the affection and gentle humour which it soon becomes apparent is a hallmark of Sevnica, a Slovenian town which just happens to be the place where Donald Trump's first-lady-to-be, Melania, spent most of her childhood. ""We formed the burger so it would resemble Trump a little bit,"" chuckles Bruno Vidmar, the chef-proprietor of Rondo, a restaurant in the newer part of Sevnica. ""It has hot peppers, because Trump's statements are hot - and it comes with dollar fries because he's a successful entrepreneur."" The owner of the Rondo restaurant designed this burger to resemble Donald Trump The presidential tie-in seems to be serving Rondo well: on a weekday morning, the place is buzzing with an early lunch crowd from the nearby furniture and textile factories. Meanwhile a table full of smartly-dressed young women order another of Bruno's culinary creations dreamt up with Sevnica's most famous daughter in mind. ""The 'Melanija' dessert is made out of sponge, then there's a layer of mascarpone and strawberries. It's light enough for a model - and we have it on good authority that Melania loves strawberries."" Sevnica is a small place - so Bruno probably did not have to search long to find an authority on what Melania likes for pudding. Or, at least, what she did like when she was growing up as Melanija Knavs in this town of fewer than 5,000 people. Bar the addition of a branch of Lidl on the outskirts, little seems to have changed since she left for Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, as a teenager. The old castle - parts of which date back to the 12th Century - still overlooks Sevnica from its hilltop perch. The town itself is a tidy place with new and old sections, sitting alongside the River Sava and surrounded by forested hills. The Slovenian Tourist Board suggests that Sevnica is ""an excellent destination for those who enjoy picnics and outings, hiking, cycling or fishing"". If the roads had been less icy, it would certainly have been an enjoyable ride through the trees to GostiÅ¡Äe Ob Ribniku, a restaurant and guesthouse next to a small lake. Inside the traditional wooden chalet, you can chat to one of the people who can shed some light on the future first lady's early years. Sevnica is ""an excellent destination for those who enjoy picnics and outings, hiking, cycling or fishing"" according to the Slovenian Tourist Board ""We were next door neighbours - and we used to go the same way to school,"" says Mateja Zalezina, who runs GostiÅ¡Äe Ob Ribniku with her husband, Dejan. ""In the afternoon when we came back we used to hang out in front of the apartment block. Even then she was quite busy, because her mother was a fashion designer and Melania was one of the models for the Jutranjka company that did fashion for kids."" Mateja laughs at the idea that she could have spotted that her neighbour would go a long way from Sevnica - never mind all the way to the White House. But she says that Melania could not help but stand out. ""She was really good at school. She and her sister Ines were studying really hard. After school, we played a game called 'gumi-twist', an elastic band game, and she was really good at that. She had the figure of a model - really long legs - and she always won!"" The restaurant is offering a three-course ""Melanija Menu"" in honour of Mateja's former playmate. But, like Rondo's eponymous offering, this does not feel like a culinary cash-in, just a low-key tribute, delivered with affection. ""I'm really happy for her - she's achieved the maximum,"" says Dejan. ""I hope everyone in Sevnica will watch the inauguration. We will be here at the restaurant with friends and will raise a glass to them both."" Melania's former neighbour says America's next first lady studied ""really hard"" at school Back in the old town, beneath the castle, Sevnica's mayor Srecko Ocvirk is not planning any special events to mark the start of the Trump era. But he hopes the publicity will bring the town's charms to the attention of tourists. ""The first visitors who came were journalists like you,"" he admits. ""But we're now seeing there are rising numbers of tourists. We're also expecting more organised tour groups after the inauguration. Sevnica and the region will become better known because of this."" At the town's primary school, one of the staff has certainly achieved a degree of local celebrity. Art teacher Nena Bedek was best friends with Melania until the future Mrs Trump left to finish her schooling in Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana. Now Nena fields questions from her students about her friendship with Sevnica's most famous former resident - and marvels at the different paths their lives have taken. ""It's a 'wow' effect for us and for me,"" she says. Melania's childhood best friend has fond memories ""She was a reliable girl and a very good friend. But she never wished to stand out - even though she was beautiful and hard-working. She loved to read and draw. She was brought up in a very artistic manner - she knew what was beautiful - due to her mother's job as a fashion designer. I have very fond memories and keep her very close in my heart."" As for the town's various tributes - which include wine, slippers and honey as well as the culinary offerings - Nena believes they are in keeping with the Sevnica spirit. ""They are very sympathetic and sweet - none of them are bad things - and it's also funny. I think it's still within limits - all in all it's sweet and nice."" Rather like Sevnica itself, perhaps.

Why does the Kremlin favour Trump?Trump inauguration boycott escalates,"The question of whether Russia's leader Vladimir Putin has got material with which he could blackmail Donald Trump is for now unknowable and misses the point by a country mile: the two men think alike. Mr Trump's belief in American traditionalism and dislike of scrutiny echo the Kremlin's tune: nation, power and aversion to criticism are the new (and very Russian) world order. You could call this mindset Trumputinism. The echo between the Kremlin and Trump Tower is strong, getting louder and very, very good news for Mr Putin. As Trump signalled to Michael Gove on Monday,,externala new nuclear arms reduction deal seems to be in the offing linked to a review of sanctions against Russia. The dog that did not bark in the night is Mr Trump's peculiar absence of criticism of Mr Putin, for example, on the Russian hacking of American democracy, his land-grab of Crimea and his role in the continuing war in Eastern Ukraine. What is odd is that Mr Trump, in his tweets, favours the Russia line over, say, the CIA and the rest of the American intelligence community. But why on earth criticise the world leader with whom you most agree? Three men have egged along Trumputinism: Nigel Farage, who is clear that the European Union is a far bigger danger to world peace than Russia; his friend, Steve Bannon, who is now Mr Trump's chief strategist; and a Russian ""penseur"", Alexander Dugin. With his long hair and iconic Slavic looks, Mr Dugin is variously described as ""Putin's Brain"" or ""Putin's Rasputin"". Alexander Dugin is described as ""Putin's Brain"" He has his own pro-Kremlin TV show which pumps out Russian Orthodox supremacy in a curious mixture of Goebbels-style rhetoric and Songs of Praise. Mr Dugin is widely believed to have the ear of the Kremlin. He is also under Western sanctions for the ferocity of his statements in favour of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has cost 10,000 lives to date. Messrs Farage, Bannon and Dugin are all united that the greatest danger for Western civilisation lies in Islamist extremism. Mr Bannon aired his views in a right-wing mindfest on the fringes of the Vatican in 2014. He claimed that so-called Islamic State has a Twitter account ""about turning the United States into a 'river of blood'"". ""Trust me, that is going to come to Europe,"" he added. ""On top of that we're now, I believe, at the beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism."" The danger is that in allying yourself with the Kremlin in the way they fight ""Islamist fascism"" in say, Aleppo, you end up siding with what some have called ""Russian fascism"" or, at least, abandoning democratic values and the rules of war and, in so doing, become a recruiting sergeant for ISIS. It is a risk on which Mr Dugin does not seem willing to reflect. My interview with him in Moscow did not end well. Dugin posted a critical blog entry after walking out of his interview with John Sweeney First, he dismissed the chances that the Russians hacked American democracy as ""strictly zero"". I asked him about the depth of Mr Putin's commitment to democracy. ""Please be careful,"" he responded. ""You could not teach us democracy because you try to impose to every people, every state, every society, their Western, American or so-called American system of values without askingâ¦and it is absolutely racist; you are racist."" Too many of Mr Putin's critics end up dead - around 20 since he took power in 2000. I have met and admired three: Anna Politkovskaya, Natasha Estemirova and Boris Nemtsov. Boris Nemtsov was murdered close to the Kremlin in 2015 Mr Nemtsov was shot just outside the Kremlin's walls. I asked Mr Dugin what his death told us about Russian democracy. ""If you are engaged in Wikileaks you can be murdered,"" he countered. I then invited Mr Dugin to list the American journalists who have died under Barack Obama. Mr Dugin did not oblige but told me that ours was a ""completely stupid kind of conversation"" and walked out of the interview. Later, he posted a blog to his 20,000 followers, illustrated with my photograph and accusing me of manufacturing ""fake news"" and calling me ""an utter cretin... a globalist swine"". Such is the language of the new world order. A few days later I watched the press conference when Mr Trump closed down a question from a CNN reporter by accusing him of manufacturing ""fake news"".

Brexit memo: Don't mention the WarJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondent18 January 2017 (17:08:10),"Basil Fawlty discovered that some subjects were taboo Like some latter-day Basil Fawlty, Boris Johnson mentioned the War and didn't get away with it. The foreign secretary urged the French president not to ""administer punishment beatings"" on Britain for choosing to escape the EU ""rather in the manner of some World War Two movie"". Not surprisingly, uproar has ensued. Former Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Johnson had shown once again that he could be ""supremely clever and yet immensely stupid"". To some Britons, Mr Johnson's remarks will be seen as colourful but unexceptional language that echoes the popular World War Two film The Great Escape. To many of Mr Johnson's generation, these films were part of their childhood and are subject to frequent cultural reference. Former Prime Minister David Cameron has seen The Guns of Navarone more than 17 times and once quoted a line from the film in a party conference speech. I know one former Conservative cabinet minister who can quote reams from Where Eagles Dare. (Full disclosure, so can I). Yet this hinterland of war films from the 1960s and 1970s, seen by some today as jingoistic, can create a tin ear among some Britons when it comes to recognising how sensitive many Europeans remain towards this period in their history. The foreign secretary has form on this. During the referendum campaign last year he compared the EU to Nazi Germany, telling the Daily Telegraph both were attempting to unify Europe: ""Napoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically."" This caused a flurry of headlines and a social media storm that passed quickly. Yet the impact on EU politicians was lasting. One EU diplomat explained it to me like this: ""You Brits don't understand us when we talk about European values. To us they are important because they are not Nazi values, they are not Vichy values, they are not fascist values, not the values of the Greek junta. They are the values of a different Europe. ""So for that clown to compare us to the Nazis, well, that hurts and will not be forgotten."" In other words, the global conflict from which the EU's forerunner emerged - and was ultimately designed to prevent recurring - lingers long in the mind on the continent. So perhaps the foreign secretary might take the advice of Gisela Stuart, the German-born Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, who said she was sure her fellow Brexit campaigner did not mean to be offensive but added: ""For the next two yearsâ¦ just don't mention the war."" Or maybe Mr Johnson might remember the last line of the Fawlty Towers episode when a ranting Basil is being led away by the nurses and one of the stunned German guests asks: ""However did they win?""

Jeremy Bowen: Families return to the ghost towns of East Aleppo18 January 2017 (00:44:16),"The Syrian army seized East Aleppo from the rebels in December For the people who have returned to the ruins of East Aleppo the old phrase ""there's no place like home"" has a whole new meaning. The eastern side of Aleppo has been pulverised. Running water and mains power are a memory. It is hard to find a building that is not badly damaged. Many look as if they could collapse at any time. Rubble from the buildings that were flattened by artillery fire, barrel bombs or air strikes block many of the streets. Dozens of bulldozers have been working for more than a month to clear a path through the debris. Jeremy Bowen: A walk through Aleppo Aleppo: Before and after images Why is there a war in Syria? East Aleppo remains a deeply inhospitable environment. But the UN estimates that 40,000 people so far, and more every day, have decided to come back here. They are moving into their old homes or unoccupied buildings that look as if they might do, for a while at least. Abu Hussein, a man in his 50s, was remarkably cheerful as he stood with his wife Umm Hussein and looked down from their balcony on to the rubble that makes his street impassable for any vehicle. ""Nothing is better or more beautiful than our home,"" he said. ""It's the place to be in good times or in bad."" Abu Hussein and Umm Hussein have returned to a shell of a home His family's flat is in Shaar, one of the poorest quarters in East Aleppo. The area is made up mainly of cramped concrete tenements five or six stories high - at least those still standing. In Abu Hussein's street, some buildings have collapsed in on themselves. Others have had the fronts ripped off, like dolls' houses in a nightmare, exposing beds still made up with sheets and blankets, and sofas teetering close to falling into the street. The street where the Husseins live is impassable for any vehicle Abu Hussein said he was happy because he was home, even though his flat was dark and cold. His wife cooks on a small charcoal grill on the stairwell. The glass in the windows has gone. It is so well ventilated that the dank mist of a winter's evening seeped in. He had spent much of last year with his in-laws, he said, and the sooner they tried to make a go of it back home the better. This video can not be played Syrian conflict: What's left of Aleppo's Great Mosque? Abu Hussein and his wife have a two-year-old son who is still with her parents. They have no jobs, and the small amount of money they had saved went long ago. ""Of course we have hope,"" Umm Hussein said. ""We'll rebuild and we'll find a solution."" They left East Aleppo two days before the start last year of the major offensive by the Syrian army, backed by Russia and Iran, which by Christmas had beaten the rebels and reunited the city. During the years when the east was isolated, then besieged, it was possible to cross to government-controlled West Aleppo. Abu Hussein said the trip, which now takes 15 minutes, was possible for anyone who was prepared to take a 17-hour journey through territory controlled by Syria's galaxy of armed groups, including the rebel Free Syrian Army, Kurdish militias, the jihadists of so-called Islamic State, and the armed forces of the Syrian government. The United Nations, which spent more than $200m (Â£162m) on relief work in Aleppo last year, is particularly concerned that the poor in Shaar have come back out of desperation to a place that is still dangerous. Relief agencies have put water tanks in the streets. Children struggle through mud and rubble to help their families by carrying water home. Much of East Aleppo remains a ghost town The east was bombed into submission by Syrian government forces and their Russian backers Aleppo has changed since the government and its allies won the battle for the city last month. It no longer feels like a wartime city. Outgoing artillery fire is still a steady drumbeat, aimed at rebel front lines that are not far away. The country is at war. But Aleppo's war is over. In the ruins, people are thinking about the future. Slowly but steadily, some of Syria's millions of displaced people are returning, desperate or optimistic, or both. Aleppo, one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities, was Syria's largest before the war began in 2011 Large areas of the east side of the city are ghost towns, but there is every chance that more returnees will come back looking for a home once the weather gets warmer in the spring. The battle for Aleppo was the most decisive of the war. It is a long time since the war was merely a contest between President Bashar al-Assad and armed groups who wanted to destroy the regime. So many foreign powers have intervened that this has become an international conflict. Syria has layers of war and not all of them are about the future of the Assad regime. The intervention of Russia and Iran tipped the balance in Aleppo. Mr Assad and his allies can, for the first time, smell victory. Foreigners, not Syrians, are setting the pace. And at the moment it looks as if foreign powers will dictate how the war ends.

Babies remember birth language,"The first year of life is a time of astonishing linguistic development Babies build knowledge about the language they hear even in the first few months of life, research shows. If you move countries and forget your birth language, you retain this hidden ability, according to a study. Dutch-speaking adults adopted from South Korea exceeded expectations at Korean pronunciation when retrained after losing their birth language. Scientists say parents should talk to babies as much as possible in early life. Dr Jiyoun Choi of Hanyang University in Seoul led the research. The study is the first to show that the early experience of adopted children in their birth language gives them an advantage decades later even if they think it is forgotten, she said. ''This finding indicates that useful language knowledge is laid down in [the] very early months of life, which can be retained without further input of the language and revealed via re-learning,'' she told BBC News. In the study, adults aged about 30 who had been adopted as babies by Dutch-speaking families were asked to pronounce Korean consonants after a short training course. Korean consonants are unlike those spoken in Dutch. The participants were compared with a group of adults who had not been exposed to the Korean language as children and then rated by native Korean speakers. Both groups performed to the same level before training, but after training the international adoptees exceeded expectations. There was no difference between children who were adopted under six months of age - before they could speak - and those who were adopted after 17 months, when they had learned to talk. This suggests that the language knowledge retained is abstract in nature, rather than dependent on the amount of experience. Dr Jiyoun Choi said there were practical messages for parents. ''Please remember that [the] language learning process occurs very early in life, and useful language knowledge is laid down in the very early months of life as our study suggests,'' she said. ''Try to talk to your babies as much as possible because they are absorbing and digesting what you are saying.'' The process of acquiring language starts extremely early, even while the child is still in the womb. Babies have learned their mother's voice by the time they are born. It has long been known that the foundations for speaking and listening to a native language are laid down very early in life. But it was not known until now that very early language acquisition is an abstract process. The research is published in the journal,Royal Society Open Science,external.

What next for The Gambia?,"Mr Barrow took the oath of office in his country's embassy in Senegal A political crisis in The Gambia appears to be coming to a head, with Senegalese and Nigerian troops in the country to ensure long-time leader Yahya Jammeh gives up power after losing elections last month. Mr Jammeh has asked for a deadline for him to leave office to be extended from noon until 16:00 GMT on Friday or be forced out by West African forces. They deployed on Thursday after the internationally-recognised new president, Adama Barrow, was sworn in at his country's embassy in the Senegalese capital, Dakar, in front of ambassadors from countries in the UN Security Council and key African states. This video can not be played Why The Gambia is in turmoil - in 60 seconds. Shortly afterwards the UN Security Council unanimously backed action against Mr Jammeh. Troops have been told to halt their advance for a last attempt at negotiation by the presidents of Guinea and Mauritania, who have arrived in the Gambian capital, Banjul. The chairman of West African regional bloc Ecowas, Marcel Alain de Souza, has said that if the meeting proved unsuccessful, military action will follow. Mr Barrow, who remains in Senegal, has said that he will not return to Banjul until the operation has ended. Ecowas mandated Senegal, which almost surrounds The Gambia, to lead a military intervention to install Mr Barrow. Nigeria has also sent aircraft and troops to Senegal, and deployed a warship. Mr Barrow has urged soldiers in The Gambia to remain in their barracks and warned those that do not will be considered rebels. The country is a popular tourist destination and after the British Foreign Office updated its travel advice, holiday companieshave been evacuating tourists. The UN Security Council unanimously backed Ecowas efforts to install Mr Barrow. However, the text of the resolution said this should be ""by political means first"" and made no explicit mention of military action. Some diplomats have suggested that formal UN authorisation for an intervention may not be necessary if Mr Barrow, having assumed the presidency, requested help. Mr Jammeh tried to bolster his position earlier this week by declaring a state of emergency and engineering a parliamentary vote to extend his presidency by three months. He said these moves would prevent a power vacuum while the Supreme Court considered a legal challenge he has submitted over the election result. The parliamentary vote took place while Mr Jammeh was officially president and is considered legally valid under Gambian law. This means The Gambia could now be considered to have two presidents, although each side obviously disputes the legitimacy of the other. Regional powers chose to disregard the parliamentary vote on the grounds that Mr Barrow won December's election fairly and should take office. Without the extension, Mr Jammeh's term ended at midnight on Wednesday. The Senegalese-led intervention force will be expected to have more firepower than the Gambian army but it is not clear how much resistance it will face. The army chief is a close Jammeh loyalist but has been quoted as saying he would not risk his men's lives in a political dispute. The elite regiment of the army, drawn mainly from the same ethnic group as Mr Jammeh, is well-armed and is regarded as being fiercely loyal. Mr Jammeh remains ensconced at State House with their protection and unnamed officials have been reported as saying these troops would resist any attempt to arrest him. However, they would be at a considerable numerical disadvantage to the intervening force. The loyalty of other Gambian regiments is much less certain. Correspondents say there has been talk that some are unhappy with recent events and want a peaceful resolution. Tension is high in the Gambian capital over concerns that the political conflict will escalate into violence. Thousands of people have fled to neighbouring countries and rural areas. Earlier this week, Mr Barrow's coalition urged Gambians to ""exercise restraint, observe the rule of law and not to respond to provocation"". Some celebrated when Mr Barrow won elections, but there are fears of possible violence now The BBC's Umaru Fofana, who is in Banjul, says people there are petrified. They are stocking up on food and water. Everyone has been praying for a peaceful resolution, he says. Mr Jammeh, who seized power in a 1994 coup, initially accepted that Mr Barrow hadwon the electionbut later reversed his position and said he would not step down. He filed a petition to the Supreme Court, challenging the election results, and says the existence of this legal process means it would be unconstitutional for Mr Barrow to assume office. He also asked the Supreme Court for an injunction to stop the inauguration but the chief justice declined to rule on it, saying he must recuse himself from any case that could affect his own position - he would normally conduct the swearing-in ceremony. Mr Jammeh has said there were irregularities in the election process, including the turning away of some of his supporters from polling stations, and errors made by the electoral commission. Yahya Jammeh is refusing to stand down and is thought to command the support of elite troops The commission accepted that some of the results it initially published contained errors, but said Mr Barrow still won. Retaining power would ensure he was not prosecuted inThe Gambiafor alleged abuses committed during his rule. Ministers are continuing to desert Mr Jammeh's government. Several ministers, and even the long-serving vice-president, have resigned in recent days. One of the ministers who resigned, former information chief Sheriff Bojang,said Mr Jammeh's arguments had a ""veneer of constitutionalism""but were an attempt to subvert the will of the Gambian people. The international community says Mr Barrow won fairly. The lawyer representing Mr Jammeh and his APRC party in the election challenge has also fled to Senegal and urged the long-time leader to step aside. Judges from Nigeria and Sierra Leone have been hired to hear the petition to overturn the election result, but they have yet to arrive in Banjul. Gambian chief justice Emmanuel Fagbenle has said the court will be able to convene no earlier than May, and possibly not until November, because the Nigerian who is to act as court president, Onogeme Uduma, is fully booked for the coming months. Nigerian leader Muhammadu Buhari (r) was in Banjul on Friday but could not persuade Mr Jammeh to change his mind Mr Barrow has distanced himself from comments, made by other opposition figures, suggesting Mr Jammeh may be prosecuted over alleged abuses in power. He said Mr Jammeh should be able to stay in The Gambia and would be honoured as, and receive the privileges of, a former head of state if he stepped down. However, Mr Jammeh does not appear to have been persuaded by his opponent's apparently conciliatory language. Another option, raised by Nigerian MPs, is that Mr Jammeh could be offered asylum and a comfortable retirement in another African country. Besides Nigeria, Morocco has been mooted as a possible destination (Mr Jammeh's wife is Moroccan). With the entry of Senegalese and Nigerian troops, a third possibility now appears to be unfolding - that Mr Jammeh, having rejected all offers so far, continues to cling to power with the backing of at least some of the army, until he is forcefully removed.

How could customs union deal work?,"The claim:The UK could negotiate an agreement that gives some of the benefits of customs union membership while still allowing other trade deals to be negotiated. Reality Check verdict:Turkey has a deal for partial membership of the customs union so it is possible, but the terms are not favourable to Turkey. The prime minister says she does not want to replicate any existing agreements. There is a limit to what the government will be able to achieve in the negotiations if it is not prepared to impose the EU's tariffs on non-EU countries. Prime Minister Theresa May announced on Tuesday that the UK would definitely not continue to be a full member of the customs union because that would prevent trade deals being negotiated with non-EU countries. But she said that she did want to reach some sort of customs agreement with the EU. ""Whether that means we must reach a completely new customs agreement, become an associate member of the customs union in some way or remain a signatory to some elements of it, I hold no preconceived position,"" she said. The EU customs union,externalis a trade agreement between European countries that they will not impose tariffs (taxes on imports) on each other's goods and agree to impose common external tariffs on goods from other countries outside the customs union. It means that once a product is inside the customs zone it can be transported without customs checks to any other country in the union. Mrs May specified that there were two parts of the customs union that she could not accept. One of them was the common external tariff, because having to impose the tariff would get in the way of free trade agreements outside the EU. The other was the common commercial policy, which is the part of the EU treaties that sets out the principles for EU trade, including that it is the EU that sets external tariffs and negotiates trade deals, rather than individual member states. The customs union is made up of the 28 EU members states and Monaco. The EU also has separate customs union agreements withTurkey,external, Andorra and San Marino. Turkey's agreement covers industrial products and processed agricultural products. That means Turkey has to impose the common external tariff and meet EU regulations on its industrial products, but not its unprocessed agricultural ones. So when Turkey negotiates trade agreements with other countries, it still has to impose the EU's external tariff on industrial products and processed agricultural products (unless those countries also have trade deals with the EU). It's also a one-sided agreement, with non-EU countries that have free trade agreements with the EU automatically getting access to Turkish markets although Turkey does not get access to theirs. And it means that on the products covered by the agreement, Turkey must keep to EU regulations. Clearly the EU regulations would not currently be a problem for UK companies, which already follow them, but a Turkey-style deal would mean being bound by future changes to the regulations without having any say in them. The question is whether the UK, which has stressed it does not want to replicate any existing agreements, could negotiate a deal with the EU that would allow tariff-free access for some industries to the customs union without getting in the way of the UK's trade agreements with other countries. Theresa May said she wanted the UK's trade with the EU to be ""as frictionless as possible"", without specifying what benefits she would like to keep. But there is a limit to what the UK can secure in the negotiations without agreeing to the EU's tariffs on non-EU countries, because that would mean that other countries could get a back-door, tariff-free route into the EU.

Happy 100th,"Living longer may also mean working longer Will you live to be 100 years old? Even if you don't - it's pretty likely your children or your grandchildren will. While Brexit, China and Trump may be dominating the news out of this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, living longer is a hot topic in the cold and snowy mountain village, and one which many attendees are already grappling with. Current trends suggest,externalmost babies born since 2000 in developed countries such as the UK, US, Canada, France and Germany, will live past their 100th birthday. Put another way, for every 10 years since the 19th Century, life expectancy has increased by two and a half years, according to Jim Vaupel from Max Planck Institute of Demography, who has tracked global changes over the past 150 years. That's the equivalent of another six to eight hours every day. The successful women embracing âgirl powerâ For city or country? Davos coverage in full It may sound great - after all who doesn't want to live for as long as possible - but the reality is we may also be working for as long as possible to be able to pay for it. ""If we live 30 years longer, then in order to retire at 60 we would have to save five times as much during our working lives. It's the end of retirement as we know it,"" says Lynda Gratton, who hosted a session on the topic in Davos. She is a psychologist, and professor of management practice at the London Business School, and has written a book on the topic. The effects of people living longer is one of the hot topics in Davos Rather than the three traditional stages of life: education, work and retirement, Ms Gratton expects people to have to constantly retrain as they shift careers and focus. Counter-intuitively, she suggests that one positive of having a longer career could actually mean a better work-life balance. If you're working for longer, then taking a couple of years out to look after children, or ageing parents for example, won't be such a big deal when your career lasts for 60-plus years, she suggests. Jo Ann Jenkins, chief executive at non-profit group AARP - the influential lobby group for older Americans - says working longer is already a reality for many in the US. In 2012, US employees aged over 50 made up almost a third of the workforce. By 2022 they're expected to make up 36%. The shift has already forced the group to change its name. The body used to be called the American Association of Retired Persons, but had to change it to just AARP because its members complained they weren't retired, but still working. ""People used to think middle age started around 35.  Now, most people think it's late 40s or early 50s. Same thing with one's working years. Someone who was 55 or 60 often used to be seen as over the hill. That's not the case today,"" says Ms Jenkins. Longer life expectancy isn't always matched by good health She believes one of the big adjustments will be how to manage the increasing breadth of age groups in the workplace. ""Years ago, one of the big questions was: can a man report to a woman manager? We've answered that question. Today, a big question is: can an older employee report to a younger manager? I think many organisations are still grappling with that."" Of course, increased life expectancy isn't always matched by better health. Christophe Weber, the chief executive of Japanese pharmaceutical giant Takeda, says the key issue is how long people are remaining well. In Japan, around a quarter of the population is now over 60, and Mr Weber notes that this increasing longevity also means certain diseases such as dementia, for example, are on the rise. He says research and finding new medicines to address the issue will be crucial. ""[People living longer] is a very nice evolution but the challenge is how you finance it,"" he says, adding that the healthier people are, the less costly it is. As far as work goes, he says people need ""a soft landing carrier to retirement"", suggesting while older people may remain at work, they're likely to work part-time, or in less hands-on mentoring roles. But if even the idea of working part-time when you're in your 70s seems depressing, Ms Gratton has some encouragement. She says the fact that you're likely to have to change jobs and retrain several times to remain employable over 60 years offers a natural break to take time out. ""Take a gap year. Why should it only be the young who take gap years? You could take a gap year at 50, and travel around the world,"" she says. Want to age well - how about never retiring?

Jonathan Josephs - All aboard China-to-London freight train18 January 2017 (13:44:17),"The train left China two weeks ago It's not on a boat, it's not on a plane, it's on a train. The newest way to send your freight from China to Europe involves spending 15 days on a train that doesn't have a buffet car in sight. On 3 January in Yiwu in eastern China, a bright orange locomotive pulling 44 containers laden with suitcases, clothes and an assortment of household goodsset off on a 7,500-mile (12,000km) journeyto western Europe. Ten containers were taken off at the German cargo hub of Duisburg. The rest made up the first cargo train from China to arrive in London at Barking's Eurohub freight terminal. London is the 15th European city to find its way on to the ever-expanding map of destinations for China's rail cargo. Last year, 1,702 freight trains made the voyage to Europe, more than double the 2015 figure. This video can not be played Travelling from China to London Yiwu Timex Industrial Investments, which is running this service with China's state-run railways, says prices are half that of air cargo and cut two weeks off the journey time by sea. The UK's biggest supermarket, Tesco, doesn't have any goods on this particular train but does use rail to carry toys, electrical goods, homeware and clothing from China to European rail hubs such as Bratislava in Slovakia and Krasnaje in Belarus. Alistair Lindsay, Tesco's head of global logistics, says the supermarket prefers shipping its goods because this is the most environmentally friendly way, as well as offering the best value for money, but that ""where we need to move products quicker we have that option to do it by rail"". This decision would normally be driven by customer demand for particular products, he says. It demonstrates how market demand and the realities of globalisation are increasingly allowing China's President Xi Jinping to realise his ambitious plan to revive the ancient Silk Road. For centuries the fabled trade route from the ancient capital of Xian provided a link to the bustling markets of European cities such as Istanbul and Venice. In the 21st Century China has become the world's biggest exporter, withthe export of goods totalling $2.28 trillion (Â£1.85tn) in 2015,external. The Silk Road provided a link to the markets of European cities like Istanbul and Venice This rail expansion is part of President Xi's ""One Belt, One Road"" (OBOR) trade policy. For Beijing it offers another way to sustain its economic growth. Kazakhstan is one of the countries on the route and it was there that Mr Xi first outlined his vision in aspeech in 2013,externalsaying, ""This will be a great undertaking benefiting the people of all countries along the route."" Extolling the virtues of globalisation was atheme he repeated againat Davos this week. For some, this is as much political as economic, offering Beijing the chance to project soft power as well as demonstrating it has the influence to thread disparate nations from Russia to Spain together. China is also pushing its version of a ""maritime silk road for example"", by building a $1.4bn port city in Sri Lanka ""[OBOR] is set to become Xi Jinping's grand legacy,"" says Dr Sam Beatson, of King's College London. ""Regardless of the returns on offer... the policies will continue to be pushed as a means of seeking to fulfil Xi's dream under his leadership."" One of the other legacies President Xi is trying to tackle is China's pollution problem. While rail cargo is not as green as sea transport it emits less carbon dioxide (CO2) than air travel. Freight transport accounts for about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions This is the ""first argument when trying to get our customers to re-evaluate their options"", says Johan Ignell, rail freight manager at Swedish cargo firm Greencarrier. It calculates that a 40ft (12m) container with 20 tonnes of cargo would account for just 4% of the CO2 emissions it would take to move it by air (though emissions would be more than halved again if it were moved by sea). Freight transport accounts for about 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but it is ""fraught with difficulty"" to compare emissions from different transport modes, says Prof Alan McKinnon of Germany's Kuehne Logistics University. Prof McKinnon, one of the authors of a 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC),external, says ""load factor, energy efficiency and power sources all make a difference and can be hard to ascertain"". China is now the world's biggest exporter He adds: ""While shifting air cargo to rail will certainly cut emissions, container shipping will continue to command a significant carbon advantage over transcontinental rail, particularly now that most vessels are slow steaming to save fuel."" There is also a business case for this emerging trade route to grow. Not least among European companies looking to export to China. At the moment there are no plans to run a return train service from London but that could change quickly. China is already the European Union's second biggest export market - though there is an EU trade deficit in goods of about $190bn. For UK companies facing up to the reality of Brexit, China is an attractive proposition and the train carries new opportunities. Brand Avenue is a company that already exports British-made goods including cosmetics and jewellery to China, and chief executive Jody Jacobs says he's exploring moving to rail. ""We deal a lot in goods which weigh a lot in comparison to their volume [which is] where airfreight becomes expensive, such as cosmetics and baby food. ""So for us a service which is quicker than sea and cheaper than air is a great middle ground."" For UK companies facing up to the reality of Brexit, China is an attractive proposition For established cargo companies rail also offers the potential for growth. Shipping lines have seen profits fall because of overcapacity attributed to the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The world's biggest shipping company, Maersk, told the BBC it is investigating ""possible opportunities"" in long-distance rail, though it sees them as supplementary to sea and air routes. China is planning another 20 European routes for rail freight, and with the world's demand for consumer goods continuing to grow, all the ingredients seem to be there for rail to help the global economy steam ahead in 2017 and beyond.

The most important words May will ever deliver?Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor17 January 2017 (12:43:11),"This video can not be played The prime minister declined four times to answer questions about when she had been aware of the ""misfire'"" Under the gilt and candelabra of Lancaster House where Margaret Thatcher extolled the virtues of joining the single market, Theresa May has uttered some of the most important words she will ever deliver. She has, for the first time explicitly, confirmed that she has decided not to try to preserve our membership of the European single market. Instead she is hoping to conclude a deal with the rest of the EU that will still give business the access it needs to trade with the rest of the continent without barriers, tariffs or any new obstacles. Since the referendum she and her ministers have simply refused to be so explicit. Some Remainers have argued that she ought to try to keep us in the vast partnership, the risks to the economy are too vast, and while it might be complicated to achieve, the prize is simply too great to give up.

Brexit 'deal or no deal',"Theresa May set out her Brexit strategy in a speech in London Theresa May's Brexit speech is pretty much the only story in town, at least as far as the front pages are concerned. It is the tough rhetoric which captures the headlines. The Times headline sums up her message to the EU,externalas ""Give us a fair deal or you'll be crushed"". At the opposite end of the market, the Daily Star renders it as ""May: I will crush EU"". For the Daily Mail,external, the parallels with Margaret Thatcher are hard to resist. It says the speech showed the ""steel of the new Iron Lady"". Among the papers that opposed Brexit, theGuardian found the speech a ""doubly depressing event"",external- a reality check for those who want to keep the UK in the single market while being riddled with its own streak of ""global fantasy"". But the Guardian acknowledges that as a political manoeuvre it was a huge success for Mrs May and has strengthened her authority. TheFinancial Times,externalpraises the prime minister's ""bold vision"" but warns that the road ahead will be perilous. The Daily Mirror says Brexit will be a rollercoaster ride,externaland only the reckless would pretend that it will be easy to reach a good deal with other nations. The Sun's front page is mocked up as a Biblical tablet of stone,externalwith the single word headline ""Brexodus"". The paper says Mrs May could call a snap election if Parliament votes to reject the deal she negotiates. The Daily Telegraph praises the ""steel behind"" Mrs May's words,externaland declares the speech ""a defining moment in British politics"". Matt's cartoon has a worker bricking up the Channel Tunne,externall and remarking:  ""Mrs May's Brexit is a little harder than we'd been led to expect"". In other stories, the recently-retired head of the Serpentine Gallery in London, Dame Julia Peyton-Jones, features widely after becoming a mother at the age of 64. The Daily Mail says that instead of putting her feet up after a high-flying career,external, the woman known as the ""Queen Of Arts"" will now be busy raising her daughter, Pia. Dame Julia has not revealed further details, and the papers cannot say whether she had the child naturally or through a surrogate mother, IVF or adoption. TheTimes,externalreports that Manchester United, the world's richest football club according to Forbes magazine, has defended the launch of three new replica kits each season by claiming that their fans want ""newness"". The paper thinks that argument flies in the face of concern expressed by parents at the high cost of funding their children's support for top teams. Each new United kit costs Â£88 pounds for a child's version. Manchester City, Spurs and Arsenal also bring out three new strips per season. Finally, theDaily Telegraph,externalreports that intelligence agency GCHQ is launching a recruitment drive targeting teenage girls who know their way around social media. A nationwide competition will launch next month designed to attract thousands of potential female spies with the skills to protect the nation against cyber attacks. The Telegraph says the security services want to tackle their image as ""male, pale and stale"" by recruiting more ""Jane Bonds"" to their ranks.

Seeds of a Trump-Republican conflict,"With just days to go before inauguration, Donald Trump is making life rather difficult for his party's leadership in Congress. It could be by accident. It could be part of a plan to establish his independent credentials. Or it could simply be an early attempt at framing Republican policies in terms palatable to his working-class supporters. Whatever the reason, Mr Trump has staked out positions that are not exactly in harmony with Republican orthodoxy or the policy direction in which the Republican-led Congress seems to be heading. Over the weekend Mr Trumptold the Washington Post,externalthat the goal of his healthcare reform plan, following repeal of the Affordable Care Act, is ""insurance for everybody"". ""There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it,"" the president-elect said. ""That's not going to happen with us."" Universal coverage is an objective President Barack Obama's healthcare reform sought, but never actually achieved. According to the federal government, even with full implementation of Obamacare and its insurance-coverage mandate, the US uninsured rate was 8.6% in 2016 - albeit a 50-year low. ""Insurance for everybody,"" outside a single-payer government-provided healthcare plan, is virtually unachievable. This is why, when Republican congressional leaders describe their healthcare reform proposals, they generally use the term ""universal access"" not ""universal coverage"". ""Our goal here is to make sure that everybody can buy coverage or find coverage if they choose to,"" a Republican House of Representatives aidetold reporters,externalin December. Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan may not see eye-to-eye on universal healthcare coverage. The yet-to-be announced plan congressional Republicans are currently formulating is more likely to be a blend of the measures floated by various conservatives in the past. For instance Congressman Tom Price, Mr Trump's nominee to be health and human services secretary, suggested a system that leaned heavily on tax credits and an expansion of existing health-savings accounts, where individuals could put aside untaxed money to pay for future medical needs. Speaker of the House Paul Ryanhas proposed,externalthe creation of federally funded high-risk insurance pools that would enrol individuals who couldn't get insurances elsewhere because of pre-existing medical conditions or other complicating factors. None of these would come close to approaching universal coverage or even Mr Obama's uninsured mark over the past few years, however. As if that weren't enough, Mr Trump also advocated using the buying power of the federal Medicare prescription-drug programme for the elderly to drive down the cost of pharmaceuticals. While this has long been a goal of Democrats, conservatives have opposed the idea for more than a decade. It's enough to make rank-and-file Republicans reach for their antacids. Looming over this entire discussion is a Congressional Budget Officereport,externalreleased on Tuesday that predicts a straight-up repeal of Obamacare without any kind of a replacement would result in a doubling of premiums in the individual insurance market by 2026, at which point a total of 32 million Americans would have lost their coverage. Mr Trump, in his comments this weekend, has essentially laid down a marker that repeal will be quickly followed by a replacement that will do a better job advancing Democratic goals of lower drug prices and more universal coverage than the Democrats' own best attempt. It is, to put it bluntly, a high bar to reach. If reshaping the US healthcare system turns out to be a challenge, at least tax reform was considered a low-hanging fruit for Mr Trump and his party. Even here, however, the president-elect has made comments that undermine Republican efforts to achieve legislative consensus. A key part of the nascent congressional tax plan involved something called ""border adjustments"", which would tax corporations based on their final point of sale and not on where they are based. This would allow the US to give preference to businesses based in the US - one of Mr Trump's key goals during the campaign. It would also raise enough revenue to allow the overall US tax rate to be lowered from its current 35% mark. Donald Trump doesn't want a ""complicated"" tax reform plan Mr Trump, however, said the idea was ""too complicated"". ""Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it,"" he said. ""Because usually it means we're going to get adjusted into a bad deal."" Mr Trump appears to support a more direct border tariff, not the more complicated congressional work-around. On Monday he threatened European automakers with a 35% tax on foreign-made vehicles sold in the US. The problem this presents for both the president-elect and congressional leaders is it runs directly against his party's long-standing free-trade positions - principles many in Congress have campaigned, and won, on for years. They might be able to dance around the issue with border adjustments and corporate tax reform, but Mr Trump seems more like a bull than a ballerina. It's possible to imagine that Mr Trump's recent comments were just, to put it delicately, rhetorical missteps and that he, in fact, is actually on the same wavelength as his Republican colleagues in Congress. Then again, when pressed by the Washington Post on how he could get his healthcare priorities advanced despite an apparent conflict with current Republican plans, Mr Trump dug in his heels. ""The Congress can't get cold feet because the people will not let that happen,"" Mr Trump said. ""I think we will get approval. I won't tell you how, but we will get approval. You see what's happened in the House in recent weeks."" That was an apparent reference to Mr Trump'sTwitter-based effortto force House Republicans to back away from a plan to weaken an independent congressional ethics investigation office several weeks ago. Donald Trump says ""the people"" won't let Congress back away from his ideas Whether he was directly responsible for causing the legislators to change course or simply reflecting popular outcry is open to debate, but the president-elect seems to be feeling his oats. And if it's this way on tax law and healthcare reform - areas where Republicans and Mr Trump have a fair amount of ideological common ground - imagine what might happen when the president tries to advance his more controversial ideas on immigration or trade. Or pushes his childcare proposal, which met with significant opposition from his party ""allies"" pretty much from the moment he proposed them last October. And what's in store if Mr Ryan goes through with his long-sought dream of entitlement reform - despite Mr Trump's campaign pledges not to touch Medicare or Social Security benefits? Candidate Trump was a political wild-card, willing to buck conventional wisdom and his own party seemingly on whim. Early indications are President Trump could do more of the same. As Republicans celebrate this weekend, storm clouds may be forming on the horizon.

Robertson to face O'Sullivan at Masters after win over Carter - highlights & report,"This video can not be played Robertson eases into quarters with win over Carter Dafabet Masters 2017 Venue:Alexandra Palace, LondonDates:15-22 January Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, Connected TV, Red Button, BBC Sport website and app. Former Crucible winner Neil Robertson set up a Masters quarter-final with defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan by beating Ali Carter 6-3. A low-scoring match saw the pair share the first two frames before the Australian opened up a 4-1 lead. England's world number 14 Carter pulled it back to 4-3, but the 2012 Masters champion won the next before clinching victory with a 117 break. Earlier, Marco Fu beat Judd Trump 6-5 in a thrilling final-frame decider. Hong Kong's Fu had fallen 3-0 and 4-2 behind, but recovered to make breaks of 80 and 102 in the last two frames. This video can not be played Masters 2017: Marco Fu beats Judd Trump in final-frame decider Englishman Trump started brightly with breaks of 102, 87 and 67, and further runs of 79 and 112 took him one away from victory, before Fu fought back. Fu, runner-up in 2010, faces Northern Ireland's Mark Allen in the next round at Alexandra Palace on Thursday. A high-class encounter saw the pair make 14 breaks over 50 in the best-of-11 match. Fu's victory was the third first-round match to go to a decider following O'Sullivan's win over Liang Wenbo and Allen's victory over John Higgins. ""I have done it the hard way,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I missed three balls and was 3-0 down. I just tried to concentrate on the good things I had been doing. ""Maybe there was a few nerves at the start. No matter how many tournaments you have won, this is an extra buzz."" Last month, Fu was 4-1 down before winning eight frames in a row to beat Higginsin the Scottish Open finalto claim the third ranking title of his career. Fu added: ""When I am in good form, I handle the mistakes better now. I feel stronger when I miss a few balls, it does not matter to me, I can keep going."" 1991 world champion John Parrott on BBC Two I feel sorry for Judd, he did not have a single chance in the final frame but Marco took those last few balls well.

What we now know,"Ambassadors from other EU countries were invited to hear Theresa May's speech With her Brexit speech, Theresa May has for the first time revealed some key details about her approach to negotiations with the EU. Here's what we know now: What it is:The single market aims to make it easy for EU nations to trade with one another. It allows free movement of goods, workers, services and capital around the EU, without any tariffs, pretty much as if it was all one country. While it remains in the EU, the UK is a full member of the single market, and much of the Brexit debate has been about what will happen when it leaves. Some non-EU countries - such as Norway - have arrangements with the EU that allow them to be part of the single market if they meet certain conditions. UK government position:Having previously not publicly committed either way, Theresa May confirmed the UK cannot remain a member of the single market after it leaves the EU. She said this was because, as European leaders have stressed, the UK would have to accept EU rules and regulations and be bound by the European Court of Justice. Instead, she said, the UK will push for a new ""comprehensive free trade agreement"", giving it ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Theresa May said ""elements"" of the single market could remain for financial services The deal might contain ""elements"" of the current arrangements, she said, singling out the the motor trade and financial services as examples. What it is:A customs union is an arrangement between countries who agree not to impose tariffs on each other's goods. They also agree to impose common external tariffs on goods from countries outside their customs union. Setting common external tariffs is what distinguishes a customs union from a free trade area, where members are able to set their own tariffs on goods from the rest of the world. As an EU member, the UK is currently part of its customs union. What we know:The PM specified that the UK will leave the EU customs union, saying elements of it (the Common Commercial Policy and the Common External Tariff) prevented the UK from striking trade deals around the world. At the same time, she said she wanted the UK ""to have a customs union agreement with the EU"". She added: ""Whether that means we must reach a completely new customs agreement, become an associate member of the customs union in some way, or remain a signatory to some elements of it, I hold no preconceived position."" The 28 member states are in the EU customs union, but the EU also has separate customs union agreements - which vary in scope, for example in relation to the type of goods covered, with a number of other countries. The government has made clear that there will be restrictions to EU migration as a result of the referendum. This was reiterated by Mrs May in her speech, saying: ""The message from the public before and during the referendum campaign was clear: Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe. And that is what we will deliver."" But the precise model to be used has not yet been confirmed. During the referendum campaign, Vote Leave called for a ""points-based"" system, similar to that used in Australia. But this model, which would involve applications being accepted on the basis of skills, has been rejected by Mrs May, who says it would not give sufficient control to the government. An alternative, which Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said is under consideration, is to require migrants to have a work permit before coming to work in the UK, with ministers able to prioritise different sectors. The government has said all possibilities are being considered. The fate of EU citizens currently living in the UK and of UK citizens living in the rest of the EU has become another pressing question. The government has repeatedly stated that the UK could not make commitments on the right of EU citizens to remain in the UK without securing a reciprocal deal for British citizens living abroad in Europe. ""I have said on many occasions that I expect to be able to, and wish to be able to, guarantee their status here in the UK, but we do need reciprocity - we need to have care and concern for UK citizens who are living in the European Union,"" Mrs May told MPs last month. In her speech, she said many countries wanted a deal, but ""one or two others do not"", and called for a resolution as soon as possible. Mrs May confirmed: ""l will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and the EU to a vote in both Houses of Parliament, before it comes into force."" After her speech, Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs the UK would be leaving the EU whatever the outcome of the vote. The government will also be forced to consult Parliament before starting negotiations if it loses the legal challenge over Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The prime minister has been clear the UK will no longer be bound by the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice, which ensures the application of EU legislation, after Brexit. ""We are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,"" she told the Conservative Party conference. ""That's not going to happen."" There has been much talk of an interim deal between the UK and the EU before the final terms are agreed. But different versions of what this could mean have been put forward. In her speech, Mrs May said there would be no ""unlimited transitional status"", which would leave the UK in ""some kind of permanent political purgatory"". However, she proposed a ""phased process of implementation"" after a deal has been reached, to allow each element of the deal to be introduced. As it will not be in the single market, the UK will not pay ""huge sums"" to EU budgets, Theresa May said. In some circumstances it may have to make an ""appropriate contribution"" to be part of European schemes, she said. ""But the principle is clear: the days of Britain making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end."" The PM gave her strongest warning yet to her opposite numbers ahead of the negotiations, saying a ""punitive deal that punishes Britain"" would be ""an act of calamitous self-harm for the countries of Europe"" and would ""not be the act of a friend"". She added that ""no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain"". There was another warning for the EU in the PM's speech, as she told leaders to ""respect difference"", rather than ""trying to hold things together by force, tightening a vice-like grip that ends up crushing into tiny pieces the very things you want to protect"". The government had already set itself a Brexit deadline - Theresa May will give notice of the UK's departure from the EU under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty before the end of March. This allows two years for the negotiations to be completed before the UK leaves. The government has insisted neither a pending Supreme Court judgement nor the political upheaval in Northern Ireland will delay its timetable. What will happen to EU funding currently given to projects and different regions across the UK? We know that during negotiations with the EU, all rights and obligations from EU membership will continue as normal. This means that the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget and that all projects in the UK that currently benefit from EU funding will continue to do so while the UK remains a member of the EU. In August, the Treasury said it would guarantee to back EU-funded projects signed before the Autumn Statement (23 November). Agricultural funding now provided by the EU will also continue until 2020. In October, Chancellor Philip Hammond told the Conservative Party conference the Treasury would guarantee payments for multi-year EU funding secured before Brexit after Britain left the EU.

How often do planes fall on houses?,"On 16 January 2017 a cargo plane flying from Hong Kong to Istanbul crash-landed just outside the main airport for Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. As well as all four crew members, at least33 people on the ground were killed. Locals said entire families had been wiped out in the disaster. This video can not be played Footage showed the wreckage strewn across a large area The images are horrific, but it's reassuring to know accidental plane crashes in residential areas are incredibly rare, a fact largely attributable to pilot training. ""The rules of flying in an emergency are first you aviate, then you navigate, then you communicate,"" says Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at Flight Global. A skilled pilot with the right information can avert a major disaster In other words, the pilot's priority is keeping the plane in the air, then working out the route, then telling everyone what's going on, though all of this can happen very quickly. ""Pilots will always avoid coming down in a civilian area if they can, but situations during these instances can be very intense and hectic,"" says Mr Waldron. ""A lot will depend on how much control they have over the aircraft."" This was the case, for example, with Chesley Sullenberger, aka Sully, who was flying an Airbus 320 over New York in January 2009 when its engines were disabled by a bird strike. He made the quick calculation that he could not risk diverting to a nearby airport, as the plane could come down on populated areas, and so landed in the middle of the Hudson River. After an investigation, he was judged to have made the right decision, which saved the lives of 155 people on board and possibly numerous more on the ground. Air disasters timeline 'A golden era of aircraft safety' The TransAsia plane came down just short of highrise buildings A similar incident in Taiwan in February 2015 saw a TransAsia flightcrashing in a riverin the middle of Taipei. Dramatic images showed the plane narrowly missing cars on a busy bridge as it came down. Forty-three people died. It was later discovered that one engine had malfunctioned and the crew accidentally shut down the working engine instead. It remains unclear whether the river landing was pilot skill or chance, says Mr Waldron. These incidents happened in daytime and in good flying conditions, but the situation can be very different if flying at night, as the Turkish airline crew were this week, he says. The two-man crew of a Bombardier freighter which crashed in Norway in 2016, experienced ""spatial disorientation"" after getting confusing technical readings about their height and speed while flying at night, theofficial investigation,externalfound. They did the right thing but, ""guided by the erroneous information"", flew straight into a mountain, killing them both. The Kyrgyzstan government has been quick to blame the Bishkek crash on pilot error, but with debris still strewn across the ground, it's far too soon to make that assessment, says Mr Waldron. Studying the plane's flight deck recorder black box data will be crucial to finding out what the crew was going through and how it could be avoided in the future. But Mr Waldron is keen to stress that despite the horror of such catastrophes, flying remains an extremely safe mode of transport. On 30 June 2015, an Indonesian Hercules military plane crashed in a densely populated area shortly after taking off fromMedan airport in northern Sumatra. Most of those killed were on board, but at least 17 people died on the ground. Medan had had a similar disaster 10 years before, when a Boeing 737 crashed after taking-off from Polonia airport. Nearly 50 local residents died. A hundred passengers and crew died, though there were some survivors. In November 2012 an Ilyushin-76 cargo plane hit trees on landing at Maya-Maya airport in Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of Congo. The plane careered off the runway into nearby buildings before plunging into a ravine. Most of the 32 people who died were on the ground. In March 2011, 14 people died on the ground, along with nine on board, when a cargo plane fell on a residential area in Pointe-Noire, also in Congo. A Dana Air plane carrying 153 peoplecrashed into buildingsin Nigeria's largest city in June 2012 after an engine failure.

The secret university,"Mona studied at the underground Bahai university 10 years after Shirin The largest non-Muslim minority in Iran, the Bahais, are persecuted in many ways - one being that they are forbidden from attending university. Some study in secret, but for those who want to do a postgraduate degree the only solution is to leave their country and study abroad. ""I remember my father showing me the scars he had on his head from when he used to be beaten up by the children of his town on his way to school,"" says Shirin. ""So, of course, I didn't tell my father that I was experiencing the same when I was growing up in Iran in the 1980s. I knew he prayed and hoped that the world would get better."" In fact, persecution of the Bahais only increased following the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Find us on Facebook,external And when Shirin's son, Khosru, started going to school, she had to hide more bad news from her father. ""I did not tell him that the children of the children of the children who left him scarred, are now calling my son untouchable,"" she says. When, in the eighth grade, Khosru told the other children he was Bahai they dropped him like a stone. ""The kids wouldn't touch me,"" he says, ""and if I were to touch them, they'd go and take a shower."" Since the creation of the Bahai faith in the mid-19th Century, the Iranian Shia establishment has called them ""a deviant sect"", principally because they reject the Muslim belief that Mohammed was the last prophet. On official websites they are described as apostates, and as ""unclean"". But it is when a student has finished school that the problems really begin. As a Bahai, Shirin was told she could not enter university. Her only option was to secretly attend the Bahais' own clandestine university - the Bahai Institute for Higher Education (BIHE), set up in the mid-1980s by Bahai teachers and students who had been thrown out of Iranian universities after the revolution. Universities are open to young women in Iran, but not if they are Bahai Shirin enrolled in 1994. At that time, only two BA courses were available -in Science or Religious Studies - so she decided to study comparative religion. Lectures took place in improvised classrooms in private homes all around Tehran. It took six years to complete her course, and it was then that she hit an impenetrable wall. There was no scope to do an MA or a PhD, and there was no scope for employment where her skills could be used. Soon afterwards, a wave of crackdowns on the Bahai intelligentsia began, with raids on clandestine classrooms and the arrest of many BIHE teachers. Shirin saw her world was closing in on her. So when she heard about a domestic worker's visa scheme in the UK, she jumped at it. ""I applied straight away without wasting time, it didn't matter what the visa was called. I had to leave,"" she says. Shirin arrived in the UK in 2003 and combined her domestic work with an evening job at an Italian restaurant in Scarborough. But she never forgot what she came to do, what she must achieve. On a dark and smoggy English morning, she boldly walked through the doors of Birmingham University, and announced that she had a degree in religion from an underground university in Tehran. To her great surprise, a week later, she was summoned back and was offered a place. Listen to Lipika Pelham's report on the Bahai,The World's Faith, for Heart and Soul on the BBC World Service ""It was more than a miracle - it was beyond expectation, beyond my wildest dream,"" she says. ""Till today, I feel it was the best reward I received for never compromising my faith."" Shirin finished her degree in 2006 and left the UK to join her brother in the US, where many of her family, friends and co-religionists have, over the years, found sanctuary from persecution. Shirin (right) and a friend in New York But soon another crackdown against the Bahais began, at home in Iran. In 2008, seven members of the Bahai administrative body, Yaran, were arrested and charged with among other things, spying for Israel. After a trial in a Revolutionary Court in 2010, they were sentenced to up to 20 years in prison. At this time another young Bahai woman, Mona, was applying to university in Tehran. ""I took an entrance exam at the University of Tehran - they were supposed to send a card saying how and where you should register if you were accepted, and you must write your religion on the card,"" she says. ""I wrote that I was not Muslim. There was an option that said 'other', and I ticked that box. There was no option for Bahai. ""When they sent back the card, they said, 'OK, you may register,' and in the place of religion, they wrote, Islam."" ""In my belief, you're not supposed to lie about your faith even when facing death. So I wrote back, I was not Muslim. They said, 'Good luck, you can't enter university.'"" Like Shirin, Mona had only one option - the clandestine university, and it was an unforgettable experience. ""I remember the faces of all my friends who were coming from other cities in Iran, from far away,"" she says. ""It took them maybe 16 - 20 hours to get to Tehran. Their faces looked so tired. ""It was really hard. We had one class from 08:00 to 12:00 in the east of Tehran, and the second class from 14:00 to 18:00 on the west side - it was exhausting! Sometimes we didn't have physical teachers, we had them over Skype, who were teaching us from the US, Canada."" After she graduated, she faced the same difficulties Shirin had experienced a decade earlier - and opted for a similar solution. In 2009, she escaped to New York, via Austria, under an international religious refugee repatriation programme. When I met her recently in Joe's Coffee, a lively meeting place for students and teachers at Columbia University, she had just completed her MA in Psychology. She was over the moon. ""It feels amazing, I can't believe it's all done and I'll even have a graduation! When I graduated from the BIHE, they arrested all my teachers, Bahai teachers. And we never had a graduation day."" The US is home to one of the largest Bahai populations in the world, their presence dating back at least to 1912, when Abdul Baha, the son of the faith's founder, Baha'u'llah, spent 11 months in the country, promoting the religion. The BIHE degrees are accepted by most US universities - as Mona's was at Columbia University - and many BIHE volunteers are based in the US. ""Students and instructors in Iran can end up in jail just for being students and instructors. So they are not only doing something that is hard for them to do, but dangerous to do,"" says Prof Thane Terril, a convert to the Bahai faith who now runs online teacher training courses for post-graduate students. ""The motivation for the students is like a person in the desert without water."" Sipping coffee in the cafÃ© of the former hotel, Ansonia, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where Abdul Baha once stayed, Shirin says that she could never understand what the regime has against the Bahais. ""Abdul Baha emphasised that the East and West must meet,"" she says. ""I think the collective approach to life is what we think of as being the oriental or Eastern culture, and the individualist approach to life is considered to be Western. And when the two merge, you have a very beautiful culture."" Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

Shock of the nude,"The BBC's Siobhann Tighe was unsure what to do when she sat down on a bus beside a man who was watching porn on his mobile phone, as she wrote last Saturday. Her storyprovoked a fiery debate - while some deplored the man's behaviour, others said what he chose to watch was his own business. Many readers also described similar encounters on public transport and elsewhere. Here is a selection of their comments. I was travelling home from London to Newcastle with two children on a busy train. There was one man at a table with three empty seats. I realised he was sitting next to a conspicuous stack of porno mags and leafing through them. Everyone in the corridor had chosen to stand apart from him. ""Mummy!"" - my four-year-old daughter exclaimed loudly as she swung into the empty seat - ""that man has got pictures of ladies with big boobies!"". The porno man looked at her, looked at them, and crumpled. He put his mags in a bag and freed up the space next to him so that we could sit down.Hellen, Newcastle Whilst on a flight from Germany to Hong Kong a man in the next seat started up his laptop and was oblivious to the fact that his hardcore porn could be seen and heard by me and people in the next aisle. As a woman travelling on my own on an overnight flight, this made me extremely uncomfortable. I raised it with the purser - the man was moved and spoken to, apparently. As for the countless times I've witnessed this on the train, there's been no hope of anyone in authority sorting it out. You either have to move seats, say something and risk being verbally attacked, or seethe quietly until your stop. I'm not anti-men, anti-sex or anti-porn. Yet whenever I've raised this issue in the past, there's always someone ready to call me out for being a prude. I'm not. I just don't think porn has a place on public transport, or in any areas frequented by the general public.Annie G, UK Find us on Facebook,external I admit I've viewed online porn occasionally in the privacy of my own home, but even I was surprised and felt a little uncomfortable when the person on the next train seat began viewing very hardcore porn on his tablet. I ended up moving and informed the guard. He said he would ""have a word"" with the guy, and duly did, at which point the perpetrator (no doubt embarrassed) got up and moved. The guard apologised to me, then explained that this was an increasing problem.Lawrie, Sleaford This happened to me on a train to London. I was shocked and offended. The man was watching porn video involving a yoga instructor, on his phone in the seat beside me. I decided to ask the man to stop watching the video because, like the man, I have free will and I could ask him to stop doing something I was uncomfortable with. Of course, he could refuse and I was prepared for that. As it happens, he obliged and actually apologised. It is not the law's role to protect people from offence. If we disagree with views, we must challenge these views and have an open debate, for that is the only way society can progress.Mel Lane, Guildford l was on a bus in Huddersfield working with a looked after child who was 14 years old at the time. My young person tapped me and pointed out the man sitting in front of us was watching ""disturbing stuff"". He was watching hardcore porn on a large screen. I quietly approached the man and asked him to either sit at the back or please turn it off, otherwise I would have to have very loud words with the driver. He looked horrified when l told him that a 14-year-old had pointed out what he was watching to me. He didn't say anything, he just turned his phone off and shoved it in his pocket. I still told the driver quietly when l was getting off. I left him having a word with him. I felt l had to say something as a professional, responsible adult and a mother.Annabel, Bradford When I was 14, I was on a plane with my dad. I had the middle seat and an unknown man was in the window seat with his computer. He was reading a lot of documents and then started watching porn. I was so shocked and then I got scared, like who does that in a plane? I've never told anyone about this, but I haven't forgotten it somehow.Lais, Brazil I went to McDonald's one evening with my wife and children. I sat at a large table while my wife and children went to the counter. A group of children aged between 12 and 14 were watching porn on a large iPhone with the sound on. I asked them to switch it off and received a cold shoulder. I insisted since I had young children or I would report them to the manager. Happily they switched it off before my children came.Paul Brown, Glasgow I was at an upmarket bar/restaurant having a meal with friends. At a table close by a man sitting on his own had his laptop out. I glanced at the screen and the man was searching porn websites full of pornographic explicit images of women. I was rather shocked, particularly as he was making no attempt to be discreet. It felt to me like a blatant case of sexual harassment to myself and my female friend. The waitress agreed to talk to him and he dimmed the screen. I said I would only be happy if it was turned off or we would leave. She went back to him and he closed his laptop and left. In my view a man wouldn't be able to expose himself in a restaurant so why should he be able to expose degrading images on his laptop?Paula Stott, Harrogate This video can not be played VIDEO: From disgust to it's ok, Woman's Hour took to the streets to find out what you think of watching porn on buses I was standing on a packed tube train and a man was standing watching a porn movie on his phone. A boy, around 12 years old, realised what the man was watching and moved away. I tapped the man on the shoulder and very loudly asked why he was watching porn in a public place with children around? All he could reply with was ""you shut up"" and [swore at me]. I told him loudly to stop watching porn and switch it off but he refused. He said it was his personal right. Only my 16-year-old daughter supported me and told him to stop. Nobody else joined in or tried to help me. His behaviour was very threatening. I wanted to take his photo but was worried about his reaction. It wasn't until after he left the train at Leicester Square that other passengers congratulated me on standing up to him. I was so angry I reported the incident to Transport Police. They said if they managed to identify him he would be prosecuted for causing public outrage.Sharon Forbes, Chippenham I am a Traffic PCSO working for the Met Police on Safer Transport. There was a young male looking at a gay porn magazine. As there were young children on the bus I asked him to put the magazine away. He refused and called me ""homophobic."" I then requested the driver of the bus to pull over and I evicted the passenger from the bus and told him my thoughts. I could have gone down the route of a Section 5 of the Public Order Act - causing harm, alarm or distress.  I would recommend anyone to challenge someone looking at porn on a bus, if its causing them distress.Anonymous I was on an overland train and a man, about 25 years old and wearing a hoodie, was watching porn on his mobile as we waited for the train to depart. The speaker was turned up and it was obvious from the sounds that it was a man and woman having sex. The young man appeared to be oblivious to the rest of us. Two women got up and moved to the next carriage. None of us said anything, it was obvious looking around that most of us felt considerable discomfort. The train departed and as the sound of the tracks and its engine increased, he turned up the volume on his mobile.Mick Gavin, London Listen to Siobhann Tighe talking to Jenni Murrayon Woman's Hour, on BBC Radio 4 Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

The disaster effect,"Australia's Granville train disaster killed 83 people in 1977 Wednesday marks 40 years since a Sydney train derailed in a deadly accident that horrified Australia. It left enduring lessons, writes Jamie Duncan. Australia's worst rail disaster took only seconds to happen but was a decade or more in the making. The Granville train crash on January 18, 1977, claimed 83 lives and injured 213 others. Granville revealed gross inadequacies in New South Wales (NSW) railway maintenance and taught the emergency services a lesson about the welfare of workers like those who raced against time to free survivors on that hot January day. The 06:09 train from Mount Victoria, in the Blue Mountains, to Sydney had at least 469 passengers aboard by the time it left Parramatta station in the city's west. At 08:10, its electric locomotive derailed on an 80km/h (50 mph) curve in a deep cutting at Granville and speared into the supports of the Bold Street bridge above the tracks. The locomotive tipped on its side and dragged the first two carriages off the rails. Eight people were killed in carriage one, which tore open as it hit a power stanchion. Everyone survived in the second carriage. The train derailed and hit a bridge, forcing it to collapse The bridge, with four cars on its deck, teetered for a few seconds, then rained at least 470 tonnes of concrete and steel on carriages three and four. The weight crushed the roof of the wooden-framed carriages to within 60cm (24 inches) or less of the floor. Some areas were crushed to floor level. Within minutes, a vast rescue assembled - police, firefighters, ambulance crews, doctors, nurses, engineers, railway workers among them. The cutting hindered initial access until ladders, then stairs, could be erected. The accident drew civilian volunteers, some just teenagers, to lend a hand but many ghoulish sightseers turned up. By 08:50, 1500 people lined the cutting. The crowd spilled onto the tracks. Some disguised themselves as rescue workers and climbed onto the unstable bridge wreckage for a closer look, risking the lives of trapped passengers and their rescuers beneath. Doctors, nurses and police rescue crews crawled into tiny spaces to reach the injured, with rubble above likely to shift and further compress the carriages. In one instance, a police rescue officer was lying prone in a 35cm gap from floor to roof, clambering among victims' bodies to get to an injured man. A doctor had to amputate the arm of a dead woman to aid the rescuer but, without warning, a slab shifted above and compressed the carriage another 5cm, injuring the officer's back. Police were diverted from the rescue to control the crowd. Rescuers were praised, but subsequent investigations found problems Gas was leaking into the carriages, preventing the use of oxy-acetylene cutting equipment. Power lines had to be cut one by one before cranes could begin lifting pieces of the collapsed bridge. The stifling heat sapped the rescuers. Compressed air did little to ease the sweltering conditions. Emergency lights strung through the carriages added to the heat. Seven trapped passengers suffered potentially lethal crush syndrome - in which potassium, acids and other toxins built up in a person's trapped limbs can be released quickly once they're freed, causing life-threatening heart, respiratory and kidney issues. Three died from it. Nevertheless, Granville became an object lesson in treating crush syndrome. One policeman used a knife to cut through seats and remove springs to ease pressure on trapped passengers. The last living person was freed around 18:15 but died in hospital. The last body was extracted 31 hours after the crash. Tina Morgan, the youngest survivor of the disaster, said the scars from that day will never heal. ""It will never go away. For thousands of people involved, this will never go away, it's major trauma,"" she told the Australian Associated Press. Ms Morgan, then 14, was trapped for at least five hours with her back injured and a piece of timber piercing her chest. The incident led to improvements in the response to crash disasters Of the 77 passengers in carriage three, 44 were killed. In carriage four, 31 passengers out of 64 were killed. The efforts of emergency workers were praised following the disaster, but a debrief a month later showed there were some problems. In some instances, there was too much help on hand, crowding the scene. A disaster simulation conducted near Granville only weeks earlier had prepared medical teams well, but the review found too many medicos came to the scene and could have been better used if directed to nearby hospitals. Volunteers sometimes complicated things. At one stage, up to 30 people were observed trying to carry single stretchers. Importantly, there was no plan for psychological support for emergency workers traumatised by the appalling scene. In all, one-quarter of emergency staff at Granville reported symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia a month later. The National Association of Loss and Grief was established in 1977 in response, and commenced work with workers adversely affected by the disaster. Psychological and pastoral care became more available to emergency service workers. At least 469 passengers were on board shortly before the crash An inquiry headed by then NSW District Court chief judge, Justice James Staunton, began in February 1977. It revealed that the Bold Street bridge had been struck by derailments on the same section of track twice before - by a locomotive in 1967 and a loaded coal wagon in 1975. The track there was in a ""very unsatisfactory condition"", poorly fastened and badly aligned. The tracks had spread wider than standard gauge. On the morning of the crash, this caused the locomotive's front left wheel to drop inside the track and sent it careering into the bridge supports. The defects should have been identified and repaired, with failures reaching into the highest echelons of the Public Transport Commission (although no-one was held directly accountable) and exacerbated by a high turnover of track inspection staff in the months before the disaster. Budgetary constraints were also a factor. The Public Transport Commission ran at a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Among his recommendations, Justice Staunton called for senior emergency personnel to be trained in disaster management and that more general training in crisis intervention be provided in crisis management for health and welfare workers in traumatic events. Roses are dropped from the Bold Street bridge in a ceremony each year The Wran government, which only came to power months before the accident, announced an immediate A$200m (Â£122m; $151m) railway improvement plan. Forty years on, the response continues. Ahead of Wednesday's anniversary, Transport Minister Andrew Constance said the governmentplanned to apologise,externalto victims' families. ""It's a tragedy which no-one would ever get over and it's hard for a lot of us to imagine the grief that people experience life-long because of the very nature of that happened,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Each year since the Granville disaster, survivors, rescuers and loved ones of those killed gather on the Bold Street bridge on January 18 for a memorial service, dropping 83 roses to remember those lost.

Brexit speech,"This video can not be played Theresa May confirmed that the final deal would be put to the vote in Parliament Following Theresa May's widely anticipated speech on Brexit on Tuesday, you sent us your questions. The impact on free trade was the most asked about subject. Below, BBC Economics Correspondent Andrew Walker looks at two of the most popular questions you asked: Why does [Mrs May] think we'll get a free trade agreement when [we're] opting out of the free movement of goods, services and people? What's the difference between the ""freest possible movement of trade and goods"" and the single market as we know it? The only thing on the list above that the Prime Minister has said she wants to opt out of is the free movement of people - or rather the free movement of people to work and settle in the UK. She is very keen on the free movement of goods and services.She said in the speechthat she wants: ""the freest possible trade in goods and services between Britain and the EU's member states."" She does not want to opt out of that. The freest possible means what we have today. For example: no tariffs on goods travelling in either direction, mutual recognition of each other's technical standards, the freedom to offer services across borders and more. In short, it means the provisions of the single market that apply to goods and services. It would be theoretically possible to go further still, especially in services. The European Commissionsays there are still barriers and it wants to tackle them,external. But for now, the single market as it is represents the freest we can get. The UK's Brexit plans: What we now know Europe sees UK set for 'hard' Brexit Pound gains on May speech but FTSE falls But Mrs May seems to accept that we can't have that without also accepting freedom of movement for workers. And that is one of her red lines. So once that has gone, the freest possible movement for goods and services will presumably mean something less than the single market, something less than we have today. How much less will be a matter for negotiation. In fact, the answer to many questions about what will ""X"" be like when we leave will depend on the outcome of the negotiations. We can speculate but we can't know for sure. This video can not be played Some of the headlines from Theresa May's vision for future UK-EU relations The UK does have some cards which will encourage the EU to lean towards what the Prime Minister wants. Some European businesses have the UK as an important export market - German car makers for example. During the referendum campaign many Leave supporters were keen to point out that the rest of the EU exports more to the UK than the UK exports to them. That, they argued, means they need the UK more than we need them. The counter-argument is that EU exports to the UK as a share of national income are a lot smaller than trade in the opposite direction. That suggests UK/EU trade matters more to us than to them. Another reason that the remaining EU might want to be cooperative in trade negotiations is that many continental businesses would want to continue to be able to use the City of London as a financial centre.

Trump and the nuclear codesMelania Trump's hometown celebratesSeeds of a Trump-Republican conflict,"On 20 January, inauguration day in the United States, a nameless, unknown military aide was seen accompanying President Barack Obama to the handover ceremony at the US Capitol in Washington. That military aide was carrying a satchel over his or her shoulder containing a briefcase known as ""the nuclear football"". Inside was a piece of digital hardware measuring 3in (7.3cm) by 5in, known as ""the biscuit"". This contained the launch codes for a strategic nuclear strike. The briefing for the incoming president on how to activate them had already taken place out of public sight, but the moment President-elect Donald Trump took the oath of office that aide, and the satchel, moved quietly over to his side. From then on, Donald Trump has had sole authority to order an action that could result in the deaths of millions of people in under an hour. The question on a lot of people's minds is, given his thin skin and impulsive temperament, what are the safeguards, if any, to prevent an impetuous decision by one man with catastrophic consequences? First off, it should be said that Donald Trump has previously rowed back on some of his earlier, provocative comments on the use of nuclear weapons. He stated he would be ""the last person to use them"", although he did not rule it out. Donald Trump: US must greatly expand nuclear capabilities Russia's top spin doctor in nuclear warning North Korea's nuclear programme: How advanced is it? Other senior figures are also involved in the chain of command, such as the US Secretary of Defence, retired US Marine Gen James Mattis, But Mark Fitzpatrick, a nuclear non-proliferation expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Washington, says that ultimately, the sole authority to launch a strike rests with the president. ""There are no checks and balances on the president's authority to launch a nuclear strike,"" he says. ""But between the time he authorises one and the time it's carried out there are other people involved."" The idea of a rogue president taking such a monumental decision on his own is unrealistic. He gives the order and the secretary of defence is constitutionally obliged to carry it out. The secretary of defence could, in theory, refuse to obey the order if he had reason to doubt the president's sanity, but this would constitute mutiny and the president can then fire him and assign the task to the deputy secretary of defence. Donald Trump says the US should ""greatly strengthen and expand"" its nuclear capabilities Under the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution a vice-president could, in theory, declare the president mentally incapable of taking a proper decision, but he would need to be backed by a majority of the cabinet. So how would it work in practice? Inside that briefcase, the ""nuclear football"" that never leaves the president's side, is a ""black book"" of strike options for him to choose from once he has authenticated his identity as commander-in-chief, using a plastic card. Washington folklore has it that a previous president temporarily mislaid his identification card when he left it inside a jacket that was sent to the dry cleaners. Once the president has selected his strike options from a long-prepared ""menu"", the order is passed via the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Pentagon's war room and then, using sealed authentication codes, on to US Strategic Command HQ in Offutt Airbase in Nebraska. The order to fire is transmitted to the actual launch crews using encrypted codes that have to match the codes locked inside their safes. This video can not be played Which countries have nuclear weapons? The US and Russia both possess enough nuclear missiles to destroy each other's cities several times over - there are reported to be 100 US nuclear warheads aimed at Moscow alone. The two countries' arsenals account for more than 90% of the world's total number of nuclear warheads. As of September 2016 Russia had the most, with an estimated 1796 strategic nuclear warheads, deployed on a mixed platform of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and strategic bombers. Under a programme ordered by President Vladimir Putin, Moscow has recently invested billions of roubles in upgrading its strategic nuclear missile force, keeping an arsenal of constantly mobile ballistic missiles travelling through tunnels deep beneath the forests of Siberia. America had, in September 2016, 1,367 strategic nuclear warheads, similarly deployed in land-based underground missile silos, which by their static nature are vulnerable to a first strike, at sea onboard submarines, where they are harder to detect, and at airbases, where they can be loaded on to bombers. The UK has about 120 strategic warheads, of which only a third are deployed at sea. The Royal Navy always keeps a portion of the nation's Trident nuclear force somewhere in the world's oceans, maintaining what is known as the continuous at sea deterrent. The Topol is one of Russia's mobile ICBMs ICBMs travel at a speed of over 17,000mph (Mach 23), flying high above the Earth's atmosphere before descending towards their pre-programmed targets at four miles a second. The flight-time for land-based missiles flying between Russia and the US is between 25 and 30 minutes. For submarine-based missiles, where the boats may be able to approach a coast covertly, the flight time could be considerably shorter, even as little as 12 minutes. This does not leave a president much time to decide whether it is a false alarm or imminent Armageddon. Once ICBMs have been launched they cannot be recalled, but if they remain in their silos they will probably be destroyed by the inbound attack. A former senior White House official told me recently that much would depend on the circumstances in which a nuclear strike was being considered. If this was a long-term, measured policy decision to say, carry out a pre-emptive strike on country X, then a lot of people would be involved. The vice-president, National Security Adviser, and much of the cabinet would all be likely to be included in the decision-making process. But if there was an imminent strategic threat to the United States, i.e. if an inbound launch of ICBMs from a hostile state had been detected and were minutes from reaching the US then, he said, ""the president has extraordinary latitude to take the sole decision to launch.""

Melania Trump's hometown celebratesSeeds of a Trump-Republican conflict,"This video can not be played What was Melania Trump like in Slovenia? The President Burger is presented with a flourish - on a wooden board, surrounded by circular ""dollar fries"" and topped with a yellow crust of cheese ""hair"" which looks as if it might fly away at any moment. As tributes to the US President-elect go, it may not be the most respectful. But it is offered with the affection and gentle humour which it soon becomes apparent is a hallmark of Sevnica, a Slovenian town which just happens to be the place where Donald Trump's first-lady-to-be, Melania, spent most of her childhood. ""We formed the burger so it would resemble Trump a little bit,"" chuckles Bruno Vidmar, the chef-proprietor of Rondo, a restaurant in the newer part of Sevnica. ""It has hot peppers, because Trump's statements are hot - and it comes with dollar fries because he's a successful entrepreneur."" The owner of the Rondo restaurant designed this burger to resemble Donald Trump The presidential tie-in seems to be serving Rondo well: on a weekday morning, the place is buzzing with an early lunch crowd from the nearby furniture and textile factories. Meanwhile a table full of smartly-dressed young women order another of Bruno's culinary creations dreamt up with Sevnica's most famous daughter in mind. ""The 'Melanija' dessert is made out of sponge, then there's a layer of mascarpone and strawberries. It's light enough for a model - and we have it on good authority that Melania loves strawberries."" Sevnica is a small place - so Bruno probably did not have to search long to find an authority on what Melania likes for pudding. Or, at least, what she did like when she was growing up as Melanija Knavs in this town of fewer than 5,000 people. Bar the addition of a branch of Lidl on the outskirts, little seems to have changed since she left for Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, as a teenager. The old castle - parts of which date back to the 12th Century - still overlooks Sevnica from its hilltop perch. The town itself is a tidy place with new and old sections, sitting alongside the River Sava and surrounded by forested hills. The Slovenian Tourist Board suggests that Sevnica is ""an excellent destination for those who enjoy picnics and outings, hiking, cycling or fishing"". If the roads had been less icy, it would certainly have been an enjoyable ride through the trees to GostiÅ¡Äe Ob Ribniku, a restaurant and guesthouse next to a small lake. Inside the traditional wooden chalet, you can chat to one of the people who can shed some light on the future first lady's early years. Sevnica is ""an excellent destination for those who enjoy picnics and outings, hiking, cycling or fishing"" according to the Slovenian Tourist Board ""We were next door neighbours - and we used to go the same way to school,"" says Mateja Zalezina, who runs GostiÅ¡Äe Ob Ribniku with her husband, Dejan. ""In the afternoon when we came back we used to hang out in front of the apartment block. Even then she was quite busy, because her mother was a fashion designer and Melania was one of the models for the Jutranjka company that did fashion for kids."" Mateja laughs at the idea that she could have spotted that her neighbour would go a long way from Sevnica - never mind all the way to the White House. But she says that Melania could not help but stand out. ""She was really good at school. She and her sister Ines were studying really hard. After school, we played a game called 'gumi-twist', an elastic band game, and she was really good at that. She had the figure of a model - really long legs - and she always won!"" The restaurant is offering a three-course ""Melanija Menu"" in honour of Mateja's former playmate. But, like Rondo's eponymous offering, this does not feel like a culinary cash-in, just a low-key tribute, delivered with affection. ""I'm really happy for her - she's achieved the maximum,"" says Dejan. ""I hope everyone in Sevnica will watch the inauguration. We will be here at the restaurant with friends and will raise a glass to them both."" Melania's former neighbour says America's next first lady studied ""really hard"" at school Back in the old town, beneath the castle, Sevnica's mayor Srecko Ocvirk is not planning any special events to mark the start of the Trump era. But he hopes the publicity will bring the town's charms to the attention of tourists. ""The first visitors who came were journalists like you,"" he admits. ""But we're now seeing there are rising numbers of tourists. We're also expecting more organised tour groups after the inauguration. Sevnica and the region will become better known because of this."" At the town's primary school, one of the staff has certainly achieved a degree of local celebrity. Art teacher Nena Bedek was best friends with Melania until the future Mrs Trump left to finish her schooling in Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana. Now Nena fields questions from her students about her friendship with Sevnica's most famous former resident - and marvels at the different paths their lives have taken. ""It's a 'wow' effect for us and for me,"" she says. Melania's childhood best friend has fond memories ""She was a reliable girl and a very good friend. But she never wished to stand out - even though she was beautiful and hard-working. She loved to read and draw. She was brought up in a very artistic manner - she knew what was beautiful - due to her mother's job as a fashion designer. I have very fond memories and keep her very close in my heart."" As for the town's various tributes - which include wine, slippers and honey as well as the culinary offerings - Nena believes they are in keeping with the Sevnica spirit. ""They are very sympathetic and sweet - none of them are bad things - and it's also funny. I think it's still within limits - all in all it's sweet and nice."" Rather like Sevnica itself, perhaps.

McCoy 'put on two stone' since retiring,"Sir Tony McCoy confessed to a weakness for chocolate biscuits Jockey Sir Tony McCoy has put on two stone since he retired and has admitted eating ""whole packets"" of biscuits while watching TV at night. The 42-year-old, who remains the most successful jump jockey of all time,bowed out of the sport in April 2015. He spent decades dieting to keep trim for races and once said hisChristmas dinner consisted of just 597 calories. He now confesses to a weakness for chocolate biscuits but said a recent health check has made him rethink. ""There's nights I would eat the whole packet... it is not something I am proud of,"" McCoy said. ""For someone that had pretty good willpower it is not anywhere near as good as it used to be."" During his racing career, McCoy skipped dinner several nights a week to maintain his thin frame McCoy, from Moneyglass, County Antrim, was renowned for his determination and dedication over the course of his record-breaking career. Hewon more than 4,000 races, and was crowned champion jockey 20 years in a row. Keeping hold of that crown involved keeping his body weight well below what would be considered average for a man of his height - 5ft 10in (1.8m) He maintained a thin frame of about 10 st 3lbs (65kg) with a punishing regime of meagre portions - often missing dinner three nights a week - and hot baths to sweat off the pounds. Life has been sweeter since he retired, but McCoy will now revert to watching his diet after a recent health check warned of the risks of high cholesterol and blood sugar. ""When I was racing I was unhealthy looking,"" he said. ""Everybody tells me now I am healthy looking but yet there are things I need to keep an eye on like my cholesterol, the possibility of diabetes."" In 2013, McCoy posed with his trophy marking his 4000th career victory Back in 2010, his low-calorie Christmas dinner consisted of three thinly sliced pieces of turkey breast, a spoonful of cabbage, three Brussels sprouts, a splash of gravy and a small lemonade. ""I never mind having a frugal Christmas dinner as I'm always looking forward to some great rides on Boxing Day,"" he said at the time. ""What I do enjoy is seeing Mick Fitzgerald and Carl Llewellyn loosening their belts before they struggle home. I just can't imagine bursting out of my clothes like those two do."" The retired champion may have needed to pile on a few pounds, but McCoy now intends to monitor his food intake as ""prevention is so much better than any cure"". ""I spent all my life dieting but it is something I actually do need,"" he said. ""Because my body was so used to that I cannot really let my lifestyle change too much. I am two stone heavier than I was a year and a half ago."" A 'first' Christmas dinner for AP McCoy Timeline of Tony McCoy's career Arise Sir Anthony - McCoy is knighted.

Sutton shock Wimbledon in FA Cup to set up tie with Leeds,"This video can not be played FA Cup: AFC Wimbledon 1-3 Sutton United highlights Non-league Sutton set up a glamorous FA Cup fourth-round home tie against Leeds with a thrilling replay win at 10-man League One side AFC Wimbledon. The Dons made a perfect start when Tom Elliott rose above the away defence to nod in Dean Parrett's free-kick. But they were left a man down for more than 75 minutes as Paul Robinson was sent off for hauling down Matt Tubbs. Roarie Deacon's stunner levelled before late goals from Maxime Biamou and Dan Fitchett caused an upset. The National League side will host Leeds at Gander Green Lane on Sunday, 29 January (14:00 GMT). Follow all the reaction from Tuesday's FA Cup ties FA Cup results and fourth-round fixtures Listen: 'I dared not dream about this' This video can not be played Fitchett goal sparks wild scenes for Sutton Sutton were the lowest-ranked team left in the draw for the fourth round, but knew they had to overcome their near-neighbours - 51 places above them on the league ladder - before they could even think about hosting Championship promotion chasers Leeds in a money-spinning tie. The non-league club have reached the fourth round on two previous occasions, the last time coming in the 1988-89 season, when they memorably beat then-top flight opponents Coventry in the third round. But the reward for beating Wimbledon was worth much more to the Greater London club than that famous win 28 years ago. Sutton manager Paul Doswell compared winning the third-round replay to the Championship play-off final in terms of financial importance, estimating it would take their earnings from this cup run to about Â£500,000. This victory was more than just money. The jubilant celebrations from the away players and officials, plus their 300-odd travelling supporters, showed how much the victory meant. Leeds-born Tom Elliott put AFC Wimbledon ahead, but missed out on a tie against his home-city club Former Tottenham manager David Pleat on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: ""It was an extraordinary night. We thought fitness might tell - with Wimbledon the fitter side - but the one-man advantage was the major factor. ""It was a great start for Wimbledon, scoring that early goal, then the Robinson sending-off made it difficult for them. I though Sutton played too many high long balls and lacked creativity round the sides. ""Wimbledon coped with everything until that late, late surge."" Sutton manager Paul Doswellspoke of his ""unadulterated joy"" as The U's - 15th in the National League - set-up a home tie with Championship Leeds United. ""I'm so pleased for my chairman, our directors who are all volunteers, for the 1,000 fans here and for the players. ""Without being over-emotional about it, we have got a good chance against Leeds on our pitch. No one likes playing on it apart from us it seems. If they make seven or eight changes against us I think we will have a chance."" Dons boss Neal Ardleymeanwhile pointed unsurprisingly to the dismissal of Paul Robinson after 15 minutes as the key moment, though he added he had few complaints with the result.

What Melania Trump's hometown tells us about her,"This video can not be played What was Melania Trump like in Slovenia? The President Burger is presented with a flourish - on a wooden board, surrounded by circular ""dollar fries"" and topped with a yellow crust of cheese ""hair"" which looks as if it might fly away at any moment. As tributes to the US President-elect go, it may not be the most respectful. But it is offered with the affection and gentle humour which it soon becomes apparent is a hallmark of Sevnica, a Slovenian town which just happens to be the place where Donald Trump's first-lady-to-be, Melania, spent most of her childhood. ""We formed the burger so it would resemble Trump a little bit,"" chuckles Bruno Vidmar, the chef-proprietor of Rondo, a restaurant in the newer part of Sevnica. ""It has hot peppers, because Trump's statements are hot - and it comes with dollar fries because he's a successful entrepreneur."" The owner of the Rondo restaurant designed this burger to resemble Donald Trump The presidential tie-in seems to be serving Rondo well: on a weekday morning, the place is buzzing with an early lunch crowd from the nearby furniture and textile factories. Meanwhile a table full of smartly-dressed young women order another of Bruno's culinary creations dreamt up with Sevnica's most famous daughter in mind. ""The 'Melanija' dessert is made out of sponge, then there's a layer of mascarpone and strawberries. It's light enough for a model - and we have it on good authority that Melania loves strawberries."" Sevnica is a small place - so Bruno probably did not have to search long to find an authority on what Melania likes for pudding. Or, at least, what she did like when she was growing up as Melanija Knavs in this town of fewer than 5,000 people. Bar the addition of a branch of Lidl on the outskirts, little seems to have changed since she left for Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana, as a teenager. The old castle - parts of which date back to the 12th Century - still overlooks Sevnica from its hilltop perch. The town itself is a tidy place with new and old sections, sitting alongside the River Sava and surrounded by forested hills. The Slovenian Tourist Board suggests that Sevnica is ""an excellent destination for those who enjoy picnics and outings, hiking, cycling or fishing"". If the roads had been less icy, it would certainly have been an enjoyable ride through the trees to GostiÅ¡Äe Ob Ribniku, a restaurant and guesthouse next to a small lake. Inside the traditional wooden chalet, you can chat to one of the people who can shed some light on the future first lady's early years. Sevnica is ""an excellent destination for those who enjoy picnics and outings, hiking, cycling or fishing"" according to the Slovenian Tourist Board ""We were next door neighbours - and we used to go the same way to school,"" says Mateja Zalezina, who runs GostiÅ¡Äe Ob Ribniku with her husband, Dejan. ""In the afternoon when we came back we used to hang out in front of the apartment block. Even then she was quite busy, because her mother was a fashion designer and Melania was one of the models for the Jutranjka company that did fashion for kids."" Mateja laughs at the idea that she could have spotted that her neighbour would go a long way from Sevnica - never mind all the way to the White House. But she says that Melania could not help but stand out. ""She was really good at school. She and her sister Ines were studying really hard. After school, we played a game called 'gumi-twist', an elastic band game, and she was really good at that. She had the figure of a model - really long legs - and she always won!"" The restaurant is offering a three-course ""Melanija Menu"" in honour of Mateja's former playmate. But, like Rondo's eponymous offering, this does not feel like a culinary cash-in, just a low-key tribute, delivered with affection. ""I'm really happy for her - she's achieved the maximum,"" says Dejan. ""I hope everyone in Sevnica will watch the inauguration. We will be here at the restaurant with friends and will raise a glass to them both."" Melania's former neighbour says America's next first lady studied ""really hard"" at school Back in the old town, beneath the castle, Sevnica's mayor Srecko Ocvirk is not planning any special events to mark the start of the Trump era. But he hopes the publicity will bring the town's charms to the attention of tourists. ""The first visitors who came were journalists like you,"" he admits. ""But we're now seeing there are rising numbers of tourists. We're also expecting more organised tour groups after the inauguration. Sevnica and the region will become better known because of this."" At the town's primary school, one of the staff has certainly achieved a degree of local celebrity. Art teacher Nena Bedek was best friends with Melania until the future Mrs Trump left to finish her schooling in Slovenia's capital, Ljubljana. Now Nena fields questions from her students about her friendship with Sevnica's most famous former resident - and marvels at the different paths their lives have taken. ""It's a 'wow' effect for us and for me,"" she says. Melania's childhood best friend has fond memories ""She was a reliable girl and a very good friend. But she never wished to stand out - even though she was beautiful and hard-working. She loved to read and draw. She was brought up in a very artistic manner - she knew what was beautiful - due to her mother's job as a fashion designer. I have very fond memories and keep her very close in my heart."" As for the town's various tributes - which include wine, slippers and honey as well as the culinary offerings - Nena believes they are in keeping with the Sevnica spirit. ""They are very sympathetic and sweet - none of them are bad things - and it's also funny. I think it's still within limits - all in all it's sweet and nice."" Rather like Sevnica itself, perhaps.

"Kidney, eggs, blood...","Tracey Jolliffe is calling on others to give a kidney Tracey Jolliffe has already donated a kidney, 16 eggs and 80 pints of blood, and intends to leave her brain to science. She is now hoping to give away part of her liver to a person she may never meet. ""If I had another spare kidney, I'd do it again,"" Tracey tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. She is what is known as an ""altruistic donor"" - someone willing to give away an organ to potentially help save the life of a complete stranger. A microbiologist in the NHS, and the daughter of two nurses, she has spent her life learning about the importance of healthcare from a professional standpoint. But she has also been keen to make a difference on a personal level. ""I signed up to donate blood, and to the bone marrow register, when I was 18,"" she says. Now 50, her wish to donate has become gradually more expansive. In 2012, she was one of fewer than 100 people that year to donate a kidney without knowing the recipient's identity - and now supports the charity Give A Kidney, encouraging others to do the same. As of 30 September 2016, 5,126 people remain on the NHS kidney transplant waiting list. About 3,000 kidney transplants are carried out each year Tracey's kidney donation, in all likelihood, will have saved someone's life. ""I remind myself of it every day when I wake up,"" she says, rightly proud of her life-changing actions. It was not, however, a decision taken on the spur of a moment. Donating a kidney is an ""involved process"", she says, with suitability assessments taking at least three months to complete. Tests leading up to the transplant include X-rays, heart tracing and a special test of kidney function, which involves an injection and a series of blood tests. ""It is not something to do if you're scared of needles,"" she jokes. The risks associated with donating, however, are relatively low for those deemed healthy enough to proceed, with a mortality rate of about one in 3,000 - roughly the same as having an appendix removed. Compared with the general public, NHS Blood and Transplant says, most kidney donors have equivalent - or better - life expectancy than the average person. Tracey says she was in hospital for five days after her operation but felt ""back to normal"" within six weeks. More than 53,000 people in the UK are being treated for kidney failure 90% of people on the transplant list are waiting for a kidney, with 3,000 kidney transplants carried out each year Unlike many other types of organ donation, it is possible to donate a kidney while still alive because we need only one kidney to survive The average waiting time for a kidney transplant is three to four years 60% of recipients of live donor kidneys can expect to survive for about 15 years Source: Kidney Research UK,external As well as helping to save lives - including through 80 pints worth of blood donations - Tracey has also helped families create them too. She has donated 16 of her eggs, allowing three couples to have children. It was a simple decision to take, she says. ""I have no desire to have children of my own, so I thought, 'I'm healthy, why not?'"" The next step, she hopes, could be to donate part of her liver - once again, to someone she has never met. But she is aware of the dangers involved. ""It's a much riskier operation than donating your kidney,"" she says. The rate of death for those donating the right lobe is estimated at one in 200. For the left lobe, it is one in 500. But many donators live a long and healthy life, with the organ having an ""amazing capacity to regenerate"", as Tracey describes it. Almost immediately after an operation, the remaining liver begins to enlarge in a process known as hypertrophy, continuing for up to eight weeks. Brain tissue is a vital research resource Tracey will undoubtedly continue to donate for as long as she can - and is hoping to pass on her organs once she dies. ""I signed up to donate my brain for medical science when I go,"" she says. Brain donations are usually performed within 24 hours of death, to be used for medical research into conditions such as dementia. Taking such decisions can be difficult, but Tracey says her friends and family ""accept I'm going to do what I want to do"". Her reasons for donating organs - whether it be a brain or a kidney - are both humbling and understated. ""I think it's part of my nature, my opportunity to do something nice,"" she says. But the difference such decisions can make to others is huge. For information on how to make a living donation, visit theNHS Blood and Transplant,externalwebsite.

Trump and the nuclear codesWhat Melania Trump's hometown tells us about herSeeds of a Trump-Republican conflict,"On 20 January, inauguration day in the United States, a nameless, unknown military aide was seen accompanying President Barack Obama to the handover ceremony at the US Capitol in Washington. That military aide was carrying a satchel over his or her shoulder containing a briefcase known as ""the nuclear football"". Inside was a piece of digital hardware measuring 3in (7.3cm) by 5in, known as ""the biscuit"". This contained the launch codes for a strategic nuclear strike. The briefing for the incoming president on how to activate them had already taken place out of public sight, but the moment President-elect Donald Trump took the oath of office that aide, and the satchel, moved quietly over to his side. From then on, Donald Trump has had sole authority to order an action that could result in the deaths of millions of people in under an hour. The question on a lot of people's minds is, given his thin skin and impulsive temperament, what are the safeguards, if any, to prevent an impetuous decision by one man with catastrophic consequences? First off, it should be said that Donald Trump has previously rowed back on some of his earlier, provocative comments on the use of nuclear weapons. He stated he would be ""the last person to use them"", although he did not rule it out. Donald Trump: US must greatly expand nuclear capabilities Russia's top spin doctor in nuclear warning North Korea's nuclear programme: How advanced is it? Other senior figures are also involved in the chain of command, such as the US Secretary of Defence, retired US Marine Gen James Mattis, But Mark Fitzpatrick, a nuclear non-proliferation expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Washington, says that ultimately, the sole authority to launch a strike rests with the president. ""There are no checks and balances on the president's authority to launch a nuclear strike,"" he says. ""But between the time he authorises one and the time it's carried out there are other people involved."" The idea of a rogue president taking such a monumental decision on his own is unrealistic. He gives the order and the secretary of defence is constitutionally obliged to carry it out. The secretary of defence could, in theory, refuse to obey the order if he had reason to doubt the president's sanity, but this would constitute mutiny and the president can then fire him and assign the task to the deputy secretary of defence. Donald Trump says the US should ""greatly strengthen and expand"" its nuclear capabilities Under the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution a vice-president could, in theory, declare the president mentally incapable of taking a proper decision, but he would need to be backed by a majority of the cabinet. So how would it work in practice? Inside that briefcase, the ""nuclear football"" that never leaves the president's side, is a ""black book"" of strike options for him to choose from once he has authenticated his identity as commander-in-chief, using a plastic card. Washington folklore has it that a previous president temporarily mislaid his identification card when he left it inside a jacket that was sent to the dry cleaners. Once the president has selected his strike options from a long-prepared ""menu"", the order is passed via the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Pentagon's war room and then, using sealed authentication codes, on to US Strategic Command HQ in Offutt Airbase in Nebraska. The order to fire is transmitted to the actual launch crews using encrypted codes that have to match the codes locked inside their safes. This video can not be played Which countries have nuclear weapons? The US and Russia both possess enough nuclear missiles to destroy each other's cities several times over - there are reported to be 100 US nuclear warheads aimed at Moscow alone. The two countries' arsenals account for more than 90% of the world's total number of nuclear warheads. As of September 2016 Russia had the most, with an estimated 1796 strategic nuclear warheads, deployed on a mixed platform of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and strategic bombers. Under a programme ordered by President Vladimir Putin, Moscow has recently invested billions of roubles in upgrading its strategic nuclear missile force, keeping an arsenal of constantly mobile ballistic missiles travelling through tunnels deep beneath the forests of Siberia. America had, in September 2016, 1,367 strategic nuclear warheads, similarly deployed in land-based underground missile silos, which by their static nature are vulnerable to a first strike, at sea onboard submarines, where they are harder to detect, and at airbases, where they can be loaded on to bombers. The UK has about 120 strategic warheads, of which only a third are deployed at sea. The Royal Navy always keeps a portion of the nation's Trident nuclear force somewhere in the world's oceans, maintaining what is known as the continuous at sea deterrent. The Topol is one of Russia's mobile ICBMs ICBMs travel at a speed of over 17,000mph (Mach 23), flying high above the Earth's atmosphere before descending towards their pre-programmed targets at four miles a second. The flight-time for land-based missiles flying between Russia and the US is between 25 and 30 minutes. For submarine-based missiles, where the boats may be able to approach a coast covertly, the flight time could be considerably shorter, even as little as 12 minutes. This does not leave a president much time to decide whether it is a false alarm or imminent Armageddon. Once ICBMs have been launched they cannot be recalled, but if they remain in their silos they will probably be destroyed by the inbound attack. A former senior White House official told me recently that much would depend on the circumstances in which a nuclear strike was being considered. If this was a long-term, measured policy decision to say, carry out a pre-emptive strike on country X, then a lot of people would be involved. The vice-president, National Security Adviser, and much of the cabinet would all be likely to be included in the decision-making process. But if there was an imminent strategic threat to the United States, i.e. if an inbound launch of ICBMs from a hostile state had been detected and were minutes from reaching the US then, he said, ""the president has extraordinary latitude to take the sole decision to launch.""

Oldest gorilla in captivity dies at 60,"At 60, Colo outlived most captive gorillas by more than two decades The oldest known gorilla to be born in captivity, a female named Colo, has died in the US aged 60. Colo passed away in her sleep overnight at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio, less than a month after celebrating her birthday. She was born at the zoo in December 1956 and is believed to be the first gorilla ever born in captivity. Colo, a Western lowland gorilla, lived for more than 20 years longer than the average captive gorilla. Despite recently having a malignant tumour removed, zookeepers said that she had been recovering well and the cause of her death had yet to be determined. Columbus Zoo and Aquarium said in a statement that Colo was ""an ambassador for gorillas"" who ""inspired people to learn more about the critically endangered species"". This video can not be played Colo the gorilla enjoys her birthday cake ""Colo touched the hearts of generations of people who came to see her and those that cared for her over her long lifetime,"" the statement read. The zoo added that Colo is to be cremated, with her ashes buried on site. In December, hundreds of people visited Columbus Zoo and Aquarium to sing Happy Birthday and watch Colo, a great-great grandmother, enjoy her cake. America's oldest gorilla celebrates birthday.

McCoy 'put on two stone' since retirement,"Sir Tony McCoy confessed to a weakness for chocolate biscuits Jockey Sir Tony McCoy has put on two stone since he retired and has admitted eating ""whole packets"" of biscuits while watching TV at night. The 42-year-old, who remains the most successful jump jockey of all time,bowed out of the sport in April 2015. He spent decades dieting to keep trim for races and once said hisChristmas dinner consisted of just 597 calories. He now confesses to a weakness for chocolate biscuits but said a recent health check has made him rethink. ""There's nights I would eat the whole packet... it is not something I am proud of,"" McCoy said. ""For someone that had pretty good willpower it is not anywhere near as good as it used to be."" During his racing career, McCoy skipped dinner several nights a week to maintain his thin frame McCoy, from Moneyglass, County Antrim, was renowned for his determination and dedication over the course of his record-breaking career. Hewon more than 4,000 races, and was crowned champion jockey 20 years in a row. Keeping hold of that crown involved keeping his body weight well below what would be considered average for a man of his height - 5ft 10in (1.8m) He maintained a thin frame of about 10 st 3lbs (65kg) with a punishing regime of meagre portions - often missing dinner three nights a week - and hot baths to sweat off the pounds. Life has been sweeter since he retired, but McCoy will now revert to watching his diet after a recent health check warned of the risks of high cholesterol and blood sugar. ""When I was racing I was unhealthy looking,"" he said. ""Everybody tells me now I am healthy looking but yet there are things I need to keep an eye on like my cholesterol, the possibility of diabetes."" In 2013, McCoy posed with his trophy marking his 4000th career victory Back in 2010, his low-calorie Christmas dinner consisted of three thinly sliced pieces of turkey breast, a spoonful of cabbage, three Brussels sprouts, a splash of gravy and a small lemonade. ""I never mind having a frugal Christmas dinner as I'm always looking forward to some great rides on Boxing Day,"" he said at the time. ""What I do enjoy is seeing Mick Fitzgerald and Carl Llewellyn loosening their belts before they struggle home. I just can't imagine bursting out of my clothes like those two do."" The retired champion may have needed to pile on a few pounds, but McCoy now intends to monitor his food intake as ""prevention is so much better than any cure"". ""I spent all my life dieting but it is something I actually do need,"" he said. ""Because my body was so used to that I cannot really let my lifestyle change too much. I am two stone heavier than I was a year and a half ago."" A 'first' Christmas dinner for AP McCoy Timeline of Tony McCoy's career Arise Sir Anthony - McCoy is knighted.

Made in Hull," 10 January 2017 ‘I am so proud that my birthplace Hull has won #cityofculture’, tweeted an excited Isy Suttie, who is best known for her performance as nerd girl Dobby inPeep Show, and her talent for comedy songs. She is also a huge fan of Hull Truck theatre, and one of her favourite local hangouts is ‘the Chinese restaurant that John Prescott likes’. The comedian sings a song about her love for a boy called Sam, which she wrote around the same time she first read Adrian Mole. Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella (The English Patient,Cold Mountain) had his first foray into film-making during his third year at Hull University. While writing a musical - likely his adaptation ofMobius the Stripper- he borrowed the drama department’s Bolex camera and shot his first scene in a local park. Minghella’s work will be celebrated with aseries of screenings and eventsas part of the City of Culture year. Although they shot to fame backing up Ziggy Stardust, The Spiders From Mars were once The Rats from Hull. The Rats, aka Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick ‘Woody’ Woodmansey, had years of experience gigging around the local pubs in various bands before their paths would cross with Bowie, with Ronson becoming one of his key musical collaborators. Woody Woodmansey will be performing liveThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy StardustandThe Spiders From Marsat Hulllater this year, and aseries of screeningswill also give a retrospective on the band. Reece Shearsmith recounts that growing up in Hull, his mother would always nag at him to stop reading and watching television; 'go outside and play in the sunshine', she’d say. Turns out his indoorsy nature paid off, as it shaped him into one of the critically-acclaimed writers behindPsychoville,Inside No. 9and award-winning seriesThe League of Gentlemen. Award-winning poet and novelist Stevie Smith was born in Hull in 1902, before moving away at the age of three. Her mother died when Stevie was a teenager, prompting her stalwart, no-nonsense aunt - Smith referred to her as ‘The Lion of Hull’ – to move in and look after her. Poets WH Auden and Stevie Smith together in an Edinburgh pub during the 1965 International Festival. Turner’s Furniture on Beverley Road boasted the cheeky slogan ‘Everything But The Girl’ in the 1980s; little did they suspect that Hull University students Ben Watt and Tracey Thorn would adopt it as the name for their band, which would find success with hits likeEach And Every OneandMissing. How Everything But The Girl came to cover The Smiths with Jeff Buckley at Glastonbury. The veteran actor, known for films such asThe Loneliness of the Long Distance RunnerandBilly Liar, was born and raised in Hull and is famously a huge fan of Hull City Football Club. In fact, his passion is so contagious that it affected hisDoctor Zhivagoco-star Omar Sharif when the pair shared a flat in the 1960s; Sharif remained a huge Tigers fan for the rest of his life. Sir Tom Courtenay reads Philip Larkin's First Sight. The acclaimed film, theatre and television actress is Hull to the core; born and raised there, she performed in radio seriesTo Hull and Backand her daughter is named after Amy Johnson, another Hull heroine, who was the first woman to fly solo from Britain to Australia. Andrew Motion, former Poet Laureate, was also known for his prize-winning biography of Philip Larkin, who he worked with at Hull University. Motion taught English, Larkin was the librarian; the pair first met in the staff bar, when Larkin choked on his beer and Motion found himself clapping him on the back to help him recover. Ice suitably broken, they quickly became good friends. After inheriting his father’s flour mill, J. Arthur Rank used his wealth to become Britain’s most influential film mogul. By the late 1940s, The Rank Organisation owned Pinewood and Ealing Studios, and was behind classics such asBlack Narcissus,The Red Shoes, andBrief Encounter– and his ‘Charm School’ for aspiring actors started the careers of Christopher Lee, Joan Collins and many others.

Tuesday blues," Monday 16th January 2017 This time last year, we publishedan articlewith a similar title to this one, and also featuring six episodes ofSoul Music- the long-runningRadio 4series that examines a song or piece of music that's had a powerful emotional impact on musicians and listeners alike. Perhaps because it was the week of so-called Blue Monday - theadmittedly suspectidea that the third Monday in January is the most depressing day of the year - the article captured your imaginations. It was widely shared from the social media accounts ofBBC Music,Radio 4,Radio 2and6 Music, with hundreds of you telling us which songs make you cry, and for what reasons. We read your comments and were moved by them, so here are six more episodes of Soul Music - all on pieces of music that you told us you find solace in at difficult times. [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music: Bridge Over Troubled Water In your comments last year, two songs were mentioned more than any others -Johnny Cash's 2002 cover ofNine Inch Nails' Hurt, which has yet to be have an episode of Soul Music made about it, andSimon & Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water from 1970. What is it about the latter that affects us so profoundly? Paul Gambaccini places the song in its historical context - along with songs like The Beatles' Let It Be, it seemed to mark the end of the youthful idealism of the 1960s - and looks at how the song is about both vulnerability (""When you're weary, feeling small,"" it begins) and security (""I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough""). Bridge Over Troubled Water Simon & Garfunkel [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music: The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face gets the instant sound-off button,"" Radio 2 listener Jane told us, the suggestion being that she can't help but sob if she hears it. The 1957 folk song about first love, first borns and loss was written byEwan MacCollforPeggy Seeger, who later became his wife, and then became an international Grammy-winning hit forRoberta Flackin 1972. In the above episode, Peggy and Ewan's biographer Ben Harker explain its history before we hear two extraordinarily moving stories about what the song means to two people. [WATCH] Peggy sings the song in 1990, shortly after Ewan had died [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music: Shipbuilding Another track that was repeatedly mentioned in your lists of songs that make you weep was 1982's Shipbuilding, written byElvis Costelloand Clive Langer forRobert Wyatt. ""Every time,"" said 6 Music listener Sian, and we perfectly understand why. The mix of tenderness, nostalgia and political ire is hugely effective. On hand in this episode to place the song in context of the early 1980s and, specifically, the Falklands War is MP Alan Johnson, who tells us it makes him cry, and Clive Langer. Philosopher Richard Ashcroft says it's a kind of secular hymn adding, ""If you don't like the song, it's going to be hard for me to be your friend, because I think it's so important and so moving."" Shipbuilding Robert Wyatt BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music: (Something Inside) So Strong ""Always gets me,"" said Radio 4 listener Claire about the 1984Labi Siffreclassic (Something Inside) So Strong, a song that Labi reveals here was inspired by two things - watching a TV documentary on apartheid in South Africa and by the oppression he had experienced as a gay man. The episode begins with Pete Churchill, musical director of The Choir With No Name in Birmingham, made up of homeless singers, explaining how the song is about ""the strength of the human spirit, not being defeated, carrying on and having pride"". We also find out that Nelson Mandela was a fan of the song and that Labi sang it to help him ""reconstruct"" himself after the death of his partner of almost 50 years in 2013. (Something Inside) So Strong Labi Siffre [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music: You'll Never Walk Alone TheRodgersandHammersteinsong You'll Never Walk Alone from 1945 musical Carousel ended the first-ever series of Soul Music in January 2001 and was a pick for a tear-jerker from many of you. In this fascinating discussion of the song, presented by composer Carl Davis, it's spoken of as being ""a humanist anthem with this message to walk on through the wind, to walk on through the storm"" and a kind of hymn that's ""almost as if it's always existed"". Famously, it became an anthem for fans of Liverpool FC afterGerry & The Pacemakershad a hit with the song in 1963. ""When I go to the match and they [the fans] sing Walk Alone,"" says Gerry Marsden, ""I still get goose pimples - it's a wonderful feeling."" You'll Never Walk Alone Gerry & The Pacemakers [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Soul Music: Spiegel im Spiegel Finally, not a song but a piece of modern classical music - Estonia composerArvo Pärt's Spiegel im Spiegel from 1978 - which 6 Music listener Sam called ""a pure masterpiece of two emotions chasing each other"". It's a sparse, tranquil piece for piano and violin that conjures up deep emotions - a seemingly simple composition, but as violinistTasmin Littlesays here, it's very hard to perform because the playing has to be perfect, or the mood is lost. And it's a piece that appeals to people who wouldn't necessarily call themselves classical music fans. The episode begins with a mother explaining how her daughter had introduced her to Spiegel im Spiegel; a week later, the daughter was killed in the 1998 Omagh bombing in Northern Ireland and the piece profoundly moved her family and friends when played at the funeral.

Jeremy Bowen: Families return to the ghost towns of East Aleppo,"The Syrian army seized East Aleppo from the rebels in December For the people who have returned to the ruins of East Aleppo the old phrase ""there's no place like home"" has a whole new meaning. The eastern side of Aleppo has been pulverised. Running water and mains power are a memory. It is hard to find a building that is not badly damaged. Many look as if they could collapse at any time. Rubble from the buildings that were flattened by artillery fire, barrel bombs or air strikes block many of the streets. Dozens of bulldozers have been working for more than a month to clear a path through the debris. Jeremy Bowen: A walk through Aleppo Aleppo: Before and after images Why is there a war in Syria? East Aleppo remains a deeply inhospitable environment. But the UN estimates that 40,000 people so far, and more every day, have decided to come back here. They are moving into their old homes or unoccupied buildings that look as if they might do, for a while at least. Abu Hussein, a man in his 50s, was remarkably cheerful as he stood with his wife Umm Hussein and looked down from their balcony on to the rubble that makes his street impassable for any vehicle. ""Nothing is better or more beautiful than our home,"" he said. ""It's the place to be in good times or in bad."" Abu Hussein and Umm Hussein have returned to a shell of a home His family's flat is in Shaar, one of the poorest quarters in East Aleppo. The area is made up mainly of cramped concrete tenements five or six stories high - at least those still standing. In Abu Hussein's street, some buildings have collapsed in on themselves. Others have had the fronts ripped off, like dolls' houses in a nightmare, exposing beds still made up with sheets and blankets, and sofas teetering close to falling into the street. The street where the Husseins live is impassable for any vehicle Abu Hussein said he was happy because he was home, even though his flat was dark and cold. His wife cooks on a small charcoal grill on the stairwell. The glass in the windows has gone. It is so well ventilated that the dank mist of a winter's evening seeped in. He had spent much of last year with his in-laws, he said, and the sooner they tried to make a go of it back home the better. This video can not be played Syrian conflict: What's left of Aleppo's Great Mosque? Abu Hussein and his wife have a two-year-old son who is still with her parents. They have no jobs, and the small amount of money they had saved went long ago. ""Of course we have hope,"" Umm Hussein said. ""We'll rebuild and we'll find a solution."" They left East Aleppo two days before the start last year of the major offensive by the Syrian army, backed by Russia and Iran, which by Christmas had beaten the rebels and reunited the city. During the years when the east was isolated, then besieged, it was possible to cross to government-controlled West Aleppo. Abu Hussein said the trip, which now takes 15 minutes, was possible for anyone who was prepared to take a 17-hour journey through territory controlled by Syria's galaxy of armed groups, including the rebel Free Syrian Army, Kurdish militias, the jihadists of so-called Islamic State, and the armed forces of the Syrian government. The United Nations, which spent more than $200m (Â£162m) on relief work in Aleppo last year, is particularly concerned that the poor in Shaar have come back out of desperation to a place that is still dangerous. Relief agencies have put water tanks in the streets. Children struggle through mud and rubble to help their families by carrying water home. Much of East Aleppo remains a ghost town The east was bombed into submission by Syrian government forces and their Russian backers Aleppo has changed since the government and its allies won the battle for the city last month. It no longer feels like a wartime city. Outgoing artillery fire is still a steady drumbeat, aimed at rebel front lines that are not far away. The country is at war. But Aleppo's war is over. In the ruins, people are thinking about the future. Slowly but steadily, some of Syria's millions of displaced people are returning, desperate or optimistic, or both. Aleppo, one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities, was Syria's largest before the war began in 2011 Large areas of the east side of the city are ghost towns, but there is every chance that more returnees will come back looking for a home once the weather gets warmer in the spring. The battle for Aleppo was the most decisive of the war. It is a long time since the war was merely a contest between President Bashar al-Assad and armed groups who wanted to destroy the regime. So many foreign powers have intervened that this has become an international conflict. Syria has layers of war and not all of them are about the future of the Assad regime. The intervention of Russia and Iran tipped the balance in Aleppo. Mr Assad and his allies can, for the first time, smell victory. Foreigners, not Syrians, are setting the pace. And at the moment it looks as if foreign powers will dictate how the war ends.

Martin Bashir: 'Unity' call on Reformation anniversary,"A statue of Martin Luther in Wittenberg, where the Protestant Reformation began The Church of England has said Protestants should ""repent of their part in perpetuating divisions"" - 500 years after the Reformation began the split from the Roman Catholic Church in Europe. A statement from the Archbishops of Canterbury and York has said the split caused ""lasting damage"" to the unity of the Church - something that contradicted the teaching of Jesus and left a ""legacy of mistrust and competition"". It went on to say: ""Such repentance needs to be linked to action aimed at reaching out to other churches and strengthening relationships with them."" Coming during the annual Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, it is a further sign that these two Churches are seeking to repent of past failings and find more ways in which they might work together. The historic rupture, which began in October 1517 when the German monk Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door of Wittenberg Cathedral, led to centuries of violence, where rulers of one Church would frequently execute communicant members of the other. The Archbishop of Canterbury the Most Reverend Justin Welby Last October, Pope Francis and the Archbishop of Canterbury presided at a service in Rome that was held on the fiftieth anniversary of the historic summit between Pope Paul VI and Archbishop Michael Ramsey, which established the Anglican Centre in Rome. In a joint declaration issued after the service in October, the two leaders said they were ""undeterred"" from seeking unity between the two denominations. While the Archbishops of Canterbury and York embrace the theological distinctives that arose out of the Reformation, specifically Martin Luther's emphasis on Christian salvation being through faith and not by merit or effort, they regret the bloodshed that followed that historic rupture in 1517. It is worth noting that both Churches always mark 4 May as a day for Reformation Martyrs, with the Church of England praying that 'those who have been divided on earth may be reconciled in heaven'. Today's statement is a call to all Christians, of whatever denomination, to repent of division and to unite within the Christian Gospel. Correction 18 January 2017: This report has been amended to remove a suggestion that the Church had apologised for events following the Reformation.

Weighing it up,"Trade makes the world go round, but how free can it remain? Free trade is something of a sacred cow in the economics profession. Moving towards it, rather slowly, has also been one of the dominant features of the post-World War Two global economy. Now there are new challenges to that development. The UK is leaving the European Union and the single market - though in her speech this week, British Prime Minister Theresa May promised topush for the ""freest possible trade"" with European countriesand to sign new deals with others around the world. Most obviously Donald Trump has raised the possibility of quitting various trade agreements, notably Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. Even the World Trade Organization (WTO) has proposed new barriers to imports. In Europe, trade negotiations with the United States and Canada have run into difficulty, reflecting public concerns about the impact on jobs, the environment and consumer protection. The WTO's Doha Round of global trade liberalisation talks has run aground. The World Trade Organization is based in Geneva and came into being in 1995 The case for trade without government imposed barriers has a long history in economics. Adam Smith, the 18th Century Scottish economist who many see as the founding father of the subject, was in favour of it. But it was a later British writer, David Ricardo in the 19th Century, who set out the idea known ascomparative advantage,externalthat underpins much of the argument for freer trade. It is not about countries being able to produce more cheaply or efficiently than others. You can have a comparative advantage in making something even if you are less efficient than your trade partner. When a country shifts resources to produce more of one good there is what economists call an ""opportunity cost"" in terms of how much less of something else you can make. You have a comparative advantage in making a product if the cost in that sense is less than it is in another country. Economic arguments over free trade date back to the 19th Century If two countries trade on this basis, concentrating on goods where they have a comparative advantage they can both end up better off. Another reason that economists tend to look askance at trade restrictions comes from an analysis of the impact if governments do put up barriers - in particular tariffs or taxes - on imports. There are gains of course. The firms and workers who are protected can sell more of their goods in the home market. But consumers lose out by paying a higher price - and consumers in this case can mean businesses, if they buy the protected goods as components or raw materials. The textbook analysis says that those losses add up to more than the total gains. So you get the textbook conclusion that it's best to avoid protection. Many lower-skilled workers in developed economies feel they have lost out in the drive to globalisation And this conclusion is regardless of what other countries do. The 19th Century French economist Frederic Bastiat set it out it like this: ""It makes no more sense to be protectionist because other countries have tariffs than it would to block up our harbours because other countries have rocky coasts."" The implication is that unilateral trade liberalisation makes perfect sense. A more recent theory of what drives international trade looks at what are called economies of scale - where the more a firm produces of some good, the lower cost of each unit. The associated specialisation can make it beneficial for economies that are otherwise very similar to trade with one another. This area is known as new trade theory and the Nobel Prize winnerPaul Krugman,externalwas an important figure in developing it. The basic idea that it's good to have freer trade has underpinned decades of international co-operation on trade policy since World War Two. Free trade has been a cornerstone of the post-war world The period since 1945 has been characterised by a gradual lowering of trade barriers. It happened in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which began life in 1948 as a forum for governments to negotiate lower tariffs. Its membership was initially small, but by the time it was replaced by the World Trade Organization in 1995, most countries had signed up. The motivation was to end or reduce the protectionism or barriers to trade that went up in the 1930s. It is not generally thought that those barriers caused the Great Depression, butmany do think they aggravated and prolonged it.,external The process of post-wartrade liberalisation,externalwas driven largely by a desire for reciprocal concessions - better access to others' markets in return for opening your own. But what is the case against free (or at least freer) trade? First and foremost is the argument that it creates losers as well as winners. What Ricardo's theory suggested was that all countries engaging in trade could be better off. But his idea could not address the question of whether trade could create losers as well as winners within countries. Economic theory says if governments adopt protectionism, total losses will outweigh total gains Work by two Swedish Nobel Prize winners, Eli Hecksher and Bertil Ohlin, subsequently built on by the American Paul Samuelson developed the basic idea of comparative advantage in a way that showed that trade could lead tosome groups losing out,external. Putting it very briefly, if a country has a relatively abundant supply of, for example, low-skilled labour, those workers will gain while their low-skilled counterparts in countries where it is less abundant will lose. There has been a debate about whether this approach fits the facts, but some do see it as a useful explanation of how American industrial workers (for example) have been adversely affected by the rise of competition from countries such as China. A group of economists includingDavid Autor,externalof the Massachusetts Institute of Technology looked at the impact on areas where local industry was exposed to what they call the China shock. ""Adjustment in local labour markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labour-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commences. At this week's World Economic Forum, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned against isolationist moves that could spark a trade war ""Exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income."" Still if you accept that overall countries gain, then the winners could in principle fully compensate the losers and still be better off. Such programmes do exist. Countries that have unemployment benefits provide assistance to people who have lost their jobs. Some of those people will have been affected by competition from abroad. The United States has a programme that is specially targeted for people who lose their jobs as a result of imports, called Trade Adjustment Assistance. But is it enough?Lawrence Mishel,externalof the Economic Policy Institute, a think-tank in Washington writes: ""The winners have never tried to fully compensate the losers, so let's stop claiming that trade benefits us all."" Which arguments will Donald Trump be listening to in the White House? In any case, it is not clear that compensation would do the trick. AsMark Carney,,externalthe Bank of England governor noted, they may lose their jobs and also ""the dignity of work"". He is keen on maintaining open markets for trade, but recognises the need to do something about what you might call the side effects. To return to recent political developments - Donald Trump clearly did get support from many of those people in areas of the US where industry has declined. We don't yet know how he will address those issues when he takes his place in the White House. Perhaps his threats to introduce new tariffs are just that - threats. But the post-war trend towards more liberalised international trade looks more uncertain than it has for many years.

Golden idea,"Charles Chen Yidan is putting his technology fortune back into education A Chinese technology billionaire is offering the world's most valuable education prize. The Yidan Prize will award nearly $8m (Â£6.64m) every year to two research projects that have the potential to ""transform"" global education. Charles Chen Yidan, who co-founded China's internet company, Tencent, wants to use the prize to scale up innovative education research projects and replicate them across the world. Universities, governments and think tanks have reacted enthusiastically to the prize, and leading US institutions like Harvard and MIT have already submitted several nominations. But the winner might not necessarily be a household name in education. Even a local project could win the prize, if it can prove it has been effective. ""As long as an idea is replicable in other regions, we can give them an award,"" says Mr Chen. Mr Chen, now aged 45, became one of China's richest men after co-founding Tencent in 1998. In 2013, he stepped down to focus on educational philanthropy. His interest in education came from his family. His grandmother was illiterate but insisted that Mr Chen's father got a good education. The internet billionaire founded Wuhan College, with an emphasis on more than exam grades Mr Chen himself studied applied chemistry as an undergraduate at Shenzhen University and took a master's degree in economic law at Nanjing University. His educational philosophy has also been shaped by the ""tremendous pressure"" he felt while studying for China's ""gaokao"" higher education entrance examinations. So he set up Wuhan College, a private university in China, which focuses on ""whole-person development"" rather than rote-learning and examinations. More stories from theBBC's Global education series,externallooking at education from an international perspective, andhow to get in touch. You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. The college aims to train talented students to join China's technology industry. Executives from Tencent helped to design the college's curriculum, recruit students and teach classes, so that its graduates are trained in the skills required by employers. But Mr Chen was frustrated that this college only reached a limited number of students. So he decided a global education prize would be the best way to improve education for millions of young people. Mr Chen, speaking on a tour of Europe to promote the prize to universities, governments, NGOs and think tanks, says he has already been inundated with nominations. He wants the prize to focus the attention of universities and governments on future trends in education. Looking for creativity: Fine art exam in Wuhan this autumn ""We find that no matter whether people come from a rich or developing country, in the east or the west, they are talking about similar concerns,"" says Mr Yidan. These are questions about children from rich families having the best access to education, and whether students in some countries face too many exams. The prize-winners will be chosen by an independent committee of educational experts led by Dr Koichiro Matsuura, former director-general of Unesco. They are looking for nominations that are innovative and sustainable, that reform existing educational structures, and that respond to what might be the future challenges for education. But Mr Chen also has his own ideas about how to improve global education. Speaking through a translator but occasionally breaking into English to reinforce a point, he said he wants to find ways to make the most of the expertise of retired teachers. Mr Yidan, launching the prize, called for better use of the talents of retired teachers ""They are a valuable resource that we need to make better use of,"" he says. He thinks that collecting ""big data"" on students can improve the education that individual students receive. ""By analysing big data, we can find bespoke ways to help pupils in need,"" he says. Unsurprisingly for the co-founder of an internet company, he believes that technology will transform education. This latest education prize is now the most valuable. The Global Teacher Prize, run by the Varkey Foundation, gives $1m (Â£830,000) annually to a teacher who has made an ""outstanding contribution"" to education. The Broad Prize for Urban Education, which ran from 2002 to 2014, gave $1m every year to a school district in the US that significantly improved the academic performance of low-income and minority students. The WISE Prize for education, supported by the Qatar Foundation, awards $500,000 (Â£415,000) to the winning laureate. But is a prize really the best way to improve education? Dan Sarofian-Butin, founding dean of the school of education and social policy at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, says that prize money can be a poor way of achieving change. ""Rather than give a one-off cash prize, I hope the Yidan Prize will nurture and sustain its winners over a period of years,"" he says. Hanan Al Hroub who teaches refugee children has been named as the world's best teacher ""If you look at the TV show Dragons' Den, or Shark Tank in the US, what the winners really get is not just the investment money from the sharks, but their expertise, their network of contacts and firms, their foot in the door with many companies, and their national exposure. ""Likewise, a really powerful education prize would create a mechanism that fostered exactly such mentoring, networking, and sustainability."" Andreas Schleicher, education director at the OECD, welcomes the Yidan Prize as an incentive for innovation in education. ""When we surveyed teachers, less than a quarter of them said they would be recognised for greater levels of innovation,"" he said. ""The highly industrial and compliance-based organisation of education generally means that even where good ideas are generated, they don't scale and spread."" Nominations close at the end of March,externaland the winners will be announced in September.

Voice trouble,"Our voices can tell us more than we think Our voices are amazing things. We can use them to sing, shout and whisper sweet nothings. We can use them to activate gadgets andprove who we are to banks. And now researchers believe they can also reveal whether we're getting ill. A US start-up called Canary Speech is developing a way of analysing conversations using machine learning to test for a number of neurological and cognitive diseases, ranging from Parkinson's to dementia. The project was born out of a painful personal experience for the firm's co-founder Henry O'Connell. ""It has been my pleasure to have as a friend for nearly 30 years a dear gentleman who was diagnosed six years ago with Parkinson's disease,"" says Mr O'Connell. ""My friend was told when the diagnosis was finally made that it was likely that he had been suffering from Parkinson's for over 10 years."" As with so many diseases, early diagnosis can play a crucial role in effectively managing the condition, but recent research highlights the difficulties in correctly diagnosing it, with doctors often struggling to distinguish the symptoms. And the longer the condition goes undiagnosed, the more severe the symptoms become. Parkinson's disease symptoms include tremors, difficulty moving and speech problems ""During the years before his diagnosis was accurately made, my friend, suffering from muscle and apparent nerve-related pain, was treated in several medical facilities,"" says Mr O'Connell. ""The muscle and nerve-related pain were directly associated with a progressing Parkinson's illness. Because it went undiagnosed, proper treatment was delayed and his Parkinson's progressed potentially more rapidly than it would have under proper diagnosis and treatment."" Canary Speech developed algorithms after examining the speech patterns of patients with particular conditions, includingAlzheimer's, dementia andParkinson's. This enabled them to spot a number of tell-tale signs both pre and post-diagnosis, including the kinds of words used, their phrasing, and the overall quality of speech. For instance, one symptom of the disease is a softening of the voice - something than can be easily overlooked by those close to us. But Canary Speech's software is capable of picking up such small changes in speech patterns. Fellow co-founder Jeff Adams was previously chief executive at Yap, the company bought by Amazon and whose technology subsequently formed the core of the tech giant's voice-activated Echo speaker. Some studies suggest our speech patterns can give an early indication of Alzheimer's disease The overall goal is to be able to spot the onset of these conditions considerably sooner than is currently possible.  In initial trials, the software was used to provide real-time analysis of conversations between patients and their clinicians. As with so many machine learning-based technologies, it will improve as it gains access to more data to train the algorithms that underpin it. And as more voice-activated devices come on to the market and digital conversations are recorded, the opportunities to analyse all this data will also increase. Some researchers have analysed conversations between patients and drug and alcohol counsellors, for example, to assess the degree of empathy the therapists were displaying. ""Machine learning and artificial intelligence has a major role to play in healthcare,"" says Tony Young, national clinical lead for innovation at NHS England. ""You only have to look at the rapid advancements made in the last two years in the translation space.  Machine learning won't replace clinicians, but it will help them do things that no humans could previously do."" It is easy to see how such technology could be applied to teaching and training scenarios. Voice analysis is also being used in commercial settings. For instance, tech start-up Cogito, which emerged from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, analyses the conversations taking place between customer service staff and customers. They monitor interactions in real time. Their machine learning software compares the conversation with its database of successful calls from the past. The team believes that it can provide staff with real-time feedback on how the conversation is going, together with advice on how to guide things in a better direction - what it calls ""emotional intelligence"". Cogito's software gives real-time tips to customer service staff as they talk to customers These tips can include altering one's tone or cadence to mirror that of the customer, or gauging the emotions on display to try to calm the conversation down. It's even capable of alerting the supervisor if it thinks that greater authority would help the conversation reach a more positive conclusion. The advice uses the same kind of behavioural economics used so famously by the UK government's Behavioural Insights Team, also known as the Nudge Unit. Early customers of Cogito's product, including Humana, Zurich and CareFirst BlueCross, report an increase in customer satisfaction of around 20%. As the internet of things spreads its tentacles throughout our lives, voice analysis will undoubtedly be added to other biometric ways of authenticating ourselves in a growing number of situations. Google's Project Abacus, for example, is dedicated to killing passwords, given that 70% of us apparently forget them every month. It plans to use our speech patterns - not just what we say but how we say it - in conjunction with other behavioural data, such as how we type, to build up a more reliable picture of our identity. Our smartphones will know who we are just by the way we use them. The big - silent - elephant in the room is how all this monitoring and analysis of our voices will impact upon our right to privacy.

SportAFC Wimbledon 1-3 Sutton United17 January 2017 (23:13:24),"This video can not be played FA Cup: AFC Wimbledon 1-3 Sutton United highlights Non-league Sutton set up a glamorous FA Cup fourth-round home tie against Leeds with a thrilling replay win at 10-man League One side AFC Wimbledon. The Dons made a perfect start when Tom Elliott rose above the away defence to nod in Dean Parrett's free-kick. But they were left a man down for more than 75 minutes as Paul Robinson was sent off for hauling down Matt Tubbs. Roarie Deacon's stunner levelled before late goals from Maxime Biamou and Dan Fitchett caused an upset. The National League side will host Leeds at Gander Green Lane on Sunday, 29 January (14:00 GMT). Follow all the reaction from Tuesday's FA Cup ties FA Cup results and fourth-round fixtures Listen: 'I dared not dream about this' This video can not be played Fitchett goal sparks wild scenes for Sutton Sutton were the lowest-ranked team left in the draw for the fourth round, but knew they had to overcome their near-neighbours - 51 places above them on the league ladder - before they could even think about hosting Championship promotion chasers Leeds in a money-spinning tie. The non-league club have reached the fourth round on two previous occasions, the last time coming in the 1988-89 season, when they memorably beat then-top flight opponents Coventry in the third round. But the reward for beating Wimbledon was worth much more to the Greater London club than that famous win 28 years ago. Sutton manager Paul Doswell compared winning the third-round replay to the Championship play-off final in terms of financial importance, estimating it would take their earnings from this cup run to about Â£500,000. This victory was more than just money. The jubilant celebrations from the away players and officials, plus their 300-odd travelling supporters, showed how much the victory meant. Leeds-born Tom Elliott put AFC Wimbledon ahead, but missed out on a tie against his home-city club Former Tottenham manager David Pleat on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: ""It was an extraordinary night. We thought fitness might tell - with Wimbledon the fitter side - but the one-man advantage was the major factor. ""It was a great start for Wimbledon, scoring that early goal, then the Robinson sending-off made it difficult for them. I though Sutton played too many high long balls and lacked creativity round the sides. ""Wimbledon coped with everything until that late, late surge."" Sutton manager Paul Doswellspoke of his ""unadulterated joy"" as The U's - 15th in the National League - set-up a home tie with Championship Leeds United. ""I'm so pleased for my chairman, our directors who are all volunteers, for the 1,000 fans here and for the players. ""Without being over-emotional about it, we have got a good chance against Leeds on our pitch. No one likes playing on it apart from us it seems. If they make seven or eight changes against us I think we will have a chance."" Dons boss Neal Ardleymeanwhile pointed unsurprisingly to the dismissal of Paul Robinson after 15 minutes as the key moment, though he added he had few complaints with the result. ""You prepare for the game with 11 men but for most of it we had 10,"" he said. ""Credit to Sutton, they kept going and got their just rewards in the end. ""But we'll never know what would have happened if it was 11 versus 11. It's a big judgement call, to say that is a cast-iron sending-off early in the game.
