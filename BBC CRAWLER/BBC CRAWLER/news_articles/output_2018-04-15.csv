"Woman stabbed to death in BrixtonMet Police say a woman believed to be in her 30s died of knife injuries, and a man has been arrested.15m16 minutes agoLondon","Forensics teams were outside the address in Sudbourne Road on Sunday evening A man in his 20s has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death in Brixton, south London on Sunday evening. Police were called by the ambulance service to an address in Sudbourne Road, where a woman believed to be in her 30s was found with stab wounds. Despite the efforts of paramedics, she was pronounced dead at the scene. Police say the woman's next of kin are aware and it is believed the victim and suspect knew each other. The Metropolitan Police say this appears to be a domestic incident, rather than part of a ""knife-crime epidemic"". The arrested man is in custody at a south London police station.

Stephen Lawrence's father forgives killers,"This video can not be played Neville Lawrence: ""I forgive them all for the murder of my son"" The father of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence says he has forgiven his son's killers, nearly 25 years after the attack. Dr Neville Lawrence said the decision had been ""one of the hardest things"", but he still wanted justice. The murder ""opened the country's eyes"" to racism, he added. Stephen, 18, was stabbed in an attack by five white youths on 22 April 1993, at a bus stop in south-east London. Two menwere jailed for life in 2012. Last week the Metropolitan Police said that, despite rigorous efforts, its inquiry was""unlikely to progress"". Police had previously apologised for failures in the investigation. A timeline of the Stephen Lawrence case 'I Don't take no for an answer' Speaking to the BBC, Dr Lawrence said he still felt the pain of his first child being ""murdered for senseless reasons"". But he said that while he wanted all the killers to face justice, he had forgiven them. Dr Lawrence, who now supports families of other murdered young people, said: ""It was one of the hardest things for me to say to myself, 'I forgive you for the murder of my son'."" He said forgiveness had made his life ""a long way better now"", and ""maybe if I had done it earlier it would have been better for me as well"". Stephen Lawrence was murdered on 22 April 1993 Gary Dobson was jailed for a minimum of 15 years and two months, and David Norris for 14 years and three months in January 2012. The pair were convicted after microscopic samples of Stephen Lawrence's DNA were found on the clothes they had been wearing in the attack. Three others were publicly named as suspects but police have said fresh prosecutions are unlikely unless new evidence is found. Dr Lawrence said the killers ""made my son into a legend"" and the impact the death had on British society was ""amazing"". He said: ""It has helped me because in a sense it is helping others. ""Although I've lost Stephen I've gained something else in that my son is not going to be forgotten."" Gary Dobson and David Norris received life sentences almost 20 years after they murdered Stephen Lawrence Mr Lawrence said it was not the legacy he would have wanted for his son: ""He wanted be an architect. ""I thought I would see quite a few buildings if he had qualified and I thought that was the way I was going to remember him, but unfortunately that is not the way."" The Met Police said it has reviewed the investigation but ""without new information [it] is unlikely to progress further"". Chris Le Pere, the senior investigator, said it was ""never too late"" for someone to ""do the right thing"" and come forward with information. Dr Lawrence said he accepted the police's decision but he did not want to see the case closed completely. He said: ""My son is in the ground in Jamaica. ""[The killers] have walked around, some of them for 25 years, the only time I was able to see anything of my son was going to his grave. ""You do something, you should pay for it."" Dr Lawrence has said he remains hopeful that - with the publicity around the 25th anniversary of his son's death and aBBC documentary to air this week- someone will come forward with information.

Officers hurt as prisoners 'trash wing',"The inmates climbed on to the safety netting of E Wing and refused to come down Inmates ""threw paint and smashed fire alarms"" during a disturbance at a young offenders institution. The Prison Service said four prison officers suffered minor injuries in the trouble at HMYOI Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. Inmates ""trashed"" E Wing in protest over a lack of showers and time out of their cells, the BBC was told. The Prison Service said: ""Offenders who behave in this way will be punished and may face extra time behind bars."" The young offenders institution houses young males with the longest sentences in England A woman whose partner is an inmate told the BBC some of the men had leapt on to the wing's safety netting and refused to come down. The source said her partner was not involved and went back to his cell. Another prisoner sent pictures of the disturbance from a banned mobile phone. ""There's a new regime and they aren't allowed any association during the week,"" she said. ""So they can shower and exercise but then have been locked up all week. They had one shower on Monday and nothing since. ""On Saturday they weren't allowed the weekend association where they can play pool, etc. This morning, they were allowed another shower but, when they were told they were going to be locked up again, with no explanation, lots of them refused to go back."" The inmates then ""trashed the wing"", the source said, adding ""they've thrown paint, smashed fire alarms and broken cameras"". Prisoners refused to go back to their cells on Sunday morning E Wing houses more than 70 young men aged up to 21 in the jail on Bierton Road. A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""Prison staff at HMYOI Aylesbury have successfully resolved a brief period of indiscipline today involving a small number of offenders on one wing."" They said the trouble was ""confined to one area of the prison"" and the rest of the site remained secure. Four prison officers were taken to hospital with minor injuries and have since returned to duty. Last July,seven prison officers and one inmate were injured in a ""brawl""at Aylesbury.

Starbucks 'sorry' over black men arrest,"Demonstrations took place outside the Starbucks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Sunday Coffee chain Starbucks has apologised after two black men were arrested while waiting for a friend at one of their shops in the US city of Philadelphia. Amateur video shows police placing the pair, who were accused by shop staff of trespassing, in handcuffs. The footage has been widely shared since it was posted on Twitter and has led to accusations of racial profiling. Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson said the video was ""hard to watch"" and that the actions taken were ""wrong"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. In the incident, which took place on Thursday evening, the two men were approached by the store manager and asked to leave after they requested the use of the toilet without making a purchase, police said. In response, the men told staff that they were waiting for a friend and refused to leave. Philadelphia police commissioner Richard Ross said his officers were right to carry out the arrest after staff told them the pair were causing a disturbance and trespassing. ""If a business calls and they say that someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business, they [the officers] now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties,"" Mr Ross said. In a statement released on Saturday,Mr Johnson expressed ""our deepest apologies"" to the two men involved in the incident,externaland said Starbucks would do ""whatever we can to make things right"". ""The video shot by customers is very hard to watch and the actions in it are not representative of our Starbucks mission and values,"" Mr Johnson said. He added that the call to the Philadelphia police department should not have been made on the ""basis"" of the events which took place beforehand. Black women wrongly accused of 'dine and dash' Does profiling make sense? However the footage of the incident, which has received nearly nine million views so far, sparked criticism and calls for a boycott of the Starbucks coffee store. On Sunday, people gathered outside the shop in protest. The company now plans to investigate its practices in order to ""prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again"", Mr Johnson said.

Corbyn wants proof Russia poisoned spy,"This video can not be played 'Absolute evidence' needed in Salisbury poisoning case Jeremy Corbyn wants to see ""incontrovertible evidence"" before blaming Russia for the poisoning of an ex-spy and his daughter in Salisbury. The Labour leader said it was ""clear"" the nerve agent used was ""very similar"" to those made in Russia - and Moscow should be challenged about this - but ""absolute"" proof was still needed. He also said the international chemical weapons watchdog needed greater powers. Boris Johnson said to deny Russian involvement was ""quite extraordinary"". Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on a park bench in Salisbury on 4 March. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Poisoned ex-spy's daughter leaves hospital Who is Sergei Skripal? The government says they were exposed to a military-grade nerve agent belonging to the Novichok group, and accuses Russia of being behind the poisoning. Russia denies any involvement. On Sunday, the Bishop of Salisbury called for a deeper and lasting solution to the diplomatic fallout between the UK and Russia, during a service of cleansing in the city centre. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has said itagrees with the UK's findings on the identityof the nerve agent. The UK's national security adviser has since said thatRussian intelligence agencies targeted Ms Skripal's emails as early as 2013, and that Moscow trained ""special units"" to use nerve agents. In a letter to Nato, Sir Mark Sedwill also accused Russia of testing assassination methods with chemical weapons, including using nerve agents smeared on to door handles. When asked on the Andrew Marr Show what it would take for Mr Corbyn to agree that the Russian state had committed the attack, he said: ""I want to see incontrovertible evidence of it. ""I am appalled and alarmed at the idea that anyone would use this nerve agent and clearly it was an attempt to murder the Skripals on British soil. ""Sadly it's not the [OPCW's] job to identify who made it or necessarily where it was made. I think we do need to strengthen the role of the OPCW in the future."" When asked whether he agreed with Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell that the poisoning was a state-sponsored assassination attempt, Mr Corbyn said: ""If we're going to make a very clear assertion like that we've got to have the absolute evidence to do it.""

He added that it was a ""blindness to reality that I find very perplexing, a defiant refusal to accept the Kremlin was responsible for this"". Sergei Skripal remains in hospital but his daughter Yulia has been discharged The Skripals are thought by police to have come into contact with the nerve agent on the front door handle of their home in Wiltshire. The Skripals and Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who was exposed to the Novichok when he was tending to the Skripals - were all treated at Salisbury District Hospital. The police officer and Ms Skripal, 33, have been discharged.Mr Skripal is ""still seriously ill"" but his condition is said to be improving. Areas of the city were cordoned off as special investigators collected samples to test for the nerve agent. On Sunday, the Bishop of Salisbury hosted a ""service of cleansing and celebration"" to symbolically reclaim the city for the common good. The Right Rev Nicholas Holtam said: ""It's a service in which we want to thank the community that have really carried Salisbury through this. ""For some it's had an impact in a whole variety of ways, it's had an impact on business, it's had an impact on people's mental health.""

Trump attacks Comey's memoir of 'lies',"Mr Trump called Mr Comey a ""slippery slimeball"" and the ""worst FBI director in history"" US President Donald Trump has attacked former FBI director James Comey over his ""many lies"", suggesting he be jailed over his testimony to Congress. ""Why did he lie to Congress (jail),"" Mr Trump said, adding: ""How come he gave up classified information (jail)."" He also criticised Mr Comey's forthcoming memoir, saying the ""badly reviewed book"" raises ""big questions"". His comments come ahead of an ABC News interview with Mr Comey to be aired on Sunday as part of his book tour. The book - A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership - reportedly paints an unflattering portrait of Mr Trump, who fired Mr Comey last year. Allow Twitter content?

He states that his assumption that Mrs Clinton would win the 2016 presidential election was a factor in reopening the inquiry shortly before the vote.

Prisoners 'trash wing' in riot,"The inmates climbed on to the safety netting of E Wing and refused to come down Inmates ""threw paint and smashed fire alarms"" during a disturbance at a young offenders institution. The Prison Service said four prison officers suffered minor injuries in the trouble at HMYOI Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. Inmates ""trashed"" E Wing in protest over a lack of showers and time out of their cells, the BBC was told. The Prison Service said: ""Offenders who behave in this way will be punished and may face extra time behind bars."" The young offenders institution houses young males with the longest sentences in England A woman whose partner is an inmate told the BBC some of the men had leapt on to the wing's safety netting and refused to come down. The source said her partner was not involved and went back to his cell. Another prisoner sent pictures of the disturbance from a banned mobile phone. ""There's a new regime and they aren't allowed any association during the week,"" she said. ""So they can shower and exercise but then have been locked up all week. They had one shower on Monday and nothing since. ""On Saturday they weren't allowed the weekend association where they can play pool, etc. This morning, they were allowed another shower but, when they were told they were going to be locked up again, with no explanation, lots of them refused to go back."" The inmates then ""trashed the wing"", the source said, adding ""they've thrown paint, smashed fire alarms and broken cameras"". Prisoners refused to go back to their cells on Sunday morning E Wing houses more than 70 young men aged up to 21 in the jail on Bierton Road. A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""Prison staff at HMYOI Aylesbury have successfully resolved a brief period of indiscipline today involving a small number of offenders on one wing."" They said the trouble was ""confined to one area of the prison"" and the rest of the site remained secure. Four prison officers were taken to hospital with minor injuries and have since returned to duty. Last July,seven prison officers and one inmate were injured in a ""brawl""at Aylesbury.

Israel destroys 'longest' Gaza tunnel,"The tunnel had been under observation for some time, Israel said The Israeli military has disabled a major tunnel dug by militants which reached into Israel from the Gaza Strip, officials say. Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said it was the longest and deepest tunnel of its kind Israel had discovered. A military spokesman said it had been dug since the 2014 Gaza war, when Israel destroyed more than 30 tunnels which it said were meant for attacks. Israel is using sophisticated measures to thwart tunnels dug by militants. Tunneling for Gaza's next war Who are Hamas? Military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said the tunnel had been dug by Hamas and began in the area of Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip. He said it penetrated several metres into Israel in the direction of Nahal Oz, but did not yet have an exit. The tunnel stretched ""several kilometres"" into Gaza and connected with other tunnels from which attacks could be launched, he said. Israel disabled the tunnel over the weekend, according to the military. ""We filled the tunnel with material that renders it useless for a very long period of time,"" Col Conricus said. It was the fifth Gaza tunnel to be destroyed by the Israeli military in recent months, Col Conricus said. Some of the tunnels have been built by Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad and others by Hamas, the Islamist group which controls Gaza. Since last year, Israel has been using special equipment to detect the presence of tunnels, andis building a hi-tech barrier above and below ground along its border with Gaza to prevent new tunnels being dug.

Arrests after five hurt in 'hit and run',"Those injured were taken to hospitals in London and Essex Two teenagers have been arrested after five pedestrians were hurt in a suspected hit-and-run crash in Essex. Emergency services were called to Furtherwick Road, Canvey Island, just before 16:15 BST on Saturday whena stolen BMW hit five men, all in their 20s. The teens, aged 17 and 18, have been arrested on suspicion of a number of offences including causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop after an accident. Three casualties remain in hospital. Essex Police said both suspects were in custody. The 17-year-old boy, from Canvey, was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop after an accident and driving while unfit through drink or drugs. The 18-year-old man, also from Canvey, was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving while unfit through drink or drugs, aggravated vehicle taking, theft of a motor vehicle, failing to stop after an accident, failing to report an accident and driving without insurance. A stolen BMW was abandoned at the scene of the crash, police said Rumours on social media that officers were chasing the BMW prior to the crash were ""incorrect"", a force spokeswoman said. ""Officers were in the area responding to an unrelated incident at the time and not to the presence of the BMW,"" she said. ""However, the matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Complaints (IOPC) under the criteria of there being an indirect link between police being in the area and the incident."" An IOPC spokesperson added: ""We have been notified by Essex Police of their referral in relation to this incident and an assessment will be carried out in due course to assess the level, if any, of our involvement."" None of the injuries sustained by the pedestrians is believed to be life-threatening, the police said. Following the crash, one man was airlifted to a hospital in London in a critical condition and another was airlifted with a potentially life-changing leg injury.

Manchester City won the Premier League title as Manchester United's shock 1-0 home defeat by West Brom confirmed their rivals as champions. Second-place United are now 16 points behind Pep Guardiola's side with only five games left to play. It is City's third title in seven seasons and a fifth top-flight crown - their first under the Spaniard in his second campaign in charge. They have dominated the title race, scoring 93 goals and losing just twice. The Premier League title is the 24th trophy of the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss' managerial career. The 47-year-old has previously won league titles in Spain and Germany, as well as two Champions Leagues with Barca.

Guardiolasaid on Saturdaythat he would play golf, rather than watch the United game. City's next match is at home to Swansea on 22 April. Man City top the charts in a number of key Premier League stats this season: Premier League stats 2017-18 Manchester City (1st) Second place Goals 93 Liverpool (78) Goal conceded 25 Manchester United (26) Home wins 14 Arsenal/Manchester United (13) Away wins 14 Tottenham (10) Shots on target 234 Liverpool (212) Total Shots 447 Liverpool (419) Chances created 441 Liverpool (440) Passes 24,193 Arsenal (20,798) Touches 30,214 Arsenal (26,977) Passing accuracy 88.76% Chelsea (84.28%) Average possession 71.22% Arsenal (62.43%) Successful passes 21,473 Arsenal (17,520) Big chances scored 60 Liverpool 45 (Opta) City have equalled Arsenal's tally of three Premier League titles - only Manchester United (13) and Chelsea (five) have won more. City have won the title with five games remaining, equalling the English top-flight record. Manchester United in 1907-08 and 2000-01, and Everton in 1984-85 all won the title with five games to spare. It is the second earliest, in terms of date, that the title has been sealed, just behind Manchester United's win on 14 April 2001. City's 28 wins matches their record tally of victories in a top-flight league season - set in 2011-12, when they sealed their 28th victory on the final day. They have scored 93 goals this season - they need seven goals in their final five league games to become the fourth team to score 100 or more goals in a Premier League campaign. City have been at the top of the league for 240 days in 2017-18 - one day fewer than Manchester United have spent at the top of the table since Sergio Aguero's goal won the title in May 2012. Guardiola is the first Spaniard to win the English top-flight title, and he has won the top-flight league title in seven of his nine seasons as a manager. Man City captain Vincent Kompany:""It's the same feeling as the first time and you can't describe it. It's amazing, such a difficult achievement and I'm proud of the team and everyone involved. This one differs in that we were consistent the whole season and we were able to play at the level we're expected to perform at. ""I'm buzzing, over the moon, so happy. I'm proud to be able to share this with all our fans, everybody who's been there to support us."" Chris Sutton, ex-Chelsea striker, on BBC Radio 5 live:""Manchester City have deserved it. Their brand of football this season has been scintillating. ""They've scored more goals and they have a brilliant manager. Their football on the eye has been superb and they've been streets ahead of everyone else. ""Old Trafford was a Theatre of Nightmares this afternoon. You'd think they'd back the derby win up with a strong performance. But they've handed the title to City on a platter."" Ian Wright, former England and Arsenal striker, on Match of the Day:""They have been magnificent. Guardiola has brought the right players. They have been scintillating all season and very much worthy champions. ""The goalkeeper was a major acquisition. Kyle Walker has been magnificent too and I'm delighted for him, but the players that were already there have improved too. That's what Guardiola needs to get praise for. ""City are already thinking about making sure they can retain it next season and do better in the Champions League."" Leon Osman, ex-Everton midfielder, on BBC Radio 5 live:""They definitely deserved the title. They've been fantastic this season, right from the start. Their performances out of the blocks in the first 10 games were incredible and they really set the tone for the season. ""[Winning at] Chelsea - a massive result away at the champions - early in the season really did put a marker down for everyone else to say we're the team to beat. They looked at one point like they were going to go unbeaten. ""I do think they've set a new standard for Premier League performances and what you expect from title winners moving forward."" Shaun Goater, ex-Man City striker, speaking to BBC Sport:""For me, it's by far the best City team I've seen. The way and the style they've gone about it is truly total football. ""City have done it in amazing style. That's what's been so beautiful - the way City have won this league."" Man City chief executive officer Ferran Soriano:""Winning the Premier League again is a great honour for Manchester City. We are delighted to have done so providing our supporters with some very exciting and unforgettable moments. ""We are committed to playing beautiful football and we are proud to have done it so brilliantly this season. For all Manchester City supporters, at home and globally, it is time to celebrate, acknowledge our friendship and enjoy our passion together."" Martin Keown, former England and Arsenal defender, on Match of the Day:""Last year Antonio Conte was the pragmatic manager but this year Guardiola had the flare. ""They have been in the shadow of Manchester United for so many years but they are well and truly out of that shadow now. Look at how much better City's players are now than at the start of the season. They just keep getting better and better. ""Guardiola is a serial winner of trophies so you go up another level. He made the necessary changes - he had the money to spend of course - but he spent it wisely and he set the tone. The players clearly know what they are doing and it's a canvas for success.""

"Ad chief Sir Martin Sorrell steps downHe built WPP into the world's largest advertising agency over 33 years, but resigns after a misconduct probe.5h5 hours agoBusiness","The head of WPP, the world's largest advertising agency, has stepped down after an internal investigation into claims of personal misconduct. Chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell ran WPP for 33 years, becoming the highest paid boss of a FTSE 100 company. Sir Martin said WPP had been his passion, but it was in ""the best interests of the business"" to resign. The probe into alleged misuse of WPP money - which he rejects - is over, WPP said. No more details were disclosed. The chairman, Roberto Quarta, will become executive chairman and work with two co-chief operating officers until a new chief executive is appointed. Sir Martin, aged 73, once said he would ""carry on until they carry me out of the glue factory"". The ad king who shaped an industry What now for the global ad giant? He was the longest serving chief executive of a FTSE 100 firm by far, and the best rewarded. In 2015 he faced an unsuccessful shareholder revolt over a Â£70m pay package. WPP said Sir Martin would be treated as having retired, so will receive any payments and share awards due under his contract. Earlier this month it was disclosed that WPP had appointed a law firm toinvestigate claims of financial impropriety.While Sir Martin rejected the allegation ""unreservedly"", he accepted ""the company has to investigate it"". WPP's statement, released late on Saturday, said: ""The previously announced investigation into an allegation of misconduct against Sir Martin has concluded. The allegation did not involve amounts that are material."" The company did not disclose further details about the claim. One source told the BBC on Sunday that the sums involved were less than Â£1m. Although Sir Martin is deemed to have ""retired"" this was not the outcome he wanted. His legacy as one of the titans of the advertising industry is secure - he built a Â£20bn global business from scratch and amassed a personal fortune. In the end, it was the trends in world business that wrong-footed the sprawling empire he created. The old advertising firms have been rendered less important by the sheer reach and analytics available by platforms like Google and Facebook. By his own admission, WPP got ""walloped"" last year and the company has lost a third of its value. If it hadn't, it's possible he could have survived the recent investigation into his conduct involving amounts of company money. But shareholders were getting restless, he had lost the unanimous backing of the board and at 73, he is no spring chicken. He has enormous energy and you wouldn't put it past him to create a new media empire. But his life's work, WPP - a company he was often accused of treating as his own - will now be run by someone else. Read more from Simon here Sir Martin said: ""The current disruption is simply putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business, our over 200,000 people and their 500,000 or so dependents, and the clients we serve in 112 countries. ""That is why I have decided that in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all share owners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside."" Mr Quarta described Sir Martin as being the ""driving force"" behind WPP's growth and thanked him for his commitment to the business. His departure comes at a difficult time for WPP, which faces intense competition from the likes of Google and Facebook as more advertising moves online. WPP shares have fallen 32% in the past 12 months, valuing the company at Â£15bn, as sales and profits guidance were downgraded. Earlier this year, consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, the world's largest advertiser and one of WPP's biggest clients, vowed to cut spending and bring more control in-house. A lack of succession planning about who will take over after the 73-year-old's retirement has also caused some anxiety among WPP shareholders. Formed WPP in 1985 after taking control of a shell company, Wire & Plastic Products, and established it as a marketing services group in 1986 Oversaw growth of company which now has 3,000 offices in 112 countries Born in London, he read economics at Christ's College, Cambridge University One of UK's top-paid executives. His pay package in 2015-16 was Â£70m - then the biggest in UK corporate history. He received Â£48m in 2016 Sir Martin was knighted by the Queen in 2000 Last year's Sunday Times' Rich List put Sir Martin's wealth at Â£495m Sir Martin and his family own about 2% of WPP. WPP, originally called Wire and Plastic Products, was a UK manufacturer of wire baskets for the first 14 years of its life until 1985 when Sir Martin took a loan out against shares he owned in Saatchi & Saatchi and purchased a stake in the company. His aim was to turn it into a marketing company offering a one-stop-shop for all the advertising and marketing needs of big corporations. The renamed WPP Group embarked on a series of acquisitions - including of J Walter Thompson, Ogilvy & Mather, research business Taylor Nelson Sofres, and the Young & Rubicam Group. Sir Martin was born in London and educated at the Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School before going on to read economics at Christ's College, Cambridge. An MBA from Harvard followed, and Sir Martin entered the world of work at Glendinning Associates before starting at Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, becoming group finance director in 1977.

Petrol bomb is thrown at police vehicle,"Police said the incident happened close to Rosapenna Street in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast A petrol bomb has been thrown at police in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast. Police said officers were responding to reports of a suspicious vehicle on Ardoyne Avenue at about 01:00 BST on Sunday when they were attacked by a crowd of stone throwers. The officers' vehicle was then struck by a petrol bomb close to Rosapenna Street. They were not injured and later located the suspicious vehicle and seized it. A 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of a range of driving offences. PSNI Inspector Tommy Fairfield said it was ""unacceptable that police officers simply trying to do their job should be attacked"", but he was ""pleased with how professionally the crew conducted themselves, continuing to pursue their enquiries and keep people safe in the face of such an attack"".

Campaigners demand 'people's' Brexit vote,"Actor Sir Patrick Stewart addressed the crowd during the launch MPs, celebrities and business leaders have launched a campaign calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union. The People's Vote - which held a rally in Camden, north London, on Sunday - aims to unite anti-Brexit groups. Organisers said some 1,200 people were at the event, including MPs from all leading parties. Pro-Brexit campaigners also gathered outside. Both the Conservatives and Labour have ruled out a second referendum. Actor Sir Patrick Stewart, who played Charles Xavier in the X-Men films based on the comic books, said the famous character would have voted Remain. He told the rally: ""Unity, common cause, wellbeing of society and debate were paramount to the belief of this fictional character. ""Our country's future is at stake and we will not stand idly by. ""That is why I support a people's vote on the final deal."" This video can not be played Sir Patrick motivated by ""history and emotion"" to want to stay in the EU Britain voted to leave the EU by 51.9% to 48.1% in June 2016. The UK will formally cease to be an EU member in March 2019, and the two sides hope to reach a final deal on the terms of its exit by October - in time for it to be ratified by UK and European parliaments.

""No-one had any idea what the consequences of Brexit were going to be."" And Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas told attendees that Brexit was ""not inevitable"", adding: ""We'll do everything we can in Parliament for a people's vote. This issue is far too important to leave to the politicians."" Organisers said some 1,200 people were at the event Layla Moran, Chuka Umunna and Caroline Lucas are among the MPs supporting the campaign Conservative MP Anna Soubry told the crowd the UK was about to embark on a course that would ""make you and your grandchildren... less prosperous than you are now"". ""I think the best and right thing to do is to put it back to the people and say you can have a vote on this deal,"" she said. Chuka Umunna, MP for Streatham, said: ""We need more Conservative members of Parliament to be as brave as Anna and many others who defied the whip and put their country before their party."" Lib Dem Layla Moran said: ""Whether you voted to Leave or Remain... there is nothing more democratic than allowing the people to accept or reject a deal that will affect our country for decades to come."" Meanwhile, pro-Brexit demonstrators also turned up at the launch, and Conservative MP Nadine Dorries argued there was no public appetite for a second referendum. Appearing alongside Mr Umunna on ITV's Peston on Sunday, she said: ""A second referendum, Chukka, which is what you're really campaigning for, is never going to happen. The public don't want it."" Pro-Brexit campaigners gathered outside the event in London Earlier, actor Sir Patrick told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the ""terms and conditions"" of Brexit were ""quite unlike"" how they were presented during the run up to the 2016 referendum. Sir Patrick also said he was motivated by ""history and emotion"" to want to stay in the EU. ""I'm a war baby and growing up a lot of the world was not good. So the day we joined was one of the most exciting days of my adulthood,"" he added. Also speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson responded to the campaign, noting that the people's vote had already taken place: ""They voted with a substantial majority to leave the EU. We're now trying to deliver on that mandate from the people."" Mr Johnson addressed the remarks made by Sir Patrick, who also played the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation. ""I think we'll get a great result and we'll be able to have, not only a gigantic free trade deal with our friends and partners across the Channel, but we'll be able to boldly go to areas we perhaps neglected over the past five years.""

Climate protest lawyer sets himself on fire,"Mr Buckel's remains were found in Prospect Park in Brooklyn A prominent US lawyer has died after setting himself on fire in a New York park in a protest against climate change. The remains of David Buckel, 60, were found in Prospect Park in Brooklyn. In a suicide note found nearby, Mr Buckel wrote that he had immolated himself using fossil fuel to symbolise what he said was the damage human beings were doing to the Earth. He said most people now breathed bad air and many died prematurely. Mr Buckel was well known for his legal work on behalf of gay, lesbian and transgender people and later worked with several environmental groups. ""Pollution ravages our planet, oozing inhabitability via air, soil, water and weather,"" the lawyer said in his suicide note, quoted by the New York Times.The note was also emailed to several news organisations shortly before his body was found,external, the newspaper said. ""My early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves,"" he said. Climate change 'hurts women more' ""This is not new, as many have chosen to give a life based on the view that no other action can most meaningfully address the harm they see,"" he added, the New York Daily News reported. Mr Buckel was the lead lawyer in a case in which police in Nebraska were found to have failed to protect Brandon Teena, a transgender teen who had been raped and assaulted and was later murdered in the state of Nebraska. Mr Teena's story was the subject of the 1999 film Boys Don't Cry and Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her portrayal of him. He also worked as marriage project director and senior counsel at Lambda Legal, which fights for LGBT rights. Lambda'sCamilla Taylor described Mr Buckel as a ""legal visionary"",external. ""His thoughtful and engaging advocacy broke through many stubborn misconceptions and showed it was possible and necessary for our movement to speak up for bullied, ostracised LGBT young people,"" she said in a statement to the Huffington Post.

US is 'locked and loaded',"This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded President Donald Trump has warned Syria's government the US is ""locked and loaded"" to strike again if it carries out chemical attacks. The warning came after the US, UK and France struck three Syrian sites in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack in the town of Douma a week ago. Syria denies any chemical use and says that attack was fabricated by rebels. A UN Security Council vote brought by Syria's ally, Russia, to condemn the US-led strikes was rejected. The wave of strikes represents the most significant attack against President Bashar al-Assad's government by Western powers in seven years of Syria's civil war. While Western powers have supported rebels from early on in the war, they have not intervened directly against Syrian government forces. Catch up on the strikes: What was targeted? PM faces 'almighty row' over strikes UK publishes legal case for Syria action What Trump said After the failure of the Russian motion, the US, UK and France circulated a new draft resolution to UN Security Council members, calling for an independent investigation into Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons, AFP news agency reported. Similar previous plans have been vetoed by Russia. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has blamed Russian obstruction for the need to launch military strikes, saying they left ""no practicable alternative"". This video can not be played Syria air strikes: Do they work? Inspectors from the independent Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) had already been dispatched to Damascus and they are expected to visit Douma this weekend. But the OPCW will not seek to establish - and publicly announce - who was responsible for the attack, which is what the UK, US and France want to see. The new, Western-drafted resolution calls for the OPCW to release their report within 30 days. Syria's Assistant Foreign Minister Ayman Sousan told the BBC his government welcomed the OPCW delegation. ""The work of the mission is in the interest of the Syrian state as it will uncover the lies, hypocrisy and the misinformation of the sides which had promoted the alleged use of chemical weapons,"" he said. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told the BBC the strikes in Syria were meant to signal that ""enough is enough""and their ""primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons"". Russia has said it believes the attack in Douma was staged. An emergency meeting was held by the UN Security Council on Saturday, leading to some bitter exchanges. Russia sought to secure a collective condemnation of the early morning air strikes. However, out of the 15-member council, only China and Bolivia voted in favour of the Russian resolution. Russia's UN envoy, Vasily Nebenzia, read out a quote from President Vladimir Putin accusing the US, UK and France of ""cynical disdain"" in acting without waiting for the OPCW's findings. US envoy Nikki Haley said she had spoken to President Trump: ""And he said: 'If the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded.'"" She added: ""We cannot stand by and let Russia trash every international norm and allow use of chemical weapons to go unanswered."" Syrian envoy Bashar Jaafari called the US, UK and France ""liars, spoilers and hypocrites"" who exploited the UN ""to pursue... [their] policy of interference and colonialism"". The future of the Syrian war: Can Trump move on? Will the West's attack sway Assad? CBS News reporter Seth Doane visited one of the targets in Damascus on Saturday afternoon, and found it to be a smouldering pile of rubble. The Barzeh complex appears to be totally destroyed The Barzeh complex is, according to the US, a centre for development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons. Syria denies this. Elsewhere, the Syrian army announced on Saturday that the Eastern Ghouta region, where Douma is situated, had been cleared of the last rebel fighters and was fully retaken. He tweeted early on Saturday, hailing the strikes as ""perfectly executed"". He also thanked the UK and France. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Fall of Eastern Ghouta - a pivotal moment for Assad At a Pentagon briefing on Saturday, Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie listed the three targets that had been struck, saying the attacks had ""set the Syrian chemical weapons programme back years"". This video can not be played Gen Kenneth McKenzie: ""We deployed 105 weapons"" Gen McKenzie said about 40 Syrian defence missiles were fired, mostly after the targets were hit, and none successfully engaged planes or missiles. The Pentagon briefing contradicted information given at a Russian defence ministry briefing, which said 103 cruise missiles had been launched and 71 were shot down by Syrian systems. Both the Russians and the US said there were no reported casualties. Syria says three people were hurt near Homs. The US said it had communicated with Russia ahead of the strikes through the normal procedures of their ""deconfliction"" hotline, but no details of the attacks were given. There had been concerns that if the allied strikes had hit Russian military personnel, it would have further escalated tension. The US says the scale of the strikes was about ""double"" what was launched in April 2017 after achemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed more than 80 people. What was hit in Syria?

Trump defends 'mission accomplished',"This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded President Donald Trump has defended his use of the term ""mission accomplished"" amid criticism following US, UK and French air strikes on targets in Syria. He accused the ""fake news media"" of seizing on the term to demean the strikes, carried out in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack. President George W Bush was ridiculed for appearing in front of a banner carrying the term during the Iraq war. Russia and Syria insist no chemical attack took place on 7 April. They have said the attack in Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta area near the capital, Damascus, was staged. Catch up on the strikes: What was targeted? PM faces 'almighty row' over strikes UK publishes legal case for Syria action What Trump said Inspectors from the independent Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) are now in Damascus. They have met Syrian officials and are expected to visit Douma soon. This video can not be played Masa, survivor of suspected chemical attack: ""Instead of breathing air, we breathed the smell of blood"" US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley has said that new sanctions will be announced on Monday against Russian companies with links to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Mr Trump used the term to conclude a tweet on Saturday morning following the overnight attacks, after hailing the strikes as ""perfectly executed"" and thanking the UK and France.

The phrase had been on a banner as Mr Bush declared the end of ""major combat operations"" in Iraq in May 2003, six weeks after the US-led invasion of the country. The following Iraqi insurgency, which dragged on for years, led to widespread ridicule of the term. George W Bush with the banner on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in May 2003 A replica banner mocks Mr Bush at the White House in 2007 Ex-Assistant Secretary of State PJ Crowley said the use of the term at that time ""represented a serious misreading of the challenge""in an article for the BBC, adding: ""But Syria isn't Iraq. It's actually much more complicated."" The OPCW inspectors met Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad and Russian officials for about three hours in Damascus on Sunday and are expected to begin work in Douma later. The Syrian army announced on Saturday that Douma's Eastern Ghouta region had been cleared of the last rebel fighters and was fully retaken. Were the Syria air strikes legal? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Fall of Eastern Ghouta - a pivotal moment for Assad The inspectors will investigate the site of the alleged chemical attack, which the Western allies believe killed dozens of people with the use of chlorine gas and possibly Sarin. The Russians say there is no trace of any chemicals and questioned why the allies carried out strikes before the inspectors had reported.Russia says the attack in Douma was staged, accusing the UK of orchestrating it. The OPCW will not seek to establish - and publicly announce - who was responsible for the attack. The UK, US and France have said the Syrian government was responsible. Mr Trump said on Saturday that the US was still ""locked and loaded"" should any more chemical weapons attacks happen. This video can not be played Syria air strikes: Do they work? The wave of strikes had represented the most significant attack against President Bashar al-Assad's government by Western powers in seven years of Syria's civil war. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Sunday no further strikes were planned, but that this would be reassessed if more chemical attacks took place. Mr Johnson told the BBC the strikes in Syria were meant to signal that ""enough is enough""and their ""primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons"". He said of the strikes: ""This is not about regime change. This is not about trying to turn the tide of the conflict in Syria."" Revealing the decision to impose new sanctions on Russian companies, Ms Haley also said the US would not withdraw the 2,000 troops it has working in Syria until it had achieved its goals of defeating the Islamic State group, preventing the use of chemical weapons and keeping a check on Iran. This would be the second tranche of sanctions against Russian firms in a month, partly related to Russia's support for Syria. Ms Haley also ruled out any direct talks with Mr Assad. In a televised interview on Sunday evening, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was France that had persuaded Mr Trump not to pull out of Syria, and also France that had convinced him to limit the strikes to alleged chemical weapons facilities. Emmanuel Macron defended the strikes in a live interview on TV He also said the strikes had ""complete international legitimacy"", were a success and were not an attack on the Assad regime. On Saturday, Russia failed to win a vote in the UN Security Council condemning the ""aggression"" of the US-led strikes on Syria. Only China and Bolivia voted with Russia. The vote followed bitter exchanges, with Russia accusing the allies of ""cynical disdain"" and the US saying that Russia had trashed diplomatic moves on chemical weapons. The US, UK and France then circulated a new draft resolution to Security Council members, calling for an independent investigation into Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons. Similar previous plans have been vetoed by Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani by phone on Sunday, telling him that any new Western strikes on Syria would spark ""international chaos"". The future of the Syrian war: Can Trump move on? Will the West's attack sway Assad? Three sites. Firstly, the Barzeh complex, which the US says is a centre for development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons, although Syria denies this. The other two were suspected chemical weapons facilities at Him Shinshar near Homs. The Barzeh complex appears completely destroyed The US said 105 missiles were launched and it believed none were intercepted by Syrian defences. It said Syria's chemical weapons programme had been set back years. This video can not be played Gen Kenneth McKenzie: ""We deployed 105 weapons"" The Russians said 71 missiles were shot down by Syrian systems.

US warns Syria: We are 'locked and loaded',"This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded President Donald Trump has warned Syria's government the US is ""locked and loaded"" to strike again if it carries out chemical attacks. The warning came after the US, UK and France struck three Syrian sites in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack in the town of Douma a week ago. Syria denies any chemical use and says that attack was fabricated by rebels. A UN Security Council vote brought by Syria's ally, Russia, to condemn the US-led strikes was rejected. The wave of strikes represents the most significant attack against President Bashar al-Assad's government by Western powers in seven years of Syria's civil war. While Western powers have supported rebels from early on in the war, they have not intervened directly against Syrian government forces. Catch up on the strikes: What was targeted? PM faces 'almighty row' over strikes UK publishes legal case for Syria action What Trump said After the failure of the Russian motion, the US, UK and France circulated a new draft resolution to UN Security Council members, calling for an independent investigation into Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons, AFP news agency reported. Similar previous plans have been vetoed by Russia. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has blamed Russian obstruction for the need to launch military strikes, saying they left ""no practicable alternative"". This video can not be played Syria air strikes: Do they work? Inspectors from the independent Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) had already been dispatched to Damascus and they are expected to visit Douma this weekend. But the OPCW will not seek to establish - and publicly announce - who was responsible for the attack, which is what the UK, US and France want to see. The new, Western-drafted resolution calls for the OPCW to release their report within 30 days. Syria's Assistant Foreign Minister Ayman Sousan told the BBC his government welcomed the OPCW delegation. ""The work of the mission is in the interest of the Syrian state as it will uncover the lies, hypocrisy and the misinformation of the sides which had promoted the alleged use of chemical weapons,"" he said. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told the BBC the strikes in Syria were meant to signal that ""enough is enough""and their ""primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons"". Russia has said it believes the attack in Douma was staged. An emergency meeting was held by the UN Security Council on Saturday, leading to some bitter exchanges. Russia sought to secure a collective condemnation of the early morning air strikes. However, out of the 15-member council, only China and Bolivia voted in favour of the Russian resolution. Russia's UN envoy, Vasily Nebenzia, read out a quote from President Vladimir Putin accusing the US, UK and France of ""cynical disdain"" in acting without waiting for the OPCW's findings. US envoy Nikki Haley said she had spoken to President Trump: ""And he said: 'If the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded.'"" She added: ""We cannot stand by and let Russia trash every international norm and allow use of chemical weapons to go unanswered."" Syrian envoy Bashar Jaafari called the US, UK and France ""liars, spoilers and hypocrites"" who exploited the UN ""to pursue... [their] policy of interference and colonialism"". The future of the Syrian war: Can Trump move on? Will the West's attack sway Assad? CBS News reporter Seth Doane visited one of the targets in Damascus on Saturday afternoon, and found it to be a smouldering pile of rubble. The Barzeh complex appears to be totally destroyed The Barzeh complex is, according to the US, a centre for development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons. Syria denies this. Elsewhere, the Syrian army announced on Saturday that the Eastern Ghouta region, where Douma is situated, had been cleared of the last rebel fighters and was fully retaken. He tweeted early on Saturday, hailing the strikes as ""perfectly executed"". He also thanked the UK and France. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The phrase had been on a banner as Mr Bush declared the end of ""major combat operations"" in Iraq in May 2003, six weeks after the US-led invasion of the country. The following Iraqi insurgency questioned the validity of the statement. Were the Syria air strikes legal? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Fall of Eastern Ghouta - a pivotal moment for Assad At a Pentagon briefing on Saturday, Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie listed the three targets that had been struck, saying the attacks had ""set the Syrian chemical weapons programme back years"". This video can not be played Gen Kenneth McKenzie: ""We deployed 105 weapons"" Gen McKenzie said about 40 Syrian defence missiles were fired, mostly after the targets were hit, and none successfully engaged planes or missiles. The Pentagon briefing contradicted information given at a Russian defence ministry briefing, which said 103 cruise missiles had been launched and 71 were shot down by Syrian systems. Both the Russians and the US said there were no reported casualties. Syria says three people were hurt near Homs. The US said it had communicated with Russia ahead of the strikes through the normal procedures of their ""deconfliction"" hotline, but no details of the attacks were given. There had been concerns that if the allied strikes had hit Russian military personnel, it would have further escalated tension. The US says the scale of the strikes was about ""double"" what was launched in April 2017 after achemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed more than 80 people. What was hit in Syria?

The school teacher who couldn't read or writeLiveCommonwealth Games closing ceremonyMost recent posts4 minutes ago Welcome back....4mWelcome back....2 hours ago 'I think we nailed it'2h'I think we nailed it'2 hours ago Get involved2hGet involved,"John Corcoran grew up in New Mexico in the US during the 1940s and 50s. One of six siblings, he graduated from high school, went on to university, and became a teacher in the 1960s - a job he held for 17 years. But, as he explains here, he hid an extraordinary secret. When I was a child I was told by my parents that I was a winner, and for the first six years of my life I believed what my parents had told me. I was late in talking, but I went off to school with high hopes of learning to read like my sisters, and for the first year things were fine because there weren't many demands on us other than standing in the right line, sitting down, keeping our mouths shut and going to the bathroom on time. And then in the second grade we were supposed to learn to read. But for me it was like opening a Chinese newspaper and looking at it - I didn't understand what those lines were, and as a child of six, seven, eight years old I didn't know how to articulate the problem. I remember praying at night and saying, ""Please Lord, let me know how to read tomorrow when I get up"" and sometimes I'd even turn on the light and get a book and look at it and see if I got a miracle. But I didn't get that miracle. At school I ended up in the dumb row with a bunch of other kids who were having a hard time learning to read. I didn't know how I got there, I didn't know how to get out and I certainly didn't know what question to ask. The teacher didn't call it the ""dumb row"" - there wasn't any cruelty or anything - but the kids called it the dumb row, and when you're in that dumb row you start thinking you're dumb. At teacher conferences my teacher told my parents, ""He's a smart boy, he'll get it,"" and they moved me on to the third grade. ""He's a smart boy, he'll get it,"" and they moved me on to the fourth grade. ""He's a smart boy, he'll get it,"" and they moved me on to the fifth grade. But I wasn't getting it. By the time I got to the fifth grade I'd basically given up on myself in terms of reading. I got up every day, got dressed, went to school and I was going to war. I hated the classroom. It was a hostile environment and I had to find a way to survive. By the seventh grade I was sitting in the principal's office most of the day. I was in fights, I was defiant, I was a clown, I was a disruptor, I got expelled from school. But that behaviour wasn't who I felt inside - it wasn't who I wanted to be. I wanted to be somebody else, I had a desire to succeed, I wanted to be a good student, but I just couldn't do it. By the time I got to the eighth grade I got tired of embarrassing myself and my family. I decided I was going to behave myself now - if you behave in high school you can find your way through the system. So I was going to be a teacher's pet and do everything necessary to pass that system. I wanted to be an athlete - I had athletic skills, and I had maths skills - I could count money and make change before I even went to school and I learned the times tables. I had social skills too -  I ran around with college kids, I dated the valedictorian - the student with the highest grades who gives a speech at the graduation ceremony, I was the homecoming king, I had people - mostly girls - do my homework for me. I could write my name and there were some words that I could remember, but I couldn't write a sentence - I was in high school and reading at the second or third grade level. And I never told anybody that I couldn't read. When I was taking a test I would look at someone else's paper, or I'd pass my paper over to somebody else and they'd answer the questions for me - it was fairly easy, amateur cheating. But when I went off to college on a full athletic scholarship it was a different story. I thought, ""Oh my gosh, this is way over my head, how am I going to be able to get through this?"" I belonged to a social fraternity who had copies of old exam papers. That was one way to cheat. I tried to take classes with a partner, somebody who would help me through. There were professors who used the same test year after year. But I also had to resort to more creative and desperate things. In one exam the professor put four questions on the board. I was sitting at the back of the room, near the window, behind the older students. I had my blue book and I painstakingly copied the four questions off the board. I didn't know what those questions said. I had arranged for a friend of mine to be outside the window. He was probably the smartest kid in school, but he was also shy and he'd asked me to fix him up with a girl by the name of Mary who he wanted to go to the spring formal dance with. I passed my blue book out the window to him and he answered the questions for me. I had another blue exam book underneath my shirt and I took it out and pretended I was writing in it. I was praying that my friend was going to be able to get my book back to me and that he was going to get the right answers. I was so desperate. I needed to pass courses. I was at risk. Listen to John Corcoran onOutlookWeekend on the BBC World Service Or download the podcasthere There was another exam that I couldn't figure out how I was going to pass. One night I went by the professor's office about midnight, he wasn't there. I opened the window with a knife and I went in like a cat burglar. I'd crossed the line now - I wasn't just a student that was cheating, I was a criminal. I went inside and I looked around for the exam. It had to be in his office but I couldn't find it. There was a file cabinet that was locked - it had to be in the file cabinet. I did the same thing two or three nights in a row looking for that exam but I still couldn't find it. So one night, about one o'clock in the morning, I brought three of my friends with me and we went to the office. We carried out a four-drawer file cabinet, put it in a vehicle, and took it off campus to a college apartment. I had arranged for a locksmith to come. I put my suit and tie on - I was pretending to be a young businessman who was leaving for Los Angeles the next day and the locksmith was saving my job by opening it. He opened it, gave me a key, and sure enough, to my great relief there were more than 40 copies of the exam - a multiple choice paper - in the top drawer of the file cabinet. I took one copy back to my dormitory, where a ""smart"" classmate made a cheat sheet with all the correct answers. We carried the file cabinet back and at five o'clock in the morning I was walking up to my room and thinking, ""Mission impossible accomplished!"" - and I was feeling pretty good that I was so clever. But then I walked up the stairs, lay down in my bed and started weeping like a baby. Why didn't I ask for help? Because I didn't believe there was anybody out there who could teach me to read. This was my secret and I guarded that secret. This video can not be played John Corcoran tells Outlook how he hid his inability to read My teachers and my parents told me that people with college degrees get better jobs, they have better lives, and so that's what I believed. My motivation was to just get that piece of paper. Maybe by osmosis, maybe by prayer, maybe by a miracle I would one day learn to read. So I graduated from college, and when I graduated there was a teacher shortage and I was offered a job. It was the most illogical thing you can imagine - I got out of the lion's cage and then I got back in to taunt the lion again. Why did I go into teaching? Looking back it was crazy that I would do that. But I'd been through high school and college without getting caught - so being a teacher seemed a good place to hide. Nobody suspects a teacher of not knowing how to read. I taught a lot of different things. I was an athletics coach. I taught social studies. I taught typing - I could copy-type at 65 words a minute but I didn't know what I was typing. I never wrote on a blackboard and there was no printed word in my classroom. We watched a lot of films and had a lot of discussions. I remember how fearful I was. I couldn't even take the roll - I had to ask the students to pronounce their names so I could hear their names. And I always had two or three students who I identified early - the ones who could read and write best in the classroom - to help me. They were my teaching aides. They didn't suspect at all - you don't suspect the teacher. One of my biggest fears was faculty meetings. We had them once a week and if the teachers were brainstorming the principal would call on somebody to get those ideas on to the board. I lived in fear that he would call on me, every week I was terrified, but I had a backup plan. If he had called on me I was going to get out of my chair and take two steps, grab my chest, drop to the floor and hope they called 911. Whatever it took not to get caught, and I never got caught. Sometimes I felt like a good teacher - because I worked hard at it and I really cared about what I was doing - but I wasn't. It was wrong. I didn't belong in the classroom, I was trespassing. I wasn't supposed to be there and sometimes what I was doing made me physically sick, but I was trapped, I couldn't tell anybody. I got married while I was a teacher. Getting married is a sacrament, it's a commitment to be truthful with another person and this was the first time I thought, ""OK, I'm going to trust this person, I'm going to tell her."" I practised in front of the mirror: ""Cathy, I can't read. Cathy, I can't read."" And one evening we were sitting on the couch and I said, ""Cathy, I can't read."" But she didn't really understand what I was saying. She thought I was saying that I didn't read much. You know, love is blind and deaf. So we got married and we had a child and years later it really came home to her. I was reading to our three-year-old daughter. We read to her routinely, but I wasn't really reading, I was making the stories up - stories that I knew, like Goldilocks and The Three Bears, I just added drama to them. But this was a new book, Rumpelstiltskin, and my daughter said, ""You're not reading it like mama."" My wife heard me trying to read from a child's book and that was the first time that it dawned on her. I had been asking her to do all this writing for me, helping me write things for school, and then she finally realised, how deep and severe this was. But nothing was said, there was no confrontation, she just carried on helping me get by. John Corcoran and his granddaughter, Kayla Mertes: It was when ""reading"" to his daughter that John's secret was revealed It didn't relieve anything because in my gut I felt dumb and I felt like a fake. I was deceitful. I was teaching my students to be seekers of truth and I was the biggest liar in the room. The relief only came when I finally learned to read. I taught high school from 1961 to 1978. Eight years after I quit my teaching job, something finally changed. I was 47 going on 48 when I saw Barbara Bush - then Second Lady of the US - talking about adult literacy on TV. It was her special cause. I'd never heard anybody talking about adult literacy before, I thought I was the only person in the world that was in the situation I was in. I was at this desperate spot in my life. I wanted to tell somebody and I wanted to get help and one day in the grocery store I was standing in line and there were two women in front of me talking about their adult brother who was going to the library. He was learning to read and they were just full of joy and I couldn't believe it. So one Friday afternoon in my pinstriped suit I walked into the library and asked to see the director of the literacy programme and I sat down with her and I told her I couldn't read. That was the second person in my adult life that I had ever told. Barbara Bush inspired John Corcoran to ask for help and finally learn to read I had a volunteer tutor - she was 65 years old. She wasn't a teacher, she was just somebody who loved to read and didn't think anybody should go through life without knowing how to. One of the things that she had me do in the early stages was to try to write because I had all these thoughts in my mind and I'd never written a sentence. The first thing that I wrote was a poem about my feelings. One of the things about poetry is that you don't have to know what a complete sentence is, and you don't have to write in complete sentences. She got me to about sixth-grade-level reading - I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. But it took me about seven years to feel like I was a literate person. I cried, I cried, and I cried after I started learning to read - there was a lot of pain and a lot of frustration -  but it filled a big hole in my soul. Adults who can't read are suspended in their childhoods, emotionally, psychologically, academically, spiritually. We haven't grown up yet. I was encouraged to tell my story by my tutor to motivate others and promote literacy, but I said, ""No way. I've lived in this community for 17 years, my children are here, my wife is here - she's a professional, my parents are here, I'm not going to tell this story."" John Corcoran and members of his family today But eventually I decided I would. It was an embarrassing secret and it was a shame-based secret, so it was a big decision. It wasn't easy but once I'd made up my mind I was going to tell the story I told it all across America, I spoke to anybody that would listen. I guarded this secret for decades and then I blasted it to the world. I was on Larry King, I was on the ABC News magazine show 20/20, I was on Oprah. John Corcoranset up a foundation,externalin his name to help adults and children with literacy skills - in California and online In the UK the National Literacy Trust websitelists organisations,externalthat promote adult literacy These includeRead Easy,externaland theReading Agency,external It was uncomfortable for people to hear the story of the teacher who couldn't read. Some people said it was impossible and that I was making the whole story up. But I want people to know there is hope, there is a solution. We are not ""dumb"", we can learn to read, it's never too late. Unfortunately we are still pushing children and teens through school without teaching them basic reading and writing skills. But we can break this cycle of failure if instead of blaming teachers we make sure they are properly trained. For 48 years I was in the dark. But I finally got the monkey off my back, I finally buried the ghost of my past. Written by Sarah McDermott. Photographs courtesy of John Corcoran.

Commonwealth Games set a record for the most gold medal-winning countries at a
single Games. The previous best was 28 different medal winning nations, at
Manchester 2002, but that mark has been surpassed over the past 11 days of
competition. On the Gold Coast, 29 countries claimed gold, with medals shared
between 43 countries, another record, beating the previous best of 39 which was
set at Manchester 2002 and equalled at Melbourne 2006. Australia topped the medal table at GC2018 with 198 medals - 80 of
them gold - but couldnât improve its own record at Melbourne 2006 when the host
nation won 221 medals, 84 gold. England finished second with 136 medals (45 gold), with India in
third with 66 medals (26 gold). Commonwealth Games closing ceremony Wherever there's a pop party, you can be sure our BBC crew aren't far away.

Drug dealer caught by WhatsApp photo,"This video can not be played 'Drugs for sale' message catches man dealing to Bridgend A pioneering fingerprint technique used to convict a drugs gang from a WhatsApp message ""is the future"" of how police approach evidence to catch criminals. An image of a man holding ecstasy tablets in his palm was found on the mobile of someone arrested in Bridgend. It was sent to South Wales Police's scientific support unit and helped to secure 11 convictions. These are believed to be the first convictions in Wales from fingerprints taken from a photograph. The unit's Dave Thomas described its use as ""groundbreaking"" and said officers are now looking more closely at photographs on phones seized for potential evidence. 'Ecstasy pills for sale' in WhatsApp message Teens found selling drugs on Snapchat and Instagram How drugs are offered on Instagram He said: ""It is an old-fashioned technique [fingerprinting], not new. ""Ultimately, beyond everything else, we took a phone and looked at everything on it - we knew it had a hand with drugs on it. ""These guys [the dealers] are using the technology not to get caught and we need to keep up with advancements."" The photograph came to light after a tip-off drugs were being sold from a house in the Kenfig Hill area of Bridgend. Elliott Morris of Redditch, Worcestershire, was sentenced to eight and a half years for conspiracy to supply cannabis. He headed a family operation with his father Darren getting 27 months and mother, Dominique, 12 months It was raided and large quantities of 'gorilla glue' - a type of cannabis - was recovered. Mr Thomas praised the officer that spotted a photograph among a stream of WhatsApp messages going back months as potentially carrying significant evidence. ""It had a number of texts such as 'what do you want to buy?' on it,"" he said. ""There was then the photograph of the hand holding pills that seemed like it was sent to potential customers saying 'these are my wares, I'm selling these'. ""But he was not thinking it showed part of his hand and there was potentially a fingerprint."" The scientific support unit - a joint venture between the Gwent and south Wales forces, based in Bridgend - was able to scan the image into its system. However, there were just parts of the middle and bottom of a finger visible - records only keep the top part. This meant the image did not find a match on national databases. Drug dealer Elliott Morris sent this photograph out on a Whatsapp message to potential customers in Bridgend However, other evidence meant officers had an idea who they believed was behind the drugs operation. ""While the scale and quality of the photograph proved a challenge, the small bits were enough to prove he was the dealer,"" added Mr Thomas. ""It has now opened the floodgates and when there is part of a hand on a photograph, officers are sending them in."" He believes it is the first time someone's fingerprint has been identified by a photograph in Wales and shows the potential of a forensic unit with a small piece of evidence. Mr Thomas pointed to how about 80% of people now have mobile phones and use them to record incidents such as fights and car crashes. ""We can download and enhance (footage),"" he said. ""These are all advancements in the digital world - they provide lots of questions we need to provide answers for."" Making greater use of social media messages is just one area being developed. ""We want to be in a position where there is a burglary at 20:30, we can scan evidence and by 20:45 be waiting at the offender's front door and arrest them arriving home with the swag,"" he added. ""That will work through remote transmission - scanning evidence at the scene and sending it back quickly for a match. ""It's the future. We are not there yet but it could significantly enhance the ability of the local bobbies to arrest people very quickly.""

"M1 minibus crash 'laid bare law loophole'Two lorry drivers, one unlicensed, were jailed after a crash which killed eight minibus occupants.11h11 hours agoBeds, Herts & Bucks","Two lorries and a minibus were involved in the crash on the M1 last August A fatal minibus crash on the M1 ""laid bare the loophole"" where employers are not automatically told of drivers losing their licence, a charity said. Eight minibus occupants were killed in the crash in August caused by two lorry drivers - one of whom had lost their HGV licence 37 days earlier. Road charity Brake said the government should ""urgently"" look at the law. The Department for Transport denied there was a ""loophole"" and said it was an issue between employer and employee. Seven Indian tourists and Nottingham-based minibus driver Cyriac Joseph were killed in the crash on the M1 near Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on 26 August. AIM Logistics, which employed one of the lorry drivers found guilty over the crash, Ryszard Masierak, said after the conviction that all its drivers were subjected to checks as regular as the DVLA suggested. The duty is on the employers to check their employees' licences regularly, with the DVLA advising it should be done every three months. Ryszard Masierak and David Wagstaff were sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court last month Evesham-based AIM Logistics said Masierak had his licence checked in June 2017. However, it said neither the employee nor the DVLA informed the firm he had it revoked on 20 July - more than a month before the crash - after he failed to re-arrange a date for a driver conduct hearing for committing ""drivers' hours offences"". 'There is no life for me now' - minibus driver's wife Lorry drivers jailed for M1 crash Trucker's firm 'unaware' his licence was revoked In the intervening period between his licence being revoked and the scheduled next check, he stopped on the inside lane of the M1 while twice the drink-drive limit. Another lorry, driven by David Wagstaff, forced the minibus underneath Masierak's stationary lorry, killing eight people and seriously injuring four others. The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph Charity Brake said: ""This crash has had a truly devastating impact and laid bare the loophole in which employers are not automatically informed if their drivers lose their licence. ""It is only right that we learn from such tragedies and prevent other families from suffering a similar fate, and so we call on the government to urgently look into this matter."" The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said the current rule relied upon the ""honesty of the driver"". Road safety manager Nick Lloyd said: ""It does seem to be a loophole that could allow drivers to avoid losing their driving job after a ban because they don't tell their boss, at least until an organisation does its regular online licence check."" This video can not be played CCTV captured the fatal M1 minibus crash The Department for Transport said the additional regulation would be unnecessary and burdensome on small businesses. It added employers should encourage employees to notify them of any change in their driving status.

Strikes showed enough is enough - Johnson,"This video can not be played Primary purpose of Syria air strikes was ""to say no to the use of barbaric weapons"", says Boris Johnson Air strikes in Syria were about saying ""enough is enough"" over the use of chemical weapons, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said. Mr Johnson said the action by the US, UK and France would not ""turn the tide"" of the conflict and was not about regime change. But he said he hoped it would act as a deterrent to more ""barbaric"" chemical attacks. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has questioned the legality of the action. He called for new legislation to ensure MPs get a vote before future military action is taken, and said he would only back intervention in Syria if the United Nations backed it. Conservatives said this would never happen due to Russia using its veto at the UN. Trump defends 'mission accomplished' claim As it happened: Western powers strike Syria targets Theresa May: Syria statement in full Syria air strikes: Were they legal? Downing Street has publishedits legal case for its part in the strikes, which targeted military bases. Sites near Damascus and Homs were hit in response to an alleged chemical attack on the town of Douma on 7 April. This video can not be played Masa, survivor of suspected chemical attack: ""Instead of breathing air, we breathed the smell of blood"" Both Syria and Russia - which provides military support to the Syrian government - have reacted angrily to the action. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Johnson stressed the ""limits"" of the intervention were to stop an apparent erosion of the ""taboo"" of chemical weapons. ""The rest of the Syrian war must proceed as it will,"" he said, adding that the ""primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons"". Mr Johnson said he did not know how Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would respond, adding that if there was a repeat chemical attack, ""clearly, with allies, we would study what the options were"". This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded Opposition parties have criticised the lack of a parliamentary vote before the air strikes. Mr Johnson promised MPs would ""have their say"" when Theresa May makes a Commons statement on Monday. Mr Corbyn told the Marr show Mrs May ""could easily"" have recalled Parliament or delayed her decision until MPs returned on Monday. The Barzah Research and Development Centre before the air strike The Barzah Research and Development Centre after the air strike He also called for a War Powers Act, ""so governments do get held accountable to Parliament for what they do in our name"". He added that Labour would continue to push for a debate and a vote on the intervention, describing it as ""policy made up by Twitter"", in a reference to the US president's tweets ahead of the air strikes. Mr Corbyn said he would only ""countenance"" getting involved in the Syrian conflict with the backing of the United Nations. This video can not be played Corbyn: Trump should pick up the phone to Putin The UN has so far failed to agree a unified response, with the US and Russia blocking each other's proposals last week. Pushed on whether he would authorise the use of force if he was prime minister, the Labour leader said ""no-one would ever say never"", adding: ""If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. ""That surely would save a lot of lives."" Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis accused Mr Corbyn of failing to ""recognise what has actually been happening"". ""He knows full well Russia veto at UN,"" he tweeted. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were grilled about the Syria conflict on the Andrew Marr show Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the legal basis for the intervention as ""thin"". ""Air strikes may make Western leaders feel that they're doing something,"" she said. ""In this case it feels as if it's more to do with a macho strongman stand-off between Trump and Putin than it is to do with really delivering peace in Syria. That should not be the criteria against which decisions about UK military action is taken."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable told Sky News he was not ""quibbling about the legality"" of the UK's action in Syria, but added: ""My questioning of the government is to the wisdom of proceeding the way it did without building up a consensus and a case in this country."" The UK believes the Assad regime was responsible forthe attack on civilians in Douma, while the US and France say they have proof. But Syria has always denied any chemical use and says the attack was fabricated by rebels. On Saturday, the Ministry of Defence said eight Storm Shadow missiles had been launched by four RAF Tornados at a former missile base, 15 miles west of Homs. It is thought President Bashar al-Assad's regime had been stockpiling materials used to make chemical weapons there, it said. A spokesperson added the facility was located ""some distance"" from ""concentrations of civilian habitation"", and the risk of contamination to the surrounding area had been minimised. More than 100 missiles were fired at the three sites The UK and US have said the strikes were successful, withPresident Trump warning of further actionif there are more chemical attacks. On Saturday, the UN Security Council rejected a resolution drafted by Russia while all Nato allies have given the military action their full support.

"Fire safety concern over short-term letsMore inspections are needed in growing holiday let market, National Fire Chiefs Council says.7h7 hours agoEngland","Fire chiefs say many short-term lets are ""essentially operating as a bed and breakfast or hotel"" The growth of home-sharing rental properties is causing fire safety concerns, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) has toldBBC Radio 5 live Investigates. Tourism industry leaders said a ""Grenfell-style incident"" could happen unless inspections were enforced. MPs have called for all properties used for short-term lets to be registered. The Short Term Accommodation Association said hosts are ""strongly recommended"" to follow safety guidance. An NFCC spokesperson said fire and rescue services are ""not aware"" of how many short-term rental properties are operating in local areas, making it ""very difficult"" to assess potential risk. They added: ""Without this knowledge of properties essentially operating as a bed and breakfast or hotel, it is almost impossible to carry out an inspection or give owners relevant advice to ensure their buildings are safe."" Fire safety law applies to all properties in which people are paying to stay. In 2017, a flat rented out on Airbnb in Plymouth was called a ""deathtrap"" after a fire inspection discovered it had toxic tiles, faulty locks and a fire extinguisher that had not been tested for more than 15 years. The owner was given a six-month suspended sentence. The property was taken off Airbnb, and has since been blocked from returning. A cramped bedroom in the Plymouth Airbnb property found to have broken fire safety rules Paul Bray, fire safety manager with Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, said the host showed a ""lack of regard for life"". ""People aren't aware of their rights to be protected from fire - and they will stay in places where the minimum standards are not being met,"" he added. ""We are concerned that there are a lot of properties like this out there."" Kate Nicholls, of the UK Hospitality and Tourism Alliance, said there was a large volume of evidence suggesting that commercial landlords were using online home-sharing sites to rent out large properties all year round. ""We are potentially risking a Grenfell-type tragedy that would be disastrous for families and further damage our reputation as a safe, attractive tourist destination."" Some short-term lets are advertised as ""party houses"" There has been huge growth in the home-share rental market. According to the Residential Landlords' Association, Airbnb listings in 10 UK cities increased by almost 200% between 2015 and 2017 to more than 210,000 - which is more than 10 times the number of traditional bed and breakfasts. In March, MPs on the parliamentary group for tourism said ""all businesses offering accommodation should compete on a level playing field"" when it comes to regulation. But the B&B Association said there was currently a ""total and utter lack of enforcement"" of safety regulations in the short-term lettings market. Chairman David Weston said: ""The authorities only inspect high-risk Airbnb style properties if someone complains, which is hugely unlikely, or if there is a fire."" Merilee Karr from the Short Term Accommodation Association said her members, which include Airbnb, have adopted the health and safety standards from the long-let industry. ""We strongly recommend hosts to follow the guidance the industry offers all our hosts,"" she said. ""Wherever we find instances where those standards aren't being met we address them with urgency.""

New UKIP leader announces plans to quit,"UKIP has confirmed Gerard Batten as its new leader - and he has said he will resign in 12 months' time. The MEP, who had been interim leader since February. said that as he was elected unopposed he would step down so a full contest can take place. Mr Batten said he will ""concentrate on doing all I can to restore the party's fortunes."" He is the fourth person to lead UKIP in 19 months, as the party's popularity has crumbled since the EU referendum. He took over from Henry Bolton in February after a racism row saw Mr Bolton ousted from the party. What to look out for in May's local elections Ex-UKIP leader 'to set up new party' Mr Batten, who has been an MEP since 2004, said he was ""pleased"" to have been confirmed as leader. ""UKIP is the only real opposition to our political establishment, and we are needed now as much as ever,"" he said. He added that the party needs to get ""back into the political fight"" with the upcoming local elections. ""I will not make any extravagant promises. ""We are essentially a volunteer organisation and we have a difficult task ahead; one which will require a lot of commitment and work,"" he said. While there have been four different UKIP leaders since the referendum, the leadership has changed hands six times. Nigel Farage, the party's most famous figure, stepped down after the Brexit vote, only to resume his post when his successor Diane James quit after less than a month at the helm. Paul Nuttall then assumed the role, but quit when UKIP performed badly in the 2017 general election. Steve Crowther was then acting leader until Mr Bolton was elected in September. Mr Batten took over after a row in which Mr Bolton's girlfriend Jo Marney was expelled from the party following allegations she had sent racist messages about Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's fiancÃ©e. Before the scandal over alleged racist messages, Mr Bolton had faced calls to quit when he left his wife for Ms Marney. The party has also suffered a funding crisis and wassaved from insolvency by public donations. Mr Batten said as interim leader he had ""made a number of decisions that have put the party on a firm footing financially and organisationally"".

Genes found for deadly heart condition,"Scientists looked at the genes of people with pulmonary arterial hypertension to find out what was causing the condition Scientists say they have identified genes that cause a deadly heart condition that can only be cured by transplants of the heart or lungs. Pulmonary arterial hypertension kills 50% of those affected within five years, but little was known about what caused the condition in some people. Now experts say they have discovered five genes that cause the illness. The findings could lead to earlier detection of the disease and ultimately new treatments, researchers say. Thousands 'unaware of sudden death risk' New blood test to spot heart conditions Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) currently affects around 6,500 people in the UK and causes the arteries carrying blood from the heart to their lungs to stiffen and thicken, ultimately leading to heart failure. It is often diagnosed in people who have other heart or lung conditions, but it can affect people of any age and in about a fifth of people there is no obvious cause. The only ""cure"" is a transplant of the heart and particularly the lungs, but there is a waiting list for organ transplants and the body will often ultimately reject them, particularly in the case of lungs. For thislatest research, published in Nature Communications,external, scientists carried out the largest ever genetic study of the disease by analysing the genomes - the unique sequence of a person's DNA - of more than 1,000 PAH patients for whom the cause of the illness was unknown. They found that mutations in five genes were responsible for causing the illness in these people, including in four genes that were not previously known to be involved in the disease. In people with the condition these genes fail to effectively produce the proteins that are required for the structure, function and regulation of the body's tissues, researchers found. Nick Morrell, the lead author of the paper and professor at the British Heart Foundation, told BBC News: ""Identifying the nature of these new genes and mutations in the new genes tells you what causes the disease. ""It allows you to design and come up with potential new ways of treating the disease because you have really well-grounded knowledge about what's actually causing it in cases where you find these mutations,"" he explained. Wendy Callaghan was diagnosed with the condition five years ago Wendy Callaghan, from west London, was diagnosed with PAH in 2013 after doctors became concerned about her persistent chest infection. Her sister died from the condition 27 years ago at the age of 36, and her grandmother also died from a similar heart condition. Wendy, who participated in the trial, has been told she has the genetic version of the illness and is now waiting to learn if her daughters and grandchildren have inherited the same deadly condition. The 58-year-old said: ""Even children can get it. People should be more aware of it and look out for the signs and persist with it if they think their child is not well. ""Especially as it does run in families, some people if they don't know they've got it could be passing those genes on to the next generation,"" Wendy added. The research was part of a pilot study for the100,000 Genomes Project,external- a huge initiative focused on understanding the genetics of cancer and rare diseases. Prof Morrell said such genetic studies were helping to transform our understanding of rare diseases. He said: ""Often people with rare diseases go to lots of different specialists, everybody is scratching their head a bit, we don't know what the cause is, therefore it's hard to find a treatment for it. ""Now being able to [genetically] sequence people with rare diseases at scale allows you to push the genetics into the clinic and into the families, and it also gives you a cause for the disease which you can potentially do something about,"" he said. Darren Griffin, professor of genetics at the University of Kent, who was not involved in the study, said the research was ""one of the big successes"" of the 100,000 Genome Project. He said: ""By studying the role of rare genetic variation in diseases, we come to a better understanding of the disease pathology itself, which can aid in early diagnosis and in tailoring treatment regimes.""

"First Rohingya family 'returns to Myanmar'Despite a UN warning, Myanmar says a family of five refugees has returned to Rakhine state.","In neighbouring Bangladesh, sprawling camps house a city-sized population of refugees Myanmar says it has repatriated the first family of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh, despite a UN warning that it is not safe to return. Some 700,000 Rohingya have fled across the border to escape a brutal military campaign that began last August. The UN has accused Myanmar of ""ethnic cleansing"" - a charge it denies. Myanmar says five members of a family arrived at a ""repatriation camp"" on Saturday, and were provided with supplies and ID cards. If confirmed, this would be the first group of Rohingya repatriated to Myanmar since the crisis began. The Myanmar government says it has been engaged in a justified campaign against Rohingya militants in Rakhine state. Earlier this month, itsentenced seven soldiers to prison terms for involvement in the killing of 10 Rohingyamen. Refugees fleeing the country into neighbouring Bangladesh, however, said that such acts were widespread - describing indiscriminate killings, rape, and the burning of villages. Is refugee crisis 'textbook ethnic cleansing'? Children's games and bitterness in Bangladesh's 'no man's land' 'Military land grab' in Rakhine - Amnesty The Rohingya are a mostly Muslim minority ethnic group in Myanmar. They are not recognised by the state, which denies them citizenship and considers them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Analysis by Nick Beake, Myanmar correspondent A series of posed photographs posted by the Burmese government on Facebook show a man, two women and two children being presented with ID cards with the Myanmar flag in the background. They're also seen apparently getting medical checks and being interviewed by army officials in uniform. The first Rohingya family to return to Rakhine State would certainly be a symbolic moment. But the truth is we know little about these people in the photos and the UN is yet to independently confirm their story. Who are they? Why did they want to return? What guarantee for their safety? Certainly, many of the Rohingya in Cox's Bazar who give harrowing accounts of rape and murder at the hands of the Burmese military have no intention of going back to the place they called home. And for those who do, they could well end up stuck in displacement camps for years - which is what happened to previous waves of returnees after earlier outbreaks of violence. Photos released by Myanmar authorities on Saturday showed what it called a ""Muslim"" family receiving National Verification Cards. The state does not use the word Rohingya. The card is a form of ID that does not grant citizenship, and has been rejected by Rohingya leaders in the Bangladesh camps. This video can not be played Watch: Drone footage from the DEC shows the extent of sprawling camps on the Bangladesh border On Saturday, just a day before Myanmar's announcement of the Rohingya family's arrival,the UN refugee agency warned,externalthat conditions in Myanmar were ""not yet conducive for returns to be safe, dignified, and sustainable"". Hatred and despair in an ancient kingdom ""Refugees in Bangladesh have said that before considering return to Myanmar, they would need to see concrete progress in relation to their legal status and citizenship, security, and their ability to enjoy basic rights at home in Rakhine State,"" the agency said.

Syria warned US still 'locked and loaded',"This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded President Donald Trump has warned Syria's government the US is ""locked and loaded"" to strike again if it carries out chemical attacks. The warning came after the US, UK and France struck three Syrian sites in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack in the town of Douma a week ago. Syria denies any chemical use and says that attack was fabricated by rebels. A UN Security Council vote brought by Syria's ally, Russia, to condemn the US-led strikes was rejected. The wave of strikes represents the most significant attack against President Bashar al-Assad's government by Western powers in seven years of Syria's civil war. While Western powers have supported rebels from early on in the war, they have not intervened directly against Syrian government forces. Catch up on the strikes: What was targeted? PM faces 'almighty row' over strikes UK publishes legal case for Syria action What Trump said After the failure of the Russian motion, the US, UK and France circulated a new draft resolution to UN Security Council members, calling for an independent investigation into Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons, AFP news agency reported. Similar previous plans have been vetoed by Russia. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has blamed Russian obstruction for the need to launch military strikes, saying they left ""no practicable alternative"". This video can not be played Syria air strikes: Do they work? Inspectors from the independent Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) had already been dispatched to Damascus and they are expected to visit Douma this weekend. But the OPCW will not seek to establish - and publicly announce - who was responsible for the attack, which is what the UK, US and France want to see. The new, Western-drafted resolution calls for the OPCW to release their report within 30 days. Syria's Assistant Foreign Minister Ayman Sousan told the BBC his government welcomed the OPCW delegation. ""The work of the mission is in the interest of the Syrian state as it will uncover the lies, hypocrisy and the misinformation of the sides which had promoted the alleged use of chemical weapons,"" he said. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told the BBC the strikes in Syria were meant to signal that ""enough is enough""and their ""primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons"". Russia has said it believes the attack in Douma was staged. An emergency meeting was held by the UN Security Council on Saturday, leading to some bitter exchanges. Russia sought to secure a collective condemnation of the early morning air strikes. However, out of the 15-member council, only China and Bolivia voted in favour of the Russian resolution. Russia's UN envoy, Vasily Nebenzia, read out a quote from President Vladimir Putin accusing the US, UK and France of ""cynical disdain"" in acting without waiting for the OPCW's findings. US envoy Nikki Haley said she had spoken to President Trump: ""And he said: 'If the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded.'"" She added: ""We cannot stand by and let Russia trash every international norm and allow use of chemical weapons to go unanswered."" Syrian envoy Bashar Jaafari called the US, UK and France ""liars, spoilers and hypocrites"" who exploited the UN ""to pursue... [their] policy of interference and colonialism"". The future of the Syrian war: Can Trump move on? Will the West's attack sway Assad? CBS News reporter Seth Doane visited one of the targets in Damascus on Saturday afternoon, and found it to be a smouldering pile of rubble. The Barzeh complex appears to be totally destroyed The Barzeh complex is, according to the US, a centre for development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons. Syria denies this. Elsewhere, the Syrian army announced on Saturday that the Eastern Ghouta region, where Douma is situated, had been cleared of the last rebel fighters and was fully retaken. He tweeted early on Saturday, hailing the strikes as ""perfectly executed"". He also thanked the UK and France. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The following Iraqi insurgency questioned the validity of the statement. Were the Syria air strikes legal? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Fall of Eastern Ghouta - a pivotal moment for Assad At a Pentagon briefing on Saturday, Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie listed the three targets that had been struck, saying the attacks had ""set the Syrian chemical weapons programme back years"". This video can not be played Gen Kenneth McKenzie: ""We deployed 105 weapons"" Gen McKenzie said about 40 Syrian defence missiles were fired, mostly after the targets were hit, and none successfully engaged planes or missiles. The Pentagon briefing contradicted information given at a Russian defence ministry briefing, which said 103 cruise missiles had been launched and 71 were shot down by Syrian systems. Both the Russians and the US said there were no reported casualties. Syria says three people were hurt near Homs. The US said it had communicated with Russia ahead of the strikes through the normal procedures of their ""deconfliction"" hotline, but no details of the attacks were given. There had been concerns that if the allied strikes had hit Russian military personnel, it would have further escalated tension. The US says the scale of the strikes was about ""double"" what was launched in April 2017 after achemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed more than 80 people. What was hit in Syria?

RAF used 'fire and forget' missilesVideoVideoSyria air strikes: Views from the UKVideoVideoMissile strikes: Before and afterVideoVideo'I panicked and texted my mum',"An RAF Tornado returns to its Cyprus base in 2014 The RAF crews involved in the overnight strikes on a Syrian chemical weapons target were well prepared for this operation. For the past three years they've regularly been carrying out bombing missions against the group known as Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria. For that they've been able to fly directly over targets in uncontested airspace dropping Paveway bombs or firing their smaller Brimstone missiles. But this time there were greater risks. Unlike IS, both the Syrian regime and its ally Russia have sophisticated air defences. If the RAF Tornados flew directly over their target there was the added danger they'd become a target too. That's why they used their Stormshadow cruise missiles. These ""fire and forget"" weapons can be pre-programmed. They use GPS mapping to find their target and have a range of up to 300 miles. The RAF Tornados which can carry two Stormshadows could stay well clear of any threat. The Stormshadow was first used in anger during the Iraq invasion in 2003. More recently it's been fired during the campaign to remove Libya's Colonel Gaddafi and on a rare occasion against IS too. Live: Western airstrikes on Syria UK 'confident' of Syria air strike success Watch: Eyewitness describes moment missiles struck The cruise missile is 5m long, weighs 1300kg and flies at speeds up to 1000km/h. It's difficult to shoot down. Once fired from the Tornado it would have flown low. When close to the target it climbs before making a final dive to penetrate its target before setting off the main warhead. In the past, the Stormshadow has been used to hit hardened targets such as concrete bunkers. The target this time was a chemical weapons facility 15 miles west of Homs. The Ministry of Defence says it believes the Assad regime had been using the former missiles base to store the precursors to make chemical weapons. Both Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and the prime minister say they believe the strike was a ""success"", although it'll take time to analyse satellite imagery to make the final Battle Damage Assessment. In terms of the quantity of missiles, the eight fired by Britain was well behind the US and France. But these strikes were not just a show of force. They were a a show of solidarity with allies trying to make a stand against the use of chemical weapons. Reaction - Western powers strike Syria targets Will Western strikes sway Syria's Assad?

Can Trump walk away after air strikes?,"The US leader has all but admitted the broader Syrian war is not a US interest Former US Assistant Secretary of State P.J Crowley says President Trump will be content to count the strikes as a victory and move on, but it's unclear if Syria, Russia and Iran will let him: As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump pledged: ""If I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me."" A year ago, as president, Mr Trump ordered a military strike involving 58 cruise missiles in response to a deadly sarin gas attack on civilians, and he essentially redeemed the red line that his predecessor, Barack Obama, drew in 2013. While Mr Trump received plaudits for his willingness to employ military force, if he expected that show of force to deter the further use of chemical weapons by Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in this brutal civil war, he was wrong. Follow live: Western powers strike Syria targets Four RAF fighters join Syria air strikes Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Secretary of Defence James Mattis acknowledged as much Friday night, that despite last year's strike Syria has continued to employ chemical weapons, most recently against an opposition stronghold outside Damascus. Mr Assad, he said, ""did not get the message last year"". So Mr Trump, together with British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron, launched coordinated military strikes against Syria's chemical weapons infrastructure, including a research centre, storage facility and command post. There is a new red line, but what is the message behind it? What are the odds that Syria, and its key international backers Russia and Iran, will heed it? And what are the consequences if they don't? This video can not be played Moment cruise missiles were launched from a French naval ship Mr Trump, Mrs May and Mr Macron have actually drawn a sharper red line than Mr Obama did â no further use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war, including chlorine barrel bombs that Syria has used routinely over seven years. While the latest strikes were described as a ""one-time shot,"" Mr Trump threatened to take further military action should Syria use chemical weapons in the future. ""We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents,"" Mr Trump said. Mr Trump was surprisingly understated Friday night in his comments regarding Russia and Iran. In the immediate aftermath of the Syrian chemical attack, Mr Trump promised that not just Syria, but Russia and Iran as well would ""pay a price"" for again violating international norms. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack If so, it will be through a different means. Friday's strikes targeted Syria's chemical weapons capability, but were specifically designed to avoid Russian and Iranian forces, avoiding the risk of an unwanted confrontation and possible escalation. Instead, he called on both Russia and Iran to re-evaluate their support for Assad, saying that nations are ""judged by the friends they keep."" PM has chosen which way to jump on Syria What can Western military intervention achieve? Were the Syria air strikes legal? While Mr Trump directly criticized Russia for failing to guarantee the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons as it promised in 2013, he incongruously suggested that the door was still open to better relations, even with Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and its recent use of a nerve agent against a former intelligence operative in London. ""Hopefully, someday we'll get along with Russia and maybe even Iran, but maybe not,"" he said. There is little prospect of cooperation regarding Syria because the two sides continue to wage different wars there. Both Russia's Putin (L) and Iran's Rouhani view Syria as a vital interest Both Russia and Iran consider Syria, and at least for now Mr Assad's survival, as a vital interest. Mr Assad's position has strengthened considerably in the year between Mr Trump's military strikes. Friday night's military action was designed to thread a pretty narrow needle - place boundaries around the war Syria, Russia and Iran are waging - without becoming a direct combatant in it. The US and its European partners have a narrower military interest in Syria - the defeat of the Islamic State caliphate, a task that is nearing completion. Just two weeks ago, Mr Trump stated his intention to bring home the roughly 2,000 US personnel deployed to Syria as quickly as possible, only to confront the chemical attack on Douma. Mr Trump said it was not up to the US to fix the Middle East Even with the new red line - Trump did declare the deterrence of the use of chemical weapons to be a ""vital national security interest of the United States"" - he all but admitted that the broader Syrian civil war was not. He described the Middle East as a ""troubled place"" and reiterated it was not the role of the US to fix it. ""We cannot purge the world of evil or act everywhere there is tyranny,"" he said, adding: ""The fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people."" Will Western strikes sway Syria's Assad? Mr Trump will be content to count this as a victory and move on - he has already declared ""Mission Accomplished!"" in a follow-up tweet - but that depends on Syria, Russia and Iran and whether they get the message this time. Of course, the last time an American president employed those words, it represented a serious misreading of the challenge he confronted. But Syria isn't Iraq. It's actually much more complicated.

Photo fingerprint 'revolution' for forceA drug dealer was convicted from a photograph he sent to customers of ecstasy pills in his palm.7h7 hours agoWales,"This video can not be played 'Drugs for sale' message catches man dealing to Bridgend A pioneering fingerprint technique used to convict a drugs gang from a WhatsApp message ""is the future"" of how police approach evidence to catch criminals. An image of a man holding ecstasy tablets in his palm was found on the mobile of someone arrested in Bridgend. It was sent to South Wales Police's scientific support unit and helped to secure 11 convictions. These are believed to be the first convictions in Wales from fingerprints taken from a photograph. The unit's Dave Thomas described its use as ""groundbreaking"" and said officers are now looking more closely at photographs on phones seized for potential evidence. 'Ecstasy pills for sale' in WhatsApp message Teens found selling drugs on Snapchat and Instagram How drugs are offered on Instagram He said: ""It is an old-fashioned technique [fingerprinting], not new. ""Ultimately, beyond everything else, we took a phone and looked at everything on it - we knew it had a hand with drugs on it. ""These guys [the dealers] are using the technology not to get caught and we need to keep up with advancements."" The photograph came to light after a tip-off drugs were being sold from a house in the Kenfig Hill area of Bridgend. Elliott Morris of Redditch, Worcestershire, was sentenced to eight and a half years for conspiracy to supply cannabis. He headed a family operation with his father Darren getting 27 months and mother, Dominique, 12 months It was raided and large quantities of 'gorilla glue' - a type of cannabis - was recovered. Mr Thomas praised the officer that spotted a photograph among a stream of WhatsApp messages going back months as potentially carrying significant evidence. ""It had a number of texts such as 'what do you want to buy?' on it,"" he said. ""There was then the photograph of the hand holding pills that seemed like it was sent to potential customers saying 'these are my wares, I'm selling these'. ""But he was not thinking it showed part of his hand and there was potentially a fingerprint."" The scientific support unit - a joint venture between the Gwent and south Wales forces, based in Bridgend - was able to scan the image into its system. However, there were just parts of the middle and bottom of a finger visible - records only keep the top part. This meant the image did not find a match on national databases. Drug dealer Elliott Morris sent this photograph out on a Whatsapp message to potential customers in Bridgend However, other evidence meant officers had an idea who they believed was behind the drugs operation. ""While the scale and quality of the photograph proved a challenge, the small bits were enough to prove he was the dealer,"" added Mr Thomas. ""It has now opened the floodgates and when there is part of a hand on a photograph, officers are sending them in."" He believes it is the first time someone's fingerprint has been identified by a photograph in Wales and shows the potential of a forensic unit with a small piece of evidence. Mr Thomas pointed to how about 80% of people now have mobile phones and use them to record incidents such as fights and car crashes. ""We can download and enhance (footage),"" he said. ""These are all advancements in the digital world - they provide lots of questions we need to provide answers for."" Making greater use of social media messages is just one area being developed. ""We want to be in a position where there is a burglary at 20:30, we can scan evidence and by 20:45 be waiting at the offender's front door and arrest them arriving home with the swag,"" he added. ""That will work through remote transmission - scanning evidence at the scene and sending it back quickly for a match. ""It's the future. We are not there yet but it could significantly enhance the ability of the local bobbies to arrest people very quickly.""

Mali militants attack in UN disguiseOne genuine UN peacekeeper is dead and many French soldiers are wounded after the attack.,"UN peacekeepers stand guard at a hotel entrance in Bamako, Mali, in 2015 A rocket and car bomb attack on French and UN soldiers in Mali has left one person dead and many others injured. Militants disguised as UN peacekeepers - in distinctive blue helmets and driving a vehicle marked with the UN logo - struck two bases near the airport in Timbuktu. The UN mission confirmed one of its peacekeepers had been killed. More than a dozen others, including many French soldiers, were wounded, according to the government. In a statement, the security ministry said the attack involved dozens of rockets fired by militants ""wearing blue helmets"". Two vehicles were also packed with explosives. One of the vehicles exploded, the ministry said, while the other, bearing the UN symbol, was stopped. The ministry said that while five people were seriously injured, the fighting had ended and the situation was under control. Attacks against UN peacekeepers and government forces are common in Mali, a former French colony which also has a French military presence. World's most dangerous peacekeeping mission Mali peace deal gives way to chaos But one foreign security source told the AFP news agency the scale of the most recent assault was ""unprecedented"" in Timbuktu. ""We've never seen an attack like this,"" a separate official from the Timbuktu governorate said. The UN mission has been deployed in Mali since a 2013 Tuareg separatist uprising. It has more than 11,000 troops and 1,741 police, and is considered one of the UN's most dangerous missions. Before Saturday's rocket and car bomb attack, 162 UN personnel had been killed in the five years since the mission began. Seven peacekeepers have been killed this year.

The IRFU/Ulster Rugby statement said: ""In arriving at this decision, the Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby acknowledge our responsibility and commitment to the core values of the game: Respect, inclusivity and integrity. ""It has been agreed, as part of this commitment, to conduct an in-depth review of existing structures and educational programmes, within the game in Ireland, to ensure the importance of these core values is clearly understood, supported and practised at every level of the game."" Paddy Jackson has played 25 times for Ireland at outhalf They also said that Ulster and Ireland winger Craig Gilroy has been sanctioned over a text message he sent to Stuart Olding. He will be unavailable for selection by Ulster until 26 April 2018. Mr Jackson and Mr Olding were cleared of raping the same woman in Mr Jackson's house in the early hours of 28 June 2016. Two other men, Blane McIlroy, who was accused of exposure, and Rory Harrison, who was charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information, were also found not guilty. In a statement to the Press Association Mr Jackson said he was ""deeply disappointed"" about the outcome of the IRFU and Ulster Rugby's internal review, which was announced after the rape trial ended. ""However, I recognise that my behaviour has fallen far short of the values expected of me as an international player, a role model for the game of rugby and as a son and a brother.  I am truly sorry,"" he said. Mr Jackson, pictured here in 2013, said it is with ""sadness and regret"" that he is leaving Ulster Rugby ""Since I was a young boy it was my ambition to play for Ulster and Ireland and I am extremely proud, privileged and honoured to have done so. ""It is therefore with great sadness and regret, but with many cherished memories, that I leave that behind."" Mr Olding also issued a statement: ""It is with regret that I have been informed that the IRFU have decided to revoke my contract."" He added: ""I very much wished to continue to have the opportunity to represent them [Ulster and Ireland]. Stuart Olding said ""influences outside of my contractual arrangement"" have made it impossible for him to continue playing for Ulster and Ireland ""Regrettably, influences outside of my contractual arrangement have made it impossible for that to happen. ""I said outside court that the Stuart Olding that you read about in the trial is not the real Stuart Olding. ""The treatment that I have received since my acquittal, both fair and unfair, has made me even more determined to prove myself. ""With the support of my family and friends I shall seek new challenges elsewhere.  I bear no-one any ill will."" On Sunday, a former Ulster and Ireland rugby player told the BBC that he sensed anger among fans in the wake of the decision to let the players go. Paddy Wallace said such supporters may now ""vote with their feet"" as they believe their views were not taken into consideration. Describing the decision as one that was motivated by money, Mr Wallace said: ""Ulster felt they needed to protect their sponsors rather than the players involved. Paddy Wallace said some fans believe their views were not reflected in the decision ""That could come back to bite them, because a lot of the supporters are thinking: 'Do I renew my season ticket, do I come to the games, do I put money across the bar?' ""The CEO [Shane Logan] has been invisible through this whole process and a lot of fans are very disgruntled about that. ""Some are feeling a disconnect and the easiest thing to do is vote with their feet."" Ulster players have expressed their""sadness"" at the departures of Paddy Jackson and Stuart Oldingfollowing the termination of their contracts. On Friday evening, hundreds of peoplestaged a protestoutside the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast ahead of Ulster Rugby's match against Ospreys. The rally was organised by Belfast Feminist Network. Dozens of people staged a protest outside the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast on Friday night Last week, a crowd-funded advertisement was taken out in a Belfast newspapercalling for Mr Jackson and Mr Olding to be droppedby Ulster and Ireland. It described the Whatsapp messages that emerged during the trial as ""reprehensible"". Mr Jacksonlater apologised for the messages. However, a separate advert was published days later, calling on Ulster and Irish rugby to reinstate ""innocent men"" to playing duties. That advert was signed by ""real fans standing up for the Ulster men"". On Thursday,one of Ulster Rugby's key sponsors, Bank of Ireland, said it was ""highly concerned""by issues arising out of the rape trial. In a statement on Saturday, it said: ""We welcome the in-depth review of structures and education programmes which has been announced today, and look forward to the recommendations which arise being put into effect.""

Mali militants attack in UN disguise,"UN peacekeepers stand guard at a hotel entrance in Bamako, Mali, in 2015 A rocket and car bomb attack on French and UN soldiers in Mali has left one person dead and many others injured. Militants disguised as UN peacekeepers - in distinctive blue helmets and driving a vehicle marked with the UN logo - struck two bases near the airport in Timbuktu. The UN mission confirmed one of its peacekeepers had been killed. More than a dozen others, including many French soldiers, were wounded, according to the government. In a statement, the security ministry said the attack involved dozens of rockets fired by militants ""wearing blue helmets"". Two vehicles were also packed with explosives. One of the vehicles exploded, the ministry said, while the other, bearing the UN symbol, was stopped. The ministry said that while five people were seriously injured, the fighting had ended and the situation was under control. Attacks against UN peacekeepers and government forces are common in Mali, a former French colony which also has a French military presence. World's most dangerous peacekeeping mission Mali peace deal gives way to chaos But one foreign security source told the AFP news agency the scale of the most recent assault was ""unprecedented"" in Timbuktu. ""We've never seen an attack like this,"" a separate official from the Timbuktu governorate said. The UN mission has been deployed in Mali since a 2013 Tuareg separatist uprising. It has more than 11,000 troops and 1,741 police, and is considered one of the UN's most dangerous missions. Before Saturday's rocket and car bomb attack, 162 UN personnel had been killed in the five years since the mission began. Seven peacekeepers have been killed this year.

World won't ignore toxic warfare - Johnson,"This video can not be played Primary purpose of Syria air strikes was ""to say no to the use of barbaric weapons"", says Boris Johnson Air strikes in Syria were about saying ""enough is enough"" over the use of chemical weapons, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said. Mr Johnson said the action by the US, UK and France would not ""turn the tide"" of the conflict and was not about regime change. But he said he hoped it would act as a deterrent to more ""barbaric"" chemical attacks. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has questioned the legality of the action. He called for new legislation to ensure MPs get a vote before future military action is taken, and said he would only back intervention in Syria if the United Nations backed it. Conservatives said this would never happen due to Russia using its veto at the UN. Trump defends 'mission accomplished' claim As it happened: Western powers strike Syria targets Theresa May: Syria statement in full Syria air strikes: Were they legal? Downing Street has publishedits legal case for its part in the strikes, which targeted military bases. Sites near Damascus and Homs were hit in response to an alleged chemical attack on the town of Douma on 7 April. This video can not be played Masa, survivor of suspected chemical attack: ""Instead of breathing air, we breathed the smell of blood"" Both Syria and Russia - which provides military support to the Syrian government - have reacted angrily to the action. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Johnson stressed the ""limits"" of the intervention were to stop an apparent erosion of the ""taboo"" of chemical weapons. ""The rest of the Syrian war must proceed as it will,"" he said, adding that the ""primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons"". Mr Johnson said he did not know how Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would respond, adding that if there was a repeat chemical attack, ""clearly, with allies, we would study what the options were"". This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded Opposition parties have criticised the lack of a parliamentary vote before the air strikes. Mr Johnson promised MPs would ""have their say"" when Theresa May makes a Commons statement on Monday. Mr Corbyn told the Marr show Mrs May ""could easily"" have recalled Parliament or delayed her decision until MPs returned on Monday. The Barzah Research and Development Centre before the air strike The Barzah Research and Development Centre after the air strike He also called for a War Powers Act, ""so governments do get held accountable to Parliament for what they do in our name"". He added that Labour would continue to push for a debate and a vote on the intervention, describing it as ""policy made up by Twitter"", in a reference to the US president's tweets ahead of the air strikes. Mr Corbyn said he would only ""countenance"" getting involved in the Syrian conflict with the backing of the United Nations. This video can not be played Corbyn: Trump should pick up the phone to Putin The UN has so far failed to agree a unified response, with the US and Russia blocking each other's proposals last week. Pushed on whether he would authorise the use of force if he was prime minister, the Labour leader said ""no-one would ever say never"", adding: ""If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. ""That surely would save a lot of lives."" Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis accused Mr Corbyn of failing to ""recognise what has actually been happening"". ""He knows full well Russia veto at UN,"" he tweeted. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were grilled about the Syria conflict on the Andrew Marr show Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the legal basis for the intervention as ""thin"". ""Air strikes may make Western leaders feel that they're doing something,"" she said. ""In this case it feels as if it's more to do with a macho strongman stand-off between Trump and Putin than it is to do with really delivering peace in Syria. That should not be the criteria against which decisions about UK military action is taken."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable told Sky News he was not ""quibbling about the legality"" of the UK's action in Syria, but added: ""My questioning of the government is to the wisdom of proceeding the way it did without building up a consensus and a case in this country."" The UK believes the Assad regime was responsible forthe attack on civilians in Douma, while the US and France say they have proof. But Syria has always denied any chemical use and says the attack was fabricated by rebels. On Saturday, the Ministry of Defence said eight Storm Shadow missiles had been launched by four RAF Tornados at a former missile base, 15 miles west of Homs. It is thought President Bashar al-Assad's regime had been stockpiling materials used to make chemical weapons there, it said. A spokesperson added the facility was located ""some distance"" from ""concentrations of civilian habitation"", and the risk of contamination to the surrounding area had been minimised. More than 100 missiles were fired at the three sites The UK and US have said the strikes were successful, withPresident Trump warning of further actionif there are more chemical attacks. On Saturday, the UN Security Council rejected a resolution drafted by Russia while all Nato allies have given the military action their full support.

WPP chief Sir Martin Sorrell steps down,"The head of WPP, the world's largest advertising agency, has stepped down after an internal investigation into claims of personal misconduct. Chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell ran WPP for 33 years, becoming the highest paid boss of a FTSE 100 company. Sir Martin said WPP had been his passion, but it was in ""the best interests of the business"" to resign. The probe into alleged misuse of WPP money - which he rejects - is over, WPP said. No more details were disclosed. The chairman, Roberto Quarta, will become executive chairman and work with two co-chief operating officers until a new chief executive is appointed. Sir Martin, aged 73, once said he would ""carry on until they carry me out of the glue factory"". The ad king who shaped an industry What now for the global ad giant? He was the longest serving chief executive of a FTSE 100 firm by far, and the best rewarded. In 2015 he faced an unsuccessful shareholder revolt over a Â£70m pay package. WPP said Sir Martin would be treated as having retired, so will receive any payments and share awards due under his contract. Earlier this month it was disclosed that WPP had appointed a law firm toinvestigate claims of financial impropriety.While Sir Martin rejected the allegation ""unreservedly"", he accepted ""the company has to investigate it"". WPP's statement, released late on Saturday, said: ""The previously announced investigation into an allegation of misconduct against Sir Martin has concluded. The allegation did not involve amounts that are material."" The company did not disclose further details about the claim. One source told the BBC on Sunday that the sums involved were less than Â£1m. Although Sir Martin is deemed to have ""retired"" this was not the outcome he wanted. His legacy as one of the titans of the advertising industry is secure - he built a Â£20bn global business from scratch and amassed a personal fortune. In the end, it was the trends in world business that wrong-footed the sprawling empire he created. The old advertising firms have been rendered less important by the sheer reach and analytics available by platforms like Google and Facebook. By his own admission, WPP got ""walloped"" last year and the company has lost a third of its value. If it hadn't, it's possible he could have survived the recent investigation into his conduct involving amounts of company money. But shareholders were getting restless, he had lost the unanimous backing of the board and at 73, he is no spring chicken. He has enormous energy and you wouldn't put it past him to create a new media empire. But his life's work, WPP - a company he was often accused of treating as his own - will now be run by someone else. Read more from Simon here Sir Martin said: ""The current disruption is simply putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business, our over 200,000 people and their 500,000 or so dependents, and the clients we serve in 112 countries. ""That is why I have decided that in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all share owners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside."" Mr Quarta described Sir Martin as being the ""driving force"" behind WPP's growth and thanked him for his commitment to the business. His departure comes at a difficult time for WPP, which faces intense competition from the likes of Google and Facebook as more advertising moves online. WPP shares have fallen 32% in the past 12 months, valuing the company at Â£15bn, as sales and profits guidance were downgraded. Earlier this year, consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, the world's largest advertiser and one of WPP's biggest clients, vowed to cut spending and bring more control in-house. A lack of succession planning about who will take over after the 73-year-old's retirement has also caused some anxiety among WPP shareholders. Formed WPP in 1985 after taking control of a shell company, Wire & Plastic Products, and established it as a marketing services group in 1986 Oversaw growth of company which now has 3,000 offices in 112 countries Born in London, he read economics at Christ's College, Cambridge University One of UK's top-paid executives. His pay package in 2015-16 was Â£70m - then the biggest in UK corporate history. He received Â£48m in 2016 Sir Martin was knighted by the Queen in 2000 Last year's Sunday Times' Rich List put Sir Martin's wealth at Â£495m Sir Martin and his family own about 2% of WPP. WPP, originally called Wire and Plastic Products, was a UK manufacturer of wire baskets for the first 14 years of its life until 1985 when Sir Martin took a loan out against shares he owned in Saatchi & Saatchi and purchased a stake in the company. His aim was to turn it into a marketing company offering a one-stop-shop for all the advertising and marketing needs of big corporations. The renamed WPP Group embarked on a series of acquisitions - including of J Walter Thompson, Ogilvy & Mather, research business Taylor Nelson Sofres, and the Young & Rubicam Group. Sir Martin was born in London and educated at the Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School before going on to read economics at Christ's College, Cambridge. An MBA from Harvard followed, and Sir Martin entered the world of work at Glendinning Associates before starting at Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, becoming group finance director in 1977.

UK publishes legal case,"This video can not be played Theresa May said the UK had taken part in ""limited and targeted strikes"" Air strikes on Syria were legally justified on humanitarian grounds, government documents say. Downing Streetpublished its legal case,externalfor military action hours afterTheresa May said she was ""confident""the strikes carried out by the UK, France and the US had been successful. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the action as ""legally questionable"". Bases near Damascus and Homs were targeted in response to an alleged chemical attack on the town of Douma. Syrian state media said the military action had been ""a flagrant violation of international law"", while ally Russia's President Vladimir Putin condemned it ""in the most serious way"".

US and allies launch strikes on Syria As it happened: Western powers strike Syria targets Theresa May: Syria statement in full,external Jeremy Corbyn: Letter in full Syria air strikes: Were they legal? At a meeting of the UN's Security Council, the UK's ambassador Karen Pierce said the strikes had been ""limited, targeted and effective"", with the impact on civilians ""minimised"". She said repeated attempts to hold the Syrian regime to account had been met with Russian ""obstruction and resistance"", and the UK and its allies would ""continue to pursue a diplomatic resolution to the crisis"". The US's ambassador Nikki Haley told the council diplomacy had been given ""chance after chance"", and the US remained ""locked and loaded"". The Security Council rejected a resolution drafted by Russia, which condemned ""the aggression against the Syrian Arab Republic by the US and its allies"". A resolution needs nine votes to pass and only Russia, China and Bolivia voted in favour. Meanwhile, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said all allies had given the action their full support. Both the Pentagon and Russian defence ministry said they had no confirmation of civilian casualties while the Russians also said there were no military casualties. Speaking in Downing Street earlier, Mrs May said: ""This collective action sends a clear message that the international community will not stand by and tolerate the use of chemical weapons."" Drawing a link with the recentnerve agent attack in Salisbury, Mrs May added: ""We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised - either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere."" Mrs May will make a statement in Parliament on Monday and give MPs a chance to ask questions. Mr Corbyn said MPs should have been consulted before the strike and earlier called on the PM to ""publish in full the legal justification and basis for"" the action. Party leaders including Scotland's First MinisterNicola Sturgeon,externaland the Liberal Democrat's Sir Vince Cable said MPs should have had a vote on the action - whilePlaid Cymru's Leanne Wood,externalaccused the government of putting UK security at risk. But Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party said Mrs May had ""the full authority"" to order the air strikes. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn wants the PM to publish the legal justification for air strikes In thesummary of legal advicegiven by Attorney General Jeremy Wright to Mrs May, Downing Street outlined why the UK was ""permitted under international law"" to take measures in the face of ""overwhelming humanitarian suffering"". It said there were three reasons why the strikes met international laws for military action on humanitarian grounds: The ""repeated lethal use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime constitutes a war crime"" and it was ""highly likely the regime would seek to use"" such weapons again Other attempts to ""alleviate the humanitarian suffering caused by the use of chemical weapons"" had been blocked and there was ""no practicable alternative"" to the strikes The action was ""carefully considered"" and the ""minimum judged necessary for that purpose"" By Norman Smith, BBC chief political correspondent Ever since the war in Iraq, the legal advice received by the government has been central to the inevitable political argument over the rights and wrongs of military action. It's no surprise then that Jeremy Corbyn should hone in straight away on doubts over the legality of the air attacks. And no surprise either that Downing Street should choose to publish so swiftly a summary of the legal advice it has received - in order to avoid the sort of damaging criticism suffered by the Blair government over its refusal to do so. Equally unsurprising, the advice received by Theresa May gives her clear backing for the case for military action - citing the right of governments to act to alleviate ""overwhelming human suffering"". And just for good measure, it also suggests that the Syrian regime is guilty of a war crime and crimes against humanity over the use of chemical weapons. But will this legal advice shift public or political opinion? The Ministry of Defence said eight Storm Shadow missiles had been launched by four RAF Tornados at a former missile base, 15 miles west of Homs. It is thought President Bashar al-Assad's regime had been stockpiling materials used to make chemical weapons there, it said. A spokesperson added the facility was located ""some distance"" from ""concentrations of civilian habitation"", and the risk of contamination to the surrounding area had been minimised. Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Mrs May said she believed the strike action had been ""the right thing to do"" and was ""absolutely in Britain's national interest"". ""This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change,"" she said. ""It is about a limited and targeted strike that does not further escalate tensions in the region and that does everything possible to prevent civilian casualties."" Jonathan Beale: RAF missiles minimised risk President Trump statement in full Nicola Sturgeon: Air strikes risk dangerous escalation Syria 'chemical attack': What we know She said the UK government believed it was ""clear"" the Assad regime was responsible for the""despicable and barbaric"" attack on civilianson 7 April. Evidence suggested a barrel bomb and a regime helicopter had been used, she added. ""No other group could have carried out this attack."" This video can not be played RAF planes took off from their airbase in Cyprus ahead of the strikes in Syria Reporting from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, the BBC's Jonathan Beale said the Tornados had left the airbase in the early hours of Saturday. He added the cruise missiles had been fired ""well away from Syrian airspace"" and were out of the range of the regime's air defences. Downing Street also said Mrs May has spoken to several world leaders from countries including Germany, Canada, Australia, Jordan, Turkey, Italy and Cyprus as well as EU President Donald Tusk. A spokesman said ""all the leaders agreed"" with Mrs May about ""the importance of restoring the international norm that the use of chemical weapons is never acceptable"". Mrs May has also spoke to Mr Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron about the ""success"" of their joint mission. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Prime ministers don't choose the decisions that face them. But they have to judge which way to jump. In 2013, Theresa May's predecessor tried and failed to get approval for military action against President Assad. There was international alarm, then as now, about his suspected use of chemical weapons. But MPs rejected David Cameron's plan and he didn't try again to persuade Parliament it was necessary. This time, she has avoided that particular obstacle by taking action alongside the US and France while MPs are away. Read the full blog here. The RAF sent four Tornado GR4 aircraft from Cyprus, each armed with two Storm Shadow cruise missiles. The Tornado has been one of the mainstays of the RAF since first entering service in 1980 and the aircraft were used to enforce no-fly zones in Iraq. Weighing in at 2,866lb (1,300kg), measuring 16.7ft (5.1m) in length and with a range in excess of 150 miles (240km), the ""bunker busting"" Storm Shadow has been described by the air force as ""arguably the most advanced weapon of its kind in the world"". The range means that none of the GR4s would have been required to cross into Syrian airspace to launch the assault. The aircraft were sent from RAF Akrotiri, a British base since the 1950s on the southern side of Cyprus, some 213 miles (343km) west of Homs.

Paddy Jackson has played 25 times for Ireland at outhalf They also said that Ulster and Ireland winger Craig Gilroy has been sanctioned over a text message he sent to Stuart Olding. He will be unavailable for selection by Ulster until 26 April 2018. Mr Jackson and Mr Olding were cleared of raping the same woman in Mr Jackson's house in the early hours of 28 June 2016. Two other men, Blane McIlroy, who was accused of exposure, and Rory Harrison, who was charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information, were also found not guilty. In a statement to the Press Association Mr Jackson said he was ""deeply disappointed"" about the outcome of the IRFU and Ulster Rugby's internal review, which was announced after the rape trial ended. ""However, I recognise that my behaviour has fallen far short of the values expected of me as an international player, a role model for the game of rugby and as a son and a brother.  I am truly sorry,"" he said. Mr Jackson, pictured here in 2013, said it is with ""sadness and regret"" that he is leaving Ulster Rugby ""Since I was a young boy it was my ambition to play for Ulster and Ireland and I am extremely proud, privileged and honoured to have done so. ""It is therefore with great sadness and regret, but with many cherished memories, that I leave that behind."" Mr Olding also issued a statement: ""It is with regret that I have been informed that the IRFU have decided to revoke my contract."" He added: ""I very much wished to continue to have the opportunity to represent them [Ulster and Ireland]. Stuart Olding said ""influences outside of my contractual arrangement"" have made it impossible for him to continue playing for Ulster and Ireland ""Regrettably, influences outside of my contractual arrangement have made it impossible for that to happen. ""I said outside court that the Stuart Olding that you read about in the trial is not the real Stuart Olding. ""The treatment that I have received since my acquittal, both fair and unfair, has made me even more determined to prove myself. ""With the support of my family and friends I shall seek new challenges elsewhere.  I bear no-one any ill will."" On Sunday, a former Ulster and Ireland rugby player told the BBC that he sensed anger among fans in the wake of the decision to let the players go. Paddy Wallace said such supporters may now ""vote with their feet"" as they believe their views were not taken into consideration. Describing the decision as one that was motivated by money, Mr Wallace said: ""Ulster felt they needed to protect their sponsors rather than the players involved. Paddy Wallace said some fans believe their views were not reflected in the decision ""That could come back to bite them, because a lot of the supporters are thinking: 'Do I renew my season ticket, do I come to the games, do I put money across the bar?' ""The CEO [Shane Logan] has been invisible through this whole process and a lot of fans are very disgruntled about that. ""Some are feeling a disconnect and the easiest thing to do is vote with their feet."" Ulster players have expressed their""sadness"" at the departures of Paddy Jackson and Stuart Oldingfollowing the termination of their contracts. On Friday evening, hundreds of peoplestaged a protestoutside the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast ahead of Ulster Rugby's match against Ospreys. The rally was organised by Belfast Feminist Network. Dozens of people staged a protest outside the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast on Friday night Last week, a crowd-funded advertisement was taken out in a Belfast newspapercalling for Mr Jackson and Mr Olding to be droppedby Ulster and Ireland. It described the Whatsapp messages that emerged during the trial as ""reprehensible"". Mr Jacksonlater apologised for the messages. However, a separate advert was published days later, calling on Ulster and Irish rugby to reinstate ""innocent men"" to playing duties. That advert was signed by ""real fans standing up for the Ulster men"". On Thursday,one of Ulster Rugby's key sponsors, Bank of Ireland, said it was ""highly concerned""by issues arising out of the rape trial. In a statement on Saturday, it said: ""We welcome the in-depth review of structures and education programmes which has been announced today, and look forward to the recommendations which arise being put into effect.""

"New UKIP leader announces plans to quitGerard Batten, who was confirmed as leader on Saturday after running unopposed, will quit in 12 months.","UKIP has confirmed Gerard Batten as its new leader - and he has said he will resign in 12 months' time. The MEP, who had been interim leader since February. said that as he was elected unopposed he would step down so a full contest can take place. Mr Batten said he will ""concentrate on doing all I can to restore the party's fortunes.""

What to look out for in May's local elections Ex-UKIP leader 'to set up new party' Mr Batten, who has been an MEP since 2004, said he was ""pleased"" to have been confirmed as leader. ""UKIP is the only real opposition to our political establishment, and we are needed now as much as ever,"" he said. He added that the party needs to get ""back into the political fight"" with the upcoming local elections. ""I will not make any extravagant promises. ""We are essentially a volunteer organisation and we have a difficult task ahead; one which will require a lot of commitment and work,"" he said. While there have been four different UKIP leaders since the referendum, the leadership has changed hands six times. Nigel Farage, the party's most famous figure, stepped down after the Brexit vote, only to resume his post when his successor Diane James quit after less than a month at the helm. Paul Nuttall then assumed the role, but quit when UKIP performed badly in the 2017 general election. Steve Crowther was then acting leader until Mr Bolton was elected in September. Mr Batten took over after a row in which Mr Bolton's girlfriend Jo Marney was expelled from the party following allegations she had sent racist messages about Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's fiancÃ©e. Before the scandal over alleged racist messages, Mr Bolton had faced calls to quit when he left his wife for Ms Marney. The party has also suffered a funding crisis and wassaved from insolvency by public donations.
