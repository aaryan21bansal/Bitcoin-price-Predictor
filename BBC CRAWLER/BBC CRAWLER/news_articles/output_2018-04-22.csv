London Marathon event director Hugh Brasher said organisers distributed four-and-a-half litres of water per person - more than any other mass participation event in the world. However, he admitted water did run out at miles eight, nine and 10. Mr Brasher added that the event, which has seen more than 38,000 finishers, was ""planned thoroughly"" and organisers would see what lessons could be learnt for next year. A total of 800,000 people had been expected to turn out to run and watch Runners in fancy dress were earlier urged to ""think carefully"" if their outfit was appropriate for the weather Before the start of the race, organisers warned the high temperatures could be especially difficult for fancy dress runners.

Extra water was provided for the runners due to the hot weather One runner, Sue Strachan who has vascular dementia, said she received ""amazing"" support from people along the course. ""I have had a couple of wobbles but people from Alzheimer's Research gave me a kiss and said hello and I thought that I have to do this, even if I have to walk at the end. I need to finish."" Britain's David Weir won his eighth London Marathon in the men's wheelchair race This year's runners also includedfirefighters who tackled the Grenfell Tower blazeandpolice officer Charlie Guenigault, who was stabbedin the London Bridge terror attack. Mr Guenigault, 26, ran to raise money for King's College Hospital, where he had three hours of emergency surgery after being knifed five times on 3 June last year. ""I don't think I'm fully recovered. As much as how difficult the race was, at the end of the day I'm just glad to say I can do it,"" he said. The first fire crew to arrive at the Grenfell Tower inferno ran the race as a team, raising more than Â£41,000 for children affected by the disaster. Firefighter Mike Dowden said: ""The people we were running for were on the last mile and that was really emotional.""

Bloomberg offers to fund Paris climate deal,"Michael Bloomberg says he hopes the US will rejoin the climate agreement Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he will pay $4.5m (Â£3.2m) to cover some of the lapsed US commitment to the Paris climate accord. He said he had a responsibility to help improve the environment because of President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the deal. The withdrawal was announced last June and sparked international condemnation. It will make the US in effect the only country not to be part of the Paris accord. The Paris agreement commits the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris climate deal explained Will US cities tackle climate change? What is climate change? As part of the agreement, the US had pledged $3bn to the Green Climate Fund, set up by the UN to help countries deal with the effects of global warming. The money promised by Mr Bloomberg does not aim to cover this, but the US contribution to the UN's climate change secretariat. ""America made a commitment and, as an American, if the government's not going to do it then we all have a responsibility,""Mr Bloomberg said on CBS,external. ""I'm able to do it. So, yes, I'm going to send them a cheque for the monies that America had promised to the organisation as though they got it from the federal government."" His charity, Bloomberg Philanthropies, offered $15m to cover a separate climate change shortfall last year. It said the money would go to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In January,President Trump said the US could ""conceivably"" returnto the deal if it treated America more fairly. ""It's an agreement that I have no problem with but I had a problem with the agreement that they (the Obama administration) signed,"" he told reporters. Mr Bloomberg said he hoped that by next year Mr Trump will have reconsidered his position on the deal. ""He's been known to change his mind, that is true,"" he said. ""America is a big part of the solution and we should go in and help the world stop a potential disaster."" The deal unites all the world's nations in a single agreement on tackling climate change for the first time in history. Coming to a consensus among nearly 200 countries on the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions is regarded by many observers as an achievement in itself and has been hailed as ""historic"". As well as the limit on global temperatures, it includes a limit on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity and a requirement for rich countries to help poorer nations by providing ""climate finance"".

Man mauled by bear survives shark attack,"They say bad luck comes in threes, and for Dylan McWilliams, a 20-year-old from Colorado, that has unfortunately proved true. The young outdoorsman has survived his third bloody brush with the animal kingdom - a shark attack while body boarding off the coast of Hawaii. ""It's kind of crazy,"" Dylan told the BBC from the island of Kauai. ""I don't seem to have a lot of luck but it's kind of lucky in unlucky situations."" He was enjoying the Pacific waves on Thursday morning when he felt something hit his leg. He explained: ""I saw the shark underneath me. I started kicking at it - I know I hit it at least once - and swam to shore as quickly as I could."" Worried about the trail of blood he was leaving, he told local media after the attack: ""I didn't know if I lost half my leg or what."" Warning: This story contains some graphic images The shark, believed to be a tiger shark between 6 and 8ft (about 2m), left distinctive teeth marks in Dylan's leg that needed seven stitches. ""My mum was worried,"" Dylan said of his call to his parents soon after paramedics saw to his injury. ""I don't know if they want me doing all this stuff,"" he admits, but he believes they support him. The outdoors enthusiast from Grand Junction in western Colorado, has been backpacking across the US and Canada for the past few years, funding his travels with odd jobs working as a ranch hand and even as a survival training instructor. How to survive a shark attack Zoo attacks and the people who survive them What are the world's deadliest animals? His grandfather was the first person to teach him survival techniques at the age of three or four, and a love for the outdoors was born. ""I've been teaching kids and people, whoever wants, how to survive in the wilderness and live off the land like the explorers did,"" said the Crocodile Hunter fan from his camping spot on a Hawaiian beach. He was putting those survival skills to use on a camping trip in Colorado last July, when at 4am, while sleeping outdoors, he was woken up to find his head being clamped in the jaws of a bear. Dylan McWilliams was mauled by a bear in 2017 (left) and bitten by a shark last week (right) ""This black bear grabbed me by the back of the head, and I was fighting back, poking it in the eye until it let me go,"" Dylan describes vividly. His friends awoke to the commotion, but after the 300 pound (136kg) male bear stomped on Dylan, it walked away. Park authorities caught it the next morning, and after tests confirmed Dylan's blood was under the bear's claws, the outdoorsman said the animal was put down. Nine staples to the back of his head have left scars and a pain when he touches them, but the experience hasn't put off the young man from his love of the outdoors. ""I've always loved animals and spent as much time with them as I could,"" the backpacker said from Kauai island, which has recently been plagued with floods. He attributes these dangerous incidents to just being in the wrong place at the wrong time, adding: ""I don't blame the shark, I don't blame the bear, and I don't blame the rattlesnake.""

And this brings us to Dylan's arguably least deadly run-in three years ago - a rattlesnake attack during a hiking trip in Utah. ""I was walking down a trail and I thought I kicked a cactus but couldn't see one, and then saw a rattlesnake all coiled up."" The then 17-year-old made the call not to go to the hospital because he figured he had only suffered a dry bite. ""There was a little venom so I did get a bit sick for a couple of days,"" the aspiring police officer said. ""We have to respect [animals'] boundaries but I don't think I was invading or provoking any of the attacks - they just happened."" Dylan McWilliams is now impatient for his wounds to heal so he can get back on to the surf. Despite his run of bad luck, he encourages everyone to experience the outdoors. ""I still go hiking, I still catch rattle snakes, and I will still swim in the ocean."" When asked if he thinks he will have another brush with dangerous wildlife, he said: ""I hope not, but I spend most of my time outside with animals... so I guess anything could happen.""

Corbyn: PM 'ignored Windrush warnings',"This video can not be played Windrush scandal: Facing the threat of deportation Jeremy Corbyn has called for an end to the government's so-called ""hostile environment"" immigration policy, saying it has ""ripped apart"" people's lives. The Labour leader said the Windrush generation and their families had been treated as ""second-class citizens"". The opposition has repeated its call for Home Secretary Amber Rudd to quit. Justice Secretary David Gauke said there had been major ""implementation failures"" but the core policy of trying to deter illegal migration was right. Theresa May has apologised on several occasions for the distress caused to the relatives of Caribbean migrants who settled in the UK between 1948 and 1971 - some of whom have been threatened with deportation, have lost their jobs or been refused access to medical treatment arising from changes to immigration rules since 2014. Leaders clash over Windrush landing cards PM: Compensation for Windrush generation She has promised compensation to those whose right to live in the UK was questioned and who suffered hardship because they did not have proof of residency or their documentation was rejected by immigration officials. The BBC's political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said the Home Office is expected to set out more details about compensation this week. If that doesn't come quickly enough or if there isn't significant progress in helping people affected, she added, then the pressure on the home secretary and prime minister will increase. Speaking at the Welsh Labour conference in Llandudno, Mr Corbyn said Mrs May was personally responsible as she had set ""a deliberately unreachable bar"" in her previous role as home secretary by forcing migrants to provide proof of residence to access services such as housing and healthcare. ""This week something rotten at the heart of government has come to the surface,"" he said. This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? ""We have seen one government minister after another, including the prime minister, try and dodge and weave around the facts to avoid scrutiny and entirely justified criticism. ""It is not that they weren't warned. At the time the Tories were pushing their hostile immigration policy through Parliament, some of us warned of the consequences this could have for many people and families. ""People's lives ripped apart because of the personal decisions and actions of Theresa May and her government."" He called for a stop to ""disgraceful"" and ""discriminatory"" policies which have resulted in people being ""shut out of public life"". In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr show - presented this week by Nick Robinson - shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry conceded the phrase ""hostile environment"" in relation to illegal immigration had first been used under the last Labour government. But she insisted it had been cranked up by the Conservatives to a point where ""people have died, people have lost their jobs, lost their futures"". Her colleague Dawn Butler went further, telling Sky News she thought the PM had ""presided over racist legislation that has discriminated against a whole generation of people from the Commonwealth"". However, Labour MP Owen Smith told ITV's Peston on Sunday his party should have done more to oppose a tightening of the rules in the 2014 Immigration Act which had had ""terrible unintended consequences"" for people. This video can not be played Poet Benjamin Zephaniah wants the government to act ""immediately"" over Windrush The party - then led by Ed Miliband - abstained in crucial votes, although Mr Corbyn and a handful of allies now on Labour's frontbench, such as John McDonnell and Diane Abbott, voted against it. Defending the government, Mr Gauke said British citizens whose right to live in the UK had been questioned and who had suffered huge anxiety should get financial redress. Although there had been ""very significant failures in terms of how it was implemented"", he said the government would not be backing down on its core policy of bearing down on illegal immigration and, ""in these circumstances"", it would not be right for ministers to quit. ""Where there are failures of policy, then we are held accountable for that,"" he told the Andrew Marr show. ""When it comes down to it, the central policy is right,"" he added. ""When it comes to those who are illegal, those who should not be here, if we want a sustainable immigration system that has public support, it's right that we address this."" But Conservative former Communities Secretary Baroness Warsi said ministers should ""think long and hard about the trauma"" caused to families by their immigration policies - calling again on the government to drop its ""unrealistic"" target of reducing annual net migration to below 100,000 a year.

Korean Air 'nut rage' sisters step down,"The airline boss's younger daughter was involved in a water-throwing incident this month The CEO of Korean Air says his two daughters are resigning after separate incidents that led to allegations of abuse of power inside the company. Police are investigating the younger daughter, Cho Hyun-min, after she allegedly splashed water in a colleague's face. Her older sister infamously delayed a flight in 2014 over a packet of nuts - and served jail time for the incident. In a statement, their father apologised to the public and his employees. Cho Yang-ho said his daughters would be stripped of all their responsibilities,Yonhap news agency reports.,external Both cases hit the headlines in the country and reopened a national debate about the Korean business system, which is dominated by family firms known as chaebols. Is reform possible at South Korea's family-run business empires? Ms Cho, 36, apologised for her ""foolish and reckless behaviour"" in the most recent incidentearlier this month. Cho Hyun-min, also known as Emily, who was senior vice-president of the company, reportedly lost her temper because she was unhappy with answers to her questions in a meeting. She denied throwing water but admitted to shoving the advertising agency manager. Dozens of online petitions to South Korea's presidential website were launched, demanding she be punished. The airline was already under intense scrutiny after the CEO's eldest daughter, Cho Hyun-ah, known as Heather in English, flew into a rage when macadamia nuts were served to her in a bag and not on a plate on a Seoul-bound flight from New York four years ago. The elder sister, Cho Hyun-ah, spent five months in prison over the 'nut rage' incident Ms Cho, 44, was convicted of violating aviation safety, coercion and abuse of power in 2015 and served five months in jail. She had been back at work for less than month, as an executive of the airline's hotel affiliate, when her father announced her decision to step down on Sunday. The sisters are granddaughters of the founder of Hanjin Group, one of South Korea's massive family-run business empires. Their brother, Cho Won-tae, remains president and chief operating officer of Korean Air. According to Yonhap, the Korean Air offices and homes of the three offspring were searched by police on Thursday amid separate allegations they had avoided paying duties on luxury goods.

Neil Hudgell said there will be no ""closure"" until the inquiry into the circumstances around Mr Sargeant's death concludes. Mr Jones's decision to leave office in the autumn was dramatically announced at Welsh Labour conference on Saturday. It comes five months after he sacked Mr Sargeant who was found dead days later. UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to Mr Jones when he spoke at the conference in Llandudno, saying the AM for Bridgend is""not done yet"". Mr Jones, who will step down after around nine years in charge, said on Saturday he had been through the ""darkest of times"". He sacked the AM for Alyn and Deeside Carl Sargeant last November following allegations of inappropriate conduct towards women. Mr Jones and his office have been under intense pressure ever since - from Mr Sargeant's family, and from politicians both within Labour and outside. Carwyn Jones to quit as first minister The leader who lost his grip Harris elected Welsh Labour deputy leader Timeline: The death of Carl Sargeant On Friday, lawyers for Mr Sargeant's son Jack - who succeeded him as AM for Alyn and Deeside - said the family was frustrated by delays to an independent inquiry led by QC Paul Bowen into Mr Jones's handling of the November reshuffle. They also said Mr Jones's own conduct had caused ""considerable distress"" to the family. Asked by BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme whether Mr Jones's decision to resign helps Carl Sargeant's family, Mr Hudgell said: ""Not at all. ""The family completely empathise with the human cost of being involved in high profile office - and the fact that he can go home to his family in the autumn, they are very pleased for the Jones family. ""But they will never get any closure until they get to the end of this journey with Paul Bowen and his investigation, and him being able to have access to all relevant material and all relevant witness, so they can finally understand the events that led up to the tragic loss of their father and husband."" He called for the publication of a report into whether the sacking of Carl Sargeant was leaked - saying it could be redacted if needed. The Welsh Government has refused to publish the report, warning witnesses would be reluctant to come forward in future if they knew their identities could be disclosed. ""My understanding is that report is going to be highly critical, not only of the handling of the leaks, but of the inquiry and how it is conducted,"" Mr Hudgell said. Independent AM and ex-Plaid Cymru leader Lord Elis-Thomas joined the Welsh Government last year Mr Jones is expected to stay on as a AM after he quits as first minister - meaning no by-election will be triggered. Welsh Government minister Lord Elis-Thomas, a former Plaid Cymru leader and now independent AM, said it was ""appalling"" that people inside and outside the Labour Party had been ""gunning for"" Mr Jones. He told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme: ""What is the point of removing someone who has said that he intends to do a particular period [in office], he was talking about 10 years? ""And then, when the tragic events surrounding Carl Sargeant happened, there was an attempt to pin this on Carwyn. ""And I found that reprehensible, because you cannot say that the hugely difficult, traumatic issue involving a person taking his own life, a politician or anyone else, can be pinned on one other person."" Lord Elis-Thomas refused to say which individuals he was talking about. ""No, I'm not going to pin names on anyone, because I don't want to be doing what they did to Carwyn,"" he added. Carolyn Harris beat Julie Morgan to the role of Welsh Labour deputy leader The announcement by Mr Jones overshadowed the controversy that developed on the same day over the Welsh Labour deputy leadership election. Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris beat Julie Morgan, Cardiff North AM, to win the job despite winning fewer votes than Ms Morgan among the party membership. Under the terms of the poll's electoral college, the votes of MPs and AMs and groups linked to Labour, including trade unions, outweighed the membership. Ms Morgan told Sunday Supplement that it is ""absolutely essential"" that the next leader is chosen on a one-member-one-vote franchise - and she was ""fairly confident"" that it would happen. ""We don't want the first minister and the leader of Labour to be elected in a way which leaves it open for that person to be elected without having the majority support of the members,"" she said. She said she hoped an upcoming democracy review in Labour, due to be debated in Llandudno on Sunday, would set up a commission that ""does not have to take a year to report"" and that leadership elections should be looked at ""straight away"". This video can not be played Carwyn Jones stands down after 'the darkest of times' Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford, considered by many to be a front-runner for the job of first minister, said he was giving ""serious consideration"" to putting himself in the running following Mr Jones's announcement. Others, including Jeremy Miles, Alun Davies, Vaughan Gething and Huw Irranca-Davies, have declined to rule themselves out. The first minister told the conference that his departure would give his family, his party and the country a ""fresh start"". Referring to his wife and family, Mr Jones told delegates on Saturday: ""I don't think anyone can know what the last few months have been like - no one apart from Lisa and the kids. ""They have carried me through the darkest of times. I have asked too much of them at times. It's time for me to think about what's fair to them.""

It was clear I would return and show everyone my football. I think I left and came back a different person, man and player."" Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said he was ""happy to have the opportunity"" of being Salah's manager and added it was an ""unbelievable honour"" to win the award.

As a striker, I know that it is a great feeling to have."" BBC Sport pundit Rachel Brown-Finnis: ""Salah was supposedly over-priced when Liverpool paid Â£36.9m for him last summer but you could triple that fee and no-one would bat an eyelid - not that they would consider selling him now."" BBC Sport pundit Dion Dublin:""To do what Salah has done in his first season at Liverpool is incredible. He has scored so many goals but he is also unselfish - he will always pick the best option even if that means he doesn't score but the team does."" Many believed it was a two-horse race between Salah and De Bruyne for the men's Player of the Year award. Belgium international De Bruyne has played a pivotal role in Manchester City's title-winning campaign. He has provided more assists (15) and created more chances (104) than any other player in the Premier League this season, as well as scoring eight goals.

""In terms of the continuity and playing every three days in all competitions he was there. I am sorry, maybe with numbers, there are numbers guys better than him, but no player in this season with the team who wins [the title] five games before the end, and he was the best. ""I would like to feel that he deserved it. But at the end in summer time we will be at home being champions and for that to happen the players have to play.""

Chelsea reach FA Cup final,"This video can not be played Highlights: Chelsea 2-0 Southampton Olivier Giroud's brilliant semi-final goal helped Chelsea beat Southampton to reach the FA Cup final and set up a meeting with Manchester United. Chelsea striker Giroud received the ball from Eden Hazard and jinked his way past two Southampton players in a crowded area before he stabbed the ball home. Giroud was replaced by Alvaro Morata with 10 minutes to go and the substitute sealed safe passage with Chelsea's second when he headed in at the back post from Cesar Azpilicueta's cross. Southampton went close with Nathan Redmond's low drive from distance while Charlie Austin hit the post. It means Chelsea manager Antonio Conte will come up against managerial adversary Jose Mourinho at Wembley on 19 May. There is no love lost between Conte and former Chelsea manager Mourinho, who havetraded insults throughout the season. The final is also repeat of 2007 when Mourinho guidedChelsea to a 1-0 victory,externalover United in the first to be played at the rebuilt Wembley. How did you rate the players? Football Daily podcast: 'Conte will want to leave Chelsea on a high' Conte's Chelsea were beaten inlast season's FA Cup finalby Arsenal, albeit as a club which appeared much more harmonious. They went into that final as Premier League champions and a domestic double would have put the gloss on a fine campaign. This season has been a stark contrast with the London club struggling to finish in the top four to secure a Champions League place. Rumours have alsoswirled over Conte's futureat Stamford Bridge. Victory in the FA Cup final will allow Conte to potentially provide a silver lining to what has been a difficult season. To do so against Mourinho would also be particularly sweet for both Conte and Chelsea's fans, with the Portuguese's relationship with his former club having become strained since he took over at Old Trafford. Encouragingly for Conte, there were flickers of the kind of form Chelsea showed at their best in that title-winning season in this game as they deservedly progressed. Willian struck the crossbar after a rapid counter-attack, the impressive Hazard forced Alex McCarthy to tip the ball over the crossbar, while Morata twice went close at the end. They will face much sterner opposition in United and Mourinho, though. This video can not be played Giroud brilliance gives Chelsea lead in 2018 FA Cup semi-final Giroud won the FA Cup three times as an Arsenal player and his fondness for the competition continued against the Saints with the crucial first goal. It ensured that the France striker has had a hand in 22 goals in 26 appearances in the competition since January 2012, with 15 goals and seven assists - more than any other player in the competition during that period. Giroud had scored twice as Southamptonsquandered a two-goal lead against Chelseato lose 3-2 in their Premier League fixture at St Mary's last weekend. And after his strike at Wembley he has now scored eight goals at Southampton's expense. Against no other side has he scored more since he arrived in England. It was a goal which provided the game's memorable moment. Giroud showed superb balance, poise and technique to finish as Southampton's players dropped like dominoes. The 31-year-old was substituted by Conte with 10 minutes left and the hearty congratulations he received from the Italian provided the sign of a job well done. His replacement Morata could have had a had a hat-trick as Southampton poured forward in attempting a dramatic comeback. In the end, the Spain striker had to settled for one goal two minutes after he came on when he nodded in from close range. Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud, left, had more touches in the penalty area (13) than Southampton forwards Shane Long and Charlie Austin, right, managed combined (seven) Mark Hughes was bidding to become the first Welsh manager to win the FA Cup, and take Southampton to their first final since 2003. The Saints were organised and defensively disciplined in the first half as they restricted Chelsea to just two attempts on target before the break. However, as soon as Chelsea took the lead a minute into the second half, it always looked an uphill struggle for Hughes' side. As the game became more stretched, Chelsea always seemed the more likely to score - although Southampton did have their moments. Hughes was frustrated after the Saints had a goal ruled out with the score at 1-0 when Chelsea goalkeeper Willy Caballero dropped the ball over his own line under pressure from Austin. ""The keeper Willy Caballero made a glaring mistake,"" Hughes said. ""I don't know how they made that decision so quickly, Charlie Austin did nothing wrong.. ""If ever there was a situation for VAR to step in and say we probably need to review that I would have thought that was the opportunity to do that."" Nevertheless there was an overriding feeling this match was of secondary importance to the issue of Premier League survival for Southampton, and Hughes can now give this his sole focus. Southampton were a point above the drop zone whenHughes replaced Mauricio Pellegrinoas manager. They are now four points adrift of 17th-placed Swansea with four matches of the season remaining. An FA Cup final would have been a bonus but results in forthcoming matches against Bournemouth, Everton, Swansea and Manchester City are what ultimately matter most for Hughes. After a dip in his performances midway through the season, the Belgium forward is back to his best. He provided the assist for Chelsea's first goal when he brilliantly controlled a high ball and slipped in Olivier Giroud Southampton manager Mark Hughes:""In the first half we didn't quite affect Chelsea as much as we talked about before the game so we were reasonably pleased to come in at half-time with it 0-0. ""Conceding first goal was always going to be detrimental. We took a centre-back off and they were able to capitalise with a second goal. ""We got a response but we didn't get any luck. We have a huge game next weekend and the focus now is putting this disappointment behind us very very quickly."" Chelsea boss Antonio Conte:""Now our target is to try and put a bit of pressure on the teams in front of us in the Premier League and get a place in the Champions League and finish as best as possible. ""It's important for us to reach a final in this competition especially because we are struggling a lot in the league. ""We are not in the position to prioritise (the FA Cup or fourth), if we want to continue to have hope of getting into the Champions League we have to take three points in these four games. Now we must be focused on the league."" Mark Hughes is just the second manager to be eliminated from the FA Cup as manager of two Premier League teams (Stoke and Southampton) in a single season, after Glenn Hoddle in 2000-01 with Southampton and Tottenham. Since they lost 3-1 to Southampton at home in October 2015, Chelsea have won each of six games against them in all competitions. Chelsea have reached the FA Cup final for the 13th time, and have got there in successive campaigns for the first time since 2009 and 2010. They have won seven of their eight FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley, with their only loss coming against Manchester City in 2013. Alvaro Morata has scored nine headed goals in all competitions this season; two more than any other Premier League player. All seven of Cesar Azpilicueta's assists this season have been for Morata. Both clubs return to Premier League action next Saturday; Chelsea are at Swansea (17:30 BST), while Southampton host Bournemouth (15:00).

"TSB customers report online problemsOne man was credited with Â£13,000 he didn't have, and could see details of someone else's account.3m3 minutes agoUK","Matthew Neal got a shock when he logged onto his TSB account A TSB customer was given access to someone else's Â£35,000 savings account, Â£11,000 Isa, and a business account when he logged onto his account last night. Matthew Neal had simply wanted to check how much he'd spent at the pub the night before. He's just one of potentially millions of TSB customers affected by a massive computer failure. The bank's upgrade to its banking systems has caused chaos for customers. The bank warned its users that it was carrying out upgrades at the weekend between 16:00 BST on Friday and 18:00 on Sunday. But a number of customers reported they were still facing problems on Monday morning, with many worried about being able to pay bills or even get cash to pay for essentials. TSB apologised and claimed it had fixed the issue. In a statement on Monday it said: ""We're really sorry that some of our customers experienced problems accessing our mobile app and internet banking yesterday evening. Both of these services are now up and running again."" Many customers took to Twitter to complain of being unable to access their accounts despite the bank's claim. The bank's social media staff simply repeated the line: ""Unfortunately, there are some intermittent problems affecting this service so please bear with us. We're working as hard as we can to resolve this."" Matthew Neal from Hertfordshire checked his TSB app after 6pm on Sunday evening to find out his balance and see how much he had spent at the pub the night before. But he got a shock. ""I could see all my accounts, but on top of that also three accounts belonging to someone else: a Â£35,000 savings account, an Â£11,000 Isa and a business account,"" he told the BBC. ""I could see their account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories and I had access to transfer money too, if I was that way inclined. ""The thing that was worrying me most was: what if someone can see mine too?"" He tried to ring the bank to alert it to the problem but after 45 minutes on hold, gave up. Since then he has been unable to access his accounts at all. A TSB spokesperson commented: ""We have noted some reports in the media regarding customers' access to account information last night. We can confirm the access issues, which lasted only about 20 minutes and impacted just a tiny fraction of our customer base, were fixed last night."" When TSB split from the Lloyds Banking Group, it continued to rent a banking platform from its former owner while it developed its own ""state-of-the-art"" platform. That was ready to go live at the weekend and TSB moved its customers' data from the Lloyds' platform to its own. This was a long-planned disruption to the service and the bank said it informed customers of the change and that it would lead to them being unable to use online banking or payment systems at the weekend.

First, many customers said they were unaware of the changes and so were caught out. Second, customers experienced difficulties long after the 6pm deadline on Sunday evening that TSB promised that things would be sorted by. In fact many were still complaining of being unable to access services on Monday morning. Laim McKenzie, from Paisley, in Scotland, signed into his app shortly after 6pm on Sunday evening to discover the problem. The 20-year-old said: ""I saw the details of one other account holder, as well as my own. ""My balance, because of my overdraft, is in minus, but my balance was showing at Â£13,000. ""I closed the app and went in again at 19:00 and only my account was showing - but my balance was showing at zero. ""I've closed the app again and have not been able to access it since."" Many customers took to Twitter to complain about issues, including being unable to log into their internet banking accounts, being unable to transfer funds and not being able to make payments.

Mr Trump has threatened to abandon the deal, which limits Iran's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, unless it is toughened up. He has until 12 May to decide whether to restore US sanctions against Iran. Correspondents say such a move would effectively kill the landmark agreement between Iran and six major western powers. The two leaders are expected to address the issue when Mr Trump hosts Mr Macron this week. Is Trump going to kill Iran deal? How sanctions have hit ordinary Iranians An unlikely (and calculated) friendship is born Mr Macron told Fox he had no ""plan B"" for the deal if the US decided to restore sanctions, and said the US should stay in the agreement as long as there was no better option. ""Let's present this framework because it's better than the sort of North Korean-type situation."" He said the two leaders had ""a very special relationship"" and he wanted to address ballistic missiles as part of the deal - a key demand of the US president - as well as work to contain Iran's influence in the region. President Trump is also demanding that signatories to the deal agree permanent restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment. Under the current deal they are set to expire in 2025. He has put pressure on his European co-signatories to address these issues before the 12 May deadline, when he needs to decide whether to sign a waiver giving sanctions relief to Iran. Under US law, passed during the Obama administration, the president needs to sign these waivers every 120-180 days acknowledging Iran's compliance with the deal. When Mr Trump signed the last one, in January, he said it was a ""last chance"" to change the accord, before the US withdraws. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif warned on Saturday that his country was prepared to resume its nuclear programme ""at much greater speed"", if the US withdrew from the accord. Mr Macron also appealed to the US president not to pull troops out of Syria after the final defeat of so-called Islamic State, saying that would ""leave the floor"" to Iran and Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.

Martin Lewis seeks damages for Facebook ads,"This video can not be played Martin Lewis is taking Facebook to court because of fake adverts showing his face. Consumer campaigner Martin Lewis is to launch UK High Court proceedings in a bid to sue Facebook for defamation. TheMoneySavingExpert founder says at least 50 fake ads,externalbearing his name have appeared on the social media platform, causing reputational damage to him. Many of the adverts show his face alongside endorsements that he has not actually made, and often link to articles carrying false information. Facebook says misleading ads are not allowed and any reported are removed. On Monday, Mr Lewis is due to lodge court papers at the High Court for a defamation case against Facebook. The business owner told the BBC he is taking the action to put Facebook ""on notice"". ""I do not appear in adverts, full-stop - no company pays me to do an advert. I have made this clear to Facebook - any ad with me in it is fake. ""They are the facial recognition experts; they should be able to spot when they are being paid. ""This isn't a post in a forum, they are being paid and these adverts are pushed out to millions of people,"" he said. Mr Lewis is seeking damages but has pledged that any money he receives will go to anti-scam charities. Several of the adverts tout schemes with titles such as Bitcoin code and Cloud Trader which, according to Mr Lewis, are fronts for binary trading firms outside the EU. Binary trading is a form of financial transaction which the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has warned consumers against. Martin Lewis said he found at least 50 fake adverts featuring himself Mr Lewis is a high profile campaigner who has used his own prime-time show on ITV to take on banks and utility companies among others. His legal action is significant not only because of the high degree of public attention it is likely to win, but because it shows him turning his sights against big technology firms. TheAdvertising Standards Authority has previously upheld Mr Lewis' complaints,externalagainst adverts saying the promotions made it falsely appear as if the expert had endorsed the advertised services. When I spoke to Mr Lewis last week, he made clear his belief that this is a widespread phenomenon on Facebook, where celebrity endorsements are often seen on adverts, even though the celebrities have not consented. Martin Lewis said he found a fake version of a BBC article which was created and posted on Facebook Facebook denies that, saying: ""We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis that he should report any adverts that infringe his rights, and they will be removed."" The company adds: ""We are in direct contact with his team, offering to help and promptly investigating their requests, and only last week confirmed that several adverts and accounts that violated our advertising policies had been taken down."" That's not how Mr Lewis sees it. Martin Lewis is the founder of MoneySavingExpert and often appears on TV to offer advice He says that the company's response has been consistently ineffective, and that he is only taking legal action after repeated demands for more to be done. Legally, there are several issues at stake here. One is the perennial issue of whether Facebook has legal responsibility for the content that appears under its banner - whether it is a publisher or a platform. Another question concerns the legal jurisdiction in which Facebook operates. Mark Lewis, the campaigner's solicitor, says: ""Facebook is not above the law - it cannot hide outside the UK and think that it is untouchable."" Doubtless Martin Lewis, who was awarded an OBE for his remarkably effective campaigning, calculates that the publicity around his case will alert some Facebook users to the fact that these false adverts are rife on the social network. Currently the onus is on users to report disreputable, fake ads, but Mr Lewis says Facebook must be more pro-active in regulating content on its platform. ""They're the ones being paid, they're the ones who should take responsibility and police it,"" he said. The legal action follows intense media scrutiny over the company's duties as a de-facto publishing platform. ""Politicians have discussed the democratic deficit because of fake news on social media - well it may be more prosaic, but real, vulnerable people are losing money because of fake ads."" It's been a difficult few months for Facebook. Now Martin Lewis is about to give them another big headache.

Hunt threatens social media with new laws,"Jeremy Hunt has written to a number of internet companies, including Facebook and Google Social media firms are being threatened with new laws if they don't do more to protect children online. In a letter to companies including Facebook and Google, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt accuses them of ""turning a blind eye"" to their impact on children. He gives them until the end of April to outline action on cutting underage use, preventing cyber bullying, and promoting healthy screen time. Google and Facebook say they share Mr Hunt's commitment to safety. The age requirement to sign up to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat is 13. To use WhatsApp or to have a YouTube account, you must also be at least 13. Hunt calls for cyber-bullying action How helpful is social media for our mental health? 'The advice I'd give to my teenage self' Is social media making your child sad? In his letter to the internet firms, Mr Hunt said: ""I am concerned that your companies seem content with a situation where thousands of users breach your own terms and conditions on the minimum user age. ""I fear that you are collectively turning a blind eye to a whole generation of children being exposed to the harmful emotional side effects of social media prematurely. ""This is both morally wrong and deeply unfair to parents who are faced with the invidious choice of allowing children to use platforms they are too young to access or excluding them from social interaction that often the majority of their peers are engaging in."" Conservative MP Liz Truss said she had resorted to physically locking her 12-year-old daughter's phone away. ""I have a box which I lock up and put my daughter's mobile phone in and I'm known as the phone jailer in our household,"" she told Pienaar's Politics on Radio 5 Live. ""It's not just the internet, it's screen time over all. It's part of being a good parent. I think social media companies can play a part and help parents in that job."" Mr Hunt met social media companies six months agoto discuss how to improve the mental health of young people who use the technology. He toldthe Sunday Times,external, there had been ""warm words"" and ""a few welcome moves"" since then, but the overall response had been ""extremely limited"" - leading him to conclude that a voluntary, joint approach would not be good enough. ""None are easy issues to solve I realise, but an industry that boasts some of the brightest minds and biggest budgets should have been able to rise to the challenge,"" said Mr Hunt. Understand the risks that your children may be exposed to - including cyberbullying, grooming, illegal or unsuitable content Make use of parental controls that give you the ability to filter the type of content your children can see when they are online. With younger children, have access to passwords to regularly check content Show them how to use privacy settings and the report and block functions on sites and apps Talk regularly to them about what they do online, what posts they have made that day, who they are friends with and how it is affecting their mood Keep an eye on how much time children spend online. Consider bans on devices at mealtimes and take them away an hour before bedtime. Do not let children charge devices in their rooms Source: Internet Matters-more advice here for keeping your kids safe online The National Bullying Helpline, a charity which deals with online bullying, said the government needed to introduce legislation to govern the social media companies. ""Asking Facebook and other social media giants to regulate themselves is like asking the press to regulate themselves. It won't happen,"" it added. Mr Hunt said the government would not rule out introducing new legislation to tackle the issue when it publishes its response to the Internet Safety Strategy consultation in May. This video can not be played Prof Sonia Livingstone is an expert on child online safety He has also asked the chief medical officer to launch a review into the impact of technology on the mental health of children and young people. Katie O'Donovan, public policy manager at Google UK, said the company had shown its commitment to protecting children by developing its resources - such as an online safety course which has been taught to 40,000 schoolchildren. Facebook said it welcomed Mr Hunt's ""continued engagement on this important issue"" and shared his ambition to create a safe and supportive environment for young people online. ""We continue to invest heavily in developing tools for parents and age-appropriate products to meet this challenge and we look forward to continuing to work with our child safety partners and government to make progress in this area,"" said Karim Palant from Facebook .

Man mauled by bear survives shark attackA 20-year-old outdoorsman bitten by a shark had previously survived a bear attack and snake bite.22m23 minutes agoUS & Canada,"They say bad luck comes in threes, and for Dylan McWilliams, a 20-year-old from Colorado, that has unfortunately proved true. The young outdoorsman has survived his third bloody brush with the animal kingdom - a shark attack while body boarding off the coast of Hawaii. ""It's kind of crazy,"" Dylan told the BBC from the island of Kauai. ""I don't seem to have a lot of luck but it's kind of lucky in unlucky situations."" He was enjoying the Pacific waves on Thursday morning when he felt something hit his leg. He explained: ""I saw the shark underneath me. I started kicking at it - I know I hit it at least once - and swam to shore as quickly as I could."" Worried about the trail of blood he was leaving, he told local media after the attack: ""I didn't know if I lost half my leg or what."" Warning: This story contains some graphic images The shark, believed to be a tiger shark between 6 and 8ft (about 2m), left distinctive teeth marks in Dylan's leg that needed seven stitches. ""My mum was worried,"" Dylan said of his call to his parents soon after paramedics saw to his injury. ""I don't know if they want me doing all this stuff,"" he admits, but he believes they support him. The outdoors enthusiast from Grand Junction in western Colorado, has been backpacking across the US and Canada for the past few years, funding his travels with odd jobs working as a ranch hand and even as a survival training instructor. How to survive a shark attack Zoo attacks and the people who survive them What are the world's deadliest animals? His grandfather was the first person to teach him survival techniques at the age of three or four, and a love for the outdoors was born. ""I've been teaching kids and people, whoever wants, how to survive in the wilderness and live off the land like the explorers did,"" said the Crocodile Hunter fan from his camping spot on a Hawaiian beach. He was putting those survival skills to use on a camping trip in Colorado last July, when at 4am, while sleeping outdoors, he was woken up to find his head being clamped in the jaws of a bear. Dylan McWilliams was mauled by a bear in 2017 (left) and bitten by a shark last week (right) ""This black bear grabbed me by the back of the head, and I was fighting back, poking it in the eye until it let me go,"" Dylan describes vividly. His friends awoke to the commotion, but after the 300 pound (136kg) male bear stomped on Dylan, it walked away. Park authorities caught it the next morning, and after tests confirmed Dylan's blood was under the bear's claws, the outdoorsman said the animal was put down. Nine staples to the back of his head have left scars and a pain when he touches them, but the experience hasn't put off the young man from his love of the outdoors. ""I've always loved animals and spent as much time with them as I could,"" the backpacker said from Kauai island, which has recently been plagued with floods. He attributes these dangerous incidents to just being in the wrong place at the wrong time, adding: ""I don't blame the shark, I don't blame the bear, and I don't blame the rattlesnake.""

And this brings us to Dylan's arguably least deadly run-in three years ago - a rattlesnake attack during a hiking trip in Utah. ""I was walking down a trail and I thought I kicked a cactus but couldn't see one, and then saw a rattlesnake all coiled up."" The then 17-year-old made the call not to go to the hospital because he figured he had only suffered a dry bite. ""There was a little venom so I did get a bit sick for a couple of days,"" the aspiring police officer said. ""We have to respect [animals'] boundaries but I don't think I was invading or provoking any of the attacks - they just happened."" Dylan McWilliams is now impatient for his wounds to heal so he can get back on to the surf. Despite his run of bad luck, he encourages everyone to experience the outdoors. ""I still go hiking, I still catch rattle snakes, and I will still swim in the ocean."" When asked if he thinks he will have another brush with dangerous wildlife, he said: ""I hope not, but I spend most of my time outside with animals... so I guess anything could happen.""

How hard is giving up plastic for a month?,"Ten years ago I attempted to live plastic-free. With the government pledging to crack down on plastic waste, will it be any easier a decade on? Summer 2008 was a warm one. I know that because my kitchen gently hummed with the sour scent of plastic milk bottles and yoghurt cartons. During that July, I saved all 603 plastic items my husband, toddler and I generated so I could compare withan experimental month ""off"" plastic,externalin the August that followed. The project was triggered by a BBC report onplastic pollution in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,external, which left me wondering if it was possible to eliminate disposable plastic from normal daily life. The answer was: ""not quite"". But that August we reduced our plastic tally to just 116 items, of which 63 were disposable nappies. Plastic fantastic: How it changed the world Plastic recycling: Your questions answered Six simple ways to cut back on plastic UK faces build-up of plastic waste Ten years later, nappies are no longer in my shopping trolley. It's now laden with the full range of groceries consumed by a family with two school-age children. Much of it is packed in plastic - and it's easy to see why: this lightweight, durable material keeps food fresh and is easy to move and store. But with avoiding disposable plastic high on many people's to-do lists, I decided to rerun my 2008 experiment. Would spending a month without buying anything wrapped in, or containing, plastic be any easier now? I tackle our breakfast routine first. We awake to milk on the doorstep, in glass bottles, just like in my childhood, albeit ordered online rather than via handwritten note. The kids are amused by the novelty and I overhear my eight-year-old daughter telling a friend: ""They appear outside our house overnight."" Milk doorstep delivery new subscriptions have risen since the start of January It seems we are not alone in making the switch in 2018. MÃ¼ller-owned delivery company Milk & More says it has had 10,000 new online customers signing up since 1 January, of which 90% are ordering milk in glass bottles. It comes despite a long term downward trend for milk deliveries which last year accounted for just 3% by volume of the milk sold - down from 7% in 2008. Delivered milk is more costly: a glass doorstep pint is around 81p, whereas a four-pint supermarket bottle is about Â£1.10. But not having to pick up milk has already cut my ""top-up"" trips to the local convenience store. My homemade bagels won't win any prizes Milk bottles are one of the most widely and easily-recycled pieces of plastic packaging. At the other end of the recyclability scale are plastic films such as bags, pouches and peelable lids which make up more than a quarter of plastic household waste. As a family we are heavily reliant at breakfast time on bags of bagels and boxes of cereals with plastic inners. This prompts me to try making bagels for the first time in my life - not as hard as you might think. But as for cereals, my suggestion to the rest of the family that we all eat porridge for a month (boxes of oats have no liners) goes down like a gruel-filled balloon. Then I find a new ""zero waste"" shop a couple of miles away that has versions of our usual options but loose in bins for scooping into our own containers. Family breakfast truce achieved. There's no avoiding the fact that visiting separate shops for separate goods takes longer than my normal one-hit blitz at the supermarket. So I decide to give my usual routine a try - but on my new avoid-plastic-at-all-costs rule. Attempting to shop based on packaging status alone leads to some combinations worthy of Ready Steady Cook: leeks, carrots, a giant mango and a box of eggs. Films and nets are not currently easily recycled Bags of salad are out, as is most pasta and rice. Tinned food is easier although cans of acidic foods such as tomatoes, or even fizzy drinks, have a plastic lining to stop the contents reacting with the metal. Many glass jars have plastic lids or labels so items such as chocolate hazelnut spread are off the menu too (sorry kids) but I take a risk with some pasta sauces, wondering whether the synthetic rubber lining to the lids counts as plastic. I'm reminded how heavy glass, tins and cardboard are - and, of course, have their own environmental impact - as I heave my trolley to the checkout. Here, there is a major change since my original challenge. Single-use carrier bags are no longer dished out freely, since 2015 in England (and earlier in other parts of the UK) they cost at least 5p. The levy has slashed usage by 83%, according to government figures. Several chains are now dropping the 5p bags altogether and only selling ""bags for life"". Like so many shoppers, I'd brought my own reusable bags, so no rule-breaking there. But the food on the shelves doesn't seem any less plastic-wrapped than a decade ago. Retailers say shrink-wrapping fish and meat has cut the amount of plastic used and prolongs shelf life However, Iain Ferguson, environment manager at the Co-op says food retailers have made many changes, they just may not be immediately visible. ""In the past 10 years a lot of work has gone into making plastic films thinner and plastic bottles lighter,"" he says. Modifications such as removing polystyrene from pizza bases, switching tomato punnets to cardboard and packing meat in one type of plastic rather than layers of differing types are other moves the Co-op has made. ""Our customers say they want no plastic but customers also buy in plastic because they want the convenience,"" Mr Ferguson says. ""The best thing we can do is to make it easier to recycle."" All the major supermarkets insist they havemade or are making significant changesand frozen food retailer Iceland hasannounced it will do away with plastic altogether,externalfor its own brand products by 2023. Back to the pressing issue of family teatime, I grab a cardboard box of fish-fingers, some naked broccoli and loose potatoes. Giant mango for pudding. Half term and we travel from London to Cornwall. Unfortunately I forget my reusable cup and water bottle and end up with a pile of junk from the journey down, adding to the21 million water bottles,externaland6.8 million coffee cups,externalthe UK gets through each day. Avril Sainsbury of Bude Cleaner Seas says attitudes to plastic litter are changing I turn to social media for a nudge back on track. Online campaigning has increased massively since 2008 and hashtags such as #oneless, #nomoresingleuse and #strawssuck, are all used to promote the idea that small changes can create a big effect. Among them is my children's favourite -#2minutebeachclean,externalwhich started in the north Cornish seaside resort of Bude in 2014. Known for its long sandy beaches and rolling surf, the town sees the effects of plastic pollution every day, especially after a storm. ""It can feel overwhelming,"" says Avril Sainsbury of water quality projectBude Cleaner Seas,externalas we survey Crooklets Beach together. ""You will see everything that you'll find in your home, disposable lighters, bottles, caps, seals - to ghost nets, which are [abandoned] fishing nets."" But she says attitudes to marine litter are changing and people are now more likely to say ""gosh I'll help you"" if they see a beach clean taking place. Micro plastics mingle with the sand on Crooklets Beach in Bude I'm feeling guilty about those water bottles and coffee cups from the journey but Bude is a practical place. Local teacher Deb Rosser has come up with a practical solution. ""You can go to anywhere in Bude - that can be cafes, shops and accommodation providers - and they will refill your bottle for free with pure Cornish tap water,"" says Deb, describing herRefill Bude,externalconcept which has spread nationwide since starting in 2014. Sales of branded Refill Bude cups and bottles have raised more than Â£5,000 for Bude Sea Pool There are now 7,800 refill points around the UK and I find a new one in Boscastle National Trust Cafe, near where we are staying. The manager says the cafe has also just swapped from cardboard cups and plates to crockery. No excuse then for plastic-free fails while we're on holiday. Back at home and some plastic-packed toiletries run out this week. I purchase a bamboo toothbrush (admittedly with nylon bristles), and get to grips with a shampoo bar instead of a bottle. Our stock of toilet paper holds out, just, but I research a paper-wrapped alternative that can be delivered. At the end of the month, we have not managed to live entirely plastic-free but we have cut down on our normal consumption. It's taken a lot more time but has not necessarily been more expensive as it's forced me to limit what I buy. My 48-item plastic tally for the month The tally for the month comes to 48 plastic items including: Five ham packets - several packed lunch fails Three cereal inners Two chicken packs A polystyrene pizza base Chocolate mini eggs - they were foil wrapped but in a plastic net Two jelly wrappers A sachet of yeast from making those bagels Once nappies are taken out of the equation, it's not too different from the 53 items I gathered during my experiment 10 years ago. Yet looking back on my normal consumption in 2008, there have been big changes. Then, I used 36 disposable carrier bags a month, got through 23 polystyrene coffee cups at work and a plastic water bottle every other day. Now, my office has a stock of mugs, and taking a reusable bag and water bottle everywhere with me has become second nature. The same can't be said for plastic-free food shopping. While I will keep some of my swaps (including the milk delivery) I do find it currently impractical to keep my family fed without buying any plastic at all. However, with changes coming thick and fast - plastic-free teabags, the deposit return scheme, stores encouraging customers to bring their own containers - I may not need to wait 10 more years to give it another try.

Macron urges Trump to stick with Iran deal,"The two leaders have ""a very special relationship"", Mr Macron says French President Emmanuel Macron has urged his US counterpart, Donald Trump, to stick with the Iran nuclear deal, saying there is no better option. He was speaking to Fox ahead of a three-day state visit to the US starting on Monday. Mr Trump has threatened to abandon the deal, which limits Iran's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, unless it is toughened up. He has until 12 May to decide whether to restore US sanctions against Iran. Correspondents say such a move would effectively kill the landmark agreement between Iran and six major western powers. The two leaders are expected to address the issue when Mr Trump hosts Mr Macron this week. Is Trump going to kill Iran deal? How sanctions have hit ordinary Iranians An unlikely (and calculated) friendship is born Mr Macron told Fox he had no ""plan B"" for the deal if the US decided to restore sanctions, and said the US should stay in the agreement as long as there was no better option. ""Let's present this framework because it's better than the sort of North Korean-type situation."" He said the two leaders had ""a very special relationship"" and he wanted to address ballistic missiles as part of the deal - a key demand of the US president - as well as work to contain Iran's influence in the region. President Trump is also demanding that signatories to the deal agree permanent restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment. Under the current deal they are set to expire in 2025. He has put pressure on his European co-signatories to address these issues before the 12 May deadline, when he needs to decide whether to sign a waiver giving sanctions relief to Iran. Under US law, passed during the Obama administration, the president needs to sign these waivers every 120-180 days acknowledging Iran's compliance with the deal. When Mr Trump signed the last one, in January, he said it was a ""last chance"" to change the accord, before the US withdraws. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif warned on Saturday that his country was prepared to resume its nuclear programme ""at much greater speed"", if the US withdrew from the accord. Mr Macron also appealed to the US president not to pull troops out of Syria after the final defeat of so-called Islamic State, saying that would ""leave the floor"" to Iran and Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.

Is social media making children sad?,"Rangan Chatterjee is a GP and says he has seen plenty of evidence of the link between mental ill-health in youngsters and their use of social media. One 16 year-old boy was referred to him after he self-harmed and ended up in A&E. ""The first thought was to put him on anti-depressants but I chatted to him and it sounded like his use of social media was having a negative impact on his health."" So Dr Chatterjee suggested a simple solution - the teenager should attempt to wean himself off social media, restricting himself to just an hour before he went to bed. Over the course of a few weeks, he should extend this to two hours at night and two in the morning. ""He reported a significant improvement in his wellbeing and, after six months, I had a letter from his mother saying he was happier at school and integrated into the local community."" That and similar cases have led him to question the role social media plays in the lives of young people. ""Social media is having a negative impact on mental health,"" he said. ""I do think it is a big problem and that we need some rules. How do we educate society to use technology so it helps us rather than harms us?"" He is not alone. A group ofUS child welfare experts recently wrote to Facebook founder,externalMark Zuckerberg urging him to close down Messenger Kids - a messaging app developed for children - saying it was irresponsible to encourage pre-teens to use the platform. It cited evidence of adolescents reporting severe mood changes because of social media use and girls as young as 10 facing body image issues because of the pictures they are bombarded with on platforms such as Facebook-owned Instagram. A 2017 study by The Royal Society of Public Health,externalasked 1,500 young people aged 11-25 to track their moods while using the five most popular social media sites. It suggested Snapchat and Instagram were the most likely to inspire feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. YouTube had the most positive influence. Seven in 10 said Instagram made them feel worse about body image and half of 14-24-year-olds reported Instagram and Facebook exacerbated feelings of anxiety. Two-thirds said Facebook made cyber-bullying worse. The study led Shirley Cramer, chief executive of RSPH, to call for three specific changes: a pop-up notification when a young person has spent a certain amount of time online a watermark on photos that have been digitally manipulated school lessons on how to use social media in a healthy way She concluded: ""Social media has become a space in which we form and build relationships, shape self-identity, express ourselves and learn about the world around us; it is intrinsically linked to mental health."" Apple investors urge action on smartphone addiction Facebook 'no place' for young children Fear of missing out drives social media addiction Consultant psychiatrist Louise Theodosiou says one of the clearest indications children are spending too long on their phones is their behaviour during a session with a psychiatrist. ""Two or three years ago, it was very unusual for a child to answer their phone or text during an appointment. But now it is common,"" said the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital doctor. She has seen a rise in cases where social media is a contributing factor in teenage depression, anxiety and other mental health issues. These problems are often complex and wide-ranging - from excessive use of gaming or social media sites to feelings of inadequacy brought on by a constant bombardment of social media images of other people's lives, to cyber-bullying. ""In the last fortnight I have had two children request extra appointments because of online bullying,"" Dr Theodosiou told the BBC. ""Some children deliberately lose or break their phones just to end distressing messages."" Teenagers who dare to express alternative views, particularly about ""diverse sexuality"", open themselves up to the risk of a torrent of abuse on platforms such as Twitter, she says. And online bullying can have a more intense effect than playground taunts. ""At school, any offline bullying would be limited to that environment but on the computer at home it begins to feel like you are being bullied in your own bedroom,"" said Dr Theodosiou. One of the groups she worries about most - one she describes as ""thankfully, rare"" - is children who have simply stopped going out because of their online addiction to social media, gaming platforms, or both. Often such children will refuse to travel to psychiatrist appointments, so a range of professionals have to make home visits to deal with the issue. It can take months to persuade them to leave their bedrooms. ""These kids are living in a fictional world, sometimes to the detriment of their physical health. They might have physical ill-health, like toothache, but they are still not wanting to leave their virtual worlds,"" she said. Dr Theodosiou has seen first-hand how difficult it can be for parents. She has heard of some sleeping with the home router to make sure the children cannot connect to the wi-fi in the middle of the night. Even for those children whose social media use may be judged normal, there are still dangers in the way the internet has become a conduit into the lives of friends and celebrities. ""Youngsters have a need to compulsively watch others and are getting upset because they feel their lives aren't like that,"" said Dr Theodosiou. ""My sense is that they think that their friends have better lives than them, even though they are just seeing an idealised version of others' lives."" Keep an eye on how much time children spend online and ensure it is not interfering with activities such as socialising, exercising, eating and sleeping Consider bans on devices at mealtimes and take them away an hour before bedtime. Do not let children charge devices in their rooms Talk regularly to children about what they do online, what posts they have made that day, who they are friends with and how it is affecting their mood With younger children, have access to passwords to regularly check content Remember, Facebook, Twitter or Instagram officially bar children under 13 from having accounts Encourage children to use the internet for creative things - helping with homework, making their own content The UK's Department of Health met in November with tech firms including Snap, Facebook, Google, Apple and Twitter to discuss the issues, which it sees as: online bullying and harmful content the amount of time youngsters spend online how to verify the age of users. Again there is plenty of evidence to suggest there is reason to worry about all three of these topics. A study from Ofcom at the end of last year foundhalf of UK children aged 11 and 12 had a profiledespite most platforms having a minimum age of 13. Mental health charity Young Minds discovered that, while fewer youngsters reported online bullying (37%) than offline bullying (47%), the vast majority(83%) felt social media firms should do more to tackle the issue,external. A Glasgow University study found many teenagers are so invested in social media and so worried about missing out on posts,they log on in the middle of the night in order to get updates,external, leading to sleep deprivation. It should also be pointed out some studies suggest children cope well with integrating social media into their lives. One, from the University of Oxford, suggested that while children do spend a lot of time online,they have some sophisticated ways of balancing online and offline time,external. The UK Safer Internet Centre found that 68% of young people said chatting to their friends online cheered them up, with 88% saying they had sent other friends ""kind messages"" when they were upset. Despite the sometimes contradictory evidence, the firms have agreed to look at the three issues raised by the UK government, along with the possibility of parental controls, over the coming months. The BBC understands they have been asked to provide evidence of what they believe makes unhealthy online behaviour among 13-18-year-olds, whether that be long periods of time spent online or using the platform at unsocial hours. The government has also asked whether social media firms could provide pop-up messages alerting people who have been online for excessive periods and to give it specific examples. In response to the meeting, Facebook's head of public policy in the UK, Karim Palant, told the BBC: ""Our research shows that when we use social media to connect with people we care about, it can be good for our well-being."" Twitter said simply that it was ""looking forward to positive discussions on these critical issues"". Google did not want to comment publicly. And Snapchat said it was working on ways to improve how threatening messages are flagged by users. Apple, which also attended the Department of Health meeting, recently faced calls from its investors to act on smartphone addiction, with software limiting how long children can use their devices. In response, it said that there were already parental controls built into the operating system of its iPhones.

How much is 'too much'?,"Concerns about the harm caused by ""too much"" screen time - particularly when it is spent on social media - are widespread. But working out what a ""healthy"" amount might be is far from easy. Headlines rarely soothe nerves. Apple's Tim Cook recently said hewould not want his nephew on a social network, while child health experts wrote to Facebook warningexcessive use of digital devices and social media ""is harmful to children and teens"". There are many other such examples. Some negative experiences on social media - like bullying, or becoming worried about how your appearance compares to others - can and do affect some children and young people. However, this does not mean that technology use in general is harmful and it is difficult to make claims about how it will affect different people. Indeed, some studies suggest that using social media can bring benefits, or have no effect on wellbeing at all. Aninquiry into the impact of social media and screen use on young people's healthwas announced this week by UK MPs, who hope to separate ""understandable concerns from the hard evidence"". For now, anyone thinking about how much time using screens and social media is ""OK"" will ultimately have to make a personal judgement. Consider the picture painted by aUnicef review of existing research,externalinto the effects of digital technology on children's psychological wellbeing, including happiness, mental health and social life. Rather than stating that social media was harmful, it suggested a more complex effect. The Unicef report highlighted a 2017 study by my colleagues at the University of Oxfordthat examined 120,000 UK 15-year-olds,external. Among those teenagers who were the lightest users, it was found that increasing the time spent using technology was linked to improved wellbeing - possibly because it was important for keeping up friendships. In contrast, among the heaviest users of technology, any increase in time was linked to lower levels of wellbeing. The researchers suggested that for those teens, technology use might get in the way of taking part in other important activities. Is social media making your child sad? How social media shapes my depression How much screen time should children have? The Fear of Missing Out The point at which the use of technology flips from having a positive effect to a negative effect was different for each category at which the researchers looked. For example, more than two hours of smartphone use on a weekday, and more than four hours on a weekend day, was linked to lower wellbeing. This effect, however, was small and only predicted 1% of a teenager's wellbeing. The researchers suggested that the positive effect of regularly eating breakfast, or getting a proper night's sleep, was three times stronger. Overall, the Unicef study suggested that some screen time could be good for children's mental wellbeing. ""Digital technology seems to be beneficial for children's social relationships,"" it said. The impact on physical activity levels, however, was ""inconclusive"". Similar trends for technology's effects on wellbeing were found in a subsequentstudy among large numbers of teenagers in the US,external. However, the researchers warned that social media and technology use negatively affects teenage wellbeing. The findings made headlines. One of the authors, professor of psychologyJean Twenge, suggested ""excessive"" use of devices was the problem,external. But again, the effects were small, with the positive effects of exercise being more significant. In contrast to the authors of the Oxford study, Dr Twenge recommends less screen time for children. ""Half an hour, an hour a day, that seemed to be the sweet spot for teen mental health in terms of electronic devices,"" she said. A broader look at evidence provided by some other high quality studies again suggests the story is not clear-cut. An early study in 2013 looked at how thetelevision and video game habits of 11,000 UK five-year-olds,externalaffected them two years later. It is one of few studies actually tracing the effects of technology over time. It suggested that, compared with children who watched one hour of television or less on a weekday, a small increase in conduct problems was seen among those who watched more than three hours each day. Playing electronic games, however, was not seen as leading to a greater risk of hyperactivity, or friendship or emotional problems. Parents will need to use their own judgement on how much screen time is ""OK"" So how much time should we, or our children, spend looking at screens? It is difficult to be precise as different people spend time online in such different ways. For example, someone enjoying their time chatting with friends is using social media very differently to someone worrying about their own life as they flick through contacts' photos. It appears to be the case that much of the debate about social media oversimplifies the reality. A useful comparison might be with sugar. Broadly speaking, people agree that excessive amounts of sugar can be bad for your health. But the effect it might have can depend on many factors, from the type of sugar - fruit, or refined; to the person - athlete, or diabetic; and the amount - one gram, or many. We would not readily trust anyone who claims to predict how someone is affected by consuming one gram of sugar. The same could be said for social media usage: the outcomes depend on so many factors that only very crude predictions are possible. Research about social media can sometimes help us navigate the debate, but concrete evidence does not yet exist. This situation could improve significantly as more research is conducted in the coming years. But for now, we will need to rely on our own judgements to decide about just how much time we - and our children - spend on social media.

Afghan voter centre blast kills dozens,"Eight-year-old Zahra is among those being treated in hospital A suicide bomb attack at a voter registration centre in the Afghan capital Kabul has killed at least 57 people, officials say. The dead include 21 women and five children, killed when the blast hit the queue outside. A further 119 people were injured. The Islamic State group (IS) said it had carried out the attack. Voter registration began this month for legislative elections which are due to take place in October. IS's mouthpiece said a suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt had targeted the centre, which is in the Dashte Barchi area of western Kabul. Militants are trying to sow chaos, minister says How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Afghan president: This is the worst job on earth Dashte Barchi is heavily populated by members of Afghanistan's Shia Muslim minority, who have been targeted by IS for their religion in the past. Relatives of victims grieved outside a hospital Children were standing in line with their parents waiting to register when the bomb went off on Sunday morning. There were no immediate details of how the bomb was detonated by the attacker but the force of the blast also destroyed cars. ""I found myself covered in blood, with dead people - women and children - around me,"" Rasuli, 26, recalled when he spoke to AFP news agency from his hospital bed in the city. ""They all wanted to vote,"" he added. Passport-sized photos and forms littered the blast site along with broken glass and pools of blood. Another wounded man, who wept as he spoke from his hospital bed, told local channel Ariana TV, ""I don't know where my daughters are. God damn the attackers!"" The same channel, Reuters news agency reports, showed angry crowds shouting ""Death to the government!"" and, before the IS claim of responsibility, ""Death to the Taliban!"" Allow Twitter content?

There have already been at least four attacks on such centres since voter registration got under way a week ago. Clothes and sandals littered the site of the attack The legislative elections later this year will be followed by a presidential poll in 2019. BBC research earlier this year found that the Afghan government had full control over just 30% of the country, with the rest of the country under significant threat from the Taliban, and, to a lesser extent, IS. Afghanistan's interior minister told the BBC earlier this year that both IS and the Taliban were targeting civilians to provoke people against the government and create chaos. Sunday's attack was Kabul's deadliest sinceat least 100 people were killed in a district full of government buildings and embassies in January. 23 March:A car bomb in Helmand province kills at least 13 spectators at a wrestling match 21 March: A suspected IS suicide bomb attack near a shrine in Kabulkills at least 31 people celebrating Persian New Year 10 March:A Taliban attack in the western province of Farahkills 24 soldiers 27 January:Taliban militants drive an ambulance laden with explosives into a Kabul secure zone, killing at least 100 20 January:Taliban gunmen kill at least 22 peopleat a major Kabul hotel President has 'worst job on Earth' The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' Afghanistan country profile Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

London Marathon is hottest on record,"This video can not be played More than 40,000 runners took part amid temperatures of 24.1C This year's London Marathon was officially the hottest on record. More than40,000 runners took partamid temperatures of 24.1C (75.3F) which were recorded in St James's Park, the Met Office said. Runners were warned it could be even hotter on the course because of the heat absorbed by the roads and from other competitors. The 26.2-mile race was started at 10:00 BST by the Queen whopressed a button from the grounds of Windsor Castle. Giant fans were installed near the finish line to help runners cool off Live updates on the marathon Mo Farah finishes third as Eliud Kipchoge wins Is marathon running bad for you? How to run a marathon in the heat A total of 40,000 runners took part in the marathon Temperatures hit a record-breaking high this year A high of 22.7C (72.8C) was recorded at St James's Park in 1996 and 22.6C (72.6F) in 2007 - whenone runner died after collapsing during the race,externaland 73 had to go to hospital. London Marathon event director Hugh Brasher said organisers distributed four-and-a-half litres of water per person - more than any other mass participation event in the world. However, he admitted water did run out at miles eight, nine and 10. Mr Brasher added that the event, which has seen more than 38,000 finishers, was ""planned thoroughly"" and organisers would see what lessons could be learnt for next year. A total of 800,000 people had been expected to turn out to run and watch Runners in fancy dress were earlier urged to ""think carefully"" if their outfit was appropriate for the weather Before the start of the race, organisers warned the high temperatures could be especially difficult for fancy dress runners. Almost 100 competitors attempted to enter the Guinness World Recordsdressed in outfits such as a suit of armour, a Paddington Bear costume and ski boots. Rob Pope set a new world record time for a competitor dressed as a film star, crossing the line dressed as Forrest Gump in just over 2 hours 36 minutes. Mr Pope, who is running 15,000 miles across America following the route run by Tom Hanks' character, said he had ""never seen crowds like that"". Rob Pope set a new world record time for a competitor dressed as a film star A record 386,050 people applied for this year's race - almost a third more than 2017 and the highest number for any marathon in the world. Runners Matthew Rees and David Wyeth, who hit the headlines last year afterMr Rees helped his fellow competitor over the finish line, completed the race again in near identical times. This video can not be played Matthew Rees helped David Wyeth over the finish line in 2017 The pair started the race together after becoming friends when Mr Wyeth nearly did not finish the race in 2017 after his legs collapsed beneath him. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Wyeth said ""the first person to give me a hug when I finished was my main man"". Extra water was provided for the runners due to the hot weather One runner, Sue Strachan who has vascular dementia, said she received ""amazing"" support from people along the course. ""I have had a couple of wobbles but people from Alzheimer's Research gave me a kiss and said hello and I thought that I have to do this, even if I have to walk at the end. I need to finish."" Britain's David Weir won his eighth London Marathon in the men's wheelchair race This year's runners also includedfirefighters who tackled the Grenfell Tower blazeandpolice officer Charlie Guenigault, who was stabbedin the London Bridge terror attack. Mr Guenigault, 26, ran to raise money for King's College Hospital, where he had three hours of emergency surgery after being knifed five times on 3 June last year. ""I don't think I'm fully recovered. As much as how difficult the race was, at the end of the day I'm just glad to say I can do it,"" he said. The first fire crew to arrive at the Grenfell Tower inferno ran the race as a team, raising more than Â£41,000 for children affected by the disaster.

"Breaking|Breaking newsBritons killed in Saudi Arabia crashBritish nationals were killed in a road crash in Saudi Arabia on Saturday, Foreign Office says6m6 minutes agoUK","This video can not be played Gulfaraz Zaman, director of Hashim Travel, called the incident 'disturbing' Four British people have died and 12 others have been hurt in a coach crash in Saudi Arabia, a travel firm says. Raj Begum Hussain, 70, from Blackburn, died alongside an elderly man and a mother and her grown-up son, all from Preston, in Lancashire. The coach was travelling from Mecca on an Umrah pilgrimage, when it was hit by a fuel tanker which caught fire and set the bus alight, the firm said. Trip organisers Hashim Travel said the incident on Saturday was ""horrendous"". Eighteen people were aboard the coach when it crashed. All were taken to hospital, where six remain. Mrs Hussain - a mother of six and a grandmother of 13 - was travelling with her younger sister who survived but was injured. ""She will be sorely missed by all family and friends.  We would like to thank the whole community for their condolences and support at this difficult time,"" her family said in a statement. It is understood that a young child was also among the injured. The group were travelling as part of an Umrah pilgrimage and had been in Saudi Arabia for a week. The crash happened near the start of the group's five-hour road trip from Mecca to Medina, near the town of Al Khalas. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Umrah pilgrimage is on a smaller scale than the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Blackburn-based Hashim Travel says it specialises in Umrah and Hajj and has been providing travel packages to people in north-west England for 20 years. The company's director, Gulfaraz Zaman, called the incident ""horrendous"" and ""very distressing"". ""If you see the remains of the bus, there's just the metal frame of it that's left,"" he told the BBC. ""It's very upsetting - especially the people that have passed away,"" he added, ""our thoughts are with the families."" He said visas had been arranged for family members of the deceased who were now travelling out to Saudi Arabia. The Council of British Hajjis said it was providing support to a British family which had been affected. Rashid Mogradia, chief executive of Council of British Hajjis, told the BBC the route between Mecca and Medina was a long but ""relatively safe journey"". A lot has been done by the Saudi authorities to improve the safety of pilgrims, he told the BBC. Passengers on the bus were from Accrington, Preston, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Northampton and Blackburn. Abdul Hamid Qureshi, chairman of Lancashire Council of Mosques said: ""This is a very sad incident. Our prayers and thoughts are with the deceased and their families."" Conservative MP for Wyre and Preston North Ben Wallace tweeted his condolences and Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi, who is chair of the recently formed All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hajj and Umrah, said: ""I am really saddened to hear of the death of pilgrims."" ""We are supporting the British families of those who have died and those injured following a serious road traffic accident near the town of Al Khalas, Saudi Arabia,"" a Foreign Office spokesperson said. The British nationals were travelling to the holy city of Medina on an Umrah pilgrimage The Hajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca that takes place in the month of Dhul Hijjah, which is the 12th month of the Islamic lunar calendar. The Umrah is an extra, optional pilgrimage and does not count as the once-in-a-lifetime Hajj. Although it includes some of the rituals of the Hajj, they are shortened and there are fewer of them. Unlike Hajj, it is not obligatory and can take place at any time of the year.

second cup final in a row. To reach final we are very pleased, especially for
our fans, they are the first to deserve this satisfaction. ""Now
our target is to try and put a bit of pressure on the teams in front of us in
the Premier League and get a place in the Champions League and finish as best
as possible. ""Itâs
important for us to reach a final in this competition especially because we are
struggling a lot in the league. ""In the Carabao Cup we reached the semi-final
and in the league we dropped a lot of points and probably next season we will play in the Europa League and not the Champions League."" Chelsea 2-0 Southampton Chelsea Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, speaking to BBC Sport: ""We are
not in the position to prioritise (the FA Cup or fourth), if we want to continue to have hope of
getting into the Champions League we have to take three points in these four games. Now we
must be focused on the league."" Southampton More from Mark Hughes: ""The keeper Willy Caballero made
a glaring mistake, he dropped it down his chest Iâd have thought that was a
clear situation that needed to be reviewed. I donât know how they made that
decision so quickly, Charlie Austin did nothing wrong. ""And
there was a hand ball from following corner by Olivier Giroud, so we feel hard
done by. ""Conceding first goal was always going to be detrimental We
took a centre-back off and they were able to capitalise with a second goal. We
have a huge game next weekend and the focus now is putting this disappointment
behind us very very quickly.

was very good, obviously we're disappointed by the nature of it, after 30 seconds or so. ""We got a response but we didnât
get any luck."" Chelsea 2-0 Southampton Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Police must 'revisit' Stephen Lawrence lessonsVigilance is needed to root out racial stereotyping which can lead to injustice says the Archbishop of York.,"The ""very clear"" lessons from the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation need to be revisited by every UK police force, the Archbishop of York says. The black teenager was killed in a racially-motivated attack in Eltham, south London 25 years ago. The landmark Macpherson Report on the way the case was handled said there had been ""institutional racism"" in the police and made 72 recommendations. Dr John Sentamu said police needed more vigilance against racial stereotyping. He told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme: ""I think the 72 recommendations, which were accepted by the then home secretary, and there was an action plan... I'm afraid it needs to be revisited by every police service so that they learn the lessons that were very clear."" Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline of how the story unfolded Stephen Lawrence filmmaker wants viewers to feel family's emotions When asked what needed to be done to improve attitudes that may be considered racist, Dr Sentamu said: ""I think it is a question of greater training. ""People need to be more vigilant and people need to realise that if you stereotype people, you end up disadvantaging them."" He added: ""When people are white you assume they are guiltless and when they are black you assume they are guilty - how you get that out of an organisation requires clear vigilance."" This video can not be played Neville Lawrence: ""I forgive them all for the murder of my son"" Mr Lawrence was set upon by a gang, stabbed and left to die in Eltham on the evening of 22 April 1993. Two of the group of up to six men who attacked the teenager and friend Duwayne Brooks, simply because they were black, have been convicted of murder, but the rest have evaded justice. David Norris and Gary Dobson are both serving life sentences. Three other men were arrested in relation to the case. Jamie Acourt, 41, from Bexley, his brother Neil Acourt, 42, who uses his mother's maiden name Stuart, and Luke Knight, 41, both from Eltham, all denied any involvement and were never convicted. The Metropolitan Police has said theinvestigation into Stephen's murder is ""unlikely to progress""without new information. Archbishop of York John Sentamu said he had experienced prejudice in the UK Dr Sentamu also spoke of racism he had suffered in his life, telling the programme there had been people who did not want him to conduct their funerals because of the colour of his skin. He added there had been instances where he was stopped and searched, saying: ""I was stopped in my car, I opened the bonnet, I opened the boot, and the gentleman - who got very aggressive - suddenly realised I had a dog collar on and said 'Whoops!'. ""I had experienced all this harassment.""

Hunt calls for bullying action,"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is meeting social media giants, including Facebook and Twitter, to challenge them on cyber-bullying. In tweets ahead of the discussions, he says some responsibility for rising rates of youth self-harm lies with social platforms. He says the industry must be ""part of the solution"" regarding young people's mental health. Social media companies have said they do prioritise user safety. Mr Hunt will be meeting representatives from the biggest providers of social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft. How helpful is social media for our mental health? 'The advice I'd give to my teenage self' Mental health: 10 charts on the scale of the problem Mr Hunt said: ""Social media has become a fundamental part of our children's lives and while the internet provides amazing opportunities we cannot ignore the negative effect disturbing images and bullying are having on their mental health. ""Now is the time to turn the tide on this abuse. I will be working closely with the top social media companies to ensure they can become the solution and not the problem."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Hunt will ask the social media companies: If they can share statistics on how often cyber-bullying happens on their platforms, and what form it takes. If they have information on the number of underage users, and what can be done to prevent them accessing services. Whether it is possible to identify unhealthy online behaviour among teenagers. And take action to try to provide advice and support. A Facebook spokesperson said: ""We want to make sure that everyone, including anyone affected by a mental health issue, has a good experience on Facebook and Instagram. ""We look forward to working with ministers and others to make sure we do everything we can to protect people's wellbeing. ""We have already introduced online tools such as Instagram's automated offensive comment filter and last month launched a new partnership between Facebook, Childnet International and The Diana Award, which is offering every UK secondary school the chance to have a young digital safety ambassador who can support their peers' safety and well-being."" Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has previously been rated as the worst social media platform when it comes to impact on young people's mental health,in a poll of people aged 14-24. Instagram responded by saying it provided tools and information on how to cope with bullying and warned users before they viewed certain content. Dr Marc Bush, chief policy adviser at charity YoungMinds, said social media companies had an important role to play in tackling online bullying, but education was also crucial. ""This means ensuring that young people learn about the positives and negatives of social media from a young age and that they know what to do if they're being harassed or come across upsetting content. ""It also means encouraging young people to take responsibility for their own behaviour and to understand what the impact might be on other people of what they post.""

When the firing stopped and the gunman was looking at his weapon, Mr Shaw rushed him and a scuffle ensued. ""I hit him with the door and the gun was kind of jammed up,"" he said.

Security services 'to get more power',"Eight people were killed when three attackers drove into pedestrians on London Bridge and then stabbed people in Borough Market Police and security services are to get more powers and resources to stop terror attacks at an earlier stage,according to the Sunday Times.,external It says the new government anti-terror strategy proposes sharing information about suspects more widely, according to a leaked draft which it has seen. It follows a review of last year's attacks in Manchester and London. The Home Office would not comment on the leaked report but has promised a ""comprehensive"" strategy. What new anti-terror powers could be used? What is the Prevent strategy? Longer jail terms for web terror viewers Some of the attackers involved in last year's terror attacks at Westminster, London Bridge and Manchester, which saw 35 people killed, had been known to the police and intelligence services. That sparked calls for changes to be made to the UK's counter-terrorism laws. The intelligence agency MI5 has information on more than 23,000 ""subjects of interest"", but only around 3,000 are under active investigation. The Sunday Times reports that the new strategy will enable counter-terrorism investigators to warn other agencies - government departments, councils, devolved administrations and local police forces - about suspects on their radar before they are considered dangerous enough to be placed under MI5 surveillance. It is claimed the plan, due to be published in the next few weeks, also calls for more focus on ""communities where the threat from terrorism and radicalisation is highest"". It would also introduce longer prison terms for terror offences, as well as more intensive monitoring when people are released from jail. A ""change of approach"" is required, according to the leaked report, as the threat of terrorism is ""higher"" since the last counter-terrorism strategy was published in 2011. Last year Home Secretary Amber Rudd set out her intention to increase the maximum sentence for people who repeatedly view terrorist content online to 15 years. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""The updated counter-terrorism strategy, which is still being finalised, will be a comprehensive and cross-cutting response to the evolving threat from domestic and international terrorism. ""The home secretary has made crystal clear her determination to leave no safe space for terrorists to act or recruit and to keep our families, communities and country safe.""

Nicaragua reporter killed on Facebook Live,"Riot police and students in Managua have faced off across barricades A journalist in Nicaragua has been shot dead while doing a live broadcast about anti-government protests. Ãngel Gahona was reporting on damage at a bank in the Caribbean coast town of Bluefields when a bullet hit him during his Facebook Live newscast. Video footage shows him falling to the ground and bleeding. More than 10 people have died in days of protests against pension changes approved by the government of President Daniel Ortega on Wednesday. The move increased pension contributions for workers and employers and reduced overall benefits by 5%. This video can not be played The protest against pension changes have escalated in recent days Mr Ortega has offered talks but protest leaders have refused, saying police violence must stop first. Government buildings have been damaged or set on fire, and troops have been deployed in several cities. Students from Polytechnic University in Managua have barricaded their campus. At least 100 people have been injured. Pope Francis has called for an end to the violence and for differences to ""be resolved peacefully and with a sense of responsibility."" One human rights group reported that the death toll was more than 25. Who is Daniel Ortega? Nicaragua's first lady In Friday's incident in Bluefields, the footage shows Mr Gahona describing a damaged cash machine before a shot rings out. He is then seen slumping to the ground, as people scream his name and try to help. It is unclear who shot him or why. Mr Ortega won the 2016 election along with his wife, Rosario Murillo, who became Nicaragua's vice-president The protests are the biggest challenge to Mr Ortega's authority since he took office in 2007. He has said the new measures will not go into effect until 1 July, which gives the government and the private sector time to negotiate. The government seemed to have the situation under control on Saturday, with deployment of army troops across the country. Protesters blamed riot police and government supporters for the violence. The human rights group Amnesty International said the authorities had been carrying out a ""terrifying clampdown on dissent"".

Armenia detains protest leader amid unrest,"This video can not be played There were scuffles as Nikol Pashinyan was detained Thousands of anti-government protesters have rallied defiantly in the Armenian capital Yerevan after riot police seized their leader. Nikol Pashinyan was arrested after televised talks with Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan collapsed. In a tense exchange, the opposition MP insisted the PM should quit and Mr Sargsyan accused him of ""blackmail"". The opposition object to Mr Sargsyan clinging to power after serving two consecutive terms as president. He was elected to the post by parliament on Tuesday, fuelling anger on the streets. As well as Mr Pashinyan, two other opposition politicians and some 200 demonstrators have been held, leaving the protest movement without political leadership. The EU, which has a partnership agreement with Armenia, called on all sides to ""show restraint and act responsibly"". Armenia country profile By Rayhan Demytrie, BBC News, in Armenia's capital Yerevan Armenia's biggest square is full of protesters. The detention of Mr Pashinyan and other opposition leaders did not stop protesters from turning up. They are holding placards that read ""I am Nikol"" and chanting his name, along with another slogan, ""Serzh go"". University student Elina Isahanyan, wrapped in the Armenian flag, says she has been participating in the protests for nine days. ""My friends and I are not attending classes. This is our way to show to this new government that we want change,"" she says. ""We are peaceful and we don't want any violence. We don't want the police to be against us."" Buses loaded with police in flak jackets can be seen in the streets leading up to the square. The justice ministry issued a warning reminding citizens that the police have the right to disperse demonstrations regardless of the nature of the protests. Protests against Mr Sargsyan have been held in other parts of Armenia - the second largest city of Guymri and the city of Vanadzor. Mr Pashinyan was previously jailed over his part in protests against Mr Sargsyan in 2008. He recently described the campaign he leads as a ""velvet revolution"", referring to the peaceful protests in 1989 that ended communist rule in Czechoslovakia. He met Mr Sargsyan at a hotel in Yerevan on Sunday morning, in the presence of dozens of journalists. The exchange was brief. After the prime minister said he was glad his rival had ""responded to my numerous appeals to negotiate"", Mr Pashinyan struck an uncompromising note. PM Serzh Sargsyan denounced Mr Pashinyan's ""blackmail"" before aborting their meeting ""I think there is a misunderstanding,"" he said. ""I have come here to discuss the terms of your resignation and the terms of a peaceful and smooth transition of power."" Mr Sargsyan said that ""this is not a dialogue, this is blackmail"" and left. Scuffles broke out between police and protesters on Sunday Addressing the assembled reporters afterwards, Mr Pashinyan called on his supporters to continue their protests, which have continued for more than a week. He was detained shortly afterwards, as riot police using stun grenades dispersed protesters. Masked police have been holding back the crowds His supporters then gathered outside a police station where they believed he was being held before they set off towards the capital's central Republic Square. He has been accused of failing to address continuing tensions with Azerbaijan and Turkey, as well as widespread poverty at home. His government has also been criticised by the opposition for its close ties to Russia, whose leaderVladimir Putin also moved between the positions of president and prime minister to maintain his grip on power. While he was president, the country shifted from a presidential system to a parliamentary republic, vesting real power in the office of the prime minister. He stood for prime minister despite promising he would not. Here Serzh Sargsyan's face is scored out on a poster His supporters argue that the tough veteran of the Nagorno-Karabakh war with Azerbaijan in the late 1980s has provided the national security Armenia needs. Serzh Sargsyan, who served as president from 2008 until this year, has been left largely unchallenged for years because of a lack of clear rivals and alternatives, Armenian affairs analystRichard Giragosian,externaltells BBC News. ""Pashinyan was the exception with his unique combination of charisma with a good sense of street politics, which only makes this current confrontation more serious."" he says. The power of the ruling Republican Party is potentially even more dangerous as it ""undermines the necessity for consensus and compromise"". ""The real question now is what lies ahead. After such polarisation and dissent, the launch of parliamentary politics seems destined to fail, undermined by an inherent lack of trust or public confidence."" However the crisis plays out, ""there is little or no foreign policy dimension"", he adds. ""It is not about Russia and not about Europe. It is local politics and economics.""

Police must 'revisit' Stephen Lawrence lessons,"The ""very clear"" lessons from the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation need to be revisited by every UK police force, the Archbishop of York says. The black teenager was killed in a racially-motivated attack in Eltham, south London 25 years ago. The landmark Macpherson Report on the way the case was handled said there had been ""institutional racism"" in the police and made 72 recommendations. Dr John Sentamu said police needed more vigilance against racial stereotyping. He told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme: ""I think the 72 recommendations, which were accepted by the then home secretary, and there was an action plan... I'm afraid it needs to be revisited by every police service so that they learn the lessons that were very clear."" Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline of how the story unfolded Stephen Lawrence filmmaker wants viewers to feel family's emotions When asked what needed to be done to improve attitudes that may be considered racist, Dr Sentamu said: ""I think it is a question of greater training. ""People need to be more vigilant and people need to realise that if you stereotype people, you end up disadvantaging them."" He added: ""When people are white you assume they are guiltless and when they are black you assume they are guilty - how you get that out of an organisation requires clear vigilance."" This video can not be played Neville Lawrence: ""I forgive them all for the murder of my son"" Mr Lawrence was set upon by a gang, stabbed and left to die in Eltham on the evening of 22 April 1993. Two of the group of up to six men who attacked the teenager and friend Duwayne Brooks, simply because they were black, have been convicted of murder, but the rest have evaded justice. David Norris and Gary Dobson are both serving life sentences. Three other men were arrested in relation to the case. Jamie Acourt, 41, from Bexley, his brother Neil Acourt, 42, who uses his mother's maiden name Stuart, and Luke Knight, 41, both from Eltham, all denied any involvement and were never convicted.

Could you give up plastic for a month?,"Ten years ago I attempted to live plastic-free. With the government pledging to crack down on plastic waste, will it be any easier a decade on? Summer 2008 was a warm one. I know that because my kitchen gently hummed with the sour scent of plastic milk bottles and yoghurt cartons. During that July, I saved all 603 plastic items my husband, toddler and I generated so I could compare withan experimental month ""off"" plastic,externalin the August that followed. The project was triggered by a BBC report onplastic pollution in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,external, which left me wondering if it was possible to eliminate disposable plastic from normal daily life. The answer was: ""not quite"". But that August we reduced our plastic tally to just 116 items, of which 63 were disposable nappies. Plastic fantastic: How it changed the world Plastic recycling: Your questions answered Six simple ways to cut back on plastic UK faces build-up of plastic waste Ten years later, nappies are no longer in my shopping trolley. It's now laden with the full range of groceries consumed by a family with two school-age children. Much of it is packed in plastic - and it's easy to see why: this lightweight, durable material keeps food fresh and is easy to move and store. But with avoiding disposable plastic high on many people's to-do lists, I decided to rerun my 2008 experiment. Would spending a month without buying anything wrapped in, or containing, plastic be any easier now? I tackle our breakfast routine first. We awake to milk on the doorstep, in glass bottles, just like in my childhood, albeit ordered online rather than via handwritten note. The kids are amused by the novelty and I overhear my eight-year-old daughter telling a friend: ""They appear outside our house overnight."" Milk doorstep delivery new subscriptions have risen since the start of January It seems we are not alone in making the switch in 2018. MÃ¼ller-owned delivery company Milk & More says it has had 10,000 new online customers signing up since 1 January, of which 90% are ordering milk in glass bottles. It comes despite a long term downward trend for milk deliveries which last year accounted for just 3% by volume of the milk sold - down from 7% in 2008. Delivered milk is more costly: a glass doorstep pint is around 81p, whereas a four-pint supermarket bottle is about Â£1.10. But not having to pick up milk has already cut my ""top-up"" trips to the local convenience store. My homemade bagels won't win any prizes Milk bottles are one of the most widely and easily-recycled pieces of plastic packaging. At the other end of the recyclability scale are plastic films such as bags, pouches and peelable lids which make up more than a quarter of plastic household waste. As a family we are heavily reliant at breakfast time on bags of bagels and boxes of cereals with plastic inners. This prompts me to try making bagels for the first time in my life - not as hard as you might think. But as for cereals, my suggestion to the rest of the family that we all eat porridge for a month (boxes of oats have no liners) goes down like a gruel-filled balloon. Then I find a new ""zero waste"" shop a couple of miles away that has versions of our usual options but loose in bins for scooping into our own containers. Family breakfast truce achieved. There's no avoiding the fact that visiting separate shops for separate goods takes longer than my normal one-hit blitz at the supermarket. So I decide to give my usual routine a try - but on my new avoid-plastic-at-all-costs rule. Attempting to shop based on packaging status alone leads to some combinations worthy of Ready Steady Cook: leeks, carrots, a giant mango and a box of eggs. Films and nets are not currently easily recycled Bags of salad are out, as is most pasta and rice. Tinned food is easier although cans of acidic foods such as tomatoes, or even fizzy drinks, have a plastic lining to stop the contents reacting with the metal. Many glass jars have plastic lids or labels so items such as chocolate hazelnut spread are off the menu too (sorry kids) but I take a risk with some pasta sauces, wondering whether the synthetic rubber lining to the lids counts as plastic. I'm reminded how heavy glass, tins and cardboard are - and, of course, have their own environmental impact - as I heave my trolley to the checkout. Here, there is a major change since my original challenge. Single-use carrier bags are no longer dished out freely, since 2015 in England (and earlier in other parts of the UK) they cost at least 5p. The levy has slashed usage by 83%, according to government figures. Several chains are now dropping the 5p bags altogether and only selling ""bags for life"". Like so many shoppers, I'd brought my own reusable bags, so no rule-breaking there. But the food on the shelves doesn't seem any less plastic-wrapped than a decade ago. Retailers say shrink-wrapping fish and meat has cut the amount of plastic used and prolongs shelf life However, Iain Ferguson, environment manager at the Co-op says food retailers have made many changes, they just may not be immediately visible. ""In the past 10 years a lot of work has gone into making plastic films thinner and plastic bottles lighter,"" he says. Modifications such as removing polystyrene from pizza bases, switching tomato punnets to cardboard and packing meat in one type of plastic rather than layers of differing types are other moves the Co-op has made. ""Our customers say they want no plastic but customers also buy in plastic because they want the convenience,"" Mr Ferguson says. ""The best thing we can do is to make it easier to recycle."" All the major supermarkets insist they havemade or are making significant changesand frozen food retailer Iceland hasannounced it will do away with plastic altogether,externalfor its own brand products by 2023. Back to the pressing issue of family teatime, I grab a cardboard box of fish-fingers, some naked broccoli and loose potatoes. Giant mango for pudding. Half term and we travel from London to Cornwall. Unfortunately I forget my reusable cup and water bottle and end up with a pile of junk from the journey down, adding to the21 million water bottles,externaland6.8 million coffee cups,externalthe UK gets through each day. Avril Sainsbury of Bude Cleaner Seas says attitudes to plastic litter are changing I turn to social media for a nudge back on track. Online campaigning has increased massively since 2008 and hashtags such as #oneless, #nomoresingleuse and #strawssuck, are all used to promote the idea that small changes can create a big effect. Among them is my children's favourite -#2minutebeachclean,externalwhich started in the north Cornish seaside resort of Bude in 2014. Known for its long sandy beaches and rolling surf, the town sees the effects of plastic pollution every day, especially after a storm. ""It can feel overwhelming,"" says Avril Sainsbury of water quality projectBude Cleaner Seas,externalas we survey Crooklets Beach together. ""You will see everything that you'll find in your home, disposable lighters, bottles, caps, seals - to ghost nets, which are [abandoned] fishing nets."" But she says attitudes to marine litter are changing and people are now more likely to say ""gosh I'll help you"" if they see a beach clean taking place. Micro plastics mingle with the sand on Crooklets Beach in Bude I'm feeling guilty about those water bottles and coffee cups from the journey but Bude is a practical place. Local teacher Deb Rosser has come up with a practical solution. ""You can go to anywhere in Bude - that can be cafes, shops and accommodation providers - and they will refill your bottle for free with pure Cornish tap water,"" says Deb, describing herRefill Bude,externalconcept which has spread nationwide since starting in 2014. Sales of branded Refill Bude cups and bottles have raised more than Â£5,000 for Bude Sea Pool There are now 7,800 refill points around the UK and I find a new one in Boscastle National Trust Cafe, near where we are staying. The manager says the cafe has also just swapped from cardboard cups and plates to crockery. No excuse then for plastic-free fails while we're on holiday. Back at home and some plastic-packed toiletries run out this week. I purchase a bamboo toothbrush (admittedly with nylon bristles), and get to grips with a shampoo bar instead of a bottle. Our stock of toilet paper holds out, just, but I research a paper-wrapped alternative that can be delivered. At the end of the month, we have not managed to live entirely plastic-free but we have cut down on our normal consumption. It's taken a lot more time but has not necessarily been more expensive as it's forced me to limit what I buy. My 48-item plastic tally for the month The tally for the month comes to 48 plastic items including: Five ham packets - several packed lunch fails Three cereal inners Two chicken packs A polystyrene pizza base Chocolate mini eggs - they were foil wrapped but in a plastic net Two jelly wrappers A sachet of yeast from making those bagels Once nappies are taken out of the equation, it's not too different from the 53 items I gathered during my experiment 10 years ago. Yet looking back on my normal consumption in 2008, there have been big changes. Then, I used 36 disposable carrier bags a month, got through 23 polystyrene coffee cups at work and a plastic water bottle every other day. Now, my office has a stock of mugs, and taking a reusable bag and water bottle everywhere with me has become second nature. The same can't be said for plastic-free food shopping. While I will keep some of my swaps (including the milk delivery) I do find it currently impractical to keep my family fed without buying any plastic at all. However, with changes coming thick and fast - plastic-free teabags, the deposit return scheme, stores encouraging customers to bring their own containers - I may not need to wait 10 more years to give it another try.

"Security services 'to get more power'Security services will get more powers to stop terror attacks, according to a leaked document.3h3 hours agoUK","Eight people were killed when three attackers drove into pedestrians on London Bridge and then stabbed people in Borough Market Police and security services are to get more powers and resources to stop terror attacks at an earlier stage,according to the Sunday Times.,external It says the new government anti-terror strategy proposes sharing information about suspects more widely, according to a leaked draft which it has seen. It follows a review of last year's attacks in Manchester and London. The Home Office would not comment on the leaked report but has promised a ""comprehensive"" strategy. What new anti-terror powers could be used? What is the Prevent strategy? Longer jail terms for web terror viewers Some of the attackers involved in last year's terror attacks at Westminster, London Bridge and Manchester, which saw 35 people killed, had been known to the police and intelligence services. That sparked calls for changes to be made to the UK's counter-terrorism laws. The intelligence agency MI5 has information on more than 23,000 ""subjects of interest"", but only around 3,000 are under active investigation. The Sunday Times reports that the new strategy will enable counter-terrorism investigators to warn other agencies - government departments, councils, devolved administrations and local police forces - about suspects on their radar before they are considered dangerous enough to be placed under MI5 surveillance. It is claimed the plan, due to be published in the next few weeks, also calls for more focus on ""communities where the threat from terrorism and radicalisation is highest"". It would also introduce longer prison terms for terror offences, as well as more intensive monitoring when people are released from jail. A ""change of approach"" is required, according to the leaked report, as the threat of terrorism is ""higher"" since the last counter-terrorism strategy was published in 2011. Last year Home Secretary Amber Rudd set out her intention to increase the maximum sentence for people who repeatedly view terrorist content online to 15 years. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""The updated counter-terrorism strategy, which is still being finalised, will be a comprehensive and cross-cutting response to the evolving threat from domestic and international terrorism. ""The home secretary has made crystal clear her determination to leave no safe space for terrorists to act or recruit and to keep our families, communities and country safe.""

Corbyn addresses Welsh Labour as FM quits,"Carwyn Jones (R), pictured in 2009, fired Carl Sargeant after allegations emerged about the minister's conduct First Minister Carwyn Jones's decision to stand down does not help Carl Sargeant's family, their lawyer has told BBC Wales. Neil Hudgell said there will be no ""closure"" until the inquiry into the circumstances around Mr Sargeant's death concludes. Mr Jones's decision to leave office in the autumn was dramatically announced at Welsh Labour conference on Saturday. It comes five months after he sacked Mr Sargeant who was found dead days later. UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to Mr Jones when he spoke at the conference in Llandudno, saying the AM for Bridgend is""not done yet"". Mr Jones, who will step down after around nine years in charge, said on Saturday he had been through the ""darkest of times"". He sacked the AM for Alyn and Deeside Carl Sargeant last November following allegations of inappropriate conduct towards women. Mr Jones and his office have been under intense pressure ever since - from Mr Sargeant's family, and from politicians both within Labour and outside. Carwyn Jones to quit as first minister The leader who lost his grip Harris elected Welsh Labour deputy leader Timeline: The death of Carl Sargeant On Friday, lawyers for Mr Sargeant's son Jack - who succeeded him as AM for Alyn and Deeside - said the family was frustrated by delays to an independent inquiry led by QC Paul Bowen into Mr Jones's handling of the November reshuffle. They also said Mr Jones's own conduct had caused ""considerable distress"" to the family. Asked by BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme whether Mr Jones's decision to resign helps Carl Sargeant's family, Mr Hudgell said: ""Not at all. ""The family completely empathise with the human cost of being involved in high profile office - and the fact that he can go home to his family in the autumn, they are very pleased for the Jones family. ""But they will never get any closure until they get to the end of this journey with Paul Bowen and his investigation, and him being able to have access to all relevant material and all relevant witness, so they can finally understand the events that led up to the tragic loss of their father and husband."" He called for the publication of a report into whether the sacking of Carl Sargeant was leaked - saying it could be redacted if needed. The Welsh Government has refused to publish the report, warning witnesses would be reluctant to come forward in future if they knew their identities could be disclosed. ""My understanding is that report is going to be highly critical, not only of the handling of the leaks, but of the inquiry and how it is conducted,"" Mr Hudgell said. Independent AM and ex-Plaid Cymru leader Lord Elis-Thomas joined the Welsh Government last year Mr Jones is expected to stay on as a AM after he quits as first minister - meaning no by-election will be triggered. Welsh Government minister Lord Elis-Thomas, a former Plaid Cymru leader and now independent AM, said it was ""appalling"" that people inside and outside the Labour Party had been ""gunning for"" Mr Jones. He told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme: ""What is the point of removing someone who has said that he intends to do a particular period [in office], he was talking about 10 years? ""And then, when the tragic events surrounding Carl Sargeant happened, there was an attempt to pin this on Carwyn. ""And I found that reprehensible, because you cannot say that the hugely difficult, traumatic issue involving a person taking his own life, a politician or anyone else, can be pinned on one other person."" Lord Elis-Thomas refused to say which individuals he was talking about. ""No, I'm not going to pin names on anyone, because I don't want to be doing what they did to Carwyn,"" he added. Carolyn Harris beat Julie Morgan to the role of Welsh Labour deputy leader The announcement by Mr Jones overshadowed the controversy that developed on the same day over the Welsh Labour deputy leadership election. Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris beat Julie Morgan, Cardiff North AM, to win the job despite winning fewer votes than Ms Morgan among the party membership. Under the terms of the poll's electoral college, the votes of MPs and AMs and groups linked to Labour, including trade unions, outweighed the membership. Ms Morgan told Sunday Supplement that it is ""absolutely essential"" that the next leader is chosen on a one-member-one-vote franchise - and she was ""fairly confident"" that it would happen. ""We don't want the first minister and the leader of Labour to be elected in a way which leaves it open for that person to be elected without having the majority support of the members,"" she said. She said she hoped an upcoming democracy review in Labour, due to be debated in Llandudno on Sunday, would set up a commission that ""does not have to take a year to report"" and that leadership elections should be looked at ""straight away"". This video can not be played Carwyn Jones stands down after 'the darkest of times' Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford, considered by many to be a front-runner for the job of first minister, said he was giving ""serious consideration"" to putting himself in the running following Mr Jones's announcement. Others, including Jeremy Miles, Alun Davies, Vaughan Gething and Huw Irranca-Davies, have declined to rule themselves out. The first minister told the conference that his departure would give his family, his party and the country a ""fresh start"". Referring to his wife and family, Mr Jones told delegates on Saturday: ""I don't think anyone can know what the last few months have been like - no one apart from Lisa and the kids. ""They have carried me through the darkest of times. I have asked too much of them at times. It's time for me to think about what's fair to them.""

Hamas man shot dead in MalaysiaMalaysian officials say the suspects are believed to have links to a foreign intelligence service.15h15 hours agoAsia,"Ten shots were fired at the Palestinian professor early on Saturday morning A Palestinian professor and member of the Hamas militant organisation has been killed in a drive-by shooting on the streets of the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur. The family of Fadi al-Batsh, 35, has accused Israel's spy agency Mossad of being behind his killing on Saturday. Malaysian officials said the suspects are believed to have links to a foreign intelligence agency. Israeli officials have not yet commented on the killing. Hamas has accused Israel of conducting assassinations of its experts abroad in the past, although Mossad has never confirmed such operations. A recent case involvedthe killing of a Tunisian national who was believed to be a Hamas drone expert in 2016. Who are Hamas? A simple guide to the Gaza conflict Fadi al-Batsh was walking from his residence to a nearby mosque at about 0600 on Saturday (2300 GMT Friday) when he came under attack. Two gunmen on a motorbike fired 10 shots, killing him on the spot, Kuala Lumpur police chief Mazlan Lazim said. ""Preliminary investigations found four gunshot wounds on the victim's body. Two bullet slugs were found at the scene of the incident,"" he added in a statement. The police chief said that CCTV footage showed the suspects, who later fled the scene, had waited about 20 minutes in the area before attacking Mr Batsh. ""We believe the lecturer was their target because two other individuals walked by the place earlier unharmed."" Hamas said the victim, a research scientist who specialised in energy issues, was one of its members Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid, quoted by state news agency Bernama, said the victim had links to a foreign intelligence organisation and was active in pro-Palestinian non-governmental organisations. The suspects are believed to be Caucasians who also have ties to a foreign intelligence service, Mr Zahid told reporters. Mr Batsh, who had lived in Malaysia for several years, was a lecturer in electrical engineering. Hamas said one of its members had been ""assassinated"", describing him as a ""martyr"" - a term it usually uses for people killed by Israeli forces. However, it stopped short of directly accusing Israel of the killing. Israel is believed to have assassinated members of militant groups abroad in the past. In 1997, Mossad agents conducted a failed bid to kill Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal in Jordan by spraying poison into his ear. The holiday village run by spies The spy agency is also believed to have been behind the 2010 murder of top Hamas militant Mahmud al-Mabhuh, who died in a Dubai hotel. Israel has never confirmed or denied involvement in his killing.

London Marathon set to be 'hottest ever',"This video can not be played More than 40,000 runners took part amid temperatures of 24.1C This year's London Marathon was officially the hottest on record. More than40,000 runners took partamid temperatures of 24.1C (75.3F) which were recorded in St James's Park, the Met Office said. Runners were warned it could be even hotter on the course because of the heat absorbed by the roads and from other competitors. The 26.2-mile race was started at 10:00 BST by the Queen whopressed a button from the grounds of Windsor Castle. Giant fans were installed near the finish line to help runners cool off Live updates on the marathon Mo Farah finishes third as Eliud Kipchoge wins Is marathon running bad for you? How to run a marathon in the heat A total of 40,000 runners took part in the marathon Temperatures hit a record-breaking high this year A high of 22.7C (72.8C) was recorded at St James's Park in 1996 and 22.6C (72.6F) in 2007 - whenone runner died after collapsing during the race,externaland 73 had to go to hospital. London Marathon event director Hugh Brasher said organisers distributed four-and-a-half litres of water per person - more than any other mass participation event in the world. However, he admitted water did run out at miles eight, nine and 10. Mr Brasher added that the event, which has seen more than 38,000 finishers, was ""planned thoroughly"" and organisers would see what lessons could be learnt for next year. A total of 800,000 people had been expected to turn out to run and watch Runners in fancy dress were earlier urged to ""think carefully"" if their outfit was appropriate for the weather Before the start of the race, organisers warned the high temperatures could be especially difficult for fancy dress runners. Almost 100 competitors attempted to enter the Guinness World Recordsdressed in outfits such as a suit of armour, a Paddington Bear costume and ski boots. Rob Pope set a new world record time for a competitor dressed as a film star, crossing the line dressed as Forrest Gump in just over 2 hours 36 minutes. Mr Pope, who is running 15,000 miles across America following the route run by Tom Hanks' character, said he had ""never seen crowds like that"". Rob Pope set a new world record time for a competitor dressed as a film star A record 386,050 people applied for this year's race - almost a third more than 2017 and the highest number for any marathon in the world. Runners Matthew Rees and David Wyeth, who hit the headlines last year afterMr Rees helped his fellow competitor over the finish line, completed the race again in near identical times. This video can not be played Matthew Rees helped David Wyeth over the finish line in 2017 The pair started the race together after becoming friends when Mr Wyeth nearly did not finish the race in 2017 after his legs collapsed beneath him. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Wyeth said ""the first person to give me a hug when I finished was my main man"". Extra water was provided for the runners due to the hot weather One runner, Sue Strachan who has vascular dementia, said she received ""amazing"" support from people along the course. ""I have had a couple of wobbles but people from Alzheimer's Research gave me a kiss and said hello and I thought that I have to do this, even if I have to walk at the end. I need to finish."" Britain's David Weir won his eighth London Marathon in the men's wheelchair race This year's runners also includedfirefighters who tackled the Grenfell Tower blazeandpolice officer Charlie Guenigault, who was stabbedin the London Bridge terror attack. Mr Guenigault, 26, ran to raise money for King's College Hospital, where he had three hours of emergency surgery after being knifed five times on 3 June last year. ""I don't think I'm fully recovered. As much as how difficult the race was, at the end of the day I'm just glad to say I can do it,"" he said. The first fire crew to arrive at the Grenfell Tower inferno ran the race as a team, raising more than Â£41,000 for children affected by the disaster. Firefighter Mike Dowden said: ""The people we were running for were on the last mile and that was really emotional."" Members of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust also took part, as the marathon marks 25 years since the teenager - who was a keen runner - was murdered. Sir Mo Farah came third in the men's elite race, but broke the British record with a time of 2:06:22 Olympic champion Eliud Kipchogecame first in the men's elite raceto win his third London Marathon title, with Britain's Sir Mo Farah finishing third and setting a new British record. Vivian Cheruiyot of Kenyawon the women's elite race- recording a personal best time of 2:18:31. Kathrine Switzer, who made history in 1967 by competing in the then men-only Boston Marathon, also completed the course. The 71-year-old, who 50 years ago had to fight off race officials to compete, said: ""There are thousands of women out there whose lives have been so enhanced and empowered from running."" Vivian Cheruiyot won her first London Marathon Britain's David Weirwon his eighth London Marathonwith a time of 01:31:15 as he took first place in the men's wheelchair race.

Armenia faces crunch talks after unrest,"This video can not be played There were scuffles as Nikol Pashinyan was detained Thousands of anti-government protesters have rallied defiantly in the Armenian capital Yerevan after riot police seized their leader. Nikol Pashinyan was arrested after televised talks with Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan collapsed. In a tense exchange, the opposition MP insisted the PM should quit and Mr Sargsyan accused him of ""blackmail"". The opposition object to Mr Sargsyan clinging to power after serving two consecutive terms as president. He was elected to the post by parliament on Tuesday, fuelling anger on the streets. As well as Mr Pashinyan, two other opposition politicians and some 200 demonstrators have been held, leaving the protest movement without political leadership. The EU, which has a partnership agreement with Armenia, called on all sides to ""show restraint and act responsibly"". Armenia country profile By Rayhan Demytrie, BBC News, in Armenia's capital Yerevan Armenia's biggest square is full of protesters. The detention of Mr Pashinyan and other opposition leaders did not stop protesters from turning up. They are holding placards that read ""I am Nikol"" and chanting his name, along with another slogan, ""Serzh go"". University student Elina Isahanyan, wrapped in the Armenian flag, says she has been participating in the protests for nine days. ""My friends and I are not attending classes. This is our way to show to this new government that we want change,"" she says. ""We are peaceful and we don't want any violence. We don't want the police to be against us."" Buses loaded with police in flak jackets can be seen in the streets leading up to the square. The justice ministry issued a warning reminding citizens that the police have the right to disperse demonstrations regardless of the nature of the protests. Protests against Mr Sargsyan have been held in other parts of Armenia - the second largest city of Guymri and the city of Vanadzor. Mr Pashinyan was previously jailed over his part in protests against Mr Sargsyan in 2008. He recently described the campaign he leads as a ""velvet revolution"", referring to the peaceful protests in 1989 that ended communist rule in Czechoslovakia. He met Mr Sargsyan at a hotel in Yerevan on Sunday morning, in the presence of dozens of journalists. The exchange was brief. After the prime minister said he was glad his rival had ""responded to my numerous appeals to negotiate"", Mr Pashinyan struck an uncompromising note. PM Serzh Sargsyan denounced Mr Pashinyan's ""blackmail"" before aborting their meeting ""I think there is a misunderstanding,"" he said. ""I have come here to discuss the terms of your resignation and the terms of a peaceful and smooth transition of power."" Mr Sargsyan said that ""this is not a dialogue, this is blackmail"" and left. Scuffles broke out between police and protesters on Sunday Addressing the assembled reporters afterwards, Mr Pashinyan called on his supporters to continue their protests, which have continued for more than a week. He was detained shortly afterwards, as riot police using stun grenades dispersed protesters. Masked police have been holding back the crowds His supporters then gathered outside a police station where they believed he was being held before they set off towards the capital's central Republic Square. He has been accused of failing to address continuing tensions with Azerbaijan and Turkey, as well as widespread poverty at home. His government has also been criticised by the opposition for its close ties to Russia, whose leaderVladimir Putin also moved between the positions of president and prime minister to maintain his grip on power. While he was president, the country shifted from a presidential system to a parliamentary republic, vesting real power in the office of the prime minister. He stood for prime minister despite promising he would not. Here Serzh Sargsyan's face is scored out on a poster His supporters argue that the tough veteran of the Nagorno-Karabakh war with Azerbaijan in the late 1980s has provided the national security Armenia needs. Serzh Sargsyan, who served as president from 2008 until this year, has been left largely unchallenged for years because of a lack of clear rivals and alternatives, Armenian affairs analystRichard Giragosian,externaltells BBC News. ""Pashinyan was the exception with his unique combination of charisma with a good sense of street politics, which only makes this current confrontation more serious."" he says. The power of the ruling Republican Party is potentially even more dangerous as it ""undermines the necessity for consensus and compromise"". ""The real question now is what lies ahead. After such polarisation and dissent, the launch of parliamentary politics seems destined to fail, undermined by an inherent lack of trust or public confidence."" However the crisis plays out, ""there is little or no foreign policy dimension"", he adds. ""It is not about Russia and not about Europe. It is local politics and economics.""

More than half your body is not human,"More than half of your body is not human, say scientists. Human cells make up only 43% of the body's total cell count. The rest are microscopic colonists. Understanding this hidden half of ourselves - our microbiome - is rapidly transforming understanding of diseases from allergy to Parkinson's. The field is even asking questions of what it means to be ""human"" and is leading to new innovative treatments as a result. ""They are essential to your health,"" says Prof Ruth Ley, the director of the department of microbiome science at the Max Planck Institute, ""your body isn't just you"". No matter how well you wash, nearly every nook and cranny of your body is covered in microscopic creatures. This includes bacteria, viruses, fungi and archaea (organisms originally misclassified as bacteria). The greatest concentration of this microscopic life is in the dark murky depths of our oxygen-deprived bowels. Prof Rob Knight, from University of California San Diego, told the BBC: ""You're more microbe than you are human."" Originally it was thought our cells were outnumbered 10 to one. ""That's been refined much closer to one-to-one, so the current estimate is you're about 43% human if you're counting up all the cells,"" he says. But genetically we're even more outgunned. The human genome - the full set of genetic instructions for a human being - is made up of 20,000 instructions called genes. But add all the genes in our microbiome together and the figure comes out between two and 20 million microbial genes. Prof Sarkis Mazmanian, a microbiologist from Caltech, argues: ""We don't have just one genome, the genes of our microbiome present essentially a second genome which augment the activity of our own. ""What makes us human is, in my opinion, the combination of our own DNA, plus the DNA of our gut microbes."" Listen to The Second Genomeon BBC Radio 4. Airs 11:00 BST Tuesday April 10, repeated 21:00 BST Monday April 16 and on the BBC iPlayer It would be naive to think we carry around so much microbial material without it interacting or having any effect on our bodies at all. Science is rapidly uncovering the role the microbiome plays in digestion, regulating the immune system, protecting against disease and manufacturing vital vitamins. Prof Knight said: ""We're finding ways that these tiny creatures totally transform our health in ways we never imagined until recently."" It is a new way of thinking about the microbial world. To date, our relationship with microbes has largely been one of warfare. Antibiotics and vaccines have been the weapons unleashed against the likes of smallpox, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or MRSA. That's been a good thing and has saved large numbers of lives. But some researchers are concerned that our assault on the bad guys has done untold damage to our ""good bacteria"". Prof Ley told me: ""We have over the past 50 years done a terrific job of eliminating infectious disease. ""But we have seen an enormous and terrifying increase in autoimmune disease and in allergy. ""Where work on the microbiome comes in is seeing how changes in the microbiome, that happened as a result of the success we've had fighting pathogens, have now contributed to a whole new set of diseases that we have to deal with."" The microbiome is also being linked to diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson's, whether cancer drugs work and even depression and autism. Obesity is another example. Family history and lifestyle choices clearly play a role, but what about your gut microbes? This is where it might get confusing. A diet of burgers and chocolate will affect both your risk of obesity and the type of microbes that grow in your digestive tract. So how do you know if it is a bad mix of bacteria metabolising your food in such a way, that contributes to obesity? Prof Knight has performed experiments on mice that were born in the most sanitised world imaginable. Their entire existence is completely free of microbes. He says: ""We were able to show that if you take lean and obese humans and take their faeces and transplant the bacteria into mice you can make the mouse thinner or fatter depending on whose microbiome it got."" Topping up obese with lean bacteria also helped the mice lose weight. ""This is pretty amazing right, but the question now is will this be translatable to humans"" This is the big hope for the field, that microbes could be a new form of medicine. It is known as using ""bugs as drugs"". I met Dr Trevor Lawley at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, where he is trying to grow the whole microbiome from healthy patients and those who are ill. ""In a diseased state there could be bugs missing, for example, the concept is to reintroduce those."" Dr Lawley says there's growing evidence that repairing someone's microbiome ""can actually lead to remission"" in diseases such as ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease. And he added: ""I think for a lot of diseases we study it's going to be defined mixtures of bugs, maybe 10 or 15 that are going into a patient."" Microbial medicine is in its early stages, but some researchers think that monitoring our microbiome will soon become a daily event that provides a brown goldmine of information about our health. Prof Knight said: ""It's incredible to think each teaspoon of your stool contains more data in the DNA of those microbes than it would take literally a tonne of DVDs to store. ""At the moment every time you're taking one of those data dumps as it were, you're just flushing that information away. ""Part of our vision is, in the not too distant future, where as soon as you flush it'll do some kind of instant read-out and tells you are you going in a good direction or a bad direction. ""That I think is going to be really transformative.""

Dog's 'cancer' turns out to be teddies,"Maisy had an operation after a CT scan showed a full stomach A sick St Bernard dog whose owners feared she could have cancer was found to have eaten four teddy bears instead. Eight-year-old Maisy had a CT scan which showed an unusually full stomach and a mass on her spleen, which led her vet to diagnose possible cancer. During an operation to remove the spleen, Wakefield-based vet Nick Blackburn found the soft toys in her stomach. Mr Blackburn said ""this was not something we were expecting to find"". ""We all know certain dogs enjoy chewing things they shouldn't but managing to devour four full teddy bears is quite a feat,"" said Mr Blackburn. Mr Blackburn, who works at Paragon Veterinary Referrals, said Maisy had since made a full recovery from her operation and a histology report showed no sign of cancer. A CT scan revealed a mass on the dog's spleen The dog's owner Jane Dickinson, from Roberttown, near Dewsbury, said the recovered teddies were stolen by Maisy from the family's Chihuahuas.

'I was a contestant on Supermarket Sweep',"Supermarket Sweep saw contestants answer quiz questions before filling their trolley with as much valuable shopping as possible Supermarket Sweep was the ultimate mid-morning TV show with its contestants envied by uni students everywhere. It saw three teams battle it out to fill a shopping trolley with the highest-valued goods - putting all weekly shops to shame in the process. Teams would answer questions and riddles to gain vital trolley dash time. Dale Winton presented both runs of the ITV show, from 1993-2001 and again in 2007.

Kal said he had always watched Supermarket Sweep growing up and saw it advertised when he was a university student. ""I applied with my friend Steve, we got an audition and ended up on the show,"" he said. ""During the show, we stopped the cameras so he could get his mascara redone! It's still so strange that my first words on national television were 'Apple Crumble Dale!' - we were told to say 'Dale' after each sentence, which we were more than happy to do."" Kal and his friend Steve appeared on the show in 2007 The pair, wearing bright yellow jumpers, got to go ""wild in the aisles"" (one of Dale's famous catchphrases on the show) and even managed to pick up some items for Dale for extra points. ""I dashed around the supermarket, which was a studio in Maidstone, Kent,"" Kal said. ""I managed to get Dale's shopping list (vitamins and orange squash), poppadoms, the pick and mix, and an inflatable microphone worth Â£50. Allow Twitter content?

Cat and dog travel buddies capture hearts,"Baloo (top) and Henry's close bond has won them almost half a million followers on Instagram Best friends Henry and Baloo have a lot in common - they have both been rescued and now enjoy long walks in the great outdoors. What makes them special to their many fans is that they are a dog and cat travelling duo. Their unlikely friendship and hiking trips around the beautiful mountainous landscapes of Colorado have gained the pair a cult social media following. Hundreds of thousands of people follow their adventures on the photo-sharing platform Instagram. For owners Cynthia Bennett and Andre Sibilsky, their popularity is surreal. Baloo is known for his unusual sleeping position - on top of Henry's head Cynthia and Andre met in Boston, but as New Hampshire and Texas natives, the couple say they are both nature lovers who were destined to move away from city life. ""We wanted to head west, toward bigger mountains. We came upon Colorado and moved on a whim, there wasn't a lot of planning involved,"" Cynthia told the BBC. The pair started hiking regularly and once settled, decided to extend their family by adopting a dog. Henry - a tall and lanky German Shepherd, Husky, Boxer, Staffordshire Terrier and Aussie mix - stood out right away. The animals' popularity has allowed the couple to pursue their love of the outdoors ""He was the same age as all the other puppies but twice the size. As soon as I got into the pen to see him, he crawled onto my lap and went belly up,"" Cynthia explains, laughing. ""Andre knew then we were taking him home. I feel like he chose us in a way."" The growing popularity of whiskers in the workplace Black cats being shunned for purr-fect selfies Rescue dog gets 3D printed leg Born as a street puppy, Henry was adopted from a rescue centre that re-homes animals from other states whose shelters have high abandonment and kill rates. A mix of high energy dogs, he took to hiking and long walks straight away. A year later, Cynthia realised that she was posting too many pictures of Henry on her social media accounts, and decided it would be a fun idea to give him one of his own. Henry has joined his owners on their nature walks since they adopted him as a puppy It took three years to get 30,000 followers on the account. That number spiralled out of control when they got Baloo. ""Henry had really bad separation anxiety when we weren't home. He would be so stressed out that he didn't eat or drink, so we decided we really wanted a buddy for him,"" Cynthia says. ""I love to take my animals everywhere - and because of Instagram I had seen other people hiking with cats, who really loved being outside,"" she adds. Allow Instagram content?

The couple spent months looking for the right match for their unique situation. ""After all"" Cynthia laughed, ""You can't really force a cat to do anything."" Like Henry, Baloo was a rescue animal. He was part of a litter of eight kittens belonging to a mother whose owner refused to have neutered. He and his siblings were abandoned immediately. ""As soon as he met Henry he attached himself right away. Baloo definitely has an obsession with Henry - if I need him to calm down, I'll put him next to him and he'll just fall asleep. The two rescue pets have become Instagram sensations because of their unusual bond The pair have proven perfect models for Cynthia's love of photography ""I truly believe he [Baloo] thinks Henry is his Mom,"" she says. ""For the first few months he would actually knead him looking to nurse."" Cynthia believes the Siamese mix thinks he's a dog, too. ""If he sees a dog out on a walk he'll run up to it, but if he sees a cat he will pretend it isn't there and ignore it. Like, do you not understand what you are? It's quite funny."" Photographs and videos of the cat and dog together, with Baloo riding or running alongside on a leash, have exploded in popularity on social media. Allow Instagram content?

Cynthia's family, she says, are dumbfounded by their popularity. ""I told my grandfather, who is my best friend. He's very outdoorsy and natural so we've always been really close. He thinks it's mind-blowing."" Sorry cats, doggos run the internet now From berated blogger to beauty millionaire The rise of the tweenage vlogger Andre works a typical office job in finance, but the popularity of the Instagram account has led Cynthia to scale back on her work in event marketing and focus more on updating the account and her passion for photography. The animals' popularity has led to endorsement deals, such as those popular with other online celebrity animals like Grumpy cat. ""Taking a leap as an artist is very scary and it's not very stable in the long side of things, but I tell my followers all the time you are changing my life and allowing me to do what I love,"" Cynthia says. Cynthia points out to followers that Baloo is not strapped in any way to Henry The animals behave like family members and best friends ""It's also giving Henry and Baloo a better life, I get more time off to travel and be with them."" It is not all positive, however. Popularity has brought on some backlash against the couple's alternative outdoor-based lifestyle, according to Cynthia. ""As soon as you get well known, you get the other side - which has been different to deal with. ""I'm like, why are you attacking a dog and a cat? I just don't get it."" Baloo, who wears a harness on walks, is said to love exploring as much as Henry But she says the support far outweighs the negativity. Through the social platform they have been able to connect with others, such as people in the so-called ""vanlife,external"" community, who receive similar complaints and criticism over their nomadic lifestyles. ""You just have to ignore it and let it wash over you. You just read the hundreds of other comments that say Henry and Baloo brighten up their day.""

Chemical experts finally see Syria siteInternational experts make a much-delayed examination of the site of a suspected attack in Douma.12h12 hours agoMiddle East,"This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded International chemical weapons experts have finally inspected the site of a suspected attack near Damascus which caused an international crisis. The team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) travelled to the town of Douma and collected samples and other items. Last week Western states bombed several Syrian government sites in retaliation for the suspected attack on 7 April. Syria and Russia, which now control Douma, deny chemical arms were used. More than 40 people are said to have died on 7 April. The joint military response by the US, UK and France followed a war of words with Russia, Syria's main military ally. The delay in the OPCW visit encouraged the proliferation of rival theories and accusations ricocheted between the various capitals and across the internet, BBC Arab Affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. What did Western strikes target? Were the Syria strikes legal? In a press release, the OPCW said its team had visited one of the two sites reportedly bombed in Douma on 7 April. The unspecified samples will be sent to the OPCW Laboratory in Rijswijk, a suburb of The Hague, and then analysed by designated labs, the agency said. Other information and ""materials"" have also been collected by the inspectors, it said. An ITV News correspondent recorded the return of the OPCW convoy to Damascus. Allow Twitter content?

The nine-strong team had been waiting for a week in the Syrian capital for clearance to visit the town. They had been due to enter the town on Wednesday but the visit was delayed after a UN risk assessment team came under fire while checking the sites on Tuesday. The OPCW at The Hague has shown the kind of bullet-proof vests and helmets used by its staff on missions Western officials fear that evidence of the alleged double chemical attack may have been tampered with. However, important traces of toxic chemicals would probably still be present in the environment and in the remains of victims, Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, told AFP news agency. ""Nerve agents like sarin can be present in the environment for many weeks after use and particularly if you look near the site where a weapon has exploded,"" he said. ""Autopsy samples, if available, will provide invaluable evidence and nerve agents can be found in many organs."" How do you test for chemical weapons? What we know about the 'chemical attack' Journalists have been visiting a warren of tunnels dug in Douma to avoid air strikes Douma was constantly under attack during the recent Russian-backed Syrian offensive to drive rebels out of areas near Damascus and is still littered with the debris of war, making any inspection potentially hazardous. Warren of war tunnels revealed The rebels withdrew under a deal with the Russian military just after 7 April. While there is suspicion that efforts may have been made to remove forensic evidence of chemical weapons, foreign journalists have already visited the town. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry accused the OPCW of itself taking too long,externalto inspect the suspected attack sites. On the day of the suspected chemical attack, Douma was still under the control of the Jaish al-Islam  group, the last rebel bastion in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after alleged gas attack Thousands of people were sheltering in basements from government bombardment, when two bombs filled with chemicals were allegedly dropped several hours apart on two separate locations. The US, UK and France say that, based on open-source information and their own intelligence, they are confidentchlorine and possibly a nerve agent were used,external. The Syrian government and Russia deny chemical weapons were used and say evidence was fabricated. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media While the Syrian government denies having ever used chemical weapons, experts from the UN and the OPCW have ascribed four chemical attacks to the government during the civil war. These includean attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun just over a year ago that involved the nerve agent Sarin. More than  80 people are said to have died in that attack.

Corbyn addresses Welsh Labour as FM quitsWelsh Labour conference delegates are still reeling from news that Carwyn Jones is standing down.5h5 hours agoWales politics,"Carwyn Jones (R), pictured in 2009, fired Carl Sargeant after allegations emerged about the minister's conduct First Minister Carwyn Jones's decision to stand down does not help Carl Sargeant's family, their lawyer has told BBC Wales. Neil Hudgell said there will be no ""closure"" until the inquiry into the circumstances around Mr Sargeant's death concludes. Mr Jones's decision to leave office in the autumn was dramatically announced at Welsh Labour conference on Saturday. It comes five months after he sacked Mr Sargeant who was found dead days later. UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to Mr Jones when he spoke at the conference in Llandudno, saying the AM for Bridgend is""not done yet"". Mr Jones, who will step down after around nine years in charge, said on Saturday he had been through the ""darkest of times"". He sacked the AM for Alyn and Deeside Carl Sargeant last November following allegations of inappropriate conduct towards women. Mr Jones and his office have been under intense pressure ever since - from Mr Sargeant's family, and from politicians both within Labour and outside. Carwyn Jones to quit as first minister The leader who lost his grip Harris elected Welsh Labour deputy leader Timeline: The death of Carl Sargeant On Friday, lawyers for Mr Sargeant's son Jack - who succeeded him as AM for Alyn and Deeside - said the family was frustrated by delays to an independent inquiry led by QC Paul Bowen into Mr Jones's handling of the November reshuffle. They also said Mr Jones's own conduct had caused ""considerable distress"" to the family. Asked by BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme whether Mr Jones's decision to resign helps Carl Sargeant's family, Mr Hudgell said: ""Not at all. ""The family completely empathise with the human cost of being involved in high profile office - and the fact that he can go home to his family in the autumn, they are very pleased for the Jones family. ""But they will never get any closure until they get to the end of this journey with Paul Bowen and his investigation, and him being able to have access to all relevant material and all relevant witness, so they can finally understand the events that led up to the tragic loss of their father and husband."" He called for the publication of a report into whether the sacking of Carl Sargeant was leaked - saying it could be redacted if needed. The Welsh Government has refused to publish the report, warning witnesses would be reluctant to come forward in future if they knew their identities could be disclosed. ""My understanding is that report is going to be highly critical, not only of the handling of the leaks, but of the inquiry and how it is conducted,"" Mr Hudgell said. Independent AM and ex-Plaid Cymru leader Lord Elis-Thomas joined the Welsh Government last year Mr Jones is expected to stay on as a AM after he quits as first minister - meaning no by-election will be triggered. Welsh Government minister Lord Elis-Thomas, a former Plaid Cymru leader and now independent AM, said it was ""appalling"" that people inside and outside the Labour Party had been ""gunning for"" Mr Jones. He told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme: ""What is the point of removing someone who has said that he intends to do a particular period [in office], he was talking about 10 years? ""And then, when the tragic events surrounding Carl Sargeant happened, there was an attempt to pin this on Carwyn. ""And I found that reprehensible, because you cannot say that the hugely difficult, traumatic issue involving a person taking his own life, a politician or anyone else, can be pinned on one other person."" Lord Elis-Thomas refused to say which individuals he was talking about. ""No, I'm not going to pin names on anyone, because I don't want to be doing what they did to Carwyn,"" he added. Carolyn Harris beat Julie Morgan to the role of Welsh Labour deputy leader The announcement by Mr Jones overshadowed the controversy that developed on the same day over the Welsh Labour deputy leadership election. Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris beat Julie Morgan, Cardiff North AM, to win the job despite winning fewer votes than Ms Morgan among the party membership. Under the terms of the poll's electoral college, the votes of MPs and AMs and groups linked to Labour, including trade unions, outweighed the membership. Ms Morgan told Sunday Supplement that it is ""absolutely essential"" that the next leader is chosen on a one-member-one-vote franchise - and she was ""fairly confident"" that it would happen. ""We don't want the first minister and the leader of Labour to be elected in a way which leaves it open for that person to be elected without having the majority support of the members,"" she said. She said she hoped an upcoming democracy review in Labour, due to be debated in Llandudno on Sunday, would set up a commission that ""does not have to take a year to report"" and that leadership elections should be looked at ""straight away"". This video can not be played Carwyn Jones stands down after 'the darkest of times' Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford, considered by many to be a front-runner for the job of first minister, said he was giving ""serious consideration"" to putting himself in the running following Mr Jones's announcement. Others, including Jeremy Miles, Alun Davies, Vaughan Gething and Huw Irranca-Davies, have declined to rule themselves out. The first minister told the conference that his departure would give his family, his party and the country a ""fresh start"". Referring to his wife and family, Mr Jones told delegates on Saturday: ""I don't think anyone can know what the last few months have been like - no one apart from Lisa and the kids. ""They have carried me through the darkest of times. I have asked too much of them at times. It's time for me to think about what's fair to them.""

""By that point it will make sense to have a fresh start for my family, my party and my country."" The announcement came despite the Welsh Labour leader telling BBC Wales on Friday that he was looking forward to continuing as first minister ""for some time to come"". Carl Sargeant was found dead days after he was sacked from his cabinet level job Mr Jones has been under pressure from Mr Sargeant's family and both opposition and Labour politicians who have wanted answers to questions over the circumstances of the minister's sacking. Carl Sargeant's death led to Mr Jones announcing several inquiries. Two have been completed, but an independent probe into the circumstances led by QC Paul Bowen around his sacking is yet to begin. Following Mr Jones' announcement, Carl Sargeant's son Jack, who has taken the Alyn and Deeside seat vacated by his father, said: ""Nothing changes. The inquiries are still relevant and should continue."" On Friday the lawyer for Jack Sargeant said Mr Jones' manner hadcaused the family distress. Mr Jones has said he did not see how that could be the case. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said he would not make a decision ""off the cuff"" Mark Drakeford, who has been tipped as a future leader of the party, did not rule out the prospect of running for Welsh Labour leader when he told BBC Wales:  ""I will talk to others. I've got to think of my own family in talking to them, and I will think about it very seriously. ""But I can quite easily see why that serious consideration would conclude that I wouldn't want to do it."" Jeremy Miles, the Welsh Government's counsel general, also did not rule out the prospect of running when BBC Wales asked if he would stand, saying it would depend on ""who puts their name forward"". Huw Irranca-Davies, minister for children and social care, said he was also considering running. Alun Davies, the local government secretary, said he would wait and see what to do. But he insisted that the next leader must not be elected under the current electoral college system, which was used to elect deputy leader Carolyn Harriswhose victory was also announced on Saturday. Leadership elections have been a controversial matter in the Labour party, with many grassroots campaigners calling for one member one vote (OMOV). Allow Twitter content?

Following Mr Jones' announcement, Carl Sargeant's son Jack, who has taken the Alyn and Deeside seat vacated by his father, said: ""Nothing changes. The inquiries are still relevant and should continue."" On Friday the lawyer for Jack Sargeant said Mr Jones' manner hadcaused the family distress. Mr Jones has said he did not see how that could be the case.

I've got to think of my own family in talking to them, and I will think about it very seriously. ""But I can quite easily see why that serious consideration would conclude that I wouldn't want to do it."" Jeremy Miles, the Welsh Government's counsel general, also did not rule out the prospect of running when BBC Wales asked if he would stand, saying it would depend on ""who puts their name forward"". Huw Irranca-Davies, minister for children and social care, said he was also considering running. Alun Davies, the local government secretary, said he would wait and see what to do. But he insisted that the next leader must not be elected under the current electoral college system, which was used to elect deputy leader Carolyn Harriswhose victory was also announced on Saturday. Leadership elections have been a controversial matter in the Labour party, with many grassroots campaigners calling for one member one vote (OMOV). Allow Twitter content?

Plaid Cymru leader, Leanne Wood, congratulated Carwyn Jones on his nine years as first minister, but added: ""Wales needs more than a change of leader. We need a new government with the ideas, the values and the drive to build our nation into the successful country we know it could be."" Former Labour AM and ex-local government minister Leighton Andrews, who has been critical of the first minister following Carl Sargeant's death, said Mr Jones had many significant achievements during his period as first minister, but said unanswered questions remain.

Hunt calls for cyber-bullying action,"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is meeting social media giants, including Facebook and Twitter, to challenge them on cyber-bullying. In tweets ahead of the discussions, he says some responsibility for rising rates of youth self-harm lies with social platforms. He says the industry must be ""part of the solution"" regarding young people's mental health. Social media companies have said they do prioritise user safety. Mr Hunt will be meeting representatives from the biggest providers of social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft. How helpful is social media for our mental health? 'The advice I'd give to my teenage self' Mental health: 10 charts on the scale of the problem Mr Hunt said: ""Social media has become a fundamental part of our children's lives and while the internet provides amazing opportunities we cannot ignore the negative effect disturbing images and bullying are having on their mental health. ""Now is the time to turn the tide on this abuse. I will be working closely with the top social media companies to ensure they can become the solution and not the problem."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Hunt will ask the social media companies: If they can share statistics on how often cyber-bullying happens on their platforms, and what form it takes. If they have information on the number of underage users, and what can be done to prevent them accessing services. Whether it is possible to identify unhealthy online behaviour among teenagers. And take action to try to provide advice and support. A Facebook spokesperson said: ""We want to make sure that everyone, including anyone affected by a mental health issue, has a good experience on Facebook and Instagram. ""We look forward to working with ministers and others to make sure we do everything we can to protect people's wellbeing. ""We have already introduced online tools such as Instagram's automated offensive comment filter and last month launched a new partnership between Facebook, Childnet International and The Diana Award, which is offering every UK secondary school the chance to have a young digital safety ambassador who can support their peers' safety and well-being."" Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has previously been rated as the worst social media platform when it comes to impact on young people's mental health,in a poll of people aged 14-24. Instagram responded by saying it provided tools and information on how to cope with bullying and warned users before they viewed certain content. Dr Marc Bush, chief policy adviser at charity YoungMinds, said social media companies had an important role to play in tackling online bullying, but education was also crucial. ""This means ensuring that young people learn about the positives and negatives of social media from a young age and that they know what to do if they're being harassed or come across upsetting content. ""It also means encouraging young people to take responsibility for their own behaviour and to understand what the impact might be on other people of what they post.""

"A month without plastic - 10 years onTen years ago I tried to live without plastic for a month. A decade on, would it be easier or harder?1han hour agoUK","Ten years ago I attempted to live plastic-free. With the government pledging to crack down on plastic waste, will it be any easier a decade on? Summer 2008 was a warm one. I know that because my kitchen gently hummed with the sour scent of plastic milk bottles and yoghurt cartons. During that July, I saved all 603 plastic items my husband, toddler and I generated so I could compare withan experimental month ""off"" plastic,externalin the August that followed. The project was triggered by a BBC report onplastic pollution in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,external, which left me wondering if it was possible to eliminate disposable plastic from normal daily life. The answer was: ""not quite"". But that August we reduced our plastic tally to just 116 items, of which 63 were disposable nappies. Plastic fantastic: How it changed the world Plastic recycling: Your questions answered Six simple ways to cut back on plastic UK faces build-up of plastic waste Ten years later, nappies are no longer in my shopping trolley. It's now laden with the full range of groceries consumed by a family with two school-age children. Much of it is packed in plastic - and it's easy to see why: this lightweight, durable material keeps food fresh and is easy to move and store. But with avoiding disposable plastic high on many people's to-do lists, I decided to rerun my 2008 experiment. Would spending a month without buying anything wrapped in, or containing, plastic be any easier now? I tackle our breakfast routine first. We awake to milk on the doorstep, in glass bottles, just like in my childhood, albeit ordered online rather than via handwritten note. The kids are amused by the novelty and I overhear my eight-year-old daughter telling a friend: ""They appear outside our house overnight."" Milk doorstep delivery new subscriptions have risen since the start of January It seems we are not alone in making the switch in 2018. MÃ¼ller-owned delivery company Milk & More says it has had 10,000 new online customers signing up since 1 January, of which 90% are ordering milk in glass bottles. It comes despite a long term downward trend for milk deliveries which last year accounted for just 3% by volume of the milk sold - down from 7% in 2008. Delivered milk is more costly: a glass doorstep pint is around 81p, whereas a four-pint supermarket bottle is about Â£1.10. But not having to pick up milk has already cut my ""top-up"" trips to the local convenience store. My homemade bagels won't win any prizes Milk bottles are one of the most widely and easily-recycled pieces of plastic packaging. At the other end of the recyclability scale are plastic films such as bags, pouches and peelable lids which make up more than a quarter of plastic household waste. As a family we are heavily reliant at breakfast time on bags of bagels and boxes of cereals with plastic inners. This prompts me to try making bagels for the first time in my life - not as hard as you might think. But as for cereals, my suggestion to the rest of the family that we all eat porridge for a month (boxes of oats have no liners) goes down like a gruel-filled balloon. Then I find a new ""zero waste"" shop a couple of miles away that has versions of our usual options but loose in bins for scooping into our own containers. Family breakfast truce achieved. There's no avoiding the fact that visiting separate shops for separate goods takes longer than my normal one-hit blitz at the supermarket. So I decide to give my usual routine a try - but on my new avoid-plastic-at-all-costs rule. Attempting to shop based on packaging status alone leads to some combinations worthy of Ready Steady Cook: leeks, carrots, a giant mango and a box of eggs. Films and nets are not currently easily recycled Bags of salad are out, as is most pasta and rice. Tinned food is easier although cans of acidic foods such as tomatoes, or even fizzy drinks, have a plastic lining to stop the contents reacting with the metal. Many glass jars have plastic lids or labels so items such as chocolate hazelnut spread are off the menu too (sorry kids) but I take a risk with some pasta sauces, wondering whether the synthetic rubber lining to the lids counts as plastic. I'm reminded how heavy glass, tins and cardboard are - and, of course, have their own environmental impact - as I heave my trolley to the checkout. Here, there is a major change since my original challenge. Single-use carrier bags are no longer dished out freely, since 2015 in England (and earlier in other parts of the UK) they cost at least 5p. The levy has slashed usage by 83%, according to government figures. Several chains are now dropping the 5p bags altogether and only selling ""bags for life"". Like so many shoppers, I'd brought my own reusable bags, so no rule-breaking there. But the food on the shelves doesn't seem any less plastic-wrapped than a decade ago. Retailers say shrink-wrapping fish and meat has cut the amount of plastic used and prolongs shelf life However, Iain Ferguson, environment manager at the Co-op says food retailers have made many changes, they just may not be immediately visible. ""In the past 10 years a lot of work has gone into making plastic films thinner and plastic bottles lighter,"" he says. Modifications such as removing polystyrene from pizza bases, switching tomato punnets to cardboard and packing meat in one type of plastic rather than layers of differing types are other moves the Co-op has made. ""Our customers say they want no plastic but customers also buy in plastic because they want the convenience,"" Mr Ferguson says. ""The best thing we can do is to make it easier to recycle."" All the major supermarkets insist they havemade or are making significant changesand frozen food retailer Iceland hasannounced it will do away with plastic altogether,externalfor its own brand products by 2023. Back to the pressing issue of family teatime, I grab a cardboard box of fish-fingers, some naked broccoli and loose potatoes. Giant mango for pudding. Half term and we travel from London to Cornwall. Unfortunately I forget my reusable cup and water bottle and end up with a pile of junk from the journey down, adding to the21 million water bottles,externaland6.8 million coffee cups,externalthe UK gets through each day. Avril Sainsbury of Bude Cleaner Seas says attitudes to plastic litter are changing I turn to social media for a nudge back on track. Online campaigning has increased massively since 2008 and hashtags such as #oneless, #nomoresingleuse and #strawssuck, are all used to promote the idea that small changes can create a big effect. Among them is my children's favourite -#2minutebeachclean,externalwhich started in the north Cornish seaside resort of Bude in 2014. Known for its long sandy beaches and rolling surf, the town sees the effects of plastic pollution every day, especially after a storm. ""It can feel overwhelming,"" says Avril Sainsbury of water quality projectBude Cleaner Seas,externalas we survey Crooklets Beach together. ""You will see everything that you'll find in your home, disposable lighters, bottles, caps, seals - to ghost nets, which are [abandoned] fishing nets."" But she says attitudes to marine litter are changing and people are now more likely to say ""gosh I'll help you"" if they see a beach clean taking place. Micro plastics mingle with the sand on Crooklets Beach in Bude I'm feeling guilty about those water bottles and coffee cups from the journey but Bude is a practical place. Local teacher Deb Rosser has come up with a practical solution. ""You can go to anywhere in Bude - that can be cafes, shops and accommodation providers - and they will refill your bottle for free with pure Cornish tap water,"" says Deb, describing herRefill Bude,externalconcept which has spread nationwide since starting in 2014. Sales of branded Refill Bude cups and bottles have raised more than Â£5,000 for Bude Sea Pool There are now 7,800 refill points around the UK and I find a new one in Boscastle National Trust Cafe, near where we are staying. The manager says the cafe has also just swapped from cardboard cups and plates to crockery. No excuse then for plastic-free fails while we're on holiday. Back at home and some plastic-packed toiletries run out this week. I purchase a bamboo toothbrush (admittedly with nylon bristles), and get to grips with a shampoo bar instead of a bottle. Our stock of toilet paper holds out, just, but I research a paper-wrapped alternative that can be delivered. At the end of the month, we have not managed to live entirely plastic-free but we have cut down on our normal consumption. It's taken a lot more time but has not necessarily been more expensive as it's forced me to limit what I buy. My 48-item plastic tally for the month The tally for the month comes to 48 plastic items including: Five ham packets - several packed lunch fails Three cereal inners Two chicken packs A polystyrene pizza base Chocolate mini eggs - they were foil wrapped but in a plastic net Two jelly wrappers A sachet of yeast from making those bagels Once nappies are taken out of the equation, it's not too different from the 53 items I gathered during my experiment 10 years ago. Yet looking back on my normal consumption in 2008, there have been big changes. Then, I used 36 disposable carrier bags a month, got through 23 polystyrene coffee cups at work and a plastic water bottle every other day. Now, my office has a stock of mugs, and taking a reusable bag and water bottle everywhere with me has become second nature. The same can't be said for plastic-free food shopping. While I will keep some of my swaps (including the milk delivery) I do find it currently impractical to keep my family fed without buying any plastic at all. However, with changes coming thick and fast - plastic-free teabags, the deposit return scheme, stores encouraging customers to bring their own containers - I may not need to wait 10 more years to give it another try.

"Boy, 3, drowns while swimming in poolThe boy was swimming with his family in a David Lloyd Fitness Club in Moortown, Leeds.9h9 hours agoLeeds & West Yorkshire","Police were called to a David Lloyd fitness club at 09:45 BST after reports of a child drowning in a pool A three-year-old boy has died while swimming at a pool in Leeds. Police were called to Tongue Lane at about 09:45 BST after reports of a child drowning in a pool at a David Lloyd fitness club in the Moortown area of the city. The boy was taken by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary accompanied by his mother but was later confirmed dead. West Yorkshire Police said they believed his death was not suspicious and was a ""tragic accident"". In a statement, the club said it was ""deeply shocked and saddened"" and its thoughts were ""very much with the boy's family at this very sad time"". ""The child was swimming with his family in our indoor pool at the time of the incident,"" the statement continued. ""He was found unconscious just after 9.30am this morning, and was rescued from the water by one of our team. ""Our club teams are fully trained to deal with incidents of this nature, and they immediately administered CPR and the emergency services were called."" The club said it was closing for the rest of the day following the death and would be making no further comment. David Lloyd apologised to customers after it shut its club following the boy's death Det Insp James Entwistle said: ""While there is nothing to suggest that the death was suspicious, we do have a duty to investigate the circumstances of what has happened. ""We understand there were a number of people in the pool at the time who have left the area prior to police arriving at the scene. ""We would ask these people to come forward to give their accounts of what they have seen and heard."" On its website, the club states it has a 25m (82ft) indoor pool, a 20m (66ft) outdoor pool, plus indoor and outdoor splash pools. One child, who went to use the club with a friend, said he could not get into the pool and saw ""most of the people crying and upset"". ""There were loads of workers all panicking... and they had red faces. People were just going in, out, in, out. ""We were just really scared so we just hid behind the bike sheds."" The club said it was ""deeply saddened"" by what had happened A woman, who did not give her name, turned up at the club with two children. She said: ""I've just been told not to go in because a small child has died there this morning. ""That's made me really really upset because David Lloyd is really good and I've seen lots of lifeguards everyday watching over the children, but I don't know what's happened and that's scaring me. ""I don't think I'll be able to swim again in that pool."" Another man, known on social media as Chris R,tweeted,external: ""We often take our 2-year-old to this pool. Always at least two lifeguards, seems so safe. ""Absolutely tragic, can't imagine what the parents must be going through."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
