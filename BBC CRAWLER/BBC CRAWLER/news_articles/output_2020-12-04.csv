Beer poured away as pubs in Wales close,"City centre streets were deserted after the ban closed pubs and restaurants Barrels of beer are being poured down drains as Wales' hospitality industry prepared for the alcohol ban to come into force. Pubs, restaurants and cafes arebanned from serving alcohol from Friday eveningand must close at 18:00 GMT, other than for takeaway service. Businesses said it was ""a devastating hammer blow"" after going to lengths to keep customers safe. They said the restrictions will also significantly impact the supply chain. Can people from Wales go to England to drink? Can I meet friends under new Covid rules? What do the new rules mean for pubs in Wales? This video can not be played 'It's like a death sentence' At the Glamorgan Brewery in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, staff have been pouring barrels of beer down the drain because it now cannot be sold in pubs. On Thursday, 58 of the company's 64 employees went back onto furlough. Barrels of beer are being poured down the drain due to the ban Director David Atkins said the new measures are ""an absolute kick in the teeth"". ""This time last year we probably turned over about Â£1.5m for the month of December. This year, it's Â£50,000. He added the majority of their beer - about 45,000 pints - will have to be thrown away. Pubs began clearing tables and chairs as the ban came into force at 18:00 GMT on Friday At The Cricketers pub in Pontcanna, Cardiff, staff were also pouring away beer on Friday afternoon. Simon Buckley, of Evan Evans Brewery which supplies the pub said: ""How can it be right and safe to open to serve food in pubs but not alcohol? It defies logic. Drinkers enjoy final night before pub alcohol ban Welsh Government pulls Christmas drinks TV advert ""Why is 6pm the bewitching hour as opposed to 10pm? In these difficult times - and the month of December particularly - the lost revenue is significant."" This video can not be played What does Wales' hospitality sector make of the new Covid rules? James Cunningham, manager of the Ruthin Castle Hotel in Ruthin, Denbighshire, said customers have appreciated the safety measures put in place and the new rules were ""incredibly frustrating"". ""Whenever they can, people want to try to come out and enjoy themselves in these very, very testing times,"" he said. He described the measures as a ""devastating hammer blow"" to the hospitality industry. ""Figures show that less than 5% of all settings of infection happen in hospitality - and yet here we are once again taking the hammer blow,"" he said. ""There's no guarantee those restrictions are going to be lifted,"" he said.

Brexit talks paused amid 'significant divergences',"Talks to reach a post-Brexit trade deal have been paused, because UK and EU negotiators say ""significant divergences"" remain. Michel Barnier and David Frost said conditions for a deal between the two sides have not been met. European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen and PM Boris Johnson will discuss the state of play on Saturday. State aid subsidies, fishing and enforcement of new rules remain the key sticking points in negotiations. If a deal is not agreed by 31 December, the two sides will trade on World Trade Organization rules, meaning the introduction of taxes on imports. What next as Brexit negotiators hit pause button? How many trade deals has the UK done so far? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Releasing identical statements on Twitter, Mr Barnier and Lord Frost said: ""After one week of intense negotiation in London, the two chief negotiators agreed today that the conditions for an agreement are not met, due to significant divergences on level playing field, governance and fisheries. ""On this basis, they agreed to pause the talks in order to brief their principals on the state of play of the negotiations."" Mr Barnier is negotiating on behalf of the 27 EU member states and can only act within the mandate set by their leaders. A senior UK government source told BBC News the statement shows how far apart both sides are and that the trade talks have run into problems. Earlier, Boris Johnson's spokesman said the government was ""committed to working hard to try and reach agreement"" but emphasised that the UK couldn't ""agree a deal that doesn't allow us to take back control"". He added that ""time is in very short supply and we are at a very difficult point in talks"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin said it was important for the 27 EU member states to give negotiators ""the space to conclude these talks"". He added that he ""fervently hoped"" a trade deal can be agreed. Meanwhile, France's Europe minister, Clement Beaune, warned that his country could ""veto"" a deal if it did not satisfy their demands. The European Parliament would need to ratify any deal before it can be implemented and UK MPs are likely to get the chance to vote on legislation implementing the agreement. And the 27 EU national parliaments could also need to ratify an agreement -  depending on the actual contents of the deal. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

What now as negotiators hit pause?,"So, after a week of super intensive, last-ditch talks, EU and UK negotiators are going their separate ways. The EU's chief envoy Michel Barnier heads back to Brussels on Saturday morning. His UK counterpart, David Frost, is to brief the prime minister on why the pause button was pressed. Is this the end of the road for talks, or are we just round the corner to a Happy Ever After? Probably neither. Just yet. If you're in favour of this post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal and you're looking for clues to be upbeat, I'd say it's significant that the two chief negotiators issued a joint statement before parting ways. What happens next with Brexit? Brexit: Seven things that will change on 1 January What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? This wasn't a case of each stomping off to a separate corner before briefing negatively about the other. That differences remain on the three key issues: fishing rights in UK waters, competition regulations and the governance of a deal (ie how to ensure both sides stick to the agreement or face penalties) should come as no surprise. It was ever thus. Limited progress was made this week on all fronts in talks, but as I, and many other Brexit commentators, have long suggested, you need political involvement at the highest levels to make the final, most difficult compromises. Or to publicly declare an agreement is just not possible, and a no deal scenario is heading our way. Positive-minded readers of this blog might also consider that, even if the EU-UK deal were almost agreed, the European Commission president and arguably, especially Boris Johnson, who has aligned himself so personally to ""getting Brexit done"", would want to put their personal stamp on things. Confirmation that they will call each other on Saturday afternoon could therefore be seen as a ""good"" sign. Although sources in the EU and UK warn not to expect news of the conclusive Big Breakthrough following their chat. Cynics might nod their head too when I say that - considering the uncomfortable political compromises both sides have to make to reach a deal - one more ""crisis"", aka the current stop in talks, is quite useful to demonstrate to the public back home that you're hanging on in there, fighting for their interests. That's certainly the way to interpret France's threat to use its veto if a deal is agreed, and it doesn't like it. Emmanuel Macron has enjoyed the role of Brexit bad cop throughout. It plays well domestically. And ""France the frenemy"" is an easy headline in the UK too. How many trade deals has the UK done so far? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? But reality is more nuanced. Paris trumpets more brashly what is the belief in all EU capitals, and in the UK government: Yes to this deal but not at any cost. The priority in Brussels is to protect the single market. The EU hoped to contain UK competition with a common rulebook. But the UK wants to be nimble and competitive; to compromise post-Brexit sovereignty as little as possible. Otherwise, government figures ask, what was the point of leaving the European Union? If you're looking for some certainty in all this, here you go: Neither side will sign on the dotted line if they can't sell this deal as a victory. Negotiations will likely become even thornier if they re-start next week. The government'sInternal Market Billwas expected to return to the House of Commons on Monday. And thelong-awaited Finance Bill, scheduled to be tabled on Tuesday. Both could contain clauses contradicting the Protocol on Northern Ireland, signed with the EU last year as part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. The government insists the clauses are necessary, as a safety net, to ensure the smooth circulation of goods within the United Kingdom, in case of a no deal situation with the EU. But the European Parliament has warned it will veto any deal with the UK, if Downing Street includes the clauses. Breaking the treaty is unacceptable, says the EU. Safety net or not. So the pressure is on. On all sides. We're witnessing that last minute, five to midnight scramble for a deal, widely predicted, but which the UK and EU always said was the last thing they wanted.

What's going on with Brexit?,"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

Brexit talks sticking points,"The teams negotiating a deal on trade and other issues between the UK and the EU are still locked in talks, with time running short. There have been cautious reports of progress but also of serious, remaining differences - political leaders on both sides say they do not know if an agreement will emerge. They are certainly leaving it very late - the UK/EU transition period (during which rules and trade have stayed the same) ends on 31 December. So, what are the issues still to be resolved? Even though fishing makes up only a tiny part of the economy on both sides, it was central to the Leave campaign that won the Brexit referendum in the UK in 2016. It's also an important issue in several EU countries - such as France. The EU is pushing for maximum access for its boats to continue operating in UK waters, where they currently catch nearly Â£600m worth of fish every year. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK wants most of that business back and says it will prioritise its own boats after 1 January when it will become an independent coastal state, outside the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). So, the dispute is not just about access, but also about a bigger share of the fishing quota for the UK fleet - not just where you can fish, but what you can catch. And if the UK gains, which countries' fishing fleets will lose the most? These are really tricky issues to resolve. There's also been disagreement about the length of a potential transition period, before new measures come into full force. Any compromise lies somewhere between the EU asking for eight years and the UK offering three. Brexit trade deal: What do the UK and the EU want? Who really owns UK fishing quotas? If there is no agreement on access to fishing waters, the UK won't get full access to the EU market, without tariffs (or taxes), to sell its fish there. Last year, around three quarters of UK fish exports went to the EU. This is all about rules on fair competition for billions of pounds of business, now and in the future. The idea of level playing field measures, which appear in most free trade agreements, is to ensure businesses on one side don't have an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other. Brexit: What is a level playing field? If you cut regulations it can be cheaper to produce things, making some companies more competitive than others, and the EU is worried that the UK could do that in the future. That's why the EU wants the UK to stick particularly closely to EU rules on things like workers' rights, the environmental regulations that companies have to follow and state aid (financial subsidies given by government to businesses). The UK, on the other hand, says the whole point of Brexit was to break free from following EU rules. The two sides appear to have agreed a common baseline of regulations on some issues, which neither of them would go below. But the EU has also been insisting on a system which would mean if one side raised standards the other could face penalties, if failing to follow suit resulted in unfair competition. That raises the question of defining precisely what constitutes unfair competition. The EU has also tried but failed to persuade the UK to mirror its rules on subsidies. The UK says it is determined to assert and defend its sovereignty. This is mainly about how the rules of the deal will be enforced in future and what happens if one side breaks them. The EU may have conceded that it will not have a unilateral right to impose penalties, but it wants a strong and independent arbitration system that has real teeth. It has been pushing for powers to retaliate against the UK breaking rules in one area, by hitting back in another - for example, imposing tariffs or taxes where it thinks they might hurt most. Such powers would of course cut both ways. There's also the question of who might adjudicate disputes and where precisely the European Court of Justice will fit in. These are all hugely sensitive issues which will set the tone for the future relationship for years to come and only a few people behind the scenes know all the details of where the negotiations have got to. It's still possible that a basic trade deal can be done in the short time that remains. But both sides are going to have to make concessions quickly. It's also worth remembering that the negotiations are not just about trade with the EU (which accounted for 43% of UK exports in 2019 and 51% of UK imports). There is the important issue, for example, of police and security co-operation as well. The UK had wanted to maintain the same access to shared databases that it has now but the EU says that isn't on offer to non-members. A deal would provide better access, though, than no deal at all. There has been important progress on Northern Ireland - the subject of months of separate negotiations on how to implementthe agreement already signed with the EUon keeping the land border as open as it is now. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 On 8 December, the two sides announced""an agreement in principle"",externalon issues including border control posts at Northern Irish ports (for trade with Great Britain), the supply of food and medicines, and state aid. Some of the arrangements for Northern Ireland would be easier to implement if a trade deal was done, but either way trade between Northern Ireland and the EU will not face tariffs (or taxes) on goods crossing the border. Without a deal, trade between Great Britain and the EU would be subject to tariffs in both directions. Any deal would still need to be ratified by parliaments on both sides, but the time to scrutinise it properly has all but run out. That's a problem for such an important agreement between close neighbours. EU law does allow agreements of this kind to be applied provisionally by member states if necessary - but that's never been done before for a trade deal, and there would be opposition in the European parliament to doing that now. And if the trade talks fall apart, don't expect much meaningful agreement on anything else. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Covid vaccine in US won't be mandatory - Biden,"This video can not be played Mr Biden said he'd do ""everything in my power as president... to encourage people to do the right thing"" President-elect Joe Biden says Americans won't be forced to take a coronavirus vaccine when one becomes available in the US. It comes as the nation's health protection agency for the first time urged ""universal mask use"" indoors, apart from when Americans are at home. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said the US had ""entered a phase of high-level transmission"" of the virus. On Friday the US recorded over 2,500 deaths and nearly 225,000 new cases. It has confirmed 14.3 million cases and more than 278,000 deaths. 'Coronavirus ended our marriage' Dr Fauci apologises for saying UK 'rushed' vaccine All Vaxxed Up Mr Biden - who is due to take office on 20 January - also said he expected his inauguration to be a scaled-back event without large crowds because of coronavirus concerns. ""My guess is there'll still be a platform ceremony but I don't know how it's all going to work out,"" he said. Pfizer, which says its vaccine has been shown to be 95% effective in clinical trials, and Moderna, which says its jab is 94% effective, have both applied to the Food and Drug Administration to distribute their drugs in the US. The UK on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine. Earlier on Friday Vice-President Mike Pence said during a visit to Atlanta's CDC that federal approval for a Covid-19 vaccine could be ""a week-and-a-half away."" This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, the US president-elect said it would not be necessary to make a coronavirus vaccine mandatory. ""I will do everything in my power as president to encourage people to do the right thing and when they do it, demonstrate that it matters,"" he said. The Pew Research Center says just 60% of Americans are currently prepared to take a coronavirus vaccine, up from 51% who said the same in September. On Thursday Mr Biden told CNN he would be happy to take a vaccine in public to allay potential concerns about its safety. Three former presidents - Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton - have said they are also prepared to be inoculated publicly. Mr Biden has also reiterated his call for Americans to wear a mask for 100 days - a measure that he said combined with vaccine distribution would see deaths ""drop off the edge"". ""My hope is they will then be inclined to say it's worth the patriotic duty to go ahead and protect other people,"" Mr Biden said. The US fight to control the coronavirus pandemic is about to slam head-first into a national anti-vaccine movement that is stubbornly pervasive. That reality may be behind President-elect Biden's statement that he would not support a government mandate that all Americans receive a Covid-19 vaccination. The attempt to implement one - even if supported by science and legal precedent dating back more than a century - could create a groundswell of opposition that would prove counterproductive to public health. Such was the case with mask-wearing - a less intrusive step to prevent the spread of the virus - which, over the past six months, has become infused with politics. Mr Biden, and state governors who would be on the front lines of any such mandate, might prefer to target only certain segments of the population more at risk of contracting or spreading Covid-19. For instance, employers could be encouraged to require healthcare and nursing home workers to be immunised, and most children already must have up-to-date shot records before attending public or private schools. While the speedy development of multiple vaccines has offered reason for hope of more normal life after the coronavirus pandemic, a brewing vaccination fight is just one example of how managing this public-health crisis in the coming months will not be an easy task for the Biden administration. The health body said it was now recommending that people wear masks anywhere outside their own homes - including indoors. It said the countrywas in a phase of ""high-level transmission"",externalas colder weather was seeing more people spend more time indoors. About half of new cases were the result of transmission from infected people who did not have any symptoms, the CDC said. It said mask wearing, physical distancing and avoiding non-essential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces were part of a ""multi-pronged"" approach needed to ""provide a bridge"" to a future where vaccines were widely available and normal life could resume. Much of California has been hit with a stay-at-home order On Thursday Mr Biden said he would make mask-wearing in federal buildings mandatory. Meanwhile, California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a stay-at-home order for much of his state. On Wednesday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an order restricting all public travel on foot or vehicle, adding: ""It's time to cancel everything."" Mr Biden described the latest jobs data as ""grim"". Figures from November, released earlier on Friday, showed that a lower-than-expected 245,000 new jobs were added as the rate of new daily infections almost doubled. ""It shows an economy that's stalling and remains in the midst of one of the worst economic and job crisis in modern history,"" Mr Biden said. Job growth slows in US as virus cases surge He predicted ""the future will be very bleak"" if lawmakers fail to pass a coronavirus rescue aid package immediately. Unless Congress enacts another relief bill, more than nine million jobless Americans will be cut off from unemployment benefits after Christmas. Lawmakers from both parties have been inching towards a $900bn (Â£670bn) plan that would include expanded unemployment benefits. Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid?

"Boy, 16, among Avonmouth explosion victims","A witness reported hearing a ""very loud explosion"" A 16-year-old boy was among four workers killed in an explosion at a waste water treatment works. Teenager Luke Wheaton, Michael James, 64, Brian Vickery, 63, and Raymond White, 57, died in the blast in Avonmouth, Bristol. A fifth person injured is recovering at home. It happened at 11:20 GMT on Thursday in a silo that treated biosolids. Wessex Water said it was working with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to investigate the cause of the blast. It is understood Mr James was a contractor working at the site, while Mr Vickery and Mr White were employees of Wessex Water and Luke was an apprentice at the firm. Luke was a former pupil at Bradley Stoke Community School in Bristol and had recently started an apprenticeship at the plant. In a post on Facebook, the school said it was ""shocked and saddened"" to hear of the ""tragic passing of our former student Luke Wheaton"". ""Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this time,"" it added. North Bristol Rugby Football Club also paid tribute to the teenager on Twitter, saying his death was ""absolutely heartbreaking"". ""Such terribly sad news that one of our Colts, Luke Wheaton was tragically lost in the accident in Avonmouth yesterday morning,"" it said. ""All of our love and thoughts to Luke's family, team mates, coaches and everyone else that knew him."" Flowers have been laid at the scene A witness reported hearing a ""very loud explosion"" that ""shook buildings"" and another said they saw about 10 ambulances driving to the scene. Avon and Somerset Police declared a major incident in the immediate aftermath. Supt Simon Brickwood said he wanted to ""extend my heartfelt sympathies to the families of those involved"". ""We appreciate the impact this incident has had on the local community and we thank those affected for their patience while our investigative work is carried out,"" he said. ""This is likely to be ongoing for some time and we will be keeping the victims' families informed throughout."" Formal identification of the victims is yet to take place and post-mortem examinations are under way, police said. Investigators are due to speak to the fifth victim when it is appropriate to do so. The blast happened in a silo that treated biosolids On Thursday, Avon Fire and Rescue Service described the scene of the incident as ""very challenging"". Search and rescue dogs were drafted in to locate casualties following the blast. Colin Skellett, chief executive of Wessex Water, said the firm was ""absolutely devastated"" by what had happened. ""Our hearts go out to the family, friends and colleagues of those who lost their lives during the tragic event on Thursday,"" he said. ""I know from the thoughts and comments I have received from so many, that this has affected the whole Wessex Water family. ""We are determined to find out what happened and why and we will work with the relevant authorities to do just that."" Cause of blast that killed four investigated Four dead in water treatment works blast A police spokesman confirmed the blast, in a chemical tank, was not terror-related. Biosolids are ""treated sludge"", a by-product of the sewage treatment process. According to Wessex Water, the sludge is treated in anaerobic digesters, oxygen-free tanks, to produce agricultural fertiliser and renewable energy. Police said a cordon at the site was likely to remain in place for several days while the blast is investigated by a team of chemical and mechanical experts, who are working with the HSE. Giles Hyder, HSE's head of operations in the South West, said: ""We send our deepest condolences to the families of those who tragically died. It is important a joint investigation is carried out. ""We will provide specialist support to what is likely to be a complex investigation under the command of the police.""

Liverpool's mayor arrested in bribery probe,"Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson is one of five men arrested Liverpool's mayor Joe Anderson has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. He and four others were held as part of an investigation into the awarding of building contracts in the city. It is understood the Labour Party has suspended Mr Anderson pending the outcome of the case. The year-long police probe, Operation Aloft, has focussed on a number of property developers. Liverpool City Council said it was co-operating with Merseyside Police. A police statement said those arrested include two men, 33 and 62, both from Liverpool, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. A 46-year-old man from Ainsdale has also been arrested on suspicion of the same offence. The other two arrested men are a 72-year-old man from Liverpool and a 25-year old from Ormskirk, who have been arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation. Developer Elliot Lawless was arrested in January 2019 and denied any wrongdoing. Elliot Lawless is currently released under investigation and was not one of the five arrested earlier on Friday. Councillor Richard Kemp, leader of the opposition Lib Dem group on Liverpool City Council, said Mr Anderson ""should follow the precedence set by leaders of the council and other senior figures in such cases."" ""He should step away from the council and step away from his mayoralty while this goes through due legal process,"" he said. Mr Anderson joined the Merchant Navy after leaving school aged 16. He later studied for a degree in social work at Liverpool John Moores University and went on to become a social worker for Sefton Council in 1992. The father-of-four was Liverpool's first elected mayor in 2012 having served on the city council since 1998. His national profile been raised by his role in driving forward mass coronavirus testing in the city. Mr Anderson, whose brother Bill died recently of Covid-19, was praised for his response to the virus by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Wedding cancelled for Covid vaccination centre,"This video can not be played Simon Jones and Jenna Roberts said the second cancellation was ""ten times worse"" A couple say they are ""heartbroken"" at having their wedding cancelled for a second time in six months by Covid-19. Jenna Roberts and Simon Jones were due to tie the knot in July but the wedding was cancelled due to lockdown. Now their ""dream"" has been shattered again after the venue at Margam Park, Port Talbot, was confirmed as a Covid-19 vaccination centre. They want compensation from Neath Port Talbot (NPT), claiming they have been left Â£2,000 out of pocket. Simon and Jenna, from Porth, Rhonda Cynon Taff, had waited almost three years for their wedding at The Orangery, after booking in 2017, but said they understood the reasons for cancelling first time, during lockdown. They postponed the special day to July next year, only to be informed on Friday it can no longer go ahead. The venue is to be used as a vaccination centre for up to 12 months from 13 December. NPT council said the venue was ""absolutely necessary"" and would play a ""crucial role"" in the Covid-19 vaccination programme for local people. What will a coronavirus wedding look like? 'Unknown' vaccine schedule for care home residents Q&A: How will the vaccine rollout work in Wales? The venue has cancelled 64 weddings, which can be rearranged for a later date in 2022 when the venue is due to reopen - or a full deposit offered. ""The worst part was I had to get off the phone and tell my partner we had to cancel our wedding again. She just burst into tears,"" said Simon, 38. ""We've had no communication about this at all, so it just came out of the blue. Had we known, we wouldn't have booked suppliers again."" The couple say they have to find another Â£2000 to make up for lost costs Jenna, 34, said: ""The first time was hard enough, the second time was ten times worse. There were a lot of tears. ""We have elderly relatives that might not be able to make our wedding in two years' time. It's just terrible."" While they are able to set a new date or get most of their deposit back, they will not get refunds for stationery, such as invites, the videographer and their children's bridesmaids dresses and suits. Simon estimates the total cost to rearrange again will be about Â£2,000. ""In no way do we blame them for any of this, but we are truly heartbroken and devastated at the fact Neath Port Talbot Council have had no thoughts on the implications it has caused by taking over a wedding venue,"" he said. Simon and Jenna have one child together, alongside two Jenna has from a previous relationship. The Margam Orangery is among 12 sites being used as a vaccination centre by NPT and Swansea councils, due to its size, location and available car parking. A NPT council spokesperson said it was aware of the disappointment but plan to deliver 500 vaccinations every day, seven days a week, to ""safeguard the health of local residents as quickly as possible"". The venue said continuing to hold weddings would have reduced the building's capacity for vaccinating by 1,500 per wedding. Councillor Peter Rees said: ""We sincerely apologise but the venue will play pivotal role in saving lives. ""We ask that couples and their families understand that we would not take this action unless it was absolutely necessary and in the interests of public safety. ""We will honour our 2020 prices for any of couples who chose an alternative date in 2022, and will offer them first refusal to move back to their original date, should the vaccination programme be completed earlier than next December."" On Wednesday, thePfizer vaccine was judged safe for use in UK next week. Preparations will be made for the rollout of the vaccine as early asnext week. Each health board will get its share and vaccines will go across Wales at the same time. Mass vaccination centres will be set up - particularly for the mRNA vaccine, which needs to be stored at -70 degrees. Officials say each site will have tight security and the vaccines will be guarded ""like a VIP"", as well as cyber and IT security measures being taken. What will a coronavirus wedding look like?

I'm A Celebrity crowns its 2020 winner,"Giovanna Fletcher has won this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, which was filmed in a Welsh castle instead of the Australian jungle. The author and presenter was crowned Queen of the Castle after facing Jordan North and Vernon Kay in Friday's final. ""I'm just blown away,"" she said after the announcement. ""I can't believe it. It's been the most amazing experience."" This year's series took place at Gwrych Castle in Abergele because coronavirus meant ITV couldn't film Down Under. Fletcher is known for hosting CBeebies show The Baby Club and the parenting podcast Happy Mum, Happy Baby. Fletcher interviewed The Duchess of Cambridge on her podcast earlier this year The 35-year-old has interviewed several high profile guests on the podcast, including Samantha Cameron, Lorraine Kelly, Amanda Holden and the Duchess of Cambridge.

Jordan North's five greatest moments I'm A Celeb brings in over Â£1m for Welsh economy This series may have taken place 9,000 miles from its usual location, but that hasn't stopped it being one of ITV's biggest shows of the year. A million more viewers than in 2019 watched the launch episode, and ratings have stayed consistently high, with large parts of the public stuck at home. The Guardian said,externalthis series ""brought levity to lockdown"", describing the show as ""a glorious, pandemic-free bubble"". The format of the show remained similar this year despite the change in location, with celebrities facing a series of gruesome challenges - although the Bushtucker Trials looked a little different. Shooting in the UK meant most of the trials took place indoors and were filmed late at night after the show came off air. The series has been so successful that ITV bosses have said they are open to the idea of keeping the show in Wales next year, depending on the circumstances. ShowrunnerRichard Cowles told Broadcast magazine,external: ""Australia has been I'm A Celebrity's natural home and the Welsh version was born out of necessity rather than choice, but we've learned a lot and so maybe there is a UK incarnation of the show.

Murder accused said he killed fiancÃ©e 'by mistake',"Lauren Griffiths was found dead at the flat she shared with Madog Rowlands in Cardiff on 30 April 2019 A man accused of murdering his fiancÃ©e told a 999 operator he had killed her ""by mistake"", a court heard. Madog Rowlands, 23, from Wrexham denies murdering Lauren Griffiths, 21, in their home on Glynrhondda Street in Cathays, Cardiff in 2019. Jurors were played a 999 call recording where Mr Rowlands told the operator: ""I've killed my fiancÃ©e by mistake"". Newport Crown Court heard Mr Rowlands was previously arrested after admitting he tried to strangle her in 2018. Police were called to Glynrhondda Street on 30 April 2019 Crying on the phone Mr Rowlands could be heard saying: ""I killed Lauren by accident, we got into a fight... ""I've taken a lot of LSD and MDMA"". Ms Griffiths was found dead at their flat in Cardiff on 30 April last year. The court has previously heard Mr Rowlands killed Ms Griffiths and wrapped her in clingfilm before ordering a takeaway and drugs. Jurors have also been told Ms Griffiths had been ""really excited"" about her wedding.

BA in PR headache as bread basket sale goes stale,"Frequent flyers John (l) and Tim Granger (r) are delighted with their purchases They flew off shelves: slippers, cups and saucers, blankets and bedding, towels, even drinks trolleys. British Airways' online sale of thousands of surplus stock not needed for its aircraft caused a stampede of buying from aviation enthusiasts and bargain-hunters. In the first 24 hours, 5,000 purchases were made, with the website getting 250,000 page views. In the first four days, 1,900 six-packs of bread baskets were snapped up. Meal trolleys were among the first to sell out. Items from the now-retired Boeing 747s in BA's aircraft fleet were in big demand. Trouble is, the sell-off seems to have been so popular it risks becoming a PR headache. While there are plenty of satisfied customers, there are also plenty of dissatisfied ones - just check Twitter, Trustpilot and the frequent flyer website Head for Points, where buyers are venting annoyance about broken and missing items, non-deliveries and lack of responses from BA and the company it used to handle the sale, Whatabuy. ""Such an unnecessary own goal,"" said Nick Hadjinikos, whose girlfriend is still waiting for her plates and bread baskets. The director at communications consultancy Kallinos said: ""During the ordering process, the site kept crashing after payment information had been submitted. This was the big worry, so I put in a couple of emails to Whatabuy and never heard back. ""Then I took to Twitter and found we were not alone. BA should have spotted the problem and headed it off. I think most of the stuff was snapped up by hawks and ended up on eBay."" Meal-equipment boxes from Boeing 747 aircraft were in the sale Another buyer, Simon Saunders, told the BBC: ""The whole thing is a shambles. Whatabuy replied to my third email and simply said, 'You will get your stuff in due course.'"" Comments on the Head for Points website include: ""One of my orders has turned up! It's missing one bit of it but they appear to have added part of another order in there"" ""Still no response to any of my emails, and no answer on the phones. Got two items, both wrong and missing the other three"" ""I have lost all patience with them and just want a refund, and for them to collect the couple of incorrect items they sent in place of my order"". Travel enthusiasts Whatabuy did not respond to BBC requests for comment. But in an email to a customer complaining about their order, the company said it had seen ""an unprecedented level of demand"" and processing was taking longer than usual. There had also been IT issues, Whatabuy said. Head for Points' Rhys Jones said complaints to his website revealed obvious problems with the sale, but he still believes the majority of his readers seem delighted with their purchases. Rhys Jones, from Head for Points, says that despite criticism of BA, most of his website's readers are happy ""This sale seems to have captured the imagination of travel enthusiasts. It offers them a chance to get hold of some authentic BA memorabilia,"" Mr Jones said. That's why John Granger bought some mugs, plates and a blanket - a gift for partner Tim. ""It was curiosity and nostalgia. We love flying so much but have not been able to travel during the pandemic. It's a reminder of our travels. ""The crockery is actually high-quality bone china [designed by William Edwards]."" He paid Â£44.70 (including P&P) for the lot. ""That's remarkable value. I'm not sure why BA was selling them so cheap."" Kirill Maksaev and partner Alexander Smotrov bought Â£100 worth of BA crockery and would have purchased a lot more, had they been quicker off the mark. They haven't got the items yet, but are not concerned. ""It's fine. We can wait. We've had the confirmation email,"" said Kirill. Kirill Maksaev (r) and Alex Smotrov (l) with some of their air travel memorabilia The purchases will be part of the mini-museum Alex has set up in his home - boarding passes, amenity bags, napkins, crockery and branded goods marking his years of air travel. ""We are plane spotters: we are passionate about aviation,"" Kirill said. BA said it had expected a huge amount of interest from aviation fans, bargain hunters and people looking for ""unique"" Christmas gifts. ""But of course, no one could have predicted quite how popular it would be and how quickly items would sell out,"" the airline told the BBC. ""We are working hard to ensure all customers receive their orders as quickly as possible and in time for Christmas. We're in touch with those who may not have received their items yet to reassure them they're on their way."" And the airline promised refunds ""for any items that are not in the condition advertised on the site"". Would BA do it again? ""We'll consider our options once we've reviewed the success of the scheme and any learnings,"" the airline said.

Care home vaccinations to start 'within two weeks',"The Pfizer vaccine must be used within 12 hours of being unpacked, the regulator says The Covid-19 vaccine will ""definitely"" be ready to go into care homes in the next two weeks, the regulator has said. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it had approved the way doses would be distributed to homes. It means care home residents and staff may not be the first to receive jabs, despite being the top priority. But the UK's chief medical officers say the vaccine will only have a ""marginal impact"" on winter hospital numbers. In a letter to colleagues, the chief medical officers of England (Prof Chris Whitty), Scotland (Dr Gregor Smith), Wales (Dr Frank Atherton) and Northern Ireland (Dr Michael McBride) warn this winter could be ""especially hard"" for the health service due to coronavirus. ""Although the very welcome news about vaccines means that we can look forward to 2021 with greater optimism, vaccine deployment will have only a marginal impact in reducing numbers coming into the health service with Covid over the next three months,"" they said. First batch of Covid vaccines arrives in the UK First vaccines 'could cut 99% of deaths' - Van-Tam When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the safety checks for vaccines? They added they did not expect the virus to ""disappear"" even once full vaccination had occurred. Festive gatherings are likely to place ""additional pressure"" on hospitals and GPs in the New Year, which ""we need to be ready for"", the experts said. The experts' warning comes as vaccinations are expected to begin at 50 hospital hubs in England on Tuesday. NHS England also says GP-run vaccination centres will be up and running from 14 December and are expected to start inviting in patients aged over 80. Dr Ellie Cannon, a GP in North London, said local GPs were working together to provide one centre or one team to administer the vaccines. ""We've been told we need to be available to vaccinate people from 8am to 8pm,"" she told BBC Breakfast, adding there was ""a lot of enthusiasm among healthcare staff to help and to be involved"". She cautioned that strict guidelines would have to be followed and only ""the most high risk"" would receive the vaccine in the first week. ""Don't call us, we will be calling you,"" she advised patients. ""GPs have already identified exactly who their high risk patients are. We don't have the facility to bypass the rules,"" she warned. Because of how the vaccine doses are packed, the regulator needs to approve the way in which they are broken down into smaller consignments for distribution to care homes, while ensuring that the vaccine stays at very cold temperatures. Asked when the vaccine would get to care homes, Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, told BBC Radio Cumbria that it might be ""variable"" but added: ""I would say definitely within the next two weeks."" The MHRA, which regulates medicines across the UK, requires that the vaccine doses are repacked for shipping to care homes in refrigerated cold rooms at between 2 and 8C and transferred into carriers that maintain the same temperature. As soon as they thaw the vials of vaccine, assemblers have 12 hours to pack them, label them and transport them to care homes, an operation that has never been done before at this scale. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the UK is ""absolutely confident"" it will have 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - the first to be approved by the regulator - next week. He said more doses were expected by the end of the year, but he was unable to specify how many. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also said they are ready to begin vaccinations on Tuesday. Meanwhile, official data showed infection levels werefalling in all English regions, except the North East. The government said the R number - the average number of people each person with Covid-19 goes on to infect - had fallen to between 0.8 and 1 in the UK, from between 0.9 and 1 last week. It also reported that a further 504 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 60,617. The first consignment of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine arrived in the UK on Thursday, and the government has ordered 40 million doses in total - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list - as recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - followed by the over-80s and front-line health and social care staff.

Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the JCVI, told The World at One on BBC Radio 4 he understood the elderly in care homes ""might not end up being the first priority group for operational reasons"" and the committee would ""closely monitor this"". He stressed the JCVI still expected care home residents ""to be prioritised"". Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said the vaccines would now have reached 50 hospital hubs to enable vaccinations to begin on Tuesday. Hospitals were working out how many care home residents, care home staff and over-80s they can get it to, he said. PANORAMA:How do you run a business if Covid-19 takes your customers away?

Pubs count the cost as alcohol ban takes effect,"City centre streets were deserted after the ban closed pubs and restaurants Barrels of beer are being poured down drains as Wales' hospitality industry prepared for the alcohol ban to come into force. Pubs, restaurants and cafes arebanned from serving alcohol from Friday eveningand must close at 18:00 GMT, other than for takeaway service. Businesses said it was ""a devastating hammer blow"" after going to lengths to keep customers safe. They said the restrictions will also significantly impact the supply chain. Can people from Wales go to England to drink? Can I meet friends under new Covid rules? What do the new rules mean for pubs in Wales? This video can not be played 'It's like a death sentence' At the Glamorgan Brewery in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, staff have been pouring barrels of beer down the drain because it now cannot be sold in pubs. On Thursday, 58 of the company's 64 employees went back onto furlough. Barrels of beer are being poured down the drain due to the ban Director David Atkins said the new measures are ""an absolute kick in the teeth"". ""This time last year we probably turned over about Â£1.5m for the month of December. This year, it's Â£50,000. He added the majority of their beer - about 45,000 pints - will have to be thrown away. Pubs began clearing tables and chairs as the ban came into force at 18:00 GMT on Friday At The Cricketers pub in Pontcanna, Cardiff, staff were also pouring away beer on Friday afternoon. Simon Buckley, of Evan Evans Brewery which supplies the pub said: ""How can it be right and safe to open to serve food in pubs but not alcohol? It defies logic. Drinkers enjoy final night before pub alcohol ban Welsh Government pulls Christmas drinks TV advert ""Why is 6pm the bewitching hour as opposed to 10pm?

James Cunningham, manager of the Ruthin Castle Hotel in Ruthin, Denbighshire, said customers have appreciated the safety measures put in place and the new rules were ""incredibly frustrating"". ""Whenever they can, people want to try to come out and enjoy themselves in these very, very testing times,"" he said. He described the measures as a ""devastating hammer blow"" to the hospitality industry. ""Figures show that less than 5% of all settings of infection happen in hospitality - and yet here we are once again taking the hammer blow,"" he said. ""There's no guarantee those restrictions are going to be lifted,"" he said.

Theme park fined Â£350k over rollercoaster fall,"The boy fell from a carriage on the Twister ride at Lightwater Valley in May 2019 A theme park where a boy fell from a rollercoaster has been fined Â£350,000 for health and safety breaches. The seven-year-old was airlifted to hospital with head injuries after falling from the ride at Lightwater Valley in North Yorkshire in May 2019. York Magistrates' Court heard the ride no longer operated and the park viewed the accident with ""great sadness"". The boy fell from the Twister attraction during the spring half-term holiday, the court heard. Bosses at the theme park, near Ripon, admitted breaching Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. More stories across Yorkshire Judge Adrian Lower was told the boy had not been wearing a seat belt and fell through a gap between the seat and a restraining bar. But the boy and his mother, who was in the car with him, were not told they had to wear a seat belt, the court heard. Judge Lower was told the effectiveness of the restraining bar was not enough to hold the youngster in position. The child was airlifted to hospital after the accident at Lightwater Valley Prosecutor Craig Hassall said the victim suffered serious head injuries following the fall and was airlifted to hospital in Leeds. His mother saw him slip under the restraint as he was ejected from the car which was between two and three metres from the ground at the time Mr Hassall said seatbelt rules were not universally understood by ride operatives and that maintenance of seatbelts was not adequate or in effective working order.

Protected river 'bulldozed' in 'wildlife crime',"The Environment Agency was at the scene earlier The Environment Agency has forced its way on to a section of a river after reports it had been ""bulldozed"" in what the local wildlife trust described as a ""crime against the environment"". The protected stretch of the River Lugg had been ""completely obliterated"", Herefordshire Wildlife Trust said. It added the work would have ""huge repercussions for wildlife downstream"". The Environment Agency is leading an investigation into what it said was a ""series of unconsented works"". West Mercia Police, Natural England and the Forestry Commission are also involved. Bulldozers are said to have caused damage to the area, Herefordshire Wildlife Trust said Emma Johnson, from Natural England, said: ""I'm shocked by the destruction I've seen to this very special river."" The wildlife trust said all habitats had been badly affected after a one-mile stretch (1.5km) of the river and its banks were ""bulldozed, straightened and re-profiled into a sterile canal"". Wildlife affected is believed to include crayfish, otters, salmon, lampreys and dragonflies. Dave Throup, area manager for the Environment Agency, said it was ""treating this very seriously"" and had ""taken immediate action in an attempt to prevent any further works at the site"". The wildlife trust said it hoped for a prosecution after it claimed a 16-tonne bulldozer was used by people ""well aware"" the river was a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The River Lugg is a protected site ""The bank-side trees are all grubbed out and burnt, the river gravels have been scraped away, and the beautiful meanders of the river have been straightened and re-profiled,"" Chief Executive Helen Stace said. ""This is a crime against the environment. Swift action needs to be taken."" They are formal conservation areas, that often contain important habitats such as grasslands, parkland and woodland. Some contain ancient woodland and ancient trees. The areas have high conservation value and need to be protected. Natural England determine which sites should have SSSI status. England has more than 4,100 sites covering more than 4,200 square miles. Over half of this area is internationally important for wildlife. Source:Woodland Trust,external A legal notice requiring the works to stop immediately had been served to the landowner by Natural England, the Environment Agency said. Mr Throup added: ""This is a beautiful part of the world. To see the changes from last week to this is terrible. We're working closely with our partners to ensure this is thoroughly investigated.""

Patel criticises anti-deportation flight campaign,"Priti Patel has criticised Labour MPs and celebrities for invoking the Windrush scandal in their efforts to stop a flight deporting convicted criminals to Jamaica. The plane containing 13 prisoners took off on Wednesday - 23 were left off it following legal challenges. Campaigners said there was a risk people were being wrongly removed as had happened in the Windrush scandal. The home secretary said their reference to Windrush was ""deeply offensive"". Shetold the Daily Mail,externalthat it was ""misjudged and upsetting"" for ""ill-informed Labour politicians and do-gooding celebrities"" to invoke it in their campaign. The Windrush scandal, which emerged in 2018, saw people who came to the UK from Commonwealth countries wrongly told they were in the country illegally. Who are the Windrush generation? Call to review foreign-born offender deportations UK 'unlawfully ignored' Windrush warnings It was cited in an open letter last month, signed by 90 public figures, including model Naomi Campbell and actress Thandie Newton. Warning that issues linked to Windrush have ""not been resolved,"" they argued the planned deportation flight brought ""credible risks of unlawful and wrongful deportations"" and urged airlines to boycott it. The campaigners warned the UK ""frequently"" seeks to deport people whose crimes are linked to forced labour, and processes for identifying victims of trafficking were in ""disarray"". A separate letter last month signed by over 60 mostly Labour MPs and peers also called for the flight to be cancelled. The MPs said some children would ""forced apart"" from their parents and the flight posed a Covid-19 risk, adding that the government had ""so far failed to learn any lessons"" from aMarch review into the Windrush scandal. But during a Commons debate on Monday, Immigration Minister Chris Philp told MPs the flight was about ""criminality, not nationality,"" and had ""nothing to do"" with the Windrush scandal. He added that ""not a single individual on the flight"" had been found eligible for thegovernment schemeset up to compensate victims of the scandal in March. Downing Street said all of the people on the flight were ""dangerous foreign criminals"", who had been born in Jamaica, adding: ""Each week we remove foreign criminals - this is no different."" The home secretary is required by law to deport any foreign national who has received a prison sentence in the UK of more than a year, unless a specified exception applies. It is reported that among those offenders originally due to be sent to Jamaica last Wednesday were the victims of modern slavery. Others are said to have young children in the UK. Frustration at human rights campaigners going to court to prevent the deportations is evident in Ms Patel's depiction of them as ""do-gooding"" celebrities. But the government accepts it can only deport those convicted felons who do not need this country's protection and have no legal basis for remaining here, conditions which open the door to legitimate legal challenge. There is also Home Office anger at suggestions that the deportation flights are akin to the Windrush scandal, with officials noting that all those due to be aboard Wednesday's flight had had their case checked by the Home Office's Windrush Taskforce. In her interview with the Mail, Ms Patel said the Windrush generation had ""made an enormous contribution to our country and were wronged by successive governments"". ""To see ill-informed Labour politicians and do-gooding celebrities attempting to conflate the victims of Windrush with these vile criminals set for deportation is not only misjudged and upsetting but deeply offensive,"" she added. After the flight took off on Wednesday, Mr Philp said it was ""disappointing that immigration law firms continued to use last-minute tactics to remove a significant number of offenders"". ""These individuals had every opportunity to raise the claims in the days and weeks leading up to the flight,"" he said. ""However a significant number of claims were not submitted until hours before the flight was due to leave - meaning some murderers and rapists were able to stay in the UK"". He said the Home Office would work through the cases of those taken off the flight as quickly as possible. Ms Patel has alsopreviously criticised""do-gooders"" and ""lefty lawyers"" for defending a ""broken"" immigration and asylum system. After the publication of her Mail interview on Friday, the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said: ""Targeted attacks on individual lawyers who are simply doing their jobs applying the law of the land is completely wrong and dangerous."" ""We and the Law Society have recently been in contact with the Home Office again about our concerns."" Glenda Caesar, a Windrush victim who lost her job as a GP administrator as she didn't have the paperwork to prove she could legally work in the UK, criticised Ms Patel's comments. Ms Caesar, who arrived in the UK from Dominica legally in 1961 when she was a child, told the PA news agency: ""She hasn't taken the time to meet with us or speak with us. ""How can she know what's deeply offensive for us?"" While stating that she did not condone crime, she said if the prisoners being deported had spent their childhoods in the UK then she could understand how they would feel about being taken to a country ""they don't even know"". In 2019, 19,290 people were removed from the UK, according to the Home Office. The majority of this group leave the country voluntarily (once caught for breaking an immigration offence, for example), but around 7,200 are forcibly removed. These numbers have declined in recent years, with last year seeing the lowest number of removals in at least 15 years. The numbers so far for this year suggest it has dipped further, which could be due to the impact of coronavirus. Last year, the largest nationality groups to be forcibly returned were Romanian, Albanian, Brazilian, Polish and Lithuanian - representing half the total. Jamaicans represented 48 of the total. We know that of all of the people returned from the UK, around 5,100 were foreign national offenders.

John O'Groats-Land's End 'record' driver cleared,"Tommy Davies wrote a blog about his journey and spoke about it on BBC Radio 2 A car enthusiast who claimed to have broken the speed record between John O'Groats and Land's End has been cleared of dangerous driving. Thomas Davies, 29, allegedly completed the 841-mile journey in September 2017 in nine hours and 36 minutes, at an average speed of 89mph. Mr Davies, of Corwen, north Wales, was also cleared of two counts of perverting the course of justice. He told his trial that what happened was an ""exaggeration of real life"". Tommy Davies (right) was cleared of all charges at Truro Crown Court Truro Crown Court heard Mr Davies wrote a blog about the journey for a website called Piston Heads and appeared on YouTube, in national newspapers and on the Jeremy Vine Show on Radio 2. Ryan Murray, prosecuting, said Mr Davies had an ambition to travel between John O'Groats and Land's End ""quicker than anyone else had ever done before"" and that he used ""illegal methods"" to achieve his ambition. He said the average speed to complete the 841-mile journey, including a stop for fuel, was 89mph. But Mr Davies told the jury: ""I don't dispute a journey was made. I dispute the manner and the speed of the journey."" He said the prosecution's case was circumstantial and was ""wedded"" to the blog he had written being accurate - but he told the jury it was an exaggeration. He said he accepted it was ""obvious"" that he had ""done some stupid things"", adding: ""I am not the man that I was three years ago.""

Juventus director probed over Suarez Italian exam,"Luis Suarez took the language test earlier this year The sporting director of Italian football club Juventus has been placed under investigation over an alleged attempt to ""speed up"" Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez's bid for citizenship. The striker took a language exam as part of a proposed move to the team. Prosecutors say the contents of the test were communicated in advance and the result was predetermined. They have called for four university officials involved in administering the test to be suspended for eight months. Juventus have strongly backed their sporting director, Fabio Paratici. The Turin-based club wanted Suarez to obtain citizenship so they did not exceed a quota for non-European Union players. Suarez's wife is Italian, making him eligible to apply for an Italian passport. But the 33-year-old player needed to pass a language exam, which he took at the University for Foreigners of Perugia on 17 September. He obtained the intermediate qualification needed for citizenship in 15 minutes, having only done the oral part of the exam, according to Reuters news agency. The university has denied wrongdoing. Announcing the results of an inquiry on Friday, chief prosecutor Raffaele Cantone said Juventus's management ""took action, even at the highest institutional levels, to 'speed up' the granting of Italian citizenship for Suarez"". Mr Paratici is accused of lying to prosecutors over the affair. Juventus said investigations would clear Mr Paratici of all wrongdoing. ""Juventus Football Club confirms that today Fabio Paratici has been notified of information regarding the guarantee and the right of defence. ""The Club strongly reiterates the correctness of Paratici's work and is confident that the ongoing investigations will help clarify his position within a reasonable time,"" Juventus said in a statement.

Weddings cancelled for Covid vaccination centre,"This video can not be played Simon Jones and Jenna Roberts said the second cancellation was ""ten times worse"" A couple say they are ""heartbroken"" at having their wedding cancelled for a second time in six months by Covid-19. Jenna Roberts and Simon Jones were due to tie the knot in July but the wedding was cancelled due to lockdown. Now their ""dream"" has been shattered again after the venue at Margam Park, Port Talbot, was confirmed as a Covid-19 vaccination centre. They want compensation from Neath Port Talbot (NPT), claiming they have been left Â£2,000 out of pocket. Simon and Jenna, from Porth, Rhonda Cynon Taff, had waited almost three years for their wedding at The Orangery, after booking in 2017, but said they understood the reasons for cancelling first time, during lockdown. They postponed the special day to July next year, only to be informed on Friday it can no longer go ahead. The venue is to be used as a vaccination centre for up to 12 months from 13 December. NPT council said the venue was ""absolutely necessary"" and would play a ""crucial role"" in the Covid-19 vaccination programme for local people. What will a coronavirus wedding look like? 'Unknown' vaccine schedule for care home residents Q&A: How will the vaccine rollout work in Wales? The venue has cancelled 64 weddings, which can be rearranged for a later date in 2022 when the venue is due to reopen - or a full deposit offered. ""The worst part was I had to get off the phone and tell my partner we had to cancel our wedding again. She just burst into tears,"" said Simon, 38. ""We've had no communication about this at all, so it just came out of the blue. Had we known, we wouldn't have booked suppliers again."" The couple say they have to find another Â£2000 to make up for lost costs Jenna, 34, said: ""The first time was hard enough, the second time was ten times worse. There were a lot of tears. ""We have elderly relatives that might not be able to make our wedding in two years' time. It's just terrible."" While they are able to set a new date or get most of their deposit back, they will not get refunds for stationery, such as invites, the videographer and their children's bridesmaids dresses and suits. Simon estimates the total cost to rearrange again will be about Â£2,000. ""In no way do we blame them for any of this, but we are truly heartbroken and devastated at the fact Neath Port Talbot Council have had no thoughts on the implications it has caused by taking over a wedding venue,"" he said. Simon and Jenna have one child together, alongside two Jenna has from a previous relationship. The Margam Orangery is among 12 sites being used as a vaccination centre by NPT and Swansea councils, due to its size, location and available car parking. A NPT council spokesperson said it was aware of the disappointment but plan to deliver 500 vaccinations every day, seven days a week, to ""safeguard the health of local residents as quickly as possible"". The venue said continuing to hold weddings would have reduced the building's capacity for vaccinating by 1,500 per wedding. Councillor Peter Rees said: ""We sincerely apologise but the venue will play pivotal role in saving lives. ""We ask that couples and their families understand that we would not take this action unless it was absolutely necessary and in the interests of public safety. ""We will honour our 2020 prices for any of couples who chose an alternative date in 2022, and will offer them first refusal to move back to their original date, should the vaccination programme be completed earlier than next December."" On Wednesday, thePfizer vaccine was judged safe for use in UK next week. Preparations will be made for the rollout of the vaccine as early asnext week. Each health board will get its share and vaccines will go across Wales at the same time. Mass vaccination centres will be set up - particularly for the mRNA vaccine, which needs to be stored at -70 degrees. Officials say each site will have tight security and the vaccines will be guarded ""like a VIP"", as well as cyber and IT security measures being taken. What will a coronavirus wedding look like?

Theme park fined Â£350k over rollercoaster fallA seven-year-old boy fell from the Twister ride at Lightwater Valley in May last year.York & North Yorkshire,"The boy fell from a carriage on the Twister ride at Lightwater Valley in May 2019 A theme park where a boy fell from a rollercoaster has been fined Â£350,000 for health and safety breaches. The seven-year-old was airlifted to hospital with head injuries after falling from the ride at Lightwater Valley in North Yorkshire in May 2019. York Magistrates' Court heard the ride no longer operated and the park viewed the accident with ""great sadness"". The boy fell from the Twister attraction during the spring half-term holiday, the court heard. Bosses at the theme park, near Ripon, admitted breaching Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. More stories across Yorkshire Judge Adrian Lower was told the boy had not been wearing a seat belt and fell through a gap between the seat and a restraining bar. But the boy and his mother, who was in the car with him, were not told they had to wear a seat belt, the court heard. Judge Lower was told the effectiveness of the restraining bar was not enough to hold the youngster in position. The child was airlifted to hospital after the accident at Lightwater Valley Prosecutor Craig Hassall said the victim suffered serious head injuries following the fall and was airlifted to hospital in Leeds. His mother saw him slip under the restraint as he was ejected from the car which was between two and three metres from the ground at the time Mr Hassall said seatbelt rules were not universally understood by ride operatives and that maintenance of seatbelts was not adequate or in effective working order.

"Schoolgirl's river death 'was an accident'There is ""no evidence whatsoever"" that Shukri Yahye-Abdi was pushed in a river, a coroner says.Manchester","Shukri Yahye-Abdi came to the UK in 2017 The death of a 12-year-old refugee girl who drowned in a river was an accident, a coroner has ruled. Shukri Yahye-Abdi, who came to the UK in 2017, died after entering the River Irwell in Bury on 27 June 2019 while holding hands with another child, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Coroner Joanne Kearsley said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to suggest that Shukri was pushed into the river. She added that claims Shukri had been bullied were ""totally incorrect"". Shukri's mother Zam Zam Ture said the verdict had not brought ""justice"" for her daughter. Following the inquest, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it did not find evidence to indicate Shukri's family were treated less favourably by police because of their ethnic background. Shukri's family had claimed she had been pushed into the water by girls who had been bullying her. Her school latersaid it would review its anti-bullying policyamid concerns raised in the community. Ms Kearlsey said there was no evidence of racist bullying by other children and such claims were ""simply rumours and unhelpful speculation"". She said Shukri had gone into the river while holding hands with Child One and moved into deeper water after the 12-year-old was told she would be taught to swim. She said Child One had been ""naive and foolish""  but what she did did not amount to manslaughter. Shukri's mother Zam Zam Ture said she felt ""so bad"" about the verdict Shukri's family's lawyer said they would seek a judicial review of the inquest's findings. Ms Ture said she felt ""so bad today"" as she had waited a ""long time for justice"". ""I know what happened to my daughter. I know today I don't have justice, but the justice is coming,"" she added. She had previouslyclaimed institutional racism within Greater Manchester Police (GMP) meant officers failed to carry out a full investigationinto her daughter's death. The IOPC said there was ""insufficient evidence on which a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct for any of the individual officers could be found"". ""Therefore the complaints against GMP are not upheld,"" an IOPC spokeswoman said. The IOPC'sfinal report,externalsaid GMP officers had reached the river within three minutes of receiving the report about Shukri being in trouble and taken witness accounts ""almost immediately"". It said officers had visited the 12-year-old's school the following day and ""added relevant information concerning bullying to their investigation"". It added that GMP had ""promptly brought in translation services"" and a family liaison officer had communicated with Shukri's family throughout. IOPC Regional Director Amanda Rowe said the complaints received following the 12-year-old's death ""were treated with the upmost seriousness and very carefully assessed against the evidence available to us"". ""I am satisfied that [GMP's investigation] was carried out in line with national and local policies and procedures,"" she said. She added that while ""nothing we can do or say will bring Shukri back"", she hoped the IOPC's work could give her family ""the clarity and facts they had rightly sought"".

"UK 'confident' of having 800,000 jabs by next week","The government is ""absolutely confident"" the UK will have 800,000 coronavirus vaccine doses by next week, when the vaccination programme starts, the business secretary has said. Alok Sharma said some of the Pfizer/BioNTech doses had arrived, with more expected by the end of the year. He was unable to say how many that will be. NHS Providers said the UK must work on the basis that more doses beyond this might not arrive ""for some time"". Chief executive Chris Hopsontweeted,externalthat it was ""vital"" hospitals sought to vaccinate as many people as possible in the highest priority groups. He added that with ""every day that goes past, we become more confident we will get a lot more [doses] and get them soon"". It comes as official data showed infection levels werefalling in all English regions, except the North East. The government said the R number - the average number of people each person with Covid-19 goes on to infect - has fallen to between 0.8 and 1 in the UK, from between 0.9 and 1 last week. It also reported that a further 504 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 60,617. First batch of Covid vaccines arrives in the UK First vaccines 'could cut 99% of deaths' - Van-Tam When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the safety checks for vaccines? The first consignment of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccinearrived in the UK on Thursday, though the number of doses has not been confirmed. Asked about whether the 800,000 doses the UK is expecting in the coming days will arrive by next week, Mr Sharma told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We will have - I'm absolutely confident - that we will have 800,000 doses available at the point next week when we start the vaccination programme. ""Of course, by the end of this year we will expect some more doses to come through - I can't give you a number on that."" The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list - which is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - followed by the over-80s and front-line health and care staff. Mr Sharma reiterated that the bulk of the vaccination programme would be carried out next year, adding that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was alsoreviewing the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. This video can not be played Ros Atkins from BBC's Outside Source asks if people will have to be vaccinated against Covid-19 The chief commercial officer for BioNTech, Sean Marett, said there would be more shipments of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which is made in Belgium, next week. He said the first batch arrived on Thursday via the Eurotunnel and they were then transported to a storage facility. Mr Hopson said the vaccines will by now have reached the hospital hubs to enable vaccinations to begin on Tuesday. Hospitals were working out how many care home residents, care home staff and over-80s they can get it to, he said. He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that the vaccine will be delivered to care homes within ""the next 10 to 14 days, but we're going as fast as we can"". Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the JCVI, told The World at One that he understood the elderly in care homes ""might not end up being the first priority group for operational reasons"" and the committee would ""closely monitor this"". He stressed that the JCVI still expected care home residents ""to be prioritised"". This week, Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert,apologised for remarks that seemed to criticise the UK's vaccine approval process. Mr Sharma defended the UK's approach to approving the vaccine, saying the MHRA was ""absolutely meticulous"" and was regarded as a ""gold standard of regulation"" by international scientists. He told Sky News: ""People should be really confident that this vaccine is safe. If it wasn't safe it wouldn't be deployed and I certainly have full confidence in the work the MHRA have done."" Downing Street also defended the UK's medicines regulator, with the prime minister's official spokesman describing the MHRA as a ""world leader in its field"". World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the development of vaccines means ""we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel"" - but added that the organisation was ""concerned that there is a growing perception that the Covid-19 pandemic is over"".

China plants its flag on the Moon,"The lander deployed a Chinese flag China has planted its flag on the Moon, more than 50 years after the US first planted the Stars and Stripes there. The pictures from China's National Space Administration show the five-starred Red Flag holding still on the windless lunar surface. They were taken by a camera on the Chang'e-5 space probe before it left the Moon with rock samples on Thursday. Two previous Chinese lunar missions had flags on the crafts' coatings - so neither could be affixed to the moon. READ MORE ABOUT THE MISSION:China's Chang'e-5 mission leaves Moon's surface The US planted the first flag on the Moon during the manned Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Five further US flags were planted on the lunar surface during subsequent missions up until 1972. In 2012 Nasa cited satellite images as showing that five of the flags were still standing, but experts quoted in media reports say they are likely to have been bleached white by the sun's glare. The first flag was said by astronaut Buzz Aldrin to have been placed too close to the Apollo lunar module and was, he said, probably blown away when the module blasted off. The state-run Global Times newspaper said the Chinese flag was a reminder of the ""excitement and inspiration"" felt during the US Apollo missions. The fabric flag was unfurled by the Chang'e-5 lander vehicle just before its ascender vehicle took off using the lander as a launchpad. Chang'e-5 landed in the northwest of the Moon's nearside. The flag can be seen on the right It has taken soil and rock samples to China's lunar orbiter 15km (nine miles) above the lunar surface - which will then be enclosed in a module that will be aimed at China's Inner Mongolia region.

All parts of the flag have been given features such as protection against cold temperatures, project leader Li Yunfeng told the Global Times. ""An ordinary national flag on Earth would not survive the severe lunar environment,"" project developer Cheng Chang said.

"Killer cleared of murder of girl, 7, in park","Emily Jones ""was always full of joy, love and laughter,"" her family have said A woman who slit a seven-year-old's throat has been cleared of murder after the prosecution offered no further evidence and withdrew the charge. Eltiona Skana, 30, hadadmitted the manslaughterof Emily Jones on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Skana, who has paranoid schizophrenia, had been on trial at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court after pleading not guilty to murder. Mr Justice Wall will sentence Skana for manslaughter on Tuesday. The jury had been directed to formally return a not guilty verdict. After hearing evidence from a consultant forensic psychiatrist treating Skana at high-security Rampton Hospital, Michael Brady QC, prosecuting, told the court there was no realistic prospect of a conviction on the murder charge. The court heard how Emily was in Queen's Park in Bolton with her father Mark Jones on the afternoon of Mother's Day on 22 March. She was riding her scooter when she spotted her mother Sarah Barnes, who was jogging. The youngster was calling out to her mother as she scooted past a park bench where Skana was sitting, alone and armed with a craft knife. Skana got up, grabbed Emily and slit her throat before running off. The defendant, originally from Albania, was later detained under the Mental Health Act. During the trial, the prosecution alleged that it was for the jury to decide whether this was a case of murder rather than manslaughter and questioned whether Skana's poor mental health was a ""convenient excuse"" for her actions. The court heard about a conversation between Skana and a nurse while in Rampton, which pointed to the attack being planned and therefore a calculated killing rather than manslaughter. Seven-year-old Emily Jones was stabbed as she played in Queen's Park, Bolton But the jury was also told the conversation took place when Skana was not taking her anti-psychotic medication as part of a change in treatment at the hospital. Dr Victoria Sullivan, who treated Skana at a medium secure mental health unit in Manchester after her arrest, said the defendant's sister Klestora told them she had not been taking her anti-psychotic medication before the attack. Skana came to the UK in 2014 and had been having injections of anti-psychotic drugs each month since 2017, the court heard. But she also told medics this medication had caused her mental health to deteriorate and she began taking tablets instead. When police raided her flat in Bolton, they found a stash of untaken, anti-psychotic drugs, which amounted to around a month's worth of medication. From mid-December of last year until March 11, the defendant had no face-to-face contact with her mental health workers, the jury heard. Earlier, in 2017, Skana had stabbed her own mother and in another incident attacked her sister and had been admitted to psychiatric hospitals three times. Dr Syed Afghan, her consultant at Rampton, agreed Skana became psychotically violent when not taking her medication.

Safety fears pause Manchester care home testingThe rapid tests picked up five infections out of every 10 found by conventional lab tests.HealthComments,"Greater Manchester councils have become the latest to pause rapid testing for care home visitors over concerns they fail to detect enough infections. Data suggests the rapid kits miss about a third of the most infectious cases picked up by conventional lab tests. Lateral flow tests are being used in England so residents can see family indoors for the first time since March. The government has described rapid testing as way of reducing, rather than eliminating, risk. The rapid lateral flow tests work by taking a nose and throat swab, shaking it in fluid until any viral particles come off, and then dropping the fluid onto a plastic stick - a bit like a pregnancy test. They take about half an hour to show a result - one line on the paper strip means the test has worked and two lines means virus is present. Their speed, and the fact they don't need to be taken to a lab, mean these tests - in theory - can be used to make on-the-spot decisions such as deciding if someone can go into premises like a care home or event venue. Manchester's decision follows similar assessments elsewhere. Sheffield has paused lateral flow tests for care home visits which it considers how best to use them. In Liverpool, visitors are permitted inside but they have to take multiple tests. Similar solutions are being considered around Greater Manchester. A standard coronavirus test - also known as a PCR test - misses fewer than 5% of infections. It was already known that lateral flow tests were less sensitive - they miss about 50% of infections overall. But lab tests had suggested that figure could fall to 5% when a high level of virus was present. The government had argued that the tests were therefore as effective as PCR tests at picking up people with the most virus in their systems - those most likely to be currently infectious. However, data published from the Liverpool testing pilot suggests that when it comes to people with higher viral loads, rapid tests only pick up seven infections for every 10 picked up by a PCR test. This means about a third of the most potentially infectious people could be told they were free of the virus. This could be even lower if the tests were conducted by non-clinically trained people. There are different uses for rapid tests. When mass testing was piloted in Liverpool, about 1,000 coronavirus cases were picked up in people without symptoms who would not otherwise have been tested. Even if the rapid tests only pick up half of cases, those are all extra cases that wouldn't have been found and so, in a sense, are all a win. There is some concern that people may change their behaviour as a result of a negative test, perhaps stopping social distancing. It's not yet know how big a problem that might be. The main aim of that type of testing is to act on positive results, asking those detected to quarantine, but also telling people with a negative result to continue to keep to the guidance as normal. According to Prof Jon Deeks at the University of Birmingham, the bigger problem is when rapid tests are used to make decisions based on a negative result. That includes care home visits, or university students who feel free to mingle with other households based on a negative test. ""There is a difference [between] mass testing to 'break chains of transmission', where any true positive result is a gain - in that case it doesn't matter too much that you miss some people - and testing to 'be safe', where the focus is on whether the negative result is trustworthy,"" he explained. Those potentially false negative results could be used to make a dangerous decision - for example, relatives may then hug a loved one in a care home who is at high risk, potentially infecting them and other vulnerable residents. A Greater Manchester spokesperson said: ""We're committed to facilitating care home visiting, we know how important it is to relatives and residents who have waited so long for this, but we also want to ensure we get this right and do it as safely as possible. ""We now have the government guidance, as well as the recommendations from our own testing expert group, and our directors of public health, adult social care leads and care homes are all working together to get things in place as fast as we can."" Dr Angela Raffle at the University of Bristol, who has also worked for the UK National Screening Programmes, said people with expertise in whole-population testing hadn't had input into the government's plans. Screening healthy populations can cause harm, for example ""people who test negative may be falsely reassured and you could actually increase transmission"", she told the BBC. Like so many things in the pandemic, this is about balancing risks and benefits. For some care home residents, a lack of visits has caused great distress and according to some families, a worsening of their health. No test is 100% effective, and lateral flow tests are considerably less than that. Some councils are trialling different ways of using them, for example asking visitors to take a PCR test a week before the visit and a rapid test on the day. Dr Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser to Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace, described the tests as an ""additional tool in helping us detect Covid-19 cases that we wouldn't otherwise know about"". That, she said, would help break chains of transmission and save lives. She added they should be used ""in combination with other vital infection prevention control measures such as wearing appropriate PPE, washing hands regularly and social distancing"".

A 'turn for the worse'?,"Michel Barnier and his team were working late into the night with their UK counterparts To do business with each other from January, the UK and the EU agree there will have to be some shared rules. It's called the level playing field, if you want to use the jargon, andyou can read about it in all the detail you want here. But again and again, the two sides have clashed over who should be in charge of the rules and, particularly, what happens if things go wrong. Alongside who gets to catch fish in whose waters, this part of the talks has been the most problematic. Late on Wednesday though, there were signs that a deal was nearly concluded. 'Prospect of breakthrough receding' in UK-EU talks It's nearly now or never for UK-EU trade deal The pizzas fuelled the negotiators into what seemed like a good place -you can read about the state of play last night here. A swift deal was not inevitable, but it certainly felt like the jigsaw pieces were lining up, with sources on both sides of the Channel agreeing that agreement on Friday or Saturday could be very lightly pencilled in. But after another day of talks on Thursday, just before 19:00 GMT, things seemed to take a turn for the worse. UK sources said the talks had ""gone back 24 hours"", claiming the EU has toughened its stance on an independent regulator to police what happens if the shared rules and regulations are broken, and things go wrong. A senior government source told the BBC: ""At the eleventh hour, the EU is bringing new elements into the negotiation. A breakthrough is still possible in the next few days but that prospect is receding."" It's been claimed that the French government has been leading a charge for a more robust system of oversight, trying to push the UK into a position they cannot accept. An EU source told the BBC the talks were in difficulty and had become ""extremely sluggish"", confirming that the main point of tension was over enforcing the rules and regulations. But another EU insider suggested the UK might just be posturing, and that there was bafflement at the suggestion anything new was put on the table - the theatrics, perhaps, in the closing moments of the negotiations. Frankly, at the moment, it is extremely hard to work out exactly what is going on - although we know for sure the negotiators are still hard at it (Thursday's food delivery was from the food chain Leon.) Every Brexit negotiation has had last minute dramas, where very often, just in the nick of time, victory is snatched from the jaws of defeat. It's true that both sides want a deal. It's also true that both sides can see the shape of a possible deal. But when there is so much at stake, taking it for granted that it will happen is quite an assumption to make.

On Thursday, 58 of the company's 64 employees went back onto furlough. Barrels of beer are being poured down the drain due to the ban Director David Atkins said the new measures are ""an absolute kick in the teeth"". ""This time last year we probably turned over about Â£1.5m for the month of December. This year, it's Â£50,000. He added the majority of their beer - about 45,000 pints - will have to be thrown away.

"China plants its flag on the MoonIt becomes the second nation to unfurl its banner on the lunar surface, more than 50 years after the US.","The lander deployed a Chinese flag China has planted its flag on the Moon, more than 50 years after the US first planted the Stars and Stripes there. The pictures from China's National Space Administration show the five-starred Red Flag holding still on the windless lunar surface. They were taken by a camera on the Chang'e-5 space probe before it left the Moon with rock samples on Thursday. Two previous Chinese lunar missions had flags on the crafts' coatings - so neither could be affixed to the moon. READ MORE ABOUT THE MISSION:China's Chang'e-5 mission leaves Moon's surface The US planted the first flag on the Moon during the manned Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Five further US flags were planted on the lunar surface during subsequent missions up until 1972. In 2012 Nasa cited satellite images as showing that five of the flags were still standing, but experts quoted in media reports say they are likely to have been bleached white by the sun's glare. The first flag was said by astronaut Buzz Aldrin to have been placed too close to the Apollo lunar module and was, he said, probably blown away when the module blasted off. The state-run Global Times newspaper said the Chinese flag was a reminder of the ""excitement and inspiration"" felt during the US Apollo missions. The fabric flag was unfurled by the Chang'e-5 lander vehicle just before its ascender vehicle took off using the lander as a launchpad. Chang'e-5 landed in the northwest of the Moon's nearside.

"Disruption after 'thundersnow' hits ScotlandHundreds of residents reported hearing explosions in the early hours of Friday caused by the weather phenomenon.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","This video can not be played The sound of thundersnow is heard across parts of Scotland Police Scotland has reassured residents in Edinburgh after hundreds of people reported being woken by the sound of explosions. However, police said that what people were actually hearing was the phenomenon known as ""thundersnow"". Two ""extraordinarily loud"" thunder claps were heard over the capital just before 05:00. The snow caused disruption across many areas, including temporarily closing the Queensferry Crossing. This video can not be played BBC Weather presenter Nick Miller explains how thundersnow happens BBC weather forecaster Gemma Plumb said snow had also fallen overnight and on Friday morning across parts of northern and eastern England as well as on the high ground of south west England and Wales. Further snow was expected to continue falling in the afternoon in northern England and Wales and in parts of the Midlands and Scotland, but would become increasingly confined to higher ground. There could also be some snow on the high ground of the rest of Wales, south west England and perhaps Northern Ireland in the afternoon, with much of the UK having outbreaks of rain - and potentially sleet or snow on higher ground later on Friday. And there will be a chance of ice in some areas - particularly in the south east of England. A number of yellow warnings for ice and snow are in place across large areas of Scotland and Northern Ireland and stretch down into North Yorkshire. In pictures: Snowy scenes in many parts of UK The coldest night of the autumn/winter so far was recorded at Altnaharra in the Highlands, where temperatures dipped to -9.6C (14.72F). Some residents in Midlothian, including in Penicuik and Loanhead, reported what they thought was a bomb exploding or a building collapse. The sound, which is created when thunder and lightning combine with a heavy snowstorm, also caused dozens of car alarms to go off. Allow Twitter content?

Saoirse Morton, 19, in Leith, was up late listening to music when she heard the thundersnow. ""I heard what I thought was an explosion so I started looking for a factory nearby that could have exploded,"" she said. ""I just sat for 10 seconds in shock before checking on my pets. I was convinced something had exploded. I messaged some friends on Facebook and said something had exploded and they said 'no, no it's thunder and lightning' and started trying to convince me.

""My husband said it was thunder and I was unsure so googled it and learned the term 'thundersnow'. ""A little while later there was a second loud boom which went for a bit longer."" She said the weather later quietened down, and the snow was starting to melt away. The noise was also heard in Fife, with Leanne Duffy tweeting that it was ""crazy"" to hear the phenomenon. The snowfall has also caused issues on the area's roads, with the Queensferry Crossing closed for several hours in both directions on Friday morning because of falling ice and snow. However, it reopened at about 08:30. How do you stop ice falling from bridge cables? Some schools and nurseries have been closed due to the wintry weather.

Brexit trade talks at a difficult point - No 10,"Talks to reach a post-Brexit trade deal have been paused, because UK and EU negotiators say ""significant divergences"" remain. Michel Barnier and David Frost said conditions for a deal between the two sides have not been met. European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen and PM Boris Johnson will discuss the state of play on Saturday. State aid subsidies, fishing and enforcement of new rules remain the key sticking points in negotiations. If a deal is not agreed by 31 December, the two sides will trade on World Trade Organization rules, meaning the introduction of taxes on imports. What next as Brexit negotiators hit pause button? How many trade deals has the UK done so far? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Releasing identical statements on Twitter, Mr Barnier and Lord Frost said: ""After one week of intense negotiation in London, the two chief negotiators agreed today that the conditions for an agreement are not met, due to significant divergences on level playing field, governance and fisheries. ""On this basis, they agreed to pause the talks in order to brief their principals on the state of play of the negotiations."" Mr Barnier is negotiating on behalf of the 27 EU member states and can only act within the mandate set by their leaders. A senior UK government source told BBC News the statement shows how far apart both sides are and that the trade talks have run into problems. Earlier, Boris Johnson's spokesman said the government was ""committed to working hard to try and reach agreement"" but emphasised that the UK couldn't ""agree a deal that doesn't allow us to take back control"". He added that ""time is in very short supply and we are at a very difficult point in talks"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin said it was important for the 27 EU member states to give negotiators ""the space to conclude these talks"". He added that he ""fervently hoped"" a trade deal can be agreed. Meanwhile, France's Europe minister, Clement Beaune, warned that his country could ""veto"" a deal if it did not satisfy their demands. The European Parliament would need to ratify any deal before it can be implemented and UK MPs are likely to get the chance to vote on legislation implementing the agreement. And the 27 EU national parliaments could also need to ratify an agreement -  depending on the actual contents of the deal. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

Beer poured away at pubs in Wales close,"City centre streets were deserted after the ban closed pubs and restaurants Barrels of beer are being poured down drains as Wales' hospitality industry prepared for the alcohol ban to come into force. Pubs, restaurants and cafes arebanned from serving alcohol from Friday eveningand must close at 18:00 GMT, other than for takeaway service. Businesses said it was ""a devastating hammer blow"" after going to lengths to keep customers safe. They said the restrictions will also significantly impact the supply chain. Can people from Wales go to England to drink? Can I meet friends under new Covid rules? What do the new rules mean for pubs in Wales? This video can not be played 'It's like a death sentence' At the Glamorgan Brewery in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, staff have been pouring barrels of beer down the drain because it now cannot be sold in pubs. On Thursday, 58 of the company's 64 employees went back onto furlough. Barrels of beer are being poured down the drain due to the ban Director David Atkins said the new measures are ""an absolute kick in the teeth"". ""This time last year we probably turned over about Â£1.5m for the month of December. This year, it's Â£50,000. He added the majority of their beer - about 45,000 pints - will have to be thrown away. Pubs began clearing tables and chairs as the ban came into force at 18:00 GMT on Friday At The Cricketers pub in Pontcanna, Cardiff, staff were also pouring away beer on Friday afternoon. Simon Buckley, of Evan Evans Brewery which supplies the pub said: ""How can it be right and safe to open to serve food in pubs but not alcohol? It defies logic. Drinkers enjoy final night before pub alcohol ban Welsh Government pulls Christmas drinks TV advert ""Why is 6pm the bewitching hour as opposed to 10pm? In these difficult times - and the month of December particularly - the lost revenue is significant."" This video can not be played What does Wales' hospitality sector make of the new Covid rules? James Cunningham, manager of the Ruthin Castle Hotel in Ruthin, Denbighshire, said customers have appreciated the safety measures put in place and the new rules were ""incredibly frustrating"". ""Whenever they can, people want to try to come out and enjoy themselves in these very, very testing times,"" he said. He described the measures as a ""devastating hammer blow"" to the hospitality industry. ""Figures show that less than 5% of all settings of infection happen in hospitality - and yet here we are once again taking the hammer blow,"" he said. ""There's no guarantee those restrictions are going to be lifted,"" he said.

Some nurses in the Hywel Dda health board area said they were unable to book as they were not sent the link.Â Â Â The new coronavirus vaccine was authorised for use just this week, with NHS healthcare workers first in line. The health board called on staff to ""bear with us"" as it worked to confirm more slots. No bookings have been confirmed after December 11, with a spokesperson telling staff: ""You may need to wait a couple of weeks before you are able to book an appointment. ""There will be enough vaccine for all patient-facing staff. We hope to be able to open up to 4,500 vaccine appointments before Christmas."" First people to be vaccinated in Wales on Tuesday Q&A: How will the vaccine rollout work in Wales? 'Unknown' vaccine schedule for care home residents Some frontline health workers at hospitals in the south west Wales area said they were not made aware of the link to make a booking for the vaccine - which meant all slots were immediately taken within five hours of going live, and many nurses in particular were left unable to get an appointment. One nurse, who works on a Covid ward at the Prince Philip Hospital, Llanelli, said she was one of those who missed out on getting an appointment for the new vaccine - and so did her colleagues. ""I feel a bit let down,"" said the nurse who did not want to be identified. ""We were asked to give our availability, we were sent a link to book and by the time we got the link there were no appointments left. A vaccination centre has been set up at Glangwili Hospital, Carmarthen ""There are around 57-60 staff on the Covid ward. As far as I know none of them were able to get an appointment. ""What we've been told is that by time management gave us the link it had been circulating around the health board and others, not frontline workers, were able to get an appointment. ""Whether Prince Phillip were a bit slow off the mark, perhaps others sent to their friends in other departments and all the slots were gone. ""We've had lots and lots of members of staff off with Covid, some quite unwell, yet we weren't given priority."" She added that she does not know when the vaccine will be available to her, but was told it could be the following week. People will be vaccinated in Wales from Tuesday Hywel Dda University Health Board said the invitation for a vaccination was sent to a strict clinical distribution list on Wednesday at 17:00 GMT, but that all appointments had been taken by 22:00 GMT. A limited supply of the new vaccine means the Hywel Dda health board has received 975 doses in this first round.Â It is currently unclear when the next batches will be available.Â Â The vaccination programme isdue to begin on Tuesdaywithin the Hywel Dda health board area, with two vaccination centres being set up - one at Glangwili Hospital and the other in Cardigan.Â Â Â Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price called the reports ""very concerning"" and said it endangered both public health and trust. ""It would appear that poor communication on the part of the health board has prevented some frontline staff from securing their slot to be vaccinated, risking putting themselves and patients in danger,"" he added. ""We need an urgent statement from the health board and an immediate intervention from the Welsh Government to make it clear that frontline health and care staff, patients and residents must be first priority.""

brought to you by our teams from the UK and US. The writers were Joshua
Cheetham, Francesca Gillett, Lauren Turner, Sophie Williams and Holly
Honderich, and the editors were Helier Cheung and Holly Wallis. Thanks for joining us as we've brought you the latest coronavirus news. Here's a reminder of some of the main headlines of the day from the UK.    The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says he is pleased that progress on vaccines means ""we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel"". However, Tedros Adhanom adds the ""WHO is concerned there is a growing perception that the Covid-19 pandemic is over"". ""The truth is that at present, many places are witnessing very high transmission of the Covid-19 virus, which is putting enormous pressure on hospitals, intensive care units and health workers."" In other developments around the world today:  Major Lee Wooten, a World War II veteran from Alabama, has recovered from Covid-19 and made it back home from the hospital just in time to celebrate his 104th birthday. Madison Hospital in Madison, Alabama posted a video of Wooten - known as ""Pop Pop"" - being discharged from the hospital, his wheelchair decorated with balloons, as staff cheer and wave him on. His granddaughter, Holly Wooten McDonald told the Associated Press that her grandfather, ""their family's treasure"", appears to be feeling better. Wooten was drafted into the US Army in 1943 and served as a railroad carpenter stationed in Paris in WWII. Bahrain has recorded 87,000 cases since the pandemic began Bahrain has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine for emergency use authorisation, becoming the second country to approve it after the UK,state media report,external. The countryâs National Health Regulatory
Authority (NHRA) announced the move on Friday, saying it had followed âthorough
analysis and reviewâ of all available data. Earlier this month Bahrain approved the
use of the Sinopharm vaccine for frontline workers. Dr Mariam Al Jalahma, CEO of NHRA said: âThe
approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to
the Kingdomâs national Covid-19 response, which has strongly prioritised
protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic.â Bahrain has recorded 341 deaths and 87,432
cases since the pandemic began. A number of Royal Navy personnel have tested positive for coronavirus at its HMNB Clyde base, also known as Faslane, and are under medical supervision. The Royal Navy said that those identified as close contacts are now isolating. HMNB Clyde, on Gare Loch in Argyll and Bute, is the navy's base for nuclear submarines and hunter-killer submarines. A spike of 96 positive cases were confirmed in the Argyll and Bute council area, where the base is located, today. This is much higher than the area's recent weekly number of positive cases.

Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The recovery in employment continued last
month, after the heavy job losses in the first wave of the pandemic in the US. According to new official data, the
number of people with jobs rose by 245,000 last month and the unemployment rate
declined to 6.7%. But the job creation figure was less than
expected and less than the previous month and is seen by economists as
disappointing.  Almost 15m people said they were unable to work because their employer closed or lost business as a result of the pandemic. Nearly four million others said they couldnât even look for work due to the pandemic. The outlook for jobs in the near future is clouded by rising infections and official restrictions. But recent vaccine developments mean longer term labour market prospects are more upbeat. Yesterday, we covered reports that cyber spies had targeted international organisations involved in the supply chain of coronavirus vaccines. The American technology firm, IBM, said hackers had been trying to access the so-called ""cold chain"" - the delivery chain used to ensure vaccines are kept at the right temperature while being transported. Dr Ian Levy, from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, says his organisation is working to ensure vaccine delivery is as ""protected as can be"" from cyber attacks. ""In April we pivoted our work to better protect the health sector and so there is a massive community effort in protecting the health sector and the vaccine supply chain, all the way from research through to delivery and distribution,"" he tells the BBC. He declined to say which states had been targeting vaccine efforts. Another 16,298 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total to 1,690,432, according to new government figures. There have been another 504 deaths, of people who had a positive test result within the previous 28 days. There have now been 60,617 deaths, under that measure.   Madrid has cancelled its New
Yearâs Eve celebrations including the traditional event in Puerta del Sol
Square where people eat 12 grapes at the stroke of midnight. The event is incredibly popular and watched around the world. The regional government announced the cancellation on Friday, where it also revealed the measures that will be in place during Christmas and New Year. Christmas markets will have their capacity cut, while spectators at Christmas parades, usually held on 5 January, will have to be seated. Earlier this week, Spain's government announced that travel between regions will only be allowed for those visiting family. Gatherings on December 24, 25 and January 1are limited to 10 people.,external Spain is one of the worst affected countries
in Europe. More than 46,000 people have died and more than 1.6 million cases
since the pandemic began. Other European countries also have Christmas restrictions in place.Italy, for example, is banning travel between its regionsfrom 21 December to 6 January. Two coronavirus vaccines are expected to be approved for use in Northern Ireland this week We know that the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived in the UK by Eurostar yesterday, and nowNorthern Ireland reportsthat it has received its first allocation. Nearly 25,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine were delivered to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on Friday morning. Health Minister Robin Swann said confirmation of which groups will get the Covid-19 vaccine first is expected next week. It is thought the seven vaccination centres that have been earmarked, including leisure centres and hospitals, will be used as satellite centres in order to roll out the vaccine to those care homes which are located nearby. Meanwhile,the NI business community has welcomedcomments from the first minister that there will be no further Covid restrictions this side of Christmas. Lockdown restrictions are currently under way in NI - but It has now been announced that they will be loosened from 00.01 GMT on Friday 11 December. Non-essential retail and some parts of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland can reopen. Hazel ShearingBBC News When Bethany Wakenshaw started her nursing course this year, she could ask for practical advice from her teachers in person as she practised CPR and other life support skills. But after coronavirus cases began to rise again across the UK, her classes moved online last month. Despite the teaching staff's best efforts, she finds online learning frustrating. ""It's so hard to concentrate when you're in your own room because they can't see you,"" she says. ""Even quickly checking your phone for five seconds can turn into being on your phone for 10 minutes.""

Some forms of PPEcould be decontaminated to make them reusablein an emergency measure, scientists have found. Cardiff University said some types of respirators could be effectively decontaminated in just 90 seconds by industrial-grade microwave ovens or using dry heat. It is not a safe method to use at home, the research team warned. Reporting their findings in the Journal of Hospital Infection, the study found that using an industrial-grade microwave oven, and a baby bottle steriliser containing water, could dramatically increase the number of respirators available to staff. This could allow the reuse of some PPE when stocks are low.

A war against coronavirus and a war against stupidity. The Chief Medical Officer at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston went viral earlier this week when an image of him comforting an elderly patient ended up on social media. The US is seeing a surge in the number of people entering hospital with Covid-19, and several states are concerned that health care facilities could soon be overwhelmed. As coronavirus spread across the US last month, health officials urged people to refrain from travel to see friends and family over the Thanksgiving holiday. But data shows that millions of Americans ignored these calls. While air travel was much lower than in previous years, airports still reported some of their busiest days since the start of the pandemic. The US Transportation Security Administration said it had screened over one million passengers on several days during the holiday period. Experts have warnedthe US could see ""surge upon surge"" of Covid-19cases as a result, while the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned that even a small number of infected travellers could lead to hundreds of thousands of new infections. Meanwhile vehicle travel surged around Thanksgiving, peaking at only around 5% less than last year, according to transport analytics firm Streetlight Data. The company's founder, Laura Schewel,told the Associated Press,externalthat this showed ""people were less willing to change their behaviour than any other day during the pandemicâ. Officials have made similar calls for people to avoid travel over Christmas and New Year period, as hospitalisation numbers soar to record highs.

place. From Saturday, people will have to remain in their home from 18:30 until
08:00. Shops will remain open, however they must close by 18:00. On weekends, a full lockdown will be in place. The territory's healthcare system is severely strainedand ill-equipped as a result of conflict, blockade and a political rift

Earlier, we brought you the news that the R number for the UK had fallen slightly to between 0.8 and 1 - the second week running it's been below 1. We've got more details here on what the R number is in different regions of the UK here: Meanwhile, the growth rate, which estimates how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day, is between -3% and -1% for the UK as a whole. That means the number of new infections is shrinking by between 1% and 3% every day. There's more on the latest stats here. Pauline Demaline was fit and healthy and only 56 years old when she fell ill with Covid-19 in March. But within days of going into hospital she had died. She worked as a parish administrator at the Holy Trinity parish church in Skipton, North Yorkshire, and it may be here that she caught the virus, in the early days of the pandemic. She and her husband, Nigel, were very careful. They didn't go out much and Nigel would do the shopping early in the day, when the shops were quiet. But Pauline had to go into work and would sometimes meet other parishioners - couples about to get married, for example, and their parents. Now, Nigel has spoken about how the personal tragedy prompted him to volunteer for one of the many Covid vaccines in trials. Read the full article here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Liverpool mayor held in bribery inquiry,"Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson is one of five men arrested Liverpool's mayor Joe Anderson has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. He and four others were held as part of an investigation into the awarding of building contracts in the city. It is understood the Labour Party has suspended Mr Anderson pending the outcome of the case. The year-long police probe, Operation Aloft, has focussed on a number of property developers. Liverpool City Council said it was co-operating with Merseyside Police. A police statement said those arrested include two men, 33 and 62, both from Liverpool, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. A 46-year-old man from Ainsdale has also been arrested on suspicion of the same offence. The other two arrested men are a 72-year-old man from Liverpool and a 25-year old from Ormskirk, who have been arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation. Developer Elliot Lawless was arrested in January 2019 and denied any wrongdoing. Elliot Lawless is currently released under investigation and was not one of the five arrested earlier on Friday. Councillor Richard Kemp, leader of the opposition Lib Dem group on Liverpool City Council, said Mr Anderson ""should follow the precedence set by leaders of the council and other senior figures in such cases."" ""He should step away from the council and step away from his mayoralty while this goes through due legal process,"" he said. Mr Anderson joined the Merchant Navy after leaving school aged 16. He later studied for a degree in social work at Liverpool John Moores University and went on to become a social worker for Sefton Council in 1992. The father-of-four was Liverpool's first elected mayor in 2012 having served on the city council since 1998. His national profile been raised by his role in driving forward mass coronavirus testing in the city.

Virus levels 'falling across most of England',"The percentage of people testing positive for the coronavirus has fallen in all English regions except the North East,according to the Office for National Statistics,external. In the week to 28 November, one in 105 people in England had the virus compared with one in 85 a week before. Meanwhile, the R number for the UK has fallen to between 0.8 and 1 - the second week running it's been below 1. This measures virus reproduction rate, suggesting the epidemic is shrinking. The UK government says it's ""absolutely confident"" it will have 800,000 doses of a Covid vaccineto begin vaccination next week. The first delivery arrived in the UK on Thursday. The ONS figures are based on swab tests of thousands of people in UK households whether they have symptoms or not. It is one source of data used by the government's scientific advisers to estimate the R number of the virus and how fast it is spreading. They estimatethe R number is currently below 1,external, which means the number of people an average infected person passes the virus onto is less than one. It's also the first time since September that advisers believe there's a good chance infections are falling in every region in England. England's second lockdown, which lasted for nearly a month, ended on Wednesday. ""It is clear that on a national level, the lockdown has had the predicted effect,"" says Prof James Naismith from the University of Oxford. He added: ""We are currently on the downward slope of the second wave. The lower we get the daily number of infections, the less risk the Christmas relaxation poses."" Elsewhere in the UK, where different levels of restrictions have been in place in over the past month, the picture is more mixed. ""We are seeing early signs of decreasing levels in Scotland whilst infections in Northern Ireland have been continuing to decline since October,"" said Katherine Kent, who analysed data from the ONS infection survey. But she added: ""The level of infections appears to have stopped decreasing in Wales recently."" Further restrictions are being introduced there on Fridayafter a rise in cases across the country. At the end of November, the ONS estimates the number of people infected was equivalent to: 1 in 190 in Northern Ireland 1 in 170 in Wales 1 in 130 in Scotland 1 in 105 in England In England, the ONS says infection levels are falling in all age groups but remain highest in children of secondary school age. The percentage of people testing positive is highest in the North East, North West, and Yorkshire and the Humber regions.

Detection concerns pause Manchester care testing,"Greater Manchester councils have become the latest to pause rapid testing for care home visitors over concerns they fail to detect enough infections. Data suggests the rapid kits miss about a third of the most infectious cases picked up by conventional lab tests. Lateral flow tests are being used in England so residents can see family indoors for the first time since March. The government has described rapid testing as way of reducing, rather than eliminating, risk. The rapid lateral flow tests work by taking a nose and throat swab, shaking it in fluid until any viral particles come off, and then dropping the fluid onto a plastic stick - a bit like a pregnancy test. They take about half an hour to show a result - one line on the paper strip means the test has worked and two lines means virus is present. Their speed, and the fact they don't need to be taken to a lab, mean these tests - in theory - can be used to make on-the-spot decisions such as deciding if someone can go into premises like a care home or event venue. Manchester's decision follows similar assessments elsewhere. Sheffield has paused lateral flow tests for care home visits which it considers how best to use them. In Liverpool, visitors are permitted inside but they have to take multiple tests. Similar solutions are being considered around Greater Manchester. A standard coronavirus test - also known as a PCR test - misses fewer than 5% of infections. It was already known that lateral flow tests were less sensitive - they miss about 50% of infections overall. But lab tests had suggested that figure could fall to 5% when a high level of virus was present. The government had argued that the tests were therefore as effective as PCR tests at picking up people with the most virus in their systems - those most likely to be currently infectious. However, data published from the Liverpool testing pilot suggests that when it comes to people with higher viral loads, rapid tests only pick up seven infections for every 10 picked up by a PCR test. This means about a third of the most potentially infectious people could be told they were free of the virus. This could be even lower if the tests were conducted by non-clinically trained people. There are different uses for rapid tests. When mass testing was piloted in Liverpool, about 1,000 coronavirus cases were picked up in people without symptoms who would not otherwise have been tested. Even if the rapid tests only pick up half of cases, those are all extra cases that wouldn't have been found and so, in a sense, are all a win. There is some concern that people may change their behaviour as a result of a negative test, perhaps stopping social distancing. It's not yet know how big a problem that might be. The main aim of that type of testing is to act on positive results, asking those detected to quarantine, but also telling people with a negative result to continue to keep to the guidance as normal. According to Prof Jon Deeks at the University of Birmingham, the bigger problem is when rapid tests are used to make decisions based on a negative result. That includes care home visits, or university students who feel free to mingle with other households based on a negative test. ""There is a difference [between] mass testing to 'break chains of transmission', where any true positive result is a gain - in that case it doesn't matter too much that you miss some people - and testing to 'be safe', where the focus is on whether the negative result is trustworthy,"" he explained. Those potentially false negative results could be used to make a dangerous decision - for example, relatives may then hug a loved one in a care home who is at high risk, potentially infecting them and other vulnerable residents. A Greater Manchester spokesperson said: ""We're committed to facilitating care home visiting, we know how important it is to relatives and residents who have waited so long for this, but we also want to ensure we get this right and do it as safely as possible. ""We now have the government guidance, as well as the recommendations from our own testing expert group, and our directors of public health, adult social care leads and care homes are all working together to get things in place as fast as we can."" Dr Angela Raffle at the University of Bristol, who has also worked for the UK National Screening Programmes, said people with expertise in whole-population testing hadn't had input into the government's plans. Screening healthy populations can cause harm, for example ""people who test negative may be falsely reassured and you could actually increase transmission"", she told the BBC. Like so many things in the pandemic, this is about balancing risks and benefits. For some care home residents, a lack of visits has caused great distress and according to some families, a worsening of their health. No test is 100% effective, and lateral flow tests are considerably less than that. Some councils are trialling different ways of using them, for example asking visitors to take a PCR test a week before the visit and a rapid test on the day. Dr Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser to Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace, described the tests as an ""additional tool in helping us detect Covid-19 cases that we wouldn't otherwise know about"". That, she said, would help break chains of transmission and save lives. She added they should be used ""in combination with other vital infection prevention control measures such as wearing appropriate PPE, washing hands regularly and social distancing"".

John O'Groats-Land's End 'record' driver clearedThomas Davies told a jury he had been exaggerating about how quickly he drove the 841-mile journey.,"Tommy Davies wrote a blog about his journey and spoke about it on BBC Radio 2 A car enthusiast who claimed to have broken the speed record between John O'Groats and Land's End has been cleared of dangerous driving. Thomas Davies, 29, allegedly completed the 841-mile journey in September 2017 in nine hours and 36 minutes, at an average speed of 89mph. Mr Davies, of Corwen, north Wales, was also cleared of two counts of perverting the course of justice. He told his trial that what happened was an ""exaggeration of real life"". Tommy Davies (right) was cleared of all charges at Truro Crown Court Truro Crown Court heard Mr Davies wrote a blog about the journey for a website called Piston Heads and appeared on YouTube, in national newspapers and on the Jeremy Vine Show on Radio 2. Ryan Murray, prosecuting, said Mr Davies had an ambition to travel between John O'Groats and Land's End ""quicker than anyone else had ever done before"" and that he used ""illegal methods"" to achieve his ambition. He said the average speed to complete the 841-mile journey, including a stop for fuel, was 89mph. But Mr Davies told the jury: ""I don't dispute a journey was made. I dispute the manner and the speed of the journey."" He said the prosecution's case was circumstantial and was ""wedded"" to the blog he had written being accurate - but he told the jury it was an exaggeration. He said he accepted it was ""obvious"" that he had ""done some stupid things"", adding: ""I am not the man that I was three years ago.""

Greater Manchester latest to pause care home tests,"Greater Manchester councils have become the latest to pause rapid testing for care home visitors over concerns they fail to detect enough infections. Data suggests the rapid kits miss about a third of the most infectious cases picked up by conventional lab tests. Lateral flow tests are being used in England so residents can see family indoors for the first time since March. The government has described rapid testing as way of reducing, rather than eliminating, risk. The rapid lateral flow tests work by taking a nose and throat swab, shaking it in fluid until any viral particles come off, and then dropping the fluid onto a plastic stick - a bit like a pregnancy test. They take about half an hour to show a result - one line on the paper strip means the test has worked and two lines means virus is present. Their speed, and the fact they don't need to be taken to a lab, mean these tests - in theory - can be used to make on-the-spot decisions such as deciding if someone can go into premises like a care home or event venue. Manchester's decision follows similar assessments elsewhere. Sheffield has paused lateral flow tests for care home visits which it considers how best to use them. In Liverpool, visitors are permitted inside but they have to take multiple tests. Similar solutions are being considered around Greater Manchester. A standard coronavirus test - also known as a PCR test - misses fewer than 5% of infections. It was already known that lateral flow tests were less sensitive - they miss about 50% of infections overall. But lab tests had suggested that figure could fall to 5% when a high level of virus was present. The government had argued that the tests were therefore as effective as PCR tests at picking up people with the most virus in their systems - those most likely to be currently infectious. However, data published from the Liverpool testing pilot suggests that when it comes to people with higher viral loads, rapid tests only pick up seven infections for every 10 picked up by a PCR test. This means about a third of the most potentially infectious people could be told they were free of the virus. This could be even lower if the tests were conducted by non-clinically trained people. There are different uses for rapid tests. When mass testing was piloted in Liverpool, about 1,000 coronavirus cases were picked up in people without symptoms who would not otherwise have been tested. Even if the rapid tests only pick up half of cases, those are all extra cases that wouldn't have been found and so, in a sense, are all a win. There is some concern that people may change their behaviour as a result of a negative test, perhaps stopping social distancing. It's not yet know how big a problem that might be. The main aim of that type of testing is to act on positive results, asking those detected to quarantine, but also telling people with a negative result to continue to keep to the guidance as normal. According to Prof Jon Deeks at the University of Birmingham, the bigger problem is when rapid tests are used to make decisions based on a negative result. That includes care home visits, or university students who feel free to mingle with other households based on a negative test. ""There is a difference [between] mass testing to 'break chains of transmission', where any true positive result is a gain - in that case it doesn't matter too much that you miss some people - and testing to 'be safe', where the focus is on whether the negative result is trustworthy,"" he explained.

Germany to wipe Nazi traces from phonetic alphabet,"This phonetic alphabet used for decades is to be changed Germany is to revamp its phonetic alphabet to remove words added by the Nazis. Before the Nazi dictatorship some Jewish names were used in the phonetic alphabet - such as ""D for David"", ""N for Nathan"" and ""Z for Zacharias"". But the Nazis replaced these with Dora, North Pole and Zeppelin, and their use has since continued with most Germans unaware of their anti-Semitic origin. Experts are working on new terms, to be put to the public and adopted in 2022. The initiative sprang from Michael Blume, in charge of fighting anti-Semitism in the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, backed by the Central Council of Jews in Germany. The job of devising new terms for the problematic letters is now in the hands of the German Institute for Standardization (DIN). The commonly-used equivalent in the UK is the Nato phonetic alphabet, with terms such as ""F for Foxtrot, T for Tango"". But many English speakers also use terms like ""D for Dennis, S for Sugar"" on the phone. In order to preserve the memory of the anti-Semitic list, it will be presented as an annex to the new list to be put to a public consultation next year. After that discussion, the new German list is to be adopted in late 2022. DIN spokesman Julian Pinnig said choosing new personal names would be more problematic than German town or city names, because the choice of personal names might not reflect the nation's ethnic diversity today. Other Jewish names removed by the Nazis in 1934 were ""Jacob"" for the letter ""J"" and ""Samuel"" for ""S"", which became ""Julius"" and ""Siegfried"". A few Nazi references were, however, replaced after World War Two, such as ""Ypres"" for ""Y"", which became ""Ypsilon"" - originally representing the Greek letter pronounced ""U"" and later the Latin letter ""Y"". Ypres was notoriously the battle where the Germans first used poison gas in World War One. ""Nordpol"" (North Pole) retains echoes of Nazism, however. Adolf Hitler's ideology rested on the bogus superiority of a mythical northern Aryan race.

Here's a reminder of some of the main headlines of the day from the UK.    The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says he is pleased that progress on vaccines means ""we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel"". However, Tedros Adhanom adds the ""WHO is concerned there is a growing perception that the Covid-19 pandemic is over"". ""The truth is that at present, many places are witnessing very high transmission of the Covid-19 virus, which is putting enormous pressure on hospitals, intensive care units and health workers."" In other developments around the world today:  Major Lee Wooten, a World War II veteran from Alabama, has recovered from Covid-19 and made it back home from the hospital just in time to celebrate his 104th birthday. Madison Hospital in Madison, Alabama posted a video of Wooten - known as ""Pop Pop"" - being discharged from the hospital, his wheelchair decorated with balloons, as staff cheer and wave him on. His granddaughter, Holly Wooten McDonald told the Associated Press that her grandfather, ""their family's treasure"", appears to be feeling better. Wooten was drafted into the US Army in 1943 and served as a railroad carpenter stationed in Paris in WWII. Bahrain has recorded 87,000 cases since the pandemic began Bahrain has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine for emergency use authorisation, becoming the second country to approve it after the UK,state media report,external. The countryâs National Health Regulatory
Authority (NHRA) announced the move on Friday, saying it had followed âthorough
analysis and reviewâ of all available data. Earlier this month Bahrain approved the
use of the Sinopharm vaccine for frontline workers. Dr Mariam Al Jalahma, CEO of NHRA said: âThe
approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to
the Kingdomâs national Covid-19 response, which has strongly prioritised
protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic.â Bahrain has recorded 341 deaths and 87,432
cases since the pandemic began. A number of Royal Navy personnel have tested positive for coronavirus at its HMNB Clyde base, also known as Faslane, and are under medical supervision. The Royal Navy said that those identified as close contacts are now isolating. HMNB Clyde, on Gare Loch in Argyll and Bute, is the navy's base for nuclear submarines and hunter-killer submarines. A spike of 96 positive cases were confirmed in the Argyll and Bute council area, where the base is located, today. This is much higher than the area's recent weekly number of positive cases.

Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The recovery in employment continued last
month, after the heavy job losses in the first wave of the pandemic in the US. According to new official data, the
number of people with jobs rose by 245,000 last month and the unemployment rate
declined to 6.7%. But the job creation figure was less than
expected and less than the previous month and is seen by economists as
disappointing.  Almost 15m people said they were unable to work because their employer closed or lost business as a result of the pandemic. Nearly four million others said they couldnât even look for work due to the pandemic. The outlook for jobs in the near future is clouded by rising infections and official restrictions. But recent vaccine developments mean longer term labour market prospects are more upbeat. Yesterday, we covered reports that cyber spies had targeted international organisations involved in the supply chain of coronavirus vaccines. The American technology firm, IBM, said hackers had been trying to access the so-called ""cold chain"" - the delivery chain used to ensure vaccines are kept at the right temperature while being transported. Dr Ian Levy, from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, says his organisation is working to ensure vaccine delivery is as ""protected as can be"" from cyber attacks. ""In April we pivoted our work to better protect the health sector and so there is a massive community effort in protecting the health sector and the vaccine supply chain, all the way from research through to delivery and distribution,"" he tells the BBC. He declined to say which states had been targeting vaccine efforts. Another 16,298 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total to 1,690,432, according to new government figures. There have been another 504 deaths, of people who had a positive test result within the previous 28 days. There have now been 60,617 deaths, under that measure.   Madrid has cancelled its New
Yearâs Eve celebrations including the traditional event in Puerta del Sol
Square where people eat 12 grapes at the stroke of midnight. The event is incredibly popular and watched around the world. The regional government announced the cancellation on Friday, where it also revealed the measures that will be in place during Christmas and New Year. Christmas markets will have their capacity cut, while spectators at Christmas parades, usually held on 5 January, will have to be seated. Earlier this week, Spain's government announced that travel between regions will only be allowed for those visiting family. Gatherings on December 24, 25 and January 1are limited to 10 people.,external Spain is one of the worst affected countries
in Europe. More than 46,000 people have died and more than 1.6 million cases
since the pandemic began. Other European countries also have Christmas restrictions in place.Italy, for example, is banning travel between its regionsfrom 21 December to 6 January. Two coronavirus vaccines are expected to be approved for use in Northern Ireland this week We know that the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived in the UK by Eurostar yesterday, and nowNorthern Ireland reportsthat it has received its first allocation. Nearly 25,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine were delivered to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on Friday morning. Health Minister Robin Swann said confirmation of which groups will get the Covid-19 vaccine first is expected next week. It is thought the seven vaccination centres that have been earmarked, including leisure centres and hospitals, will be used as satellite centres in order to roll out the vaccine to those care homes which are located nearby. Meanwhile,the NI business community has welcomedcomments from the first minister that there will be no further Covid restrictions this side of Christmas. Lockdown restrictions are currently under way in NI - but It has now been announced that they will be loosened from 00.01 GMT on Friday 11 December. Non-essential retail and some parts of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland can reopen.

Some forms of PPEcould be decontaminated to make them reusablein an emergency measure, scientists have found. Cardiff University said some types of respirators could be effectively decontaminated in just 90 seconds by industrial-grade microwave ovens or using dry heat. It is not a safe method to use at home, the research team warned. Reporting their findings in the Journal of Hospital Infection, the study found that using an industrial-grade microwave oven, and a baby bottle steriliser containing water, could dramatically increase the number of respirators available to staff. This could allow the reuse of some PPE when stocks are low.

A war against coronavirus and a war against stupidity. The Chief Medical Officer at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston went viral earlier this week when an image of him comforting an elderly patient ended up on social media. The US is seeing a surge in the number of people entering hospital with Covid-19, and several states are concerned that health care facilities could soon be overwhelmed. As coronavirus spread across the US last month, health officials urged people to refrain from travel to see friends and family over the Thanksgiving holiday. But data shows that millions of Americans ignored these calls. While air travel was much lower than in previous years, airports still reported some of their busiest days since the start of the pandemic. The US Transportation Security Administration said it had screened over one million passengers on several days during the holiday period. Experts have warnedthe US could see ""surge upon surge"" of Covid-19cases as a result, while the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned that even a small number of infected travellers could lead to hundreds of thousands of new infections. Meanwhile vehicle travel surged around Thanksgiving, peaking at only around 5% less than last year, according to transport analytics firm Streetlight Data. The company's founder, Laura Schewel,told the Associated Press,externalthat this showed ""people were less willing to change their behaviour than any other day during the pandemicâ. Officials have made similar calls for people to avoid travel over Christmas and New Year period, as hospitalisation numbers soar to record highs.

Earlier, we brought you the news that the R number for the UK had fallen slightly to between 0.8 and 1 - the second week running it's been below 1. We've got more details here on what the R number is in different regions of the UK here: Meanwhile, the growth rate, which estimates how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day, is between -3% and -1% for the UK as a whole. That means the number of new infections is shrinking by between 1% and 3% every day. There's more on the latest stats here. Pauline Demaline was fit and healthy and only 56 years old when she fell ill with Covid-19 in March. But within days of going into hospital she had died. She worked as a parish administrator at the Holy Trinity parish church in Skipton, North Yorkshire, and it may be here that she caught the virus, in the early days of the pandemic. She and her husband, Nigel, were very careful. They didn't go out much and Nigel would do the shopping early in the day, when the shops were quiet. But Pauline had to go into work and would sometimes meet other parishioners - couples about to get married, for example, and their parents. Now, Nigel has spoken about how the personal tragedy prompted him to volunteer for one of the many Covid vaccines in trials. Read the full article here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Coronavirus: Evening updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening.,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. The government is ""absolutely confident"" the UK will have 800,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses by next week, when the vaccination programme starts,according to Business Secretary Alok Sharma. The first consignment of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - which is 95% effective - arrived from Belgium on Thursday evening, though the number of doses has not been confirmed. More are expected by the end of the year. NHS Providers' chief executive Chris Hopson said it was ""vital"" hospitals sought to vaccinate as many people as possible in the highest priority groups when vaccinations begin on Tuesday.You can see who will be first in line for the vaccine here.

In the week to 28 November, one in 105 people were estimated to have the virus compared to one in 85 the week before. In Scotland, one in 130 people are estimated to have the virus. In Wales, the figure is one in 170, and in Northern Ireland it is one in 190. Separately, the UK's R number - representing the average number of people each Covid-19 positive person goes on to infect - is now between 0.8 and 1, the latest government figures show.You can read more about the R number and why it matters here. At the beginning of the week, one of retail's biggest names - Topshop owner Arcadia -entered administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. But not all High Street chains are struggling.Budget clothing retailer Primark says it expects sales and profits in its current financial year to rise, despite the disruption from recent lockdowns. Primark said autumn store closures meant it missed out on Â£430m of sales, higher than a previous estimate of Â£375m. However, it added that sales since reopening, including in England this week, had ""once again been very strong"". Primark does not sell online, and on reopening on Wednesday, pent-up demand saw queues form at several stores.

Breaking|Breaking newsAvonmouth explosion victims named by policeThe blast happened on Thursday at a water treatment works in an industrial area of Bristol.UK,"A witness reported hearing a ""very loud explosion"" A 16-year-old boy was among four workers killed in an explosion at a waste water treatment works. Teenager Luke Wheaton, Michael James, 64, Brian Vickery, 63, and Raymond White, 57, died in the blast in Avonmouth, Bristol. A fifth person injured is recovering at home. It happened at 11:20 GMT on Thursday in a silo that treated biosolids. Wessex Water said it was working with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to investigate the cause of the blast. It is understood Mr James was a contractor working at the site, while Mr Vickery and Mr White were employees of Wessex Water and Luke was an apprentice at the firm. Luke was a former pupil at Bradley Stoke Community School in Bristol and had recently started an apprenticeship at the plant. In a post on Facebook, the school said it was ""shocked and saddened"" to hear of the ""tragic passing of our former student Luke Wheaton"". ""Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this time,"" it added. North Bristol Rugby Football Club also paid tribute to the teenager on Twitter, saying his death was ""absolutely heartbreaking"". ""Such terribly sad news that one of our Colts, Luke Wheaton was tragically lost in the accident in Avonmouth yesterday morning,"" it said. ""All of our love and thoughts to Luke's family, team mates, coaches and everyone else that knew him."" Flowers have been laid at the scene A witness reported hearing a ""very loud explosion"" that ""shook buildings"" and another said they saw about 10 ambulances driving to the scene. Avon and Somerset Police declared a major incident in the immediate aftermath. Supt Simon Brickwood said he wanted to ""extend my heartfelt sympathies to the families of those involved"". ""We appreciate the impact this incident has had on the local community and we thank those affected for their patience while our investigative work is carried out,"" he said. ""This is likely to be ongoing for some time and we will be keeping the victims' families informed throughout."" Formal identification of the victims is yet to take place and post-mortem examinations are under way, police said. Investigators are due to speak to the fifth victim when it is appropriate to do so. The blast happened in a silo that treated biosolids On Thursday, Avon Fire and Rescue Service described the scene of the incident as ""very challenging"". Search and rescue dogs were drafted in to locate casualties following the blast. Colin Skellett, chief executive of Wessex Water, said the firm was ""absolutely devastated"" by what had happened. ""Our hearts go out to the family, friends and colleagues of those who lost their lives during the tragic event on Thursday,"" he said. ""I know from the thoughts and comments I have received from so many, that this has affected the whole Wessex Water family. ""We are determined to find out what happened and why and we will work with the relevant authorities to do just that.""

Biosolids are ""treated sludge"", a by-product of the sewage treatment process. According to Wessex Water, the sludge is treated in anaerobic digesters, oxygen-free tanks, to produce agricultural fertiliser and renewable energy. Police said a cordon at the site was likely to remain in place for several days while the blast is investigated by a team of chemical and mechanical experts, who are working with the HSE. Giles Hyder, HSE's head of operations in the South West, said: ""We send our deepest condolences to the families of those who tragically died. It is important a joint investigation is carried out.

Cause of blast that killed four investigatedThree employees and a contractor were killed in the blast at a water recycling centre in Avonmouth.Bristol,"A witness reported hearing a ""very loud explosion"" at the works in Avonmouth Investigations are continuing into what caused an explosion at a waste water treatment works that killed four people. Three employees of Wessex Water and a contractor were killed in the blast at a water recycling centre in Kings Weston Lane, Avonmouth, on Thursday. The explosion happened at 11:20 GMT in a silo that held treated biosolids. Wessex Water said it was ""absolutely devastated"" and was working with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). A fifth injured person is not thought to be in a life-threatening condition. This video can not be played Avonmouth explosion eyewitness describes the search for missing people Fire crews described a ""very challenging"" scene and used search and rescue dogs in the hunt for casualties following the blast. Colin Skellett, chief executive of Wessex Water, said the company was working with the HSE ""to understand what happened and why"". Biosolids are ""treated sludge"" - a by-product of the sewage treatment process. Wessex Water says the sludge is treated in anaerobic digesters - oxygen-free tanks - to produce agricultural fertiliser and renewable energy. According to Wessex Water, during the sewage treatment process debris is first removed using screens. The sewage flows into tanks where the solids sink to the bottom and are removed as sludge. The sewage is then treated biologically with bacteria that clean the water. Bristol-based waste management service GENeco says biosolids provide a ""cost-effective alternative to bagged fertiliser"". Biosolids can produce flammable methane gas when treated with bacteria, though police could not comment as to whether this was the cause of the explosion. Ch Insp Mark Runacres, from Avon and Somerset Police, said the explosion was not being treated as terror-related and there were not thought to be any ongoing public safety concerns. GMB, the union for Wessex Water workers, has sent ""hopes and prayers"" to the colleagues and families of the four people killed. John Phillips, GMB regional secretary, said it was a ""terrible tragedy"". ""This is another stark reminder of the absolute need to ensure people are able to work in environments where risks to their health and safety are properly controlled,"" he said. ""Whilst the cause of this tragedy is not yet known, it is essential that a full and thorough investigation takes place at the appropriate time."" Flowers have been laid at the scene Unite regional secretary for the south west Steve Preddy said three of its members working at the site were in a ""state of shock"". ""One was on site and nearby and witnessed much of what took place, but he is safe and well,"" he said. ""We have been in touch personally with our other members too, who are thankfully all safe and well, but obviously deeply disturbed and emotionally upset by what has happened."" Darren Jones, MP for Bristol North West, said it was ""the most tragic case in many generations"" to have happened at Avonmouth. He added he will be calling the HSE, the Environment Agency and others ""to ensure that lessons are being learnt so that these situations that shouldn't happen in first place don't happen again"". One witness to the aftermath described hearing a ""boom and echo"" which shook the ground, followed by ""a lot of commotion"". Sean Nolan said: ""It was quite short-lived, I'd say about two or three seconds. Sort of a boom and echo and then it just went quiet. ""That was it. There was no smoke, there was no after-effects of it."" Bristol City Mayor Marvin Rees said the ""thoughts of our city"" were with the families of those who had died. ""This has already been such a challenging year, and this news of further loss of life is another terrible blow. As a city we will mourn for them,"" he added. Are you in the area?

"First doses of Covid-19 vaccine arrive in BelfastThe first administration of the vaccine could happen early next week, BBC News NI understands.Northern Ireland","The first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine have arrived in Northern Ireland. Nearly 25,000 doses arrived in Belfast on Friday - it is hoped it will be the first of several deliveries this month. Health Minister Robin Swann said confirmation of which groups will get the vaccine first is due next week. There will be dummy runs at various locations, but it has been confirmed the first administration of the vaccine will be on Tuesday morning. How will the Covid-19 vaccine be rolled out in NI? Mr Swann said there was ""a long journey ahead of us but we can be optimistic"". He added: ""Vaccinators will be the first to receive the vaccine, followed swiftly by priority groups. ""We are being guided on prioritisation by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. ""It has identified care home residents and staff and health and social care workers as priority groups."" Distribution of the vaccine would be ""a massive logistical challenge"", particularly in terms of rolling it out in care homes, added the health minister. Another six people in Northern Ireland have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the Department of Health's recorded total of deaths to 1,032. Another 449 people have tested positive for the virus. In the Republic of Ireland six more Covid-19-related deaths were recorded, taking the country's overall tally to 2,086. Irish health officials also reported that another 265 people have tested positive. The arrival of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Northern Ireland is a massive box ticked. But it doesn't just magic the virus away and some people might see the vaccine as an excuse to forget about the restrictions. Given the existing two-week lockdown, the authorities anticipate that number of new infections will decline ever so slightly or remain stable until shortly before Christmas. But with more of us out and about and mixing they are sure to rise again. It is understood that if the so-called R-number can be maintained at 1.6 or below then intervention would not be required until the end of December or beginning of January. However, if it was to rise as high as 1.8 then intervention would be required, possibly at end of December. All of this depends on our behaviour and how closely we practice the Covid-19 guidelines. To vaccinate care home residents in Northern Ireland, 12,000 doses of the vaccine are required. The problem facing those responsible for rolling out the vaccination scheme is how to deliver it to care homes safely and effectively. It is thought the seven vaccination centres that have been earmarked, including leisure centres and hospitals, will be used to roll out the vaccine to those care homes which are located nearby. This video can not be played What will the vaccination process look like? The vaccine must be stored at around -70C and will be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. On Wednesday the UK regulator the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe. It is thought Northern Ireland will receive about 1.5 million doses in total. The UK is the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for widespread use. Patricia Donnelly, who is leading the vaccine rollout programme in Northern Ireland, said the fact the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had to be stored at a very low temperature and came in large packs meant it was more practical to take the people receiving it to larger centres. ""We hope that we will start to deploy it next week - we're aiming for early in the week but we can't confirm that until we have all our final arrangments in place,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra. ""Because we don't have a limitless supply of the vaccine we're also looking at where our priorities are for this. ""Next week we have a definite plan to vaccinate the vaccinators.""

"Virus levels 'falling across most of England'Infection levels are down among all age groups and all regions apart from one, data suggests.HealthComments","The percentage of people testing positive for the coronavirus has fallen in all English regions except the North East,according to the Office for National Statistics,external. In the week to 28 November, one in 105 people in England had the virus compared with one in 85 a week before. Meanwhile, the R number for the UK has fallen to between 0.8 and 1 - the second week running it's been below 1. This measures virus reproduction rate, suggesting the epidemic is shrinking. The UK government says it's ""absolutely confident"" it will have 800,000 doses of a Covid vaccineto begin vaccination next week. The first delivery arrived in the UK on Thursday. The ONS figures are based on swab tests of thousands of people in UK households whether they have symptoms or not. It is one source of data used by the government's scientific advisers to estimate the R number of the virus and how fast it is spreading. They estimatethe R number is currently below 1,external, which means the number of people an average infected person passes the virus onto is less than one. It's also the first time since September that advisers believe there's a good chance infections are falling in every region in England. England's second lockdown, which lasted for nearly a month, ended on Wednesday. ""It is clear that on a national level, the lockdown has had the predicted effect,"" says Prof James Naismith from the University of Oxford. He added: ""We are currently on the downward slope of the second wave. The lower we get the daily number of infections, the less risk the Christmas relaxation poses."" Elsewhere in the UK, where different levels of restrictions have been in place in over the past month, the picture is more mixed. ""We are seeing early signs of decreasing levels in Scotland whilst infections in Northern Ireland have been continuing to decline since October,"" said Katherine Kent, who analysed data from the ONS infection survey. But she added: ""The level of infections appears to have stopped decreasing in Wales recently."" Further restrictions are being introduced there on Fridayafter a rise in cases across the country. At the end of November, the ONS estimates the number of people infected was equivalent to: 1 in 190 in Northern Ireland 1 in 170 in Wales 1 in 130 in Scotland 1 in 105 in England In England, the ONS says infection levels are falling in all age groups but remain highest in children of secondary school age. The percentage of people testing positive is highest in the North East, North West, and Yorkshire and the Humber regions.

Cause of blast that killed four investigated,"A witness reported hearing a ""very loud explosion"" at the works in Avonmouth Investigations are continuing into what caused an explosion at a waste water treatment works that killed four people. Three employees of Wessex Water and a contractor were killed in the blast at a water recycling centre in Kings Weston Lane, Avonmouth, on Thursday. The explosion happened at 11:20 GMT in a silo that held treated biosolids. Wessex Water said it was ""absolutely devastated"" and was working with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). A fifth injured person is not thought to be in a life-threatening condition. This video can not be played Avonmouth explosion eyewitness describes the search for missing people Fire crews described a ""very challenging"" scene and used search and rescue dogs in the hunt for casualties following the blast. Colin Skellett, chief executive of Wessex Water, said the company was working with the HSE ""to understand what happened and why"". Biosolids are ""treated sludge"" - a by-product of the sewage treatment process. Wessex Water says the sludge is treated in anaerobic digesters - oxygen-free tanks - to produce agricultural fertiliser and renewable energy. According to Wessex Water, during the sewage treatment process debris is first removed using screens. The sewage flows into tanks where the solids sink to the bottom and are removed as sludge. The sewage is then treated biologically with bacteria that clean the water. Bristol-based waste management service GENeco says biosolids provide a ""cost-effective alternative to bagged fertiliser"". Biosolids can produce flammable methane gas when treated with bacteria, though police could not comment as to whether this was the cause of the explosion. Ch Insp Mark Runacres, from Avon and Somerset Police, said the explosion was not being treated as terror-related and there were not thought to be any ongoing public safety concerns. GMB, the union for Wessex Water workers, has sent ""hopes and prayers"" to the colleagues and families of the four people killed. John Phillips, GMB regional secretary, said it was a ""terrible tragedy"". ""This is another stark reminder of the absolute need to ensure people are able to work in environments where risks to their health and safety are properly controlled,"" he said. ""Whilst the cause of this tragedy is not yet known, it is essential that a full and thorough investigation takes place at the appropriate time."" Flowers have been laid at the scene Unite regional secretary for the south west Steve Preddy said three of its members working at the site were in a ""state of shock"". ""One was on site and nearby and witnessed much of what took place, but he is safe and well,"" he said. ""We have been in touch personally with our other members too, who are thankfully all safe and well, but obviously deeply disturbed and emotionally upset by what has happened."" Darren Jones, MP for Bristol North West, said it was ""the most tragic case in many generations"" to have happened at Avonmouth. He added he will be calling the HSE, the Environment Agency and others ""to ensure that lessons are being learnt so that these situations that shouldn't happen in first place don't happen again"". One witness to the aftermath described hearing a ""boom and echo"" which shook the ground, followed by ""a lot of commotion"". Sean Nolan said: ""It was quite short-lived, I'd say about two or three seconds. Sort of a boom and echo and then it just went quiet. ""That was it. There was no smoke, there was no after-effects of it."" Bristol City Mayor Marvin Rees said the ""thoughts of our city"" were with the families of those who had died. ""This has already been such a challenging year, and this news of further loss of life is another terrible blow. As a city we will mourn for them,"" he added. Are you in the area?

First people to be vaccinated in Wales on Tuesday,"This video can not be played Covid: 'People living alone won't be left alone' The first people to get the coronavirus vaccine in Wales will get the jab on Tuesday, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved by regulators on Wednesday and supplies have already started to arrive in the UK. Front-line NHS staff and the over 80s are at the top of the list for the vaccine. Care home residents are also among those identified as a priority. It comes asnew rules stopping pubs, restaurants and cafesserving alcohol on the premises come into force at 18:00 GMT on Friday. Wales 'must act now' insists health minister UK 'confident' of having 800,000 vaccine doses by next week Meanwhile, the first minister confirmed a single person, single parent or someone with caring responsibilities can join a bubble at Christmas. Between 23 and 27 December, three households from around the UK can join together and the single person would be in addition to those. Wales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton previously saidgetting the vaccines to care homes was a ""work in progress""and ""very difficult"" to do because it needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C. Speaking at the Welsh Government's briefing, Mr Drakeford said: ""Our plans in Wales have been thoroughly tested. ""We expect to receive the first supplies in the next couple of days. ""We have trained staff to give the new vaccine."" The first minister said a ""precautionary approach"" would be taken He said he hoped it would mark ""a turning point in the pandemic"" and ""put us on what is going to be a long path back to normality"". However, he did say his government will take a ""precautionary approach"" to lifting Covid-19 restrictions ""until we have a sufficient number of people vaccinated"". ""Even with the vaccines that are coming our way fastest, you have to have two doses of them three weeks apart, and they are not effective until after the second dose,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""So even those people who will be vaccinated in Wales in December will not see the benefit of that vaccine until into the new year."" Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Paul Davies called for Mr Drakeford to appoint a vaccines minister to ensure the process went smoothly. The vaccine was ""giving people hope at the end of a very dark tunnel"", he said. Mr Davies added: ""What's important now is that we see the roll out of the vaccine will take place as soon as possible and that's why I think it's important that the Welsh Government have a specific minister responsible for the rollout of this vaccine, making sure this vaccine now rolls out across Wales over the next few months.""

Sir Ian McKellen backs bid to buy Tolkien house,"The large detached brick property was built in the 1920s Sir Ian McKellen has backed a campaign to buy the house where author JRR Tolkien once lived. The actor, who played Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings movie franchise, hopes a ""fellowship"" of fans will come together to raise Â£4.5m. The crowdfunding campaign, called Project Northmoor, was set up by author Julia Golding to preserve the house for future generations. It has also been backed by actor Martin Freeman who starred in The Hobbit. They are joined by Annie Lennox, who wrote and performed an Oscar winning song for The Return of the King, Middle Earth illustrator John Howe, as well as actors John Rhys-Davies and Sir Derek Jacobi. Tolkien is believed to have written The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings at the house, which was home to the writer and his family from 1930 until 1947. The six-bedroom home in Northmoor Road, Oxford, is largely unchanged since it was built in 1924. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Time running out as Brexit trade talks restart,"EU negotiator Michel Barnier is staying in London for talks, rather than returning to Brussels, as planned The UK and the EU have resumed talks on post-Brexit trade in London, with time running out to achieve a deal. A senior UK government source said the prospects of a breakthrough were ""receding"" and accused the EU of making ""11th-hour"" demands. But a Brussels source denied this, with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier calling Friday an ""important day"". Both sides have to agree and ratify any deal by 31 December, when the current rules on EU-UK trade end. If they do not, they will do business on World Trade Organization rules, meaning the introduction of tariffs, or taxes on imports. Kuenssberg: Have talks taken a turn for the worse? What happens next with Brexit? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is a level playing field? The negotiating teams are seeking compromises in key areas - including fishing rights and business competition rule - in time for EU leaders to discuss them at a summit scheduled for Thursday. And, rather than returning to Brussels as planned on Friday, Mr Barnier is staying in London to continue discussions. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Business Secretary Alok Sharma told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the talks were ""in a difficult phase"". He added that the UK must be recognised as ""a sovereign and independent nation"" and it was ""on the basis of that that a deal will be done"". This video can not be played Business Secretary Alok Sharma said ""time is short"" on Brexit negotiations Fishing rights remain a major area of contention between the UK and France - one of the EU's most powerful members. France's Europe minister, Clement Beaune, warned that his government could ""veto"" any deal reached between the UK and EU, if it did not satisfy his country's demands. But European Council President Charles Michel urged the EU's 27 member states to maintain ""unity"" as negotiations continue. With Brexit, talks don't just go to the wire. They go beyond it. Remember, the UK left the EU nearly a year after it was intended. So the fact it's taking this long to reach a trade deal shouldn't come as a shock. But there really is pressure in the next few days to declare ""deal or no deal"". On Monday, the Internal Market Bill returns to the Commons. It would allow the UK to sidestep aspects of the agreement that was reached to leave the EU - and break international law in a ""limited and specific way"". Brussels has warned the government that this could scupper a trade deal. That aside, any deal would have to be ready before EU leaders are invited to sign it off at a summit on Thursday. It doesn't augur well that the UK and EU are even disagreeing about their disagreements. The government says Brussels has hardened its position on how competition rules are policed; the EU counters that it has made no new demands. But it's not surprising that both sides are crying ""ouch"" as the thorniest issues are now being grasped. But while No 10 talks of ""setbacks"", it hasn't yet said negotiations have broken down. While discussions between both sides continue, the prospect of a deal is still possible. Any deal would have to be signed off by the European and UK Parliaments before it can come into force. It could also require eventual ratification in the 27 EU national parliaments, depending on the contents. The UK and EU have been in negotiation since March to determine their future relations once the UK's Brexit transition period - under which it still follows most of the EU's rules - ends in less than four weeks' time. Fishing is a tiny part of the overall economy on both sides of the Channel, but it has a political importance which allows it to punch well above its weight in these negotiations. It was a big part of the Leave campaign in the run-up to the Brexit referendum in 2016, and it is a totemic issue for those who argue that national sovereignty must be fully regained. But it's a sensitive issue in other countries as well. French President Emmanuel Macron will want to win regions with big fishing communities in the next presidential election in 2022. And any proposed deal needs the agreement of all EU countries - it can't just be signed off by the European Commission. Read more here What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks?

Care home testing paused over safety concerns,"Greater Manchester councils have become the latest to pause rapid testing for care home visitors over concerns they fail to detect enough infections. Data suggests the rapid kits miss about a third of the most infectious cases picked up by conventional lab tests. Lateral flow tests are being used in England so residents can see family indoors for the first time since March. The government has described rapid testing as way of reducing, rather than eliminating, risk. The rapid lateral flow tests work by taking a nose and throat swab, shaking it in fluid until any viral particles come off, and then dropping the fluid onto a plastic stick - a bit like a pregnancy test. They take about half an hour to show a result - one line on the paper strip means the test has worked and two lines means virus is present. Their speed, and the fact they don't need to be taken to a lab, mean these tests - in theory - can be used to make on-the-spot decisions such as deciding if someone can go into premises like a care home or event venue. Manchester's decision follows similar assessments elsewhere. Sheffield has paused lateral flow tests for care home visits which it considers how best to use them. In Liverpool, visitors are permitted inside but they have to take multiple tests. Similar solutions are being considered around Greater Manchester. A standard coronavirus test - also known as a PCR test - misses fewer than 5% of infections. It was already known that lateral flow tests were less sensitive - they miss about 50% of infections overall. But lab tests had suggested that figure could fall to 5% when a high level of virus was present. The government had argued that the tests were therefore as effective as PCR tests at picking up people with the most virus in their systems - those most likely to be currently infectious. However, data published from the Liverpool testing pilot suggests that when it comes to people with higher viral loads, rapid tests only pick up seven infections for every 10 picked up by a PCR test. This means about a third of the most potentially infectious people could be told they were free of the virus. This could be even lower if the tests were conducted by non-clinically trained people. There are different uses for rapid tests. When mass testing was piloted in Liverpool, about 1,000 coronavirus cases were picked up in people without symptoms who would not otherwise have been tested. Even if the rapid tests only pick up half of cases, those are all extra cases that wouldn't have been found and so, in a sense, are all a win. There is some concern that people may change their behaviour as a result of a negative test, perhaps stopping social distancing. It's not yet know how big a problem that might be. The main aim of that type of testing is to act on positive results, asking those detected to quarantine, but also telling people with a negative result to continue to keep to the guidance as normal. According to Prof Jon Deeks at the University of Birmingham, the bigger problem is when rapid tests are used to make decisions based on a negative result. That includes care home visits, or university students who feel free to mingle with other households based on a negative test. ""There is a difference [between] mass testing to 'break chains of transmission', where any true positive result is a gain - in that case it doesn't matter too much that you miss some people - and testing to 'be safe', where the focus is on whether the negative result is trustworthy,"" he explained. Those potentially false negative results could be used to make a dangerous decision - for example, relatives may then hug a loved one in a care home who is at high risk, potentially infecting them and other vulnerable residents. A Greater Manchester spokesperson said: ""We're committed to facilitating care home visiting, we know how important it is to relatives and residents who have waited so long for this, but we also want to ensure we get this right and do it as safely as possible. ""We now have the government guidance, as well as the recommendations from our own testing expert group, and our directors of public health, adult social care leads and care homes are all working together to get things in place as fast as we can."" Dr Angela Raffle at the University of Bristol, who has also worked for the UK National Screening Programmes, said people with expertise in whole-population testing hadn't had input into the government's plans. Screening healthy populations can cause harm, for example ""people who test negative may be falsely reassured and you could actually increase transmission"", she told the BBC. Like so many things in the pandemic, this is about balancing risks and benefits. For some care home residents, a lack of visits has caused great distress and according to some families, a worsening of their health.

Lidl joins shops in repaying Covid rates reliefRetailers have so far committed to handing back Â£1.9bn after some faced criticism from MPs.BusinessComments,"Lidl will join other supermarkets to repay more than Â£100m of business rates relief it received during the pandemic. The firm's UK boss said the company felt it was ""the right thing to do"". It followssimilar moves by the UK biggest grocersincluding Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, and will see more than Â£1.9bn handed back to taxpayers. Some retailers, whose sales have boomed during the crisis, have been criticised for taking government help while paying dividends to shareholders. Christian HÃ¤rtnagel, chief executive of Lidl GB, said: ""The business rates relief that was provided to us, and the rest of the supermarket sector, came with a lot of responsibility that we took extremely seriously. ""We've been considering this for some time, and we are now in a position to confirm that we will be refunding this money as we believe it is the right thing to do."" Asda joins rivals to pay back Covid rates relief Supermarkets repay rates relief after backlash In March, all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England were given a business rates holiday for 12 months to help them get through the crisis. However, shops deemed ""essential"" by the government, such as supermarkets, were allowed to stay open during lockdown. In a statement, Lidl said that it had incurred Covid-related costs from recruiting 2,500 temporary staff, increasing stock levels and introduce protective, plastic screens at checkouts. But, it has taken the decision to repay the rates relief due to strong customer footfall. Others, including Morrisons, Aldi, Asda, Pets at Home and B&M, have also pledged to repay the rates relief, citing strong sales during Covid. Several retailers have been criticised for accepting the payments from government and then handing out dividends to shareholders. Tesco came under fire in April for handing investors Â£900m in dividends despite receiving the tax break from the government. Labour MP Rushanara Ali, who is also a member of the Treasury Select Committee, described the tax break as ""completely disproportionate"" and ""an absolute scandal"". Tesco chairman John Allan previously said he would 'defend to the death' a decision to pay dividends In October, Tesco's chairman John Allan said he would""defend to the death"" the board's decision to pay a dividend,externaland that he didn't ""remotely feel any sort of guilt over it"". This week Tesco said it would repay Â£585m in business rates relief. It was swiftly followed by the UK's other big grocers. Meanwhile, former retail chief Bill Grimsey has written to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, asking that the returned funds should be used to support for smaller businesses and struggling High Streets. He writes: ""What the rate relief episode has proved beyond doubt is that a good proportion of Britain's biggest businesses do not need generous tax breaks. ""The public are not happy to see them paying big dividends to shareholders with taxpayers' money,"" he said. A spokesperson for HM Treasury said: ""We've been clear throughout the pandemic that businesses should use our support appropriately, and we welcome any decision to repay support where it is no longer needed."" On Friday, Pets at Home also announced that it would repay in full the Â£28.9m in rates relief it had received. Peter Pritchard, chief executive of Pets at Home, said that the cash had helped the firm take the decision to keep its stores, online operations and veterinary practices open during the pandemic. The firm is classed as an essential retailer and its shops were allowed to stay open during lockdown restrictions. Pets at Home announced it will hand back Â£28.9m in business rates relief Pets at Home's sales between April and October rose by 5.1% to Â£574.4m while pre-tax profit grew by more than 14% to Â£38.9m. The strong trading prompted the retailer to pay a 2.5p dividend, worth Â£12.4m, despite having received business rates relief. On Friday, Mr Pritchard said Pets at Home ""is a robust business, both operationally and financially"" and its decision to return the business rates relief ""demonstrates our clear commitment to acting responsibly and treating all of our stakeholders fairly"". He added that the repayment meant that the Â£35m in Covid-related costs, such as implementing new safety measures in its grooming salons, it has been forced to pay would no longer be off-set by the relief it had received. The company will also be shutting its stores on Boxing Day, costing an estimated Â£3m in sales, to give its staff ""a rest"".

Care home testing paused over safety concernsThe rapid tests picked up five infections out of every 10 found by conventional lab tests.Health,"Greater Manchester councils have become the latest to pause rapid testing for care home visitors over concerns they fail to detect enough infections. Data suggests the rapid kits miss about a third of the most infectious cases picked up by conventional lab tests. Lateral flow tests are being used in England so residents can see family indoors for the first time since March. The government has described rapid testing as way of reducing, rather than eliminating, risk. The rapid lateral flow tests work by taking a nose and throat swab, shaking it in fluid until any viral particles come off, and then dropping the fluid onto a plastic stick - a bit like a pregnancy test. They take about half an hour to show a result - one line on the paper strip means the test has worked and two lines means virus is present. Their speed, and the fact they don't need to be taken to a lab, mean these tests - in theory - can be used to make on-the-spot decisions such as deciding if someone can go into premises like a care home or event venue. Manchester's decision follows similar assessments elsewhere. Sheffield has paused lateral flow tests for care home visits which it considers how best to use them. In Liverpool, visitors are permitted inside but they have to take multiple tests. Similar solutions are being considered around Greater Manchester. A standard coronavirus test - also known as a PCR test - misses fewer than 5% of infections. It was already known that lateral flow tests were less sensitive - they miss about 50% of infections overall. But lab tests had suggested that figure could fall to 5% when a high level of virus was present. The government had argued that the tests were therefore as effective as PCR tests at picking up people with the most virus in their systems - those most likely to be currently infectious. However, data published from the Liverpool testing pilot suggests that when it comes to people with higher viral loads, rapid tests only pick up seven infections for every 10 picked up by a PCR test. This means about a third of the most potentially infectious people could be told they were free of the virus. This could be even lower if the tests were conducted by non-clinically trained people. There are different uses for rapid tests. When mass testing was piloted in Liverpool, about 1,000 coronavirus cases were picked up in people without symptoms who would not otherwise have been tested. Even if the rapid tests only pick up half of cases, those are all extra cases that wouldn't have been found and so, in a sense, are all a win. There is some concern that people may change their behaviour as a result of a negative test, perhaps stopping social distancing. It's not yet know how big a problem that might be. The main aim of that type of testing is to act on positive results, asking those detected to quarantine, but also telling people with a negative result to continue to keep to the guidance as normal. According to Prof Jon Deeks at the University of Birmingham, the bigger problem is when rapid tests are used to make decisions based on a negative result. That includes care home visits, or university students who feel free to mingle with other households based on a negative test. ""There is a difference [between] mass testing to 'break chains of transmission', where any true positive result is a gain - in that case it doesn't matter too much that you miss some people - and testing to 'be safe', where the focus is on whether the negative result is trustworthy,"" he explained. Those potentially false negative results could be used to make a dangerous decision - for example, relatives may then hug a loved one in a care home who is at high risk, potentially infecting them and other vulnerable residents. A Greater Manchester spokesperson said: ""We're committed to facilitating care home visiting, we know how important it is to relatives and residents who have waited so long for this, but we also want to ensure we get this right and do it as safely as possible. ""We now have the government guidance, as well as the recommendations from our own testing expert group, and our directors of public health, adult social care leads and care homes are all working together to get things in place as fast as we can."" Dr Angela Raffle at the University of Bristol, who has also worked for the UK National Screening Programmes, said people with expertise in whole-population testing hadn't had input into the government's plans. Screening healthy populations can cause harm, for example ""people who test negative may be falsely reassured and you could actually increase transmission"", she told the BBC. Like so many things in the pandemic, this is about balancing risks and benefits. For some care home residents, a lack of visits has caused great distress and according to some families, a worsening of their health. No test is 100% effective, and lateral flow tests are considerably less than that. Some councils are trialling different ways of using them, for example asking visitors to take a PCR test a week before the visit and a rapid test on the day. Dr Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser to Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace, described the tests as an ""additional tool in helping us detect Covid-19 cases that we wouldn't otherwise know about"".

Wales 'must act now' to curb Covid spread,"In Wales people are still out and about shopping, but what is happening over the border? Wales ""could not suppress coronavirus"" after its firebreak lockdown and must act now, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has insisted. It comes as new national restrictions come into force in Wales later to try and curb the spread of Covid-19. New rules include a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol on the premises. They come in to force at 18:00 GMT and will be reviewed on 17 December, ahead ofUK-wide rules over Christmas. The Welsh Government faced a backlash for the new rules from business owners and other political parties. Plaid Cymru said hospitality was ""paying the price"" for a lack of stricter measuresafter the firebreak lockdown ended on 9 November. The Conservative leader in the Senedd, Paul Davies, said the national approach was unfair on areas with low Covid rates. But speaking on Friday, Mr Gething said without action, more people would die. Cases ""would rise"" without the rules, said Vaughan Gething ""This is really about the fact we couldn't suppress coronavirus after the firebreak, and we then have a responsibility as a government,"" Mr Gething toldBBC Breakfast. ""We either act, and act in way we know causes harm, or we don't act in this way and we accept much greater harm and much great loss of life that could be avoided."" The health minister said coronavirus cases went down duringthe 17-day firebreak lockdown in October and Novemberbut cases have now ""gone up and up"". The case rate is currently 237.9 case per 100,000 in Wales, higher than before the firebreak. Meanwhile, the latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests infections have stopped falling in Wales. The ONS takesthroat and nose swab tests from more than 19,500 people at random in Wales over six weeks.,external From the results, it can estimate that 18,100 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 28 November, 1,700 more than the week before. This is one in 170 people or 0.60% of the population. The ONS said ""our modelling suggests, in the most recent week, the percentage of those testing positive is no longer decreasing in Wales"". Mr Gething added: ""I don't enjoy these measures having to be introduced, but if we don't we can be confident - terribly confident, I'm afraid - that cases would rise and more of our people would not be here."" The Welsh Government has said the decision to stop bars and pubs serving alcoholwas backed by evidence it has published from its scientific advisors,external, and supported by evidence from the UK advisory groupsSage,external. Q&A: Can people from Wales go to England to drink? What is the evidence for new hospitality rules? How many more Covid deaths in Wales? People will now be able to travel between Wales and England'stier one and two areas again, after a ban on non-essential travel was put in place following the firebreak lockdown ending on 9 November. Travel into tier three zones is still prohibited Licensed pubs, cafes and restaurantswill have to stop serving alcohol. Those with an off-licence can sell alcoholic drinks to take away. They will have to close at 18:00 every day until further notice but can operate a takeaway service for food and drink after 18:00 However, the rule allowingfour people from four different householdsto meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place Only people you have formed an extended household (or bubble) with can come into your home, except in very limited circumstances, such as tradespeople having to undertake work Cinemas, bowling alleys, bingo halls, soft-play areas, casinos, museums, galleries and heritage sites, and other indoor entertainment venues will be forced to shut - outdoor visitor attractions will not be affected International travel will be permitted again but the government advises against it unless ""essential"". People will also be subject toexisting 14-day quarantine rules on return, depending on where you've been. The Welsh Government said it would provide an extra Â£340m to support businesses affected by the tougher restrictions One venue has had less than a week to take their annual Christmas event outside Simon Pickard, owner of Silver Mountain Experience in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, said the situation was ""ongoing and difficult"", having closed a large number of the activities they offer, including the over and underground tours, and would now have to move their Christmas event outside He said he was still unsure what the restrictions would be on 17 December and had incurred costs for outdoor equipment at a time when income was low. ""We lost all our business in the October half-term from the firebreak lockdown, which was a real first blow. We were promised everything would open up for Christmas and now we're in the same situation."" He called the rules disproportionate and said they were not reflective of the situation in Wales. ""We understand the health issues as everyone does but we feel that the restrictions have not been targeted to the right areas and not based on any real science. It has felt like a knee-jerk reaction.""

First people to be vaccinated in Wales on TuesdaySupplies of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine have already started to arrive in the UK.WalesComments,"This video can not be played Covid: 'People living alone won't be left alone' The first people to get the coronavirus vaccine in Wales will get the jab on Tuesday, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved by regulators on Wednesday and supplies have already started to arrive in the UK. Front-line NHS staff and the over 80s are at the top of the list for the vaccine. Care home residents are also among those identified as a priority. It comes asnew rules stopping pubs, restaurants and cafesserving alcohol on the premises come into force at 18:00 GMT on Friday. Wales 'must act now' insists health minister UK 'confident' of having 800,000 vaccine doses by next week Meanwhile, the first minister confirmed a single person, single parent or someone with caring responsibilities can join a bubble at Christmas. Between 23 and 27 December, three households from around the UK can join together and the single person would be in addition to those. Wales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton previously saidgetting the vaccines to care homes was a ""work in progress""and ""very difficult"" to do because it needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C. Speaking at the Welsh Government's briefing, Mr Drakeford said: ""Our plans in Wales have been thoroughly tested. ""We expect to receive the first supplies in the next couple of days. ""We have trained staff to give the new vaccine."" The first minister said a ""precautionary approach"" would be taken He said he hoped it would mark ""a turning point in the pandemic"" and ""put us on what is going to be a long path back to normality"". However, he did say his government will take a ""precautionary approach"" to lifting Covid-19 restrictions ""until we have a sufficient number of people vaccinated"". ""Even with the vaccines that are coming our way fastest, you have to have two doses of them three weeks apart, and they are not effective until after the second dose,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""So even those people who will be vaccinated in Wales in December will not see the benefit of that vaccine until into the new year."" Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Paul Davies called for Mr Drakeford to appoint a vaccines minister to ensure the process went smoothly. The vaccine was ""giving people hope at the end of a very dark tunnel"", he said. Mr Davies added: ""What's important now is that we see the roll out of the vaccine will take place as soon as possible and that's why I think it's important that the Welsh Government have a specific minister responsible for the rollout of this vaccine, making sure this vaccine now rolls out across Wales over the next few months.""

Where are the virus hotspots among older people?,"When deciding what lockdown tiers an area should be in, scientists looked closely at the number of cases in over-60s Controversial restrictions came into place in England this week, as a month-long lockdown ended. Areas have been placed in one of three tiers. But how was it decided which tier was right for which area? One of the key factors is the rate of coronavirus cases among people over the age of 60. The BBC has analysed the latest figures for areas with both the highest infection rates among the over-60s, and places where the virus is more common in older people than those younger. In the week to 29 NovemberBoston, in Lincolnshire, had the highest number of coronavirus cases among the over-60s, at about 564 per 100,000 people. This was higher than the rate among people under 60, which was about 515 per 100,000 over the same period. Among all cases, the area had the third highest infection rate in England. Lincolnshire moved into Tier 3 when the England-wide lockdown ended on Wednesday. The county seeing the most areas with the highest infection rates in over-60s wasKent. Swale, Gravesham, Thanet and Medway all had more than 300 cases per 100,000 among the over-60s, with Maidstone recording a rate of 247. Coronavirus: Your tributes to those who have died How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? First vaccines 'could cut 99% of deaths' - Van-Tam Most of the areas seeing the highest infection rates in older people have even higher rates in those under 60. However, there have been some places where the opposite was true. East Northamptonshirehad the largest gap between its infection rates among older and younger people. The rate in older people in the week to 28 November was about 207 cases per 100,000 people, nearly double the rate in under-60s of about 106. It is hard to say what causes the virus to spread from one age group to another, as causes can be unique to different parts of the country. Officials said outbreaks in care homes could account for some spikes in older populations but community transmission has also played a large role. The virus has been said to movefrom younger people to oldermore often. This could be partly explained by the high number of people over 60 receiving care from those in younger age groups. However, public health teams said the current figures broadly reflected infections acquired as England entered the second national lockdown and could have been a result oflast-minute excursionsbefore venues such as pubs and non-essential shops closed. The NHS has said although coronavirus can make anyone seriously ill, the risk would increase as patients were older. Older people tend to have more underlying health conditions, or have received treatment that could make them vulnerable. Officials have also voiced concerns about the potential impact on hospital capacity if cases rose among the over-60s. Since the pandemic began many hospitals have had fewer beds available for patients, because of extra safety precautious taken to limit the spread of the virus. In many facilities treatment has been divided into Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 zones. Higher numbers of cases among older people in particular would usually mean increased critical care admissions. The knock-on effect of this would be to further reduce hospital capacity to treat non-Covid-19 patients, as hospitals adjusted to cope with the additional strain. The government's recentcoronavirus impact assessment,externalsaid if the NHS in a part of the country were to be overwhelmed - if an area had more patients that needed critical care than it had capacity for - this could result in deaths that may have been prevented, had there been fewer patients. The government has said it looked at several criteria when deciding on what tiers to put each part of England in following the second national lockdown: Total number of Covid-19 cases in an area The number of cases among over-60s The rate at which cases were rising or falling The proportion of test results coming back positive Pressure on the NHS In its assessment of each area it outlined places where it was concerned about the number of infections among older people. Of the 46 county and wider areas used to assign tiers, 23 were highlighted as having ""high"" or ""very high"" case rates in the over-60s. It based its research on figures covering the two weeks up to 19 November. Coronavirus restrictions are set to be eased around Christmas, allowing people in all tiers to mix with slightly wider circles of family and friends. ""Christmas bubbles"",limited to three households, are due to last from 23-27 December in England. Academics have said seeing friends and family at Christmas may be a real benefit to the mental health of older people during an already difficult time. But the UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has warned people ""have to have sense"" this year and avoid hugging and kissing older relatives ""if you want them to survive to be hugged again"". ""It's not against the law, and that's the whole point. You can do it within the rules that are there,"" he said. ""But it does not make sense because you could be carrying the virus.""

"UK's 68% climate change target a 'huge challenge'The ""ambitious"" target for 2030 would see the UK move faster than any major economy, the PM says.Science & EnvironmentComments","Meeting the UK's world-leading climate change target will be a ""colossal challenge"", a government spending watchdog has warned. The National Audit Office says it will affect the way we work, travel, heat our homes - even how much meat we eat. In a report,externalit says the cost of cutting CO2 is highly uncertain, but the cost of allowing temperatures to rise would probably be greater. The PM has vowed to cut emissions by 68% by 2030 based on 1990 levels. Making the new pledge, Boris Johnson urged other world leaders to follow with ambitious targets at the virtual climate summit he is hosting on 12 December. The announcement has been broadly welcomed, although scientists say it does not guarantee dangerous climate change will be avoided. They urged Mr Johnson to impose policies to back up his ambitions - currently the UK is slipping behind its existing targets.

Achieving the new target, a 68% cut, will require the UK working 50% harder than it currently is. Between 2008 and 2018 the energy sector saw the biggest fall in emissions (-62%) as the UK abandoned coal burning. It's followed by the waste sector (-46%) which started capturing methane emissions, and industry (29%) where efficiency improved. Emissions from transport have barely fallen (-3%). Farm emissions are almost static (-2%). A coalition of green groups is urging the government to reach a 75% cut by 2030. And more radical groups such as Extinction Rebellion say the UK should stop emissions almost completely within a few years to be confident of avoiding climate disaster. Research by the London School of Economics (LSE) found that it is economically feasible for UK emissions to be cut by 72%. The government has not costed the range of measures that would be needed, but experts say more homes will need to switch to low-carbon heating.

The Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which advises government, welcomed the 68% cut, but warned: âThis is more than just a number. âIt should be accompanied by wider climate commitments, including the development of a policy package and net zero strategy to deliver against the UK goal; clear commitments to reduce international aviation and shipping emissions; and greater support for climate finance, particularly for developing countries.â Net zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and balancing any further releases by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.

UK's 68% climate change target a 'huge challenge',"Meeting the UK's world-leading climate change target will be a ""colossal challenge"", a government spending watchdog has warned. The National Audit Office says it will affect the way we work, travel, heat our homes - even how much meat we eat. In a report,externalit says the cost of cutting CO2 is highly uncertain, but the cost of allowing temperatures to rise would probably be greater. The PM has vowed to cut emissions by 68% by 2030 based on 1990 levels. Making the new pledge, Boris Johnson urged other world leaders to follow with ambitious targets at the virtual climate summit he is hosting on 12 December. The announcement has been broadly welcomed, although scientists say it does not guarantee dangerous climate change will be avoided. They urged Mr Johnson to impose policies to back up his ambitions - currently the UK is slipping behind its existing targets. The PM said: âWe have proven we can reduce our emissions and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process â uniting businesses, academics, NGOs and local communities in a common goal to go further and faster to tackle climate change. âToday, we are taking the lead with an ambitious new target to reduce our emissions by 2030 faster than any major economy.

Lidl joins shops in repaying Covid rates relief,"Lidl will join other supermarkets to repay more than Â£100m of business rates relief it received during the pandemic. The firm's UK boss said the company felt it was ""the right thing to do"". It followssimilar moves by the UK biggest grocersincluding Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, and will see more than Â£1.9bn handed back to taxpayers. Some retailers, whose sales have boomed during the crisis, have been criticised for taking government help while paying dividends to shareholders. Christian HÃ¤rtnagel, chief executive of Lidl GB, said: ""The business rates relief that was provided to us, and the rest of the supermarket sector, came with a lot of responsibility that we took extremely seriously. ""We've been considering this for some time, and we are now in a position to confirm that we will be refunding this money as we believe it is the right thing to do."" Asda joins rivals to pay back Covid rates relief Supermarkets repay rates relief after backlash In March, all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England were given a business rates holiday for 12 months to help them get through the crisis. However, shops deemed ""essential"" by the government, such as supermarkets, were allowed to stay open during lockdown. In a statement, Lidl said that it had incurred Covid-related costs from recruiting 2,500 temporary staff, increasing stock levels and introduce protective, plastic screens at checkouts. But, it has taken the decision to repay the rates relief due to strong customer footfall. Others, including Morrisons, Aldi, Asda, Pets at Home and B&M, have also pledged to repay the rates relief, citing strong sales during Covid. Several retailers have been criticised for accepting the payments from government and then handing out dividends to shareholders. Tesco came under fire in April for handing investors Â£900m in dividends despite receiving the tax break from the government. Labour MP Rushanara Ali, who is also a member of the Treasury Select Committee, described the tax break as ""completely disproportionate"" and ""an absolute scandal"". Tesco chairman John Allan previously said he would 'defend to the death' a decision to pay dividends In October, Tesco's chairman John Allan said he would""defend to the death"" the board's decision to pay a dividend,externaland that he didn't ""remotely feel any sort of guilt over it"". This week Tesco said it would repay Â£585m in business rates relief. It was swiftly followed by the UK's other big grocers. Meanwhile, former retail chief Bill Grimsey has written to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, asking that the returned funds should be used to support for smaller businesses and struggling High Streets. He writes: ""What the rate relief episode has proved beyond doubt is that a good proportion of Britain's biggest businesses do not need generous tax breaks. ""The public are not happy to see them paying big dividends to shareholders with taxpayers' money,"" he said. A spokesperson for HM Treasury said: ""We've been clear throughout the pandemic that businesses should use our support appropriately, and we welcome any decision to repay support where it is no longer needed."" On Friday, Pets at Home also announced that it would repay in full the Â£28.9m in rates relief it had received. Peter Pritchard, chief executive of Pets at Home, said that the cash had helped the firm take the decision to keep its stores, online operations and veterinary practices open during the pandemic. The firm is classed as an essential retailer and its shops were allowed to stay open during lockdown restrictions. Pets at Home announced it will hand back Â£28.9m in business rates relief Pets at Home's sales between April and October rose by 5.1% to Â£574.4m while pre-tax profit grew by more than 14% to Â£38.9m. The strong trading prompted the retailer to pay a 2.5p dividend, worth Â£12.4m, despite having received business rates relief. On Friday, Mr Pritchard said Pets at Home ""is a robust business, both operationally and financially"" and its decision to return the business rates relief ""demonstrates our clear commitment to acting responsibly and treating all of our stakeholders fairly"". He added that the repayment meant that the Â£35m in Covid-related costs, such as implementing new safety measures in its grooming salons, it has been forced to pay would no longer be off-set by the relief it had received. The company will also be shutting its stores on Boxing Day, costing an estimated Â£3m in sales, to give its staff ""a rest"".

First doses of Covid-19 vaccine arrive in NI,"The first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine have arrived in Northern Ireland. Nearly 25,000 doses arrived in Belfast on Friday - it is hoped it will be the first of several deliveries this month. Health Minister Robin Swann said confirmation of which groups will get the vaccine first is due next week. There will be dummy runs at various locations, but it has been confirmed the first administration of the vaccine will be on Tuesday morning. How will the Covid-19 vaccine be rolled out in NI? Mr Swann said there was ""a long journey ahead of us but we can be optimistic"". He added: ""Vaccinators will be the first to receive the vaccine, followed swiftly by priority groups. ""We are being guided on prioritisation by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. ""It has identified care home residents and staff and health and social care workers as priority groups."" Distribution of the vaccine would be ""a massive logistical challenge"", particularly in terms of rolling it out in care homes, added the health minister. Another six people in Northern Ireland have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the Department of Health's recorded total of deaths to 1,032. Another 449 people have tested positive for the virus. In the Republic of Ireland six more Covid-19-related deaths were recorded, taking the country's overall tally to 2,086. Irish health officials also reported that another 265 people have tested positive. The arrival of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Northern Ireland is a massive box ticked. But it doesn't just magic the virus away and some people might see the vaccine as an excuse to forget about the restrictions. Given the existing two-week lockdown, the authorities anticipate that number of new infections will decline ever so slightly or remain stable until shortly before Christmas. But with more of us out and about and mixing they are sure to rise again. It is understood that if the so-called R-number can be maintained at 1.6 or below then intervention would not be required until the end of December or beginning of January. However, if it was to rise as high as 1.8 then intervention would be required, possibly at end of December. All of this depends on our behaviour and how closely we practice the Covid-19 guidelines. To vaccinate care home residents in Northern Ireland, 12,000 doses of the vaccine are required. The problem facing those responsible for rolling out the vaccination scheme is how to deliver it to care homes safely and effectively. It is thought the seven vaccination centres that have been earmarked, including leisure centres and hospitals, will be used to roll out the vaccine to those care homes which are located nearby. This video can not be played What will the vaccination process look like? The vaccine must be stored at around -70C and will be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. On Wednesday the UK regulator the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe. It is thought Northern Ireland will receive about 1.5 million doses in total. The UK is the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for widespread use. Patricia Donnelly, who is leading the vaccine rollout programme in Northern Ireland, said the fact the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had to be stored at a very low temperature and came in large packs meant it was more practical to take the people receiving it to larger centres. ""We hope that we will start to deploy it next week - we're aiming for early in the week but we can't confirm that until we have all our final arrangments in place,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra. ""Because we don't have a limitless supply of the vaccine we're also looking at where our priorities are for this. ""Next week we have a definite plan to vaccinate the vaccinators.""

NI businesses welcome relaxed rules for Christmas,"Some coronavirus restrictions are being eased from next Friday The business community has welcomed comments from the first minister that there will be no further Covid-19 restrictions before Christmas. Non-essential retail and some parts of the hospitality sector can reopen next Friday, the NI Executive agreed on Thursday. Pubs that do not serve food will have to remain shut. But health professionals have warned there will be an increase in transmission due to the eased rules. Many hospitality businesses, including restaurants, cafes and hotels, can resume trading but must be closed at 23:00 GMT each day. ""We're trying to make sure people have a good Christmas and can come together in a safe way,"" First Minister Arlene Foster said on Thursday. The DUP leader said guidance would be issued for several sectors so that they could operate safely, and said there was a need to provide more financial support to drink-only pubs. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill described the relaxations as ""measured"" and would allow people to move around ""a bit more freely"", but acknowledged it came with a risk. This video can not be played No further restrictions before Christmas - Foster The executive agreed on Thursday that: Close-contact services such as hairdressers, beauty salons and barbers will be allowed to reopen but only by appointment and with social distancing mitigations in place Social distancing within cafes and restaurants is to be set at 2m (6ft 7in) ""Christmas bubbles"" of three households will not have a limit on the number of people contained in them Churches can resume more services, while weddings and funerals will have their cap of 25 people lifted - instead, a risk assessment will be carried out to determine how many people a venue can safely accommodate Gyms will be able to reopen for individual training but not for classes Indoor sport is also unlikely to be allowed to resume This video can not be played Covid-19: Stormont's key coronavirus moments The chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce welcomed a safe reopening of non-essential retail. Colm Shannon told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme that there will be longer opening times in the area and council staff will be on the high street, to help with the flow of people. He said that ""personal responsibility"" was also important, urging shoppers to ""respect the guidelines that are in place"". ""We have these two weeks now to try and recover some of the grounds but we do need to think about the future as well."" What support is there for my business? First NI Covid vaccinations 'to happen next week' What are the lockdown rules where you live? Northern Ireland Hotels Federation chief executive Janice Gault said that hotels would reopen ""in a responsible manner with the health of guests and staff to the fore"". ""Christmas is a vital trading period for the hotel industry with many guests checking in with their families over the festive season,"" she said. ""This year will be different, but hotels are determined that those who arrive will have an excellent experience after what has been a very difficult year for everyone."" Londonderry hotel director Ciaran O'Neill said he was ""surprised but glad"" at the decision. ""Stormont have finally decided to give us proper notice on this and give us a week to reopen,"" said Mr O'Neill. ""We have been taking bookings with asterixis now for about six weeks so every week we have to ring people to cancel or move their booking to a different date."" However, Mr O'Neill said his hotel is still operating ""under 50% capacity"", adding ""we need to be mindful of that"". But owners of drink-only pubs have criticised the executive for the decision to keep them shut. West Belfast bar owner Gerard Keenan has only opened his business for three weeks since March. ""We kind of knew that was going to happen but up until the point that somebody tells you, it's still a bitter pill to swallow,"" said Mr Keenan. ""It's just the future, I'm worried now about the future, but I'm grateful now that we're getting some financial help."" He described the situation as ""brutal"", adding ""the stigma now that's attached to wet pubs, it's killing us"". Gyms will also be able to reopen under the rules agreed on Thursday Dr Tom Black, the Northern Ireland chairman of the British Medical Association, said the easing of the restrictions appeared to be a ""pragmatic decision"". ""It is a calculated risk because when you have a holiday period and people meet up the transmission of the virus increases,"" he told the BBC's The View programme. ""We will have in the health service in Northern Ireland a very busy time in the first three weeks in January, that seems inevitable. ""We will be sitting down to a banquet of consequences with increased admissions to hospital and more people in intensive care."" The latest medical and scientific advice given to ministers indicates that the R-number - the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus to - is about one. Stormont ministers have been told that if the R-number can be maintained at 1.6 or below then no intervention, in terms of further restrictions, would be required until the end of December/beginning of January. But if it was to rise as high as 1.8 then intervention would be required ""a few days earlier than this"", according toa Stormont briefing paper,external. A vaccine will be available in Northern Ireland from next week, after the UK drugs regulator gave approval in record time.

"UK 'confident' of having 800,000 jabs by next weekAlok Sharma says he expects the doses to arrive for the start of the UK's vaccination programme.UKComments","The government is ""absolutely confident"" the UK will have 800,000 coronavirus vaccine doses by next week, when the vaccination programme starts, the business secretary has said. Alok Sharma said some of the Pfizer/BioNTech doses had arrived, with more expected by the end of the year. He was unable to say how many that will be. NHS Providers said the UK must work on the basis that more doses beyond this might not arrive ""for some time"". Chief executive Chris Hopsontweeted,externalthat it was ""vital"" hospitals sought to vaccinate as many people as possible in the highest priority groups. He added that with ""every day that goes past, we become more confident we will get a lot more [doses] and get them soon"". It comes as official data showed infection levels werefalling in all English regions, except the North East. The government said the R number - the average number of people each person with Covid-19 goes on to infect - has fallen to between 0.8 and 1 in the UK, from between 0.9 and 1 last week. It also reported that a further 504 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 60,617. First batch of Covid vaccines arrives in the UK First vaccines 'could cut 99% of deaths' - Van-Tam When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the safety checks for vaccines? The first consignment of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccinearrived in the UK on Thursday, though the number of doses has not been confirmed. Asked about whether the 800,000 doses the UK is expecting in the coming days will arrive by next week, Mr Sharma told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We will have - I'm absolutely confident - that we will have 800,000 doses available at the point next week when we start the vaccination programme. ""Of course, by the end of this year we will expect some more doses to come through - I can't give you a number on that."" The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list - which is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - followed by the over-80s and front-line health and care staff. Mr Sharma reiterated that the bulk of the vaccination programme would be carried out next year, adding that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was alsoreviewing the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. This video can not be played Ros Atkins from BBC's Outside Source asks if people will have to be vaccinated against Covid-19 The chief commercial officer for BioNTech, Sean Marett, said there would be more shipments of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which is made in Belgium, next week. He said the first batch arrived on Thursday via the Eurotunnel and they were then transported to a storage facility. Mr Hopson said the vaccines will by now have reached the hospital hubs to enable vaccinations to begin on Tuesday. Hospitals were working out how many care home residents, care home staff and over-80s they can get it to, he said. He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that the vaccine will be delivered to care homes within ""the next 10 to 14 days, but we're going as fast as we can"". Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the JCVI, told The World at One that he understood the elderly in care homes ""might not end up being the first priority group for operational reasons"" and the committee would ""closely monitor this"". He stressed that the JCVI still expected care home residents ""to be prioritised"". This week, Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert,apologised for remarks that seemed to criticise the UK's vaccine approval process. Mr Sharma defended the UK's approach to approving the vaccine, saying the MHRA was ""absolutely meticulous"" and was regarded as a ""gold standard of regulation"" by international scientists. He told Sky News: ""People should be really confident that this vaccine is safe. If it wasn't safe it wouldn't be deployed and I certainly have full confidence in the work the MHRA have done."" Downing Street also defended the UK's medicines regulator, with the prime minister's official spokesman describing the MHRA as a ""world leader in its field"". World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the development of vaccines means ""we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel"" - but added that the organisation was ""concerned that there is a growing perception that the Covid-19 pandemic is over"". TheUK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday.Trial resultssuggest it offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The vaccine is made in Belgium and has to be stored at around -70C Northern Irelandhas received its first doses of the vaccine.and vaccinations are due to begin on Tuesday morning. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the country expected to receive its first supplies in the coming days and was planning tobegin vaccinating people from Tuesday. He told a coronavirus briefing: ""We hope, of course, this marks a turning point in the pandemic and that it'll put us on to what is going to be a long path back to normality."" But he cautioned that for now the situation in Wales ""remains very serious"" ahead of new national restrictionscoming into force laterto try to curb the spread of the disease.

Meanwhile, scientists have expressed concern about how well rapid lateral flow tests - which provide results in about 20 minutes without the need for a lab - perform in practice. Dr Angela Raffle, a consultant in public health and honorary senior lecturer at the University of Bristol, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the results on how these tests had performed during Liverpool's mass-testing scheme had been ""buried"". This follows anarticle in the BMJ medical journal,externalwhich also raised concerns about the effect of rapid testing in the city and the sensitivity of lateral flow tests. Dr Raffle said: ""The infection rate in Liverpool has come down no quicker than in many other places that haven't got mass testing and we haven't yet seen a proper evaluation report from Liverpool."" There has also been concern in some parts of the care home sector over the use of the tests, with homes in Greater Manchesterreportedly urged not to use them to allow visits,external.

Cinema giant in urgent talks over Dune streaming,"Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson star in Dune Odeon owner AMC is in ""urgent talks"" with Warner Bros after the film maker said all releases would be available to stream instantly in the US. The move will enable film fans to watch the forthcoming sci-fi epic Dune and the Matrix sequel on HBO Max at the same time as their cinema release. It has escalated tensions between Hollywood and US movie theatres. Both studios and chains are desperate to rebuild revenues after virus control measures closed cinemas. The new releases will be available on the service, which is not yet available in the UK, for one month after release. HBO Max is set to launch in Europe in the second half of next year, according to its global boss Andy Forssell. The releases are also expected to include Godzilla vs Kong, Mortal Kombat and The Suicide Squad. Earlier this year, assertive action by AMC successfully curbed a similar screening plan by rival Hollywood studio, Universal. Cinemas are desperate for content to lure viewers back with new entertainment that can initially only be seen on their screens. Typically, new releases are shown exclusively at cinemas for months. AMC had agreed to allow one film, Wonder Woman 1984, to be shown simultaneously on HBO Max, the streaming service owned by its ultimate parent company AT&T. Is the era of the Hollywood blockbuster over? Twelve films to watch in December AMC boss Adam Aron, said: ""These coronavirus-impacted times are uncharted waters for all of us, which is why AMC signed on to an HBO Max exception to customary practices for one film only, Wonder Woman 1984, being released by Warner Brothers at Christmas when the pandemic appears that it will be at its height."" Keanu Reeves will reprise his role as Neo in The Matrix 4 It accused Warner Bros of subsidising its HBO Max by its move: ""We will do all in our power to ensure that Warner does not do so at our expense. We will aggressively pursue economic terms that preserve our business. ""We have already commenced an immediate and urgent dialogue with the leadership of Warner on this subject."" This video can not be played As ever more people sign up to streaming services, are fewer going to the movies? Ann Sarnoff, chair and chief executive of WarnerMedia Studios, said the pandemic called for ""creative solutions"". ""No one wants films back on the big screen more than we do,"" she said. ""We know new content is the lifeblood of theatrical exhibition, but we have to balance this with the reality that most theatres in the US will likely operate at reduced capacity throughout 2021."" AMC banned all Universal films after the studio said it would release new movies at home and on the big screen on the same day. The two firms eventually agreed that Universal films can go to digital services after just 17 days of viewing in cinemas. Explaining Warner Bros' decision, Ms Sarnoff said the ""unique one-year plan"" would give ""moviegoers who may not have access to theatres, or aren't quite ready to go back to the movies, the chance to see our amazing 2021 films"". ""We see it as a win-win for film lovers and exhibitors, and we're extremely grateful to our filmmaking partners for working with us on this innovative response to these circumstances.""

Fauci apologises for saying UK 'rushed' vaccine,"This video can not be played Dr Fauci told the BBC: ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint"" Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, has apologised for remarks that seemed to criticise the UK's vaccine approval process. ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint,"" Dr Fauci told the BBC on Thursday. The UK on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine for the coronavirus. It has defended the rapid approval and said the jab is safe and effective. Dr Fauci on Wednesday had told Fox News that the UK did not review the vaccine ""as carefully"" as US health regulators, although he implied that the US would quickly also be in a position to approve a vaccine. ""We'll be there. We'll be there very soon,"" he added. He later told CBS News that the UK had ""rushed"" the approval, but on Thursday he walked back the comments, and said there was  ""no judgement on the way the UK did it"". ""Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK. And that's just the reality,"" Dr Fauci told the BBC. ""I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way."" The UK medicines regulator - MHRA - said it had ""rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review"" - adding that it reviewed preliminary data on the vaccine trials dating back to June and had been running a ""rolling review"" since October which helped speed the process. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? The regulator said that Covid vaccines were being developed ""in a coordinated in a way that allows some stages of this process to happen in parallel to condense the time needed"" adding that it did not mean that ""the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness"" had been bypassed. ""Any vaccine must undergo robust clinical trials in line with international standards, with oversight provided by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,"" it said. ""No vaccine would be authorised for supply in the UK unless the expected standards of safety, quality and efficacy are met,"" the MHRA added. Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week On Thursday, the UK's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC he was ""very confident"" in the MHRA. He said there was more than ""100 years of medical experience"" between the UK regulator and the committee advising which groups of people are vaccinated first. Dr Fauci's remarks came as the US surpassed 14 million Covid-19 infections in total, with a recorded 276,325 deaths. A woman waits for a Covid-19 test in California, as cases mount across the US Analysis by Naomi Grimley, BBC health correspondent America's Food and Drug Administration does have a different approach to other regulators around the world - it often asks vaccine makers for their raw data, which it then spends time re-analysing. The UK's medicines regulator in London, on the other hand, relies more heavily on the companies' own reports as does the European Medicines Agency, based in Amsterdam. Politics may also explain why the FDA hasn't yet given the green light. Back in October, President Trump pressured health officials to approve the first vaccine candidates before election day on 3 November but they pushed back, fearing it might become a political football. The FDA said it wanted to see two months' extra safety data from the final phase vaccine trials before pharmaceutical companies could apply for emergency approval. That has inevitably left some arguing the US has got bogged down in a much more detailed review than might have been necessary. The head of the European Medicines Agency also appeared to raise eyebrows yesterday at the truncated timetable in London. But officials in the UK believe the US and EU are likely to approve the vaccine soon. The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, andthe first consignment of that vaccine has now arrived. It has been taken to a central hub at an undisclosed location, and will now be distributed to hospital vaccination centres around the UK. England's deputy chief medical officer said the first wave of vaccinations could prevent up to 99% of Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths. Did Brexit speed up the UK's vaccine approval? What does UK vaccine approval mean for US? Are countries under pressure to approve a vaccine? This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" The US FDA plans to meet on 10 December to discuss approval for the UK-approved vaccine, and will meet again on 17 December to discuss a second vaccine - Moderna. Dr Fauci had described the US Food and Drug Administration's approval process, slower than the UK, as the ""gold standard"". On Thursday he clarified, saying the US does ""things a little differently"" than the UK. ""That's all,"" he said. ""Not better, not worse, just differently."" An independent UK expert on the use and effects of drugs in populations - Prof Stephen Evans of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the approvals processes carried out by the FDA and the MHRA were ""basically very similar"". ""The only major difference is that the FDA may reproduce all the tables submitted by a company by re-analysing the data,"" he said. ""It is very clear that the UK assessment of this has followed all the usual processes, but has been working incredibly long hours and seven days a week both with MHRA staff and with their academic advisors for quite a long time on initial and interim data before the final data were submitted."" Dr Fauci has led the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH) for more than 30 years - covering five presidential transitions - and has become the most visible member of the White House's coronavirus task force. The EU, meanwhile, is eyeing a 29 December meeting of the European Medicines Agency to determine if there is adequate safety data on the vaccine for it to be approved in Europe. This timeline puts the EU weeks behind both the UK and US. After the agency approves the vaccine, it will probably also need a sign-off from the EU Commission.

Primark predicts rising sales despite Covid hit,"Budget clothing retailer Primark says it expects sales and profits in its current financial year to rise, despite the disruption from recent lockdowns. It said autumn store closures meant it missed out on Â£430m of sales, higher than a previous estimate of Â£375m. However, it said sales since reopening, including in England this week, had ""once again been very strong"". Primark does not sell online, and on reopening on Wednesday, pent-up demand saw queues form at several stores. The chain's owner, Associated British Foods (ABF), said it expected this financial year - which runs from September - to produce higher sales and profits at Primark than in the previous 12 months, which were affected by a longer lockdown period. It also said it would continue to expand its retail selling space. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter said Primark's loyal customers and the woes afflicting rivals such as Topshop owner Arcadia, which went into administration this week, would continue to support its growth. ""[Its] highly loyal customer base... waited until stores re-opened to satisfy their pent up shopping desires,"" she said. ""In the UK, it is likely to have easy pickings in prime locations in the future, given the demise of its rivals."" ABF said last month that so far Covid-19 had cost Primark Â£2bn in lost sales and Â£650m in profit. This new financial year has seen a month-long shut down in England and a host of other curbs in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Closures in the start of its financial year saw Covid restrictions, designed to stop a second wave of the coronavirus, temporarily close stores in a number of other major markets. These include the Republic of Ireland, France and Belgium, which all also reopened in the last week. Primark still has 34 stores - fewer than 10% of its 389 outlets worldwide - closed across its global markets, including all outlets in Northern Ireland and Austria. Recently it opened new stores in the US, in Italy and its 50th store in Spain. ABF's other businesses include groceries, sugar and other agricultures. It said these were doing better than previously expected and would also perform better this year than last.

Here's a reminder of some of the main headlines of the day from the UK.    The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says he is pleased that progress on vaccines means ""we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel"". However, Tedros Adhanom adds the ""WHO is concerned there is a growing perception that the Covid-19 pandemic is over"". ""The truth is that at present, many places are witnessing very high transmission of the Covid-19 virus, which is putting enormous pressure on hospitals, intensive care units and health workers."" In other developments around the world today:  Major Lee Wooten, a World War II veteran from Alabama, has recovered from Covid-19 and made it back home from the hospital just in time to celebrate his 104th birthday. Madison Hospital in Madison, Alabama posted a video of Wooten - known as ""Pop Pop"" - being discharged from the hospital, his wheelchair decorated with balloons, as staff cheer and wave him on. His granddaughter, Holly Wooten McDonald told the Associated Press that her grandfather, ""their family's treasure"", appears to be feeling better. Wooten was drafted into the US Army in 1943 and served as a railroad carpenter stationed in Paris in WWII. Bahrain has recorded 87,000 cases since the pandemic began Bahrain has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine for emergency use authorisation, becoming the second country to approve it after the UK,state media report,external. The countryâs National Health Regulatory
Authority (NHRA) announced the move on Friday, saying it had followed âthorough
analysis and reviewâ of all available data. Earlier this month Bahrain approved the
use of the Sinopharm vaccine for frontline workers. Dr Mariam Al Jalahma, CEO of NHRA said: âThe
approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to
the Kingdomâs national Covid-19 response, which has strongly prioritised
protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic.â Bahrain has recorded 341 deaths and 87,432
cases since the pandemic began. A number of Royal Navy personnel have tested positive for coronavirus at its HMNB Clyde base, also known as Faslane, and are under medical supervision. The Royal Navy said that those identified as close contacts are now isolating. HMNB Clyde, on Gare Loch in Argyll and Bute, is the navy's base for nuclear submarines and hunter-killer submarines. A spike of 96 positive cases were confirmed in the Argyll and Bute council area, where the base is located, today. This is much higher than the area's recent weekly number of positive cases.

Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The recovery in employment continued last
month, after the heavy job losses in the first wave of the pandemic in the US. According to new official data, the
number of people with jobs rose by 245,000 last month and the unemployment rate
declined to 6.7%. But the job creation figure was less than
expected and less than the previous month and is seen by economists as
disappointing.  Almost 15m people said they were unable to work because their employer closed or lost business as a result of the pandemic. Nearly four million others said they couldnât even look for work due to the pandemic. The outlook for jobs in the near future is clouded by rising infections and official restrictions. But recent vaccine developments mean longer term labour market prospects are more upbeat. Yesterday, we covered reports that cyber spies had targeted international organisations involved in the supply chain of coronavirus vaccines. The American technology firm, IBM, said hackers had been trying to access the so-called ""cold chain"" - the delivery chain used to ensure vaccines are kept at the right temperature while being transported. Dr Ian Levy, from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, says his organisation is working to ensure vaccine delivery is as ""protected as can be"" from cyber attacks. ""In April we pivoted our work to better protect the health sector and so there is a massive community effort in protecting the health sector and the vaccine supply chain, all the way from research through to delivery and distribution,"" he tells the BBC. He declined to say which states had been targeting vaccine efforts. Another 16,298 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total to 1,690,432, according to new government figures. There have been another 504 deaths, of people who had a positive test result within the previous 28 days. There have now been 60,617 deaths, under that measure.   Madrid has cancelled its New
Yearâs Eve celebrations including the traditional event in Puerta del Sol
Square where people eat 12 grapes at the stroke of midnight. The event is incredibly popular and watched around the world. The regional government announced the cancellation on Friday, where it also revealed the measures that will be in place during Christmas and New Year. Christmas markets will have their capacity cut, while spectators at Christmas parades, usually held on 5 January, will have to be seated. Earlier this week, Spain's government announced that travel between regions will only be allowed for those visiting family. Gatherings on December 24, 25 and January 1are limited to 10 people.,external Spain is one of the worst affected countries
in Europe. More than 46,000 people have died and more than 1.6 million cases
since the pandemic began. Other European countries also have Christmas restrictions in place.Italy, for example, is banning travel between its regionsfrom 21 December to 6 January. Two coronavirus vaccines are expected to be approved for use in Northern Ireland this week We know that the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived in the UK by Eurostar yesterday, and nowNorthern Ireland reportsthat it has received its first allocation. Nearly 25,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine were delivered to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on Friday morning. Health Minister Robin Swann said confirmation of which groups will get the Covid-19 vaccine first is expected next week. It is thought the seven vaccination centres that have been earmarked, including leisure centres and hospitals, will be used as satellite centres in order to roll out the vaccine to those care homes which are located nearby. Meanwhile,the NI business community has welcomedcomments from the first minister that there will be no further Covid restrictions this side of Christmas. Lockdown restrictions are currently under way in NI - but It has now been announced that they will be loosened from 00.01 GMT on Friday 11 December. Non-essential retail and some parts of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland can reopen. Hazel ShearingBBC News When Bethany Wakenshaw started her nursing course this year, she could ask for practical advice from her teachers in person as she practised CPR and other life support skills. But after coronavirus cases began to rise again across the UK, her classes moved online last month. Despite the teaching staff's best efforts, she finds online learning frustrating. ""It's so hard to concentrate when you're in your own room because they can't see you,"" she says. ""Even quickly checking your phone for five seconds can turn into being on your phone for 10 minutes."" Bethany is one of dozens of students who have taken to social media to vent their concerns ahead of allteaching having to move online by 9 December in England, ahead of the Christmas holidays.For students in Wales, all lectures went online yesterday. For those who are struggling - whether at uni or elsewhere - we've put together five tips to get better at learning online, from sorting out your room to learning with mates.Read more here.  Some forms of PPEcould be decontaminated to make them reusablein an emergency measure, scientists have found. Cardiff University said some types of respirators could be effectively decontaminated in just 90 seconds by industrial-grade microwave ovens or using dry heat. It is not a safe method to use at home, the research team warned. Reporting their findings in the Journal of Hospital Infection, the study found that using an industrial-grade microwave oven, and a baby bottle steriliser containing water, could dramatically increase the number of respirators available to staff. This could allow the reuse of some PPE when stocks are low.

A war against coronavirus and a war against stupidity. The Chief Medical Officer at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston went viral earlier this week when an image of him comforting an elderly patient ended up on social media. The US is seeing a surge in the number of people entering hospital with Covid-19, and several states are concerned that health care facilities could soon be overwhelmed. As coronavirus spread across the US last month, health officials urged people to refrain from travel to see friends and family over the Thanksgiving holiday. But data shows that millions of Americans ignored these calls. While air travel was much lower than in previous years, airports still reported some of their busiest days since the start of the pandemic. The US Transportation Security Administration said it had screened over one million passengers on several days during the holiday period. Experts have warnedthe US could see ""surge upon surge"" of Covid-19cases as a result, while the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned that even a small number of infected travellers could lead to hundreds of thousands of new infections. Meanwhile vehicle travel surged around Thanksgiving, peaking at only around 5% less than last year, according to transport analytics firm Streetlight Data. The company's founder, Laura Schewel,told the Associated Press,externalthat this showed ""people were less willing to change their behaviour than any other day during the pandemicâ. Officials have made similar calls for people to avoid travel over Christmas and New Year period, as hospitalisation numbers soar to record highs.

Saturday, with mosques, schools, universities and kindergartens set to close, amid a
surge in cases. High schools and nurseries will remain open, the interior
ministry said in a statement. Under the new measures, a night time curfew will also be in
place. From Saturday, people will have to remain in their home from 18:30 until
08:00. Shops will remain open, however they must close by 18:00. On weekends, a full lockdown will be in place. The territory's healthcare system is severely strainedand ill-equipped as a result of conflict, blockade and a political rift

88% of hospital beds with ventilators for Covid-19 patients in critical

Earlier, we brought you the news that the R number for the UK had fallen slightly to between 0.8 and 1 - the second week running it's been below 1. We've got more details here on what the R number is in different regions of the UK here: Meanwhile, the growth rate, which estimates how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day, is between -3% and -1% for the UK as a whole. That means the number of new infections is shrinking by between 1% and 3% every day. There's more on the latest stats here. Pauline Demaline was fit and healthy and only 56 years old when she fell ill with Covid-19 in March. But within days of going into hospital she had died. She worked as a parish administrator at the Holy Trinity parish church in Skipton, North Yorkshire, and it may be here that she caught the virus, in the early days of the pandemic. She and her husband, Nigel, were very careful. They didn't go out much and Nigel would do the shopping early in the day, when the shops were quiet. But Pauline had to go into work and would sometimes meet other parishioners - couples about to get married, for example, and their parents. Now, Nigel has spoken about how the personal tragedy prompted him to volunteer for one of the many Covid vaccines in trials. Read the full article here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Fauci apologises for saying UK 'rushed' vaccineAfter apparent criticism from the US expert, the UK defended the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.US & Canada","This video can not be played Dr Fauci told the BBC: ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint"" Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, has apologised for remarks that seemed to criticise the UK's vaccine approval process. ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint,"" Dr Fauci told the BBC on Thursday. The UK on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine for the coronavirus. It has defended the rapid approval and said the jab is safe and effective. Dr Fauci on Wednesday had told Fox News that the UK did not review the vaccine ""as carefully"" as US health regulators, although he implied that the US would quickly also be in a position to approve a vaccine. ""We'll be there. We'll be there very soon,"" he added. He later told CBS News that the UK had ""rushed"" the approval, but on Thursday he walked back the comments, and said there was  ""no judgement on the way the UK did it"". ""Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK. And that's just the reality,"" Dr Fauci told the BBC. ""I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way."" The UK medicines regulator - MHRA - said it had ""rigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review"" - adding that it reviewed preliminary data on the vaccine trials dating back to June and had been running a ""rolling review"" since October which helped speed the process. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? The regulator said that Covid vaccines were being developed ""in a coordinated in a way that allows some stages of this process to happen in parallel to condense the time needed"" adding that it did not mean that ""the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness"" had been bypassed. ""Any vaccine must undergo robust clinical trials in line with international standards, with oversight provided by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,"" it said. ""No vaccine would be authorised for supply in the UK unless the expected standards of safety, quality and efficacy are met,"" the MHRA added. Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week On Thursday, the UK's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC he was ""very confident"" in the MHRA. He said there was more than ""100 years of medical experience"" between the UK regulator and the committee advising which groups of people are vaccinated first. Dr Fauci's remarks came as the US surpassed 14 million Covid-19 infections in total, with a recorded 276,325 deaths. A woman waits for a Covid-19 test in California, as cases mount across the US Analysis by Naomi Grimley, BBC health correspondent America's Food and Drug Administration does have a different approach to other regulators around the world - it often asks vaccine makers for their raw data, which it then spends time re-analysing. The UK's medicines regulator in London, on the other hand, relies more heavily on the companies' own reports as does the European Medicines Agency, based in Amsterdam. Politics may also explain why the FDA hasn't yet given the green light. Back in October, President Trump pressured health officials to approve the first vaccine candidates before election day on 3 November but they pushed back, fearing it might become a political football. The FDA said it wanted to see two months' extra safety data from the final phase vaccine trials before pharmaceutical companies could apply for emergency approval. That has inevitably left some arguing the US has got bogged down in a much more detailed review than might have been necessary. The head of the European Medicines Agency also appeared to raise eyebrows yesterday at the truncated timetable in London. But officials in the UK believe the US and EU are likely to approve the vaccine soon. The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, andthe first consignment of that vaccine has now arrived. It has been taken to a central hub at an undisclosed location, and will now be distributed to hospital vaccination centres around the UK. England's deputy chief medical officer said the first wave of vaccinations could prevent up to 99% of Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths. Did Brexit speed up the UK's vaccine approval? What does UK vaccine approval mean for US? Are countries under pressure to approve a vaccine? This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" The US FDA plans to meet on 10 December to discuss approval for the UK-approved vaccine, and will meet again on 17 December to discuss a second vaccine - Moderna. Dr Fauci had described the US Food and Drug Administration's approval process, slower than the UK, as the ""gold standard"". On Thursday he clarified, saying the US does ""things a little differently"" than the UK. ""That's all,"" he said. ""Not better, not worse, just differently."" An independent UK expert on the use and effects of drugs in populations - Prof Stephen Evans of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the approvals processes carried out by the FDA and the MHRA were ""basically very similar"". ""The only major difference is that the FDA may reproduce all the tables submitted by a company by re-analysing the data,"" he said. ""It is very clear that the UK assessment of this has followed all the usual processes, but has been working incredibly long hours and seven days a week both with MHRA staff and with their academic advisors for quite a long time on initial and interim data before the final data were submitted."" Dr Fauci has led the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH) for more than 30 years - covering five presidential transitions - and has become the most visible member of the White House's coronavirus task force. The EU, meanwhile, is eyeing a 29 December meeting of the European Medicines Agency to determine if there is adequate safety data on the vaccine for it to be approved in Europe. This timeline puts the EU weeks behind both the UK and US. After the agency approves the vaccine, it will probably also need a sign-off from the EU Commission.

It was
brought to you by our teams from the UK and US. The writers were Joshua
Cheetham, Francesca Gillett, Lauren Turner, Sophie Williams and Holly
Honderich, and the editors were Helier Cheung and Holly Wallis. Thanks for joining us as we've brought you the latest coronavirus news. Here's a reminder of some of the main headlines of the day from the UK.    The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says he is pleased that progress on vaccines means ""we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel"". However, Tedros Adhanom adds the ""WHO is concerned there is a growing perception that the Covid-19 pandemic is over"". ""The truth is that at present, many places are witnessing very high transmission of the Covid-19 virus, which is putting enormous pressure on hospitals, intensive care units and health workers."" In other developments around the world today:  Major Lee Wooten, a World War II veteran from Alabama, has recovered from Covid-19 and made it back home from the hospital just in time to celebrate his 104th birthday. Madison Hospital in Madison, Alabama posted a video of Wooten - known as ""Pop Pop"" - being discharged from the hospital, his wheelchair decorated with balloons, as staff cheer and wave him on. His granddaughter, Holly Wooten McDonald told the Associated Press that her grandfather, ""their family's treasure"", appears to be feeling better. Wooten was drafted into the US Army in 1943 and served as a railroad carpenter stationed in Paris in WWII. Bahrain has recorded 87,000 cases since the pandemic began Bahrain has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine for emergency use authorisation, becoming the second country to approve it after the UK,state media report,external. The countryâs National Health Regulatory
Authority (NHRA) announced the move on Friday, saying it had followed âthorough
analysis and reviewâ of all available data. Earlier this month Bahrain approved the
use of the Sinopharm vaccine for frontline workers. Dr Mariam Al Jalahma, CEO of NHRA said: âThe
approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to
the Kingdomâs national Covid-19 response, which has strongly prioritised
protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic.â Bahrain has recorded 341 deaths and 87,432
cases since the pandemic began. A number of Royal Navy personnel have tested positive for coronavirus at its HMNB Clyde base, also known as Faslane, and are under medical supervision. The Royal Navy said that those identified as close contacts are now isolating. HMNB Clyde, on Gare Loch in Argyll and Bute, is the navy's base for nuclear submarines and hunter-killer submarines. A spike of 96 positive cases were confirmed in the Argyll and Bute council area, where the base is located, today. This is much higher than the area's recent weekly number of positive cases.

Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The recovery in employment continued last
month, after the heavy job losses in the first wave of the pandemic in the US. According to new official data, the
number of people with jobs rose by 245,000 last month and the unemployment rate
declined to 6.7%. But the job creation figure was less than
expected and less than the previous month and is seen by economists as
disappointing.  Almost 15m people said they were unable to work because their employer closed or lost business as a result of the pandemic. Nearly four million others said they couldnât even look for work due to the pandemic. The outlook for jobs in the near future is clouded by rising infections and official restrictions. But recent vaccine developments mean longer term labour market prospects are more upbeat. Yesterday, we covered reports that cyber spies had targeted international organisations involved in the supply chain of coronavirus vaccines. The American technology firm, IBM, said hackers had been trying to access the so-called ""cold chain"" - the delivery chain used to ensure vaccines are kept at the right temperature while being transported. Dr Ian Levy, from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, says his organisation is working to ensure vaccine delivery is as ""protected as can be"" from cyber attacks. ""In April we pivoted our work to better protect the health sector and so there is a massive community effort in protecting the health sector and the vaccine supply chain, all the way from research through to delivery and distribution,"" he tells the BBC. He declined to say which states had been targeting vaccine efforts. Another 16,298 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total to 1,690,432, according to new government figures. There have been another 504 deaths, of people who had a positive test result within the previous 28 days. There have now been 60,617 deaths, under that measure.   Madrid has cancelled its New
Yearâs Eve celebrations including the traditional event in Puerta del Sol
Square where people eat 12 grapes at the stroke of midnight. The event is incredibly popular and watched around the world. The regional government announced the cancellation on Friday, where it also revealed the measures that will be in place during Christmas and New Year. Christmas markets will have their capacity cut, while spectators at Christmas parades, usually held on 5 January, will have to be seated. Earlier this week, Spain's government announced that travel between regions will only be allowed for those visiting family. Gatherings on December 24, 25 and January 1are limited to 10 people.,external Spain is one of the worst affected countries
in Europe. More than 46,000 people have died and more than 1.6 million cases
since the pandemic began. Other European countries also have Christmas restrictions in place.Italy, for example, is banning travel between its regionsfrom 21 December to 6 January. Two coronavirus vaccines are expected to be approved for use in Northern Ireland this week We know that the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived in the UK by Eurostar yesterday, and nowNorthern Ireland reportsthat it has received its first allocation. Nearly 25,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine were delivered to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on Friday morning. Health Minister Robin Swann said confirmation of which groups will get the Covid-19 vaccine first is expected next week. It is thought the seven vaccination centres that have been earmarked, including leisure centres and hospitals, will be used as satellite centres in order to roll out the vaccine to those care homes which are located nearby. Meanwhile,the NI business community has welcomedcomments from the first minister that there will be no further Covid restrictions this side of Christmas. Lockdown restrictions are currently under way in NI - but It has now been announced that they will be loosened from 00.01 GMT on Friday 11 December. Non-essential retail and some parts of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland can reopen. Hazel ShearingBBC News When Bethany Wakenshaw started her nursing course this year, she could ask for practical advice from her teachers in person as she practised CPR and other life support skills. But after coronavirus cases began to rise again across the UK, her classes moved online last month. Despite the teaching staff's best efforts, she finds online learning frustrating. ""It's so hard to concentrate when you're in your own room because they can't see you,"" she says. ""Even quickly checking your phone for five seconds can turn into being on your phone for 10 minutes.""

Some forms of PPEcould be decontaminated to make them reusablein an emergency measure, scientists have found. Cardiff University said some types of respirators could be effectively decontaminated in just 90 seconds by industrial-grade microwave ovens or using dry heat. It is not a safe method to use at home, the research team warned. Reporting their findings in the Journal of Hospital Infection, the study found that using an industrial-grade microwave oven, and a baby bottle steriliser containing water, could dramatically increase the number of respirators available to staff. This could allow the reuse of some PPE when stocks are low.

A war against coronavirus and a war against stupidity. The Chief Medical Officer at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston went viral earlier this week when an image of him comforting an elderly patient ended up on social media. The US is seeing a surge in the number of people entering hospital with Covid-19, and several states are concerned that health care facilities could soon be overwhelmed. As coronavirus spread across the US last month, health officials urged people to refrain from travel to see friends and family over the Thanksgiving holiday. But data shows that millions of Americans ignored these calls. While air travel was much lower than in previous years, airports still reported some of their busiest days since the start of the pandemic. The US Transportation Security Administration said it had screened over one million passengers on several days during the holiday period. Experts have warnedthe US could see ""surge upon surge"" of Covid-19cases as a result, while the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned that even a small number of infected travellers could lead to hundreds of thousands of new infections. Meanwhile vehicle travel surged around Thanksgiving, peaking at only around 5% less than last year, according to transport analytics firm Streetlight Data. The company's founder, Laura Schewel,told the Associated Press,externalthat this showed ""people were less willing to change their behaviour than any other day during the pandemicâ. Officials have made similar calls for people to avoid travel over Christmas and New Year period, as hospitalisation numbers soar to record highs.

Saturday, with mosques, schools, universities and kindergartens set to close, amid a
surge in cases. High schools and nurseries will remain open, the interior
ministry said in a statement. Under the new measures, a night time curfew will also be in
place. From Saturday, people will have to remain in their home from 18:30 until
08:00. Shops will remain open, however they must close by 18:00. On weekends, a full lockdown will be in place. The territory's healthcare system is severely strainedand ill-equipped as a result of conflict, blockade and a political rift

Earlier, we brought you the news that the R number for the UK had fallen slightly to between 0.8 and 1 - the second week running it's been below 1. We've got more details here on what the R number is in different regions of the UK here: Meanwhile, the growth rate, which estimates how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day, is between -3% and -1% for the UK as a whole. That means the number of new infections is shrinking by between 1% and 3% every day. There's more on the latest stats here. Pauline Demaline was fit and healthy and only 56 years old when she fell ill with Covid-19 in March. But within days of going into hospital she had died. She worked as a parish administrator at the Holy Trinity parish church in Skipton, North Yorkshire, and it may be here that she caught the virus, in the early days of the pandemic. She and her husband, Nigel, were very careful. They didn't go out much and Nigel would do the shopping early in the day, when the shops were quiet. But Pauline had to go into work and would sometimes meet other parishioners - couples about to get married, for example, and their parents. Now, Nigel has spoken about how the personal tragedy prompted him to volunteer for one of the many Covid vaccines in trials. Read the full article here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Fauci apologises for saying UK 'rushed' vaccineAfter apparent criticism from the US expert, the UK defended the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.","This video can not be played Dr Fauci told the BBC: ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint"" Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, has apologised for remarks that seemed to criticise the UK's vaccine approval process. ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint,"" Dr Fauci told the BBC on Thursday. The UK on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine for the coronavirus. It has defended the rapid approval and said the jab is safe and effective. Dr Fauci on Wednesday had told Fox News that the UK did not review the vaccine ""as carefully"" as US health regulators, although he implied that the US would quickly also be in a position to approve a vaccine. ""We'll be there. We'll be there very soon,"" he added.

Pets at Home to hand back Covid rates relief,"Lidl will join other supermarkets to repay more than Â£100m of business rates relief it received during the pandemic. The firm's UK boss said the company felt it was ""the right thing to do"". It followssimilar moves by the UK biggest grocersincluding Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, and will see more than Â£1.9bn handed back to taxpayers. Some retailers, whose sales have boomed during the crisis, have been criticised for taking government help while paying dividends to shareholders. Christian HÃ¤rtnagel, chief executive of Lidl GB, said: ""The business rates relief that was provided to us, and the rest of the supermarket sector, came with a lot of responsibility that we took extremely seriously. ""We've been considering this for some time, and we are now in a position to confirm that we will be refunding this money as we believe it is the right thing to do."" Asda joins rivals to pay back Covid rates relief Supermarkets repay rates relief after backlash In March, all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England were given a business rates holiday for 12 months to help them get through the crisis. However, shops deemed ""essential"" by the government, such as supermarkets, were allowed to stay open during lockdown. In a statement, Lidl said that it had incurred Covid-related costs from recruiting 2,500 temporary staff, increasing stock levels and introduce protective, plastic screens at checkouts. But, it has taken the decision to repay the rates relief due to strong customer footfall. Others, including Morrisons, Aldi, Asda, Pets at Home and B&M, have also pledged to repay the rates relief, citing strong sales during Covid. Several retailers have been criticised for accepting the payments from government and then handing out dividends to shareholders. Tesco came under fire in April for handing investors Â£900m in dividends despite receiving the tax break from the government. Labour MP Rushanara Ali, who is also a member of the Treasury Select Committee, described the tax break as ""completely disproportionate"" and ""an absolute scandal"". Tesco chairman John Allan previously said he would 'defend to the death' a decision to pay dividends In October, Tesco's chairman John Allan said he would""defend to the death"" the board's decision to pay a dividend,externaland that he didn't ""remotely feel any sort of guilt over it"". This week Tesco said it would repay Â£585m in business rates relief. It was swiftly followed by the UK's other big grocers. Meanwhile, former retail chief Bill Grimsey has written to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, asking that the returned funds should be used to support for smaller businesses and struggling High Streets. He writes: ""What the rate relief episode has proved beyond doubt is that a good proportion of Britain's biggest businesses do not need generous tax breaks. ""The public are not happy to see them paying big dividends to shareholders with taxpayers' money,"" he said. A spokesperson for HM Treasury said: ""We've been clear throughout the pandemic that businesses should use our support appropriately, and we welcome any decision to repay support where it is no longer needed."" On Friday, Pets at Home also announced that it would repay in full the Â£28.9m in rates relief it had received. Peter Pritchard, chief executive of Pets at Home, said that the cash had helped the firm take the decision to keep its stores, online operations and veterinary practices open during the pandemic. The firm is classed as an essential retailer and its shops were allowed to stay open during lockdown restrictions. Pets at Home announced it will hand back Â£28.9m in business rates relief Pets at Home's sales between April and October rose by 5.1% to Â£574.4m while pre-tax profit grew by more than 14% to Â£38.9m. The strong trading prompted the retailer to pay a 2.5p dividend, worth Â£12.4m, despite having received business rates relief. On Friday, Mr Pritchard said Pets at Home ""is a robust business, both operationally and financially"" and its decision to return the business rates relief ""demonstrates our clear commitment to acting responsibly and treating all of our stakeholders fairly"". He added that the repayment meant that the Â£35m in Covid-related costs, such as implementing new safety measures in its grooming salons, it has been forced to pay would no longer be off-set by the relief it had received. The company will also be shutting its stores on Boxing Day, costing an estimated Â£3m in sales, to give its staff ""a rest"".

She was chosen from more than 5,000 US nominees for the landmark title. ""If I can do it, you can do it, and anyone can do it,"" she said. In an interview for Time magazine with actor and humanitarian Angelina Jolie,Ms Rao said she does not look like ""your typical scientist"".,external ""Everything I see on TV is that it's an older, usually white man as a scientist,"" she said. ""My goal has really shifted not only from creating my own devices to solve the world's problems, but inspiring others to do the same as well. Because, from personal experience, it's not easy when you don't see anyone else like you."" Ms Rao, from the US state of Colorado, said there are many issues that need to be solved. ""Our generation is facing so many problems that we've never seen before. But then at the same time we're facing old problems that still exist,"" she told Time. ""Like, we're sitting here in the middle of a new global pandemic, and we're also like still facing human-rights issues. There are problems that we did not create but that we now have to solve, like climate change and cyberbullying with the introduction of technology."" The Time award is just the latest accolade for Ms Rao. She was previously named ""America's top young scientist""for inventing a quick, low-cost test to detect lead-contaminated water.

Call for probe into 'missing' Â£50bn of UK cash,"The Bank of England should be trying to track down Â£50bn of ""missing"" UK currency, a committee of MPs has said. The figure amounts to about three-quarters of all UK banknotes in existence. The cash is not used in transactions or held as savings, but may be overseas, tucked away in homes unreported or being used in the ""shadow economy"". The issue was first identified by the National Audit Office (NAO), which highlighted it in September. Now the Public Accounts Committee has said the Bank should ""get a better handle"" on the currency. The committee said there were ""implications for public policy and the public purse"" if a material proportion of that large volume of banknotes was being used for illegal purposes. However, the UK is not the only country to face this problem - and other major global currencies could well be more seriously affected. A Bank of England spokesperson said: ""It is the responsibility of the Bank of England to meet public demand for banknotes. The Bank has always met that demand and will continue to do so. ""Members of the public do not have to explain to the Bank why they wish to hold banknotes. This means that banknotes are not missing."" However, the figure of Â£50bn is not disputed, even if the terminology is. The money ""is stashed somewhere, but the Bank of England doesn't know where, who by or what for - and doesn't seem very curious"", said Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee. No new 2p or Â£2 coins to be made for 10 years ""It needs to be more concerned about where the missing Â£50bn is. Depending where it is and what it's being used for, that amount of money could have material implications for public policy and the public purse. ""The Bank needs to get a better handle on the national currency it controls."" Demand for banknotes has steadily gone up, although their use is in decline, but the Bank of England does not ""appear to have a convincing reason for why the demand for notes keeps increasing"", says the committee in a report. Recent debate over cash has centred on whether vulnerable people - who might struggle with digital payments - will have access to notes and coins in the future. MPs on the committee say that means little attention is being paid to the whereabouts of banknotes today. There is nothing wrong with stashing cash rather than spending it, assuming it is secure. But that makes little sense for your average saver who could get some interest, however small, by keeping it safely in a bank or building society. That is why MPs have their suspicions that many of these banknotes are being hidden for less innocent reasons instead. This rising demand is ""a trend being seen with other major currencies"", as the committee itself admits. It particularly affects the dollar and the euro, which are widely held as reserve currencies around the world. In the case of the dollar, only about 15% of the US currency supply can be accounted for - a significantly lower proportion than for the UK. Both those currencies are more attractive to criminals because they have higher-denomination notes which make it easier to smuggle or stash ill-gotten gains. For instance, there are more $100 bills out there than any other denomination of the greenback, with 80% of them estimated to be held outside the US. As for the euro,the European Central Bank in Frankfurt no longer issues the â¬500 notebecause of concerns it could facilitate illegal activities. However, it remains legal tender, while â¬100 and â¬200 notes are still in production. By contrast, the highest-value note issued by the Bank of England is Â£50.

Cyber-warning for festive shoppers,"The ad campaign will run on TV and radio as well as online Online shoppers are being warned of the risks of cyber-fraud during the festive season. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) - part of GCHQ - is launching a major campaign called Cyber Aware with its first ever TV ads. It says over last year's Christmas shopping period there was an average loss of Â£775 per incident from online shopping fraud. The NCSC is outlining six key things people can do to protect accounts. Online shopping has seen significant growth this year and is likely to reach new levels at Christmas - even with High Street shops now re-open again in many areas. And with that comes the risk from criminals. The NCSC is working on the campaign with the Home Office, the Cabinet Office and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and aims to help individuals and organisations to protect themselves online. ""Scammers stole millions from internet shoppers last Christmas - but by following our advice, you can protect yourself from the majority of their crimes,"" said Lindy Cameron, chief executive of the NCSC. ""We hope the Cyber Aware campaign helps people to shop confidently online and enjoy their Christmas."" Online shoppers will be advised to use two-factor authentication Statistics by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau reveal that over last year's Christmas shopping period (from November 2019 to end of January 2020) there were 17,405 reports of online shopping fraud, reporting a loss of Â£13.5m - an average of Â£775 per incident, according to the NCSC. As well as awebsite,external, there is also a television and radio advertising campaign running until Christmas Eve to advise on six essential behaviours to protect online accounts and devices. These are: use a strong and separate password for your email create strong passwords using three random words save your passwords in your browser turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) update your devices and apps back up your data ""As we approach the Christmas season, we should all be on our guard and take the practical Cyber Aware actions to keep us safe as we work, shop and socialise online,"" Penny Mordaunt, the Paymaster General said.

Biden to ask Americans to wear masks for 100 days,"US President-elect Joe Biden has said he will ask Americans to wear masks for his first 100 days in office to curtail the spread of coronavirus. He told CNN he believed there would be a ""significant reduction"" in Covid-19 cases if every American wore a face covering. Mr Biden also said he would order masks to be worn in all government buildings. The US has recorded 14.1 million cases and 276,000 deaths from Covid-19 - the highest of any country in the world. Mr Biden is preparing to take office as pharmaceutical giants are poised to ship millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines to the American public. The UK on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine. In his first joint interview with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris since the election, Mr Biden said,external: ""The first day I'm inaugurated to say I'm going to ask the public for 100 days to mask. Just 100 days to mask, not forever. One hundred days. ""And I think we'll see a significant reduction if we occur that, if that occurs with vaccinations and masking to drive down the numbers considerably.""Â The first 100 days of a new presidency is symbolically important in the US and is seen as a gauge of how a president will get things done. 'Coronavirus ended our marriage' Dr Fauci apologises for saying UK 'rushed' vaccine US ex-presidents pledge to get vaccinated on film Constitutional experts say a US president has no legal authority to order Americans to wear masks, but Mr Biden said during the interview he and his Vice-President Kamala Harris would set an example by donning face coverings. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading The president's executive authority does cover US government property, and Mr Biden told CNN he intended to exercise such power. ""I'm going to issue a standing order that in federal buildings you have to be masked."" He added: ""Transportation, interstate transportation, you must be masked, airplanes and buses, et cetera.""

The Democratic president-elect said he would be ""happy"" to take a vaccine in public to allay any concerns about its safety. Three former presidents - Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton - have said they are also prepared to be inoculated publicly to show that it is safe. ""People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work,"" Mr Biden said, adding that ""it matters what a president and the vice-president do."" This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Mr Biden's Vice-President-elect Harris, who joined him at the CNN interview, received some criticism from Republicans in September after she said she would not trust Mr Trump's word on a potential vaccine and the assessment of public health experts would be ""suppressed"" under his administration. The Pew Research Center says just 60% of Americans are currently prepared to take a coronavirus vaccine, up from 51% who said the same in September. Pfizer, which says its vaccine is 95% effective in clinical trials, and Moderna, which says its jab is 94% effective, have both applied to the Food and Drug Administration to distribute their drugs in the US. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? In the CNN interview, Mr Biden said he would retain Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, as chief medical adviser to the new administration's Covid-19 team. ""When Dr Fauci says we have a vaccine that is safe, that's the moment in which I will stand before the public and say that,"" Mr Biden said. Earlier on Thursday, Dr Fauci apologised in an interview with the BBC for critical remarks he made about the UK's vaccine approval process. ""I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way,"" he said. A day earlier, Dr Fauci told US networks that UK regulators had ""rushed"" the vaccine approval. This video can not be played Dr Fauci told the BBC: ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint"" The incoming president also mentioned Dr Fauci's stance that ""you don't have to close down the economy"" if Americans follow other safety measures to stop the spread of the virus. He spoke as California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order for much of his state.

Will the borders be Brexit ready?,"For months, the government has been urging businesses to get ready for a new era in trading with the EU. But it was only on Boxing Day that details of all the new rules were actually published. Business groups are relieved that the threat of a no-deal Brexit, which would have meant tariffs (or taxes) on goods crossing the border with the EU, has been removed. But companies that trade with the EU are still facing a lot of new bureaucracy. And the disruption in mid-December, caused by border closures related to the new variant of Covid-19, was a reminder of how dependent the UK economy is on trade across the English Channel. From 1 January 2021, goods entering the EU from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) face large amounts of new paperwork and checks, including: customs declarations rules of origin checks product safety certificates food inspections This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Hauliers will also need to make sure they have the right transportation paperwork before they drive to the border. There is particular focus on the ""short straits"" route between Dover and Calais, and the nearby Channel Tunnel, which taken together handle about four million lorries a year. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" says William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. Full controls on British exports to the EU began on 1 January. Thefirst day of the new regimeappears to have gone relatively smoothly. But it's feared that later in the year, the new controls could cause disruption, even though new border infrastructure has been built at ports such as Calais, to help process vehicles more efficiently. There are some mitigating measures though. In response to the Covid crisis, the government is delaying full controls on goods entering Great Britain from the EU for a further six months. There will be checks from 1 January on controlled substances such as alcohol and tobacco, and traders deemed to be a risk will also be asked to fill in customs declarations. But most checks on goods coming in from the EU will be delayed until 1 July, a deadline that could in theory be extended. ""I think we will want to monitor it,"" the chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, Jim Harra, told MPs in November. ""Hopefully we will not still be in a situation where Covid-19 is consuming as much of people's attention."" Other measures to tackle potential disruption include diverting trade to other ports around the country and opening lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. Some of these contingencies were put into action early, to deal with the Covid border closures in December. Operation Brock, for example, involved changing the layout of a section of the M20, using a concrete barrier to allow lorries heading for mainland Europe to queue safely on the motorway. Thousands of lorries were also diverted to temporary parking at a disused airport at Manston. From 1 January drivers of lorries weighing more than 7.5 tonnes will need to acquire a Kent Access Permit before they enter the county. They will have to show that they have all the paperwork they need to ferry goods to Europe. But that doesn't deal with the challenge of the thousands of vans that cross the Channel every week. ""What has been serially misunderstood by various parts of government is the scale of the complexity for people on the ground dealing with the paperwork,"" says Duncan Buchanan, the Policy Director of the Road Haulage Association. That could mean that instead of queues on motorways, many traders won't be able to leave their depots. ""Either they won't be able to get vets to sign off on their meat exports, or they won't be able to get their permit because they don't have the right bits of paper,"" says Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Storage Federation. ""We might see a quite significant holding off of trading - people just not moving stuff in the first few weeks."" Eighty-five per cent of the volume of trade between the EU and Great Britain is carried by EU hauliers, who are often paid not by the hour, but by the kilometre. If they think there will be too many delays, many may simply not come. The government says the readiness of traders to deal with the new system remains its biggest concern. Lorries parked on the M20 in Kent ""The sheer scale of the overall operation means there are literally many millions of moving parts,"" permanent secretary of the cabinet office Alex Chisholm told MPs. ""Inevitably there are going to be some difficulties for some individual people as they adjust to the new regime."" The government has also announced a new Border Operations Centre as part of plans ""for the UK to have the world's most effective border by 2025"". Questions have been asked about how changes at the border might affect food supply. The short answer is no-one can say for sure, but nearly 30% of all the food consumed in the UK is imported from the EU. The good news is that there is a deal, which makes a big difference. But the challenge is particularly acute because the UK grows relatively small amounts of fruit and vegetables in January and February and is most dependent on supplies from southern Europe at this time of year. So, if there are delays, they could cause some shortages on the shelves. ""Some gaps are possible but we're not going to run out of food - that's not going to happen"" says Ian Wright. When it comes to non-perishable items, there had been some stockpiling in preparation for either outcome, but extra supplies won't last forever. ""The crunch point is probably not going to be in the first few days or weeks of January,"" William Bain argues. ""Towards the end of the month, when new orders start being placed and delivered, we will start to see the processes in Kent and the other ports really tested."" And it's not only about food. Other retailers, which are used to moving their stock freely around the EU customs union, have had to create separate supply chains for the UK. That is costing them more money, and their new systems have yet to be tested properly. It's not just about trade across the English Channel. Trade across the Irish Sea between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland will be subject to the same pressures, while Northern Ireland will be a special case under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. Northern Ireland will remain in the EU single market for goods, and unlike the rest of the UK it will continue to enjoy frictionless trade with the EU with no checks of any kind at the land border with the Republic. But there is a price to pay for that - new bureaucracy within the UK between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU, for example, has strict rules on products of animal origin: meat, milk, fish and eggs. These products must enter the single market (and, from 1 January, Northern Ireland) through a border control post where paperwork is checked, and a proportion of goods physically inspected. There will be a grace period of three months for supermarkets and their suppliers, but some smaller traders may have to get used to thenew rules,externalstraight away. All shipments from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will also need a safety and security declaration, and a customs declaration from a new IT system which none of the traders have used before. The government has set up a Trader Support Service to help. The details of the new trading arrangements for Northern Ireland were announced separately in early December, and provided some clarity. They include an agreement which means the vast majority of goods being shipped from GB to NI will not be at risk of having tariffs imposed. But there are plenty of unresolved issues. Traders are seeking answers about how to send parcels from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, and someonline retailers have already suspended deliveries. The trade from British to Northern Irish ports often involves multiple small shipments on a single lorry - all of which will need the right paperwork. ""We need clear rules for everyone in the supply chain,"" says Duncan Buchanan, ""and when you scratch the surface it is just not ready."" It is expected that many checks will be carried out on a 'light touch' basis to begin with. But anyone trading between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is going to have to get used to a new way of working very quickly. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"UK 'confident' of having 800,000 jabs by next weekAlok Sharma says he expects the doses to arrive for the start of the UK's vaccination programme.UK","The government is ""absolutely confident"" the UK will have 800,000 coronavirus vaccine doses by next week, when the vaccination programme starts, the business secretary has said. Alok Sharma said some of the Pfizer/BioNTech doses had arrived, with more expected by the end of the year. He was unable to say how many that will be. NHS Providers said the UK must work on the basis that more doses beyond this might not arrive ""for some time"". Chief executive Chris Hopsontweeted,externalthat it was ""vital"" hospitals sought to vaccinate as many people as possible in the highest priority groups. He added that with ""every day that goes past, we become more confident we will get a lot more [doses] and get them soon"". It comes as official data showed infection levels werefalling in all English regions, except the North East. The government said the R number - the average number of people each person with Covid-19 goes on to infect - has fallen to between 0.8 and 1 in the UK, from between 0.9 and 1 last week. It also reported that a further 504 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 60,617. First batch of Covid vaccines arrives in the UK First vaccines 'could cut 99% of deaths' - Van-Tam When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the safety checks for vaccines? The first consignment of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccinearrived in the UK on Thursday, though the number of doses has not been confirmed. Asked about whether the 800,000 doses the UK is expecting in the coming days will arrive by next week, Mr Sharma told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We will have - I'm absolutely confident - that we will have 800,000 doses available at the point next week when we start the vaccination programme. ""Of course, by the end of this year we will expect some more doses to come through - I can't give you a number on that."" The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list - which is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - followed by the over-80s and front-line health and care staff. Mr Sharma reiterated that the bulk of the vaccination programme would be carried out next year, adding that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was alsoreviewing the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. This video can not be played Ros Atkins from BBC's Outside Source asks if people will have to be vaccinated against Covid-19 The chief commercial officer for BioNTech, Sean Marett, said there would be more shipments of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which is made in Belgium, next week. He said the first batch arrived on Thursday via the Eurotunnel and they were then transported to a storage facility. Mr Hopson said the vaccines will by now have reached the hospital hubs to enable vaccinations to begin on Tuesday. Hospitals were working out how many care home residents, care home staff and over-80s they can get it to, he said. He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that the vaccine will be delivered to care homes within ""the next 10 to 14 days, but we're going as fast as we can"". Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the JCVI, told The World at One that he understood the elderly in care homes ""might not end up being the first priority group for operational reasons"" and the committee would ""closely monitor this"". He stressed that the JCVI still expected care home residents ""to be prioritised"". This week, Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert,apologised for remarks that seemed to criticise the UK's vaccine approval process. Mr Sharma defended the UK's approach to approving the vaccine, saying the MHRA was ""absolutely meticulous"" and was regarded as a ""gold standard of regulation"" by international scientists. He told Sky News: ""People should be really confident that this vaccine is safe. If it wasn't safe it wouldn't be deployed and I certainly have full confidence in the work the MHRA have done."" Downing Street also defended the UK's medicines regulator, with the prime minister's official spokesman describing the MHRA as a ""world leader in its field"". World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the development of vaccines means ""we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel"" - but added that the organisation was ""concerned that there is a growing perception that the Covid-19 pandemic is over"". TheUK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday.Trial resultssuggest it offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. The vaccine is made in Belgium and has to be stored at around -70C Northern Irelandhas received its first doses of the vaccine.and vaccinations are due to begin on Tuesday morning. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the country expected to receive its first supplies in the coming days and was planning tobegin vaccinating people from Tuesday. He told a coronavirus briefing: ""We hope, of course, this marks a turning point in the pandemic and that it'll put us on to what is going to be a long path back to normality."" But he cautioned that for now the situation in Wales ""remains very serious"" ahead of new national restrictionscoming into force laterto try to curb the spread of the disease.

Meanwhile, scientists have expressed concern about how well rapid lateral flow tests - which provide results in about 20 minutes without the need for a lab - perform in practice. Dr Angela Raffle, a consultant in public health and honorary senior lecturer at the University of Bristol, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the results on how these tests had performed during Liverpool's mass-testing scheme had been ""buried"".

"UK aims to cut emissions by 68% by end of 2030The ""ambitious"" target would see the UK cutting emissions faster than any major economy so far, the PM says.Science & Environment","Meeting the UK's world-leading climate change target will be a ""colossal challenge"", a government spending watchdog has warned. The National Audit Office says it will affect the way we work, travel, heat our homes - even how much meat we eat. In a report,externalit says the cost of cutting CO2 is highly uncertain, but the cost of allowing temperatures to rise would probably be greater. The PM has vowed to cut emissions by 68% by 2030 based on 1990 levels. Making the new pledge, Boris Johnson urged other world leaders to follow with ambitious targets at the virtual climate summit he is hosting on 12 December. The announcement has been broadly welcomed, although scientists say it does not guarantee dangerous climate change will be avoided. They urged Mr Johnson to impose policies to back up his ambitions - currently the UK is slipping behind its existing targets. The PM said: âWe have proven we can reduce our emissions and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process â uniting businesses, academics, NGOs and local communities in a common goal to go further and faster to tackle climate change. âToday, we are taking the lead with an ambitious new target to reduce our emissions by 2030 faster than any major economy. Humans waging 'suicidal war' on nature - UN chief The year 2020 set to be in top three warmest A really simple guide to climate change âBut this is a global effort, which is why the UK is urging world leaders to bring forward their own ambitious plans to cut emissions and set net zero targets.â One of the UKâs leading climate scientists, Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, told BBC News: âMr Johnsonâs target is ambitious â but we need action to back it up, right now. The Treasury recently committed billions towards the HS2 rail link He noted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently committed Â£127bn to the HS2 rail link and new roads - which will both increase emissions - while offering just Â£1bn to home insulation, which would reduce emissions. Prof Hoskins remarked: âThe actions of the chancellor don't measure up. Every single department has to wear climate change glasses when they think of new policies, and the Treasury clearly hasnât got that message.â He and other scientists said even if the UK and other nations keep their promises on cutting emissions there was no guarantee the world would avoid serious heating. âThe world will be increasingly difficult and dangerous with every percentage point of temperature rise,â he said. âThere are important things we donât know for sure. How much more does it take to destabilise Antarctica, for instance? We don't knowâ¦ and the impact could be devastating.â Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ© from the University of East Anglia said if nations matched the UKâs lead âit wonât be a safe climate â but it will be a safer climate than weâd get based on current levels of ambition.â In 2019, total UK greenhouse gas emissions were 45% per cent lower than in 1990. Achieving the new target, a 68% cut, will require the UK working 50% harder than it currently is. Between 2008 and 2018 the energy sector saw the biggest fall in emissions (-62%) as the UK abandoned coal burning. It's followed by the waste sector (-46%) which started capturing methane emissions, and industry (29%) where efficiency improved. Emissions from transport have barely fallen (-3%). Farm emissions are almost static (-2%). A coalition of green groups is urging the government to reach a 75% cut by 2030. And more radical groups such as Extinction Rebellion say the UK should stop emissions almost completely within a few years to be confident of avoiding climate disaster. Research by the London School of Economics (LSE) found that it is economically feasible for UK emissions to be cut by 72%. The government has not costed the range of measures that would be needed, but experts say more homes will need to switch to low-carbon heating. Gas-guzzling SUVs might also be forced off the roads â and frequent fliers taxed more. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which advises government, welcomed the 68% cut, but warned: âThis is more than just a number. âIt should be accompanied by wider climate commitments, including the development of a policy package and net zero strategy to deliver against the UK goal; clear commitments to reduce international aviation and shipping emissions; and greater support for climate finance, particularly for developing countries.â Net zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and balancing any further releases by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. More policies will be revealed if the long-delayed Energy White Paper is published, as expected, before Christmas. The prime ministerâs 68% target represents the UKâs NDC â its nationally determined contribution towards meeting the Paris Agreement. This video can not be played Is it possible to reverse the climate crisis? The BBC's Justin Rowlatt explains NDCs represent the commitments by each country - under the Paris pact - to reduce their own national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The Paris deal, signed in 2016, is aimed at keeping global temperature rise well under 2C, preferably with a maximum rise of 1.5C. Why the UK's carbon-free future will need rules The virtual event Mr Johnson is hosting next week is in place of annual UN climate talks scheduled for Glasgow in November but postponed by a year because of Covid-19. The UK will hold the presidency of next yearâs meeting in partnership with Italy. It is known as COP26 - the 26th Conference of the Parties. Laurence Tubiana, an architect of the Paris Agreement, said: ""This commitment from the prime minister can underpin his personal efforts to seek similar moves from counterparts in the run-up to the Glasgow Summit next year. â(It will need) investments in areas ranging from greener steel production to farming and clean heating technologies, but other countries can draw confidence from Britain's leadership."" The RSPBâs Martin Harper said: âThe UK governmentâs new 2030 climate target will enhance the UKâs leadership credentials. âBut we need to go further and faster, in particular by investing in protecting and restoring habitats such as our peatlands which are so important for locking up carbon.â A UK strategy on conserving peat is long-delayed. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: ""We welcome the important strengthening of the 2030 UK target. But this is the minimum we should aim for."" Peter Simpson, from Anglian Water and co-chair of the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group, said: âCredible plans matter in the race to zero, so todayâs announcement is welcomed. The spotlight is on.â Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said the net zero target was ""daunting"". ""The government hasn't put its own house in order yet or done enough to put the UK on course to meet older, easier targets. It's time to lead by example and shift its efforts up a gear,"" she said.

"Cause of blast that killed four investigatedThree employees and a contractor were killed in the blast at a water recycling centre in Avonmouth.BristolDisruption after 'thundersnow' hits ScotlandHundreds of residents reported hearing explosions in the early hours of Friday caused by the weather phenomenon.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","A witness reported hearing a ""very loud explosion"" at the works in Avonmouth Investigations are continuing into what caused an explosion at a waste water treatment works that killed four people. Three employees of Wessex Water and a contractor were killed in the blast at a water recycling centre in Kings Weston Lane, Avonmouth, on Thursday. The explosion happened at 11:20 GMT in a silo that held treated biosolids. Wessex Water said it was ""absolutely devastated"" and was working with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). A fifth injured person is not thought to be in a life-threatening condition. This video can not be played Avonmouth explosion eyewitness describes the search for missing people Fire crews described a ""very challenging"" scene and used search and rescue dogs in the hunt for casualties following the blast. Colin Skellett, chief executive of Wessex Water, said the company was working with the HSE ""to understand what happened and why"". Biosolids are ""treated sludge"" - a by-product of the sewage treatment process. Wessex Water says the sludge is treated in anaerobic digesters - oxygen-free tanks - to produce agricultural fertiliser and renewable energy. According to Wessex Water, during the sewage treatment process debris is first removed using screens. The sewage flows into tanks where the solids sink to the bottom and are removed as sludge. The sewage is then treated biologically with bacteria that clean the water. Bristol-based waste management service GENeco says biosolids provide a ""cost-effective alternative to bagged fertiliser"". Biosolids can produce flammable methane gas when treated with bacteria, though police could not comment as to whether this was the cause of the explosion. Ch Insp Mark Runacres, from Avon and Somerset Police, said the explosion was not being treated as terror-related and there were not thought to be any ongoing public safety concerns. GMB, the union for Wessex Water workers, has sent ""hopes and prayers"" to the colleagues and families of the four people killed. John Phillips, GMB regional secretary, said it was a ""terrible tragedy"". ""This is another stark reminder of the absolute need to ensure people are able to work in environments where risks to their health and safety are properly controlled,"" he said. ""Whilst the cause of this tragedy is not yet known, it is essential that a full and thorough investigation takes place at the appropriate time."" Flowers have been laid at the scene Unite regional secretary for the south west Steve Preddy said three of its members working at the site were in a ""state of shock"". ""One was on site and nearby and witnessed much of what took place, but he is safe and well,"" he said. ""We have been in touch personally with our other members too, who are thankfully all safe and well, but obviously deeply disturbed and emotionally upset by what has happened."" Darren Jones, MP for Bristol North West, said it was ""the most tragic case in many generations"" to have happened at Avonmouth. He added he will be calling the HSE, the Environment Agency and others ""to ensure that lessons are being learnt so that these situations that shouldn't happen in first place don't happen again"". One witness to the aftermath described hearing a ""boom and echo"" which shook the ground, followed by ""a lot of commotion"". Sean Nolan said: ""It was quite short-lived, I'd say about two or three seconds. Sort of a boom and echo and then it just went quiet. ""That was it. There was no smoke, there was no after-effects of it."" Bristol City Mayor Marvin Rees said the ""thoughts of our city"" were with the families of those who had died. ""This has already been such a challenging year, and this news of further loss of life is another terrible blow. As a city we will mourn for them,"" he added. Are you in the area?

Government to cut Â£1bn from rail budget,"The government has cut Â£1bn from the rail infrastructure budget following the chancellor's Spending Review. Rishi Sunak had previously promised record infrastructure investment as part of the government's ""levelling up"" agenda. Until now, Network Rail's ""enhancement"" budget for the five year period from 2019-24 had been set at Â£10.4bn. But, this week rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said that the budgetwould now be Â£9.4bn,external. That has put a question mark over some long-planned improvements to rail infrastructure. The BBC has contacted the government for comment. The cuts were not mentioned in Spending Review documentation, which stressed record investment in strategic road and rail projects. The shortfall is likely to leave some projects without funding. And the rail industry has raised concerns that the budget could be cut by as much as 10% overall if the government tries to claw back some funding that it was unable to spend this year, partly because of the pandemic. Darren Caplan, the chief executive of the Railway Industry Association, called the Â£1bn cut in funding ""very disappointing"". ""Rail enhancements are essential in ensuring our rail network is fit for the future, improving reliability, connectivity, customer experience and helping to reduce carbon emissions,"" he said. ""Taking our foot off the pedal now on rail investment will not help for when passengers return following the coronavirus pandemic."" Meanwhile, the government is believed to have told the industry to concentrate on so-called ""Northern Powerhouse"" rail and reversing the Beeching cuts, which closed thousands of miles of railway in the sixties. Both plans featured in Boris Johnson's manifesto. Since the start of the pandemic, the government has spent billions subsidising the rail network, so that trains were able to continue running during lockdown, even as commuters stayed at home. So far, the bill has run to more than Â£3.5bn and the Department for Transport has said ""significant"" support will still be needed. In March, the government brought the Northern franchise under state control. Meanwhile, the Welsh government has announced plans to nationalise Transport for Wales' rail services. Ministersconfirmed in Octoberthat they would take over the franchise from KeolisAmey, with day-to-day services set to be run by a publicly-owned company. Although passenger numbers have edged up since lockdown, they are still less than half their pre-pandemic levels. As a result, emergency measures to cover the losses of train firms have been extended by 18 months. They reduce the fees that can be earned by the companies but will mean that trains are still able to run, even with fewer passengers. Rail franchises axed as help for train firms grows What has gone wrong with rail franchising? The day-to-day operating budget of the state owned rail operator covering repairs, renewals and the operations of stations was unaffected. News of the budget cuts comes as the future of the franchise system, under which the railways have been run since privatisation, looks set to be replaced by a system of concessions, tightening the grip of government over the industry.

Here's a reminder of some of the main headlines of the day from the UK.    The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says he is pleased that progress on vaccines means ""we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel"". However, Tedros Adhanom adds the ""WHO is concerned there is a growing perception that the Covid-19 pandemic is over"". ""The truth is that at present, many places are witnessing very high transmission of the Covid-19 virus, which is putting enormous pressure on hospitals, intensive care units and health workers."" In other developments around the world today:  Major Lee Wooten, a World War II veteran from Alabama, has recovered from Covid-19 and made it back home from the hospital just in time to celebrate his 104th birthday. Madison Hospital in Madison, Alabama posted a video of Wooten - known as ""Pop Pop"" - being discharged from the hospital, his wheelchair decorated with balloons, as staff cheer and wave him on. His granddaughter, Holly Wooten McDonald told the Associated Press that her grandfather, ""their family's treasure"", appears to be feeling better. Wooten was drafted into the US Army in 1943 and served as a railroad carpenter stationed in Paris in WWII. Bahrain has recorded 87,000 cases since the pandemic began Bahrain has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine for emergency use authorisation, becoming the second country to approve it after the UK,state media report,external. The countryâs National Health Regulatory
Authority (NHRA) announced the move on Friday, saying it had followed âthorough
analysis and reviewâ of all available data. Earlier this month Bahrain approved the
use of the Sinopharm vaccine for frontline workers. Dr Mariam Al Jalahma, CEO of NHRA said: âThe
approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to
the Kingdomâs national Covid-19 response, which has strongly prioritised
protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic.â Bahrain has recorded 341 deaths and 87,432
cases since the pandemic began. A number of Royal Navy personnel have tested positive for coronavirus at its HMNB Clyde base, also known as Faslane, and are under medical supervision. The Royal Navy said that those identified as close contacts are now isolating. HMNB Clyde, on Gare Loch in Argyll and Bute, is the navy's base for nuclear submarines and hunter-killer submarines. A spike of 96 positive cases were confirmed in the Argyll and Bute council area, where the base is located, today. This is much higher than the area's recent weekly number of positive cases.

Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The recovery in employment continued last
month, after the heavy job losses in the first wave of the pandemic in the US. According to new official data, the
number of people with jobs rose by 245,000 last month and the unemployment rate
declined to 6.7%. But the job creation figure was less than
expected and less than the previous month and is seen by economists as
disappointing.  Almost 15m people said they were unable to work because their employer closed or lost business as a result of the pandemic. Nearly four million others said they couldnât even look for work due to the pandemic. The outlook for jobs in the near future is clouded by rising infections and official restrictions. But recent vaccine developments mean longer term labour market prospects are more upbeat. Yesterday, we covered reports that cyber spies had targeted international organisations involved in the supply chain of coronavirus vaccines. The American technology firm, IBM, said hackers had been trying to access the so-called ""cold chain"" - the delivery chain used to ensure vaccines are kept at the right temperature while being transported. Dr Ian Levy, from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, says his organisation is working to ensure vaccine delivery is as ""protected as can be"" from cyber attacks. ""In April we pivoted our work to better protect the health sector and so there is a massive community effort in protecting the health sector and the vaccine supply chain, all the way from research through to delivery and distribution,"" he tells the BBC. He declined to say which states had been targeting vaccine efforts. Another 16,298 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total to 1,690,432, according to new government figures. There have been another 504 deaths, of people who had a positive test result within the previous 28 days. There have now been 60,617 deaths, under that measure.   Madrid has cancelled its New
Yearâs Eve celebrations including the traditional event in Puerta del Sol
Square where people eat 12 grapes at the stroke of midnight. The event is incredibly popular and watched around the world. The regional government announced the cancellation on Friday, where it also revealed the measures that will be in place during Christmas and New Year. Christmas markets will have their capacity cut, while spectators at Christmas parades, usually held on 5 January, will have to be seated. Earlier this week, Spain's government announced that travel between regions will only be allowed for those visiting family. Gatherings on December 24, 25 and January 1are limited to 10 people.,external Spain is one of the worst affected countries
in Europe. More than 46,000 people have died and more than 1.6 million cases
since the pandemic began. Other European countries also have Christmas restrictions in place.Italy, for example, is banning travel between its regionsfrom 21 December to 6 January. Two coronavirus vaccines are expected to be approved for use in Northern Ireland this week We know that the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived in the UK by Eurostar yesterday, and nowNorthern Ireland reportsthat it has received its first allocation. Nearly 25,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine were delivered to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on Friday morning. Health Minister Robin Swann said confirmation of which groups will get the Covid-19 vaccine first is expected next week. It is thought the seven vaccination centres that have been earmarked, including leisure centres and hospitals, will be used as satellite centres in order to roll out the vaccine to those care homes which are located nearby. Meanwhile,the NI business community has welcomedcomments from the first minister that there will be no further Covid restrictions this side of Christmas. Lockdown restrictions are currently under way in NI - but It has now been announced that they will be loosened from 00.01 GMT on Friday 11 December. Non-essential retail and some parts of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland can reopen.

Some forms of PPEcould be decontaminated to make them reusablein an emergency measure, scientists have found. Cardiff University said some types of respirators could be effectively decontaminated in just 90 seconds by industrial-grade microwave ovens or using dry heat. It is not a safe method to use at home, the research team warned. Reporting their findings in the Journal of Hospital Infection, the study found that using an industrial-grade microwave oven, and a baby bottle steriliser containing water, could dramatically increase the number of respirators available to staff. This could allow the reuse of some PPE when stocks are low.

A war against coronavirus and a war against stupidity. The Chief Medical Officer at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston went viral earlier this week when an image of him comforting an elderly patient ended up on social media. The US is seeing a surge in the number of people entering hospital with Covid-19, and several states are concerned that health care facilities could soon be overwhelmed. As coronavirus spread across the US last month, health officials urged people to refrain from travel to see friends and family over the Thanksgiving holiday. But data shows that millions of Americans ignored these calls. While air travel was much lower than in previous years, airports still reported some of their busiest days since the start of the pandemic. The US Transportation Security Administration said it had screened over one million passengers on several days during the holiday period. Experts have warnedthe US could see ""surge upon surge"" of Covid-19cases as a result, while the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned that even a small number of infected travellers could lead to hundreds of thousands of new infections. Meanwhile vehicle travel surged around Thanksgiving, peaking at only around 5% less than last year, according to transport analytics firm Streetlight Data. The company's founder, Laura Schewel,told the Associated Press,externalthat this showed ""people were less willing to change their behaviour than any other day during the pandemicâ. Officials have made similar calls for people to avoid travel over Christmas and New Year period, as hospitalisation numbers soar to record highs.

We've got more details here on what the R number is in different regions of the UK here: Meanwhile, the growth rate, which estimates how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day, is between -3% and -1% for the UK as a whole. That means the number of new infections is shrinking by between 1% and 3% every day. There's more on the latest stats here. Pauline Demaline was fit and healthy and only 56 years old when she fell ill with Covid-19 in March. But within days of going into hospital she had died. She worked as a parish administrator at the Holy Trinity parish church in Skipton, North Yorkshire, and it may be here that she caught the virus, in the early days of the pandemic. She and her husband, Nigel, were very careful. They didn't go out much and Nigel would do the shopping early in the day, when the shops were quiet. But Pauline had to go into work and would sometimes meet other parishioners - couples about to get married, for example, and their parents. Now, Nigel has spoken about how the personal tragedy prompted him to volunteer for one of the many Covid vaccines in trials. Read the full article here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Singer challenges Stormont on theatre reopening,"Theatres and concert venues in Northern Ireland have not been given a date to reopen for audiences One of Northern Ireland's leading performers has said he ""can't get my head around"" why there has not been a plan to allow venues and theatres to reopen safely. Peter Corry was giving evidence about the effect of Covid-19 restrictions on the arts to a Stormont committee. He also said many young people were ""struggling mentally"" as arts and performance classes had been cancelled. Theatres and concert venues havenot yet been given a date to reopen. Assembly members (MLAs) on the Communities Committee were also told that Â£29m in emergency funding for arts, culture and heritage has all been allocated. As well as performing, Mr Corry runs a production company and is the artistic director of Belfast Performing Arts School. ""Like many, in March our diaries completely disappeared,"" he told MLAs. ""Everything that we had lined up for the year has gone. ""We are down to about 20% of what we thought we would have brought in in 2020."" Peter Corry said imaginative ways should be found ""to open up performances"" Mr Corry said he could not understand why there was not a plan to allow venues to open and performances to resume safely, even with limited capacity. ""I found it very confusing, like many people in my sector, how whenever restaurants and pubs opened, when they did open up and people were allowed to socially distance and sit beside total strangers, that wasn't applied to concerts and theatres,"" he told MLAs. ""I still can't get my head around that, especially when it was then shown that singing was no more dangerous than speaking at the same volume. ""We need the support to find imaginative ways to open up performance."" Ministers have previously insisted that the rules on what can and cannot open are the safest way to avoid the spread of Covid-19 and are evidence-based. Mr Corry also said the effect of restrictions had been ""hugely difficult"" for teachers and pupils at Belfast Performing Arts School. ""Many teachers have been utterly confused about what they can do and what they can't,"" he said. ""As a result, classes are cancelled no matter the size of the class or safety or suitability. ""That's to the detriment, not just to the livelihoods of the teachers, but also to the mental wellbeing of the students. ""I've spoken to many young people and many pupils in my school and they are struggling mentally with the uncertainty and the lack of routine, the inability to do what they enjoy most. ""For many young people, performing is the one place they feel they belong."" Mr Corry said online lessons worked ""to a certain extent"" but could not replace physical classes. ""I'm concerned that we are at a point where pupils are starting to disengage due to the lack of physical classes. ""Parents are also concerned about the amount of time their children are spending in front of a screen."" About Â£29m of emergency funding for the arts, culture, heritage and languages wasagreed by the Stormont executive in September. Officials from the Department for Communities (DfC) told MLAs on the committee that all of that funding had now been allocated to a number of schemes but not all had yet been spent. ""It is important to say that all of the funding has been allocated to distribution bodies,"" Joanna Gray from DfC told the committee. ""So there isn't any funding that is still sitting around waiting to have approvals or policy decisions made about it. ""It's just a case now of those delivery bodies making assessments of applications.""

Matrix 4 and Dune to go straight to streamingWarner Bros says its 2021 films will be available to stream in US at same time as they hit cinemas.Business,"Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson star in Dune Odeon owner AMC is in ""urgent talks"" with Warner Bros after the film maker said all releases would be available to stream instantly in the US. The move will enable film fans to watch the forthcoming sci-fi epic Dune and the Matrix sequel on HBO Max at the same time as their cinema release. It has escalated tensions between Hollywood and US movie theatres. Both studios and chains are desperate to rebuild revenues after virus control measures closed cinemas. The new releases will be available on the service, which is not yet available in the UK, for one month after release. HBO Max is set to launch in Europe in the second half of next year, according to its global boss Andy Forssell. The releases are also expected to include Godzilla vs Kong, Mortal Kombat and The Suicide Squad. Earlier this year, assertive action by AMC successfully curbed a similar screening plan by rival Hollywood studio, Universal. Cinemas are desperate for content to lure viewers back with new entertainment that can initially only be seen on their screens. Typically, new releases are shown exclusively at cinemas for months. AMC had agreed to allow one film, Wonder Woman 1984, to be shown simultaneously on HBO Max, the streaming service owned by its ultimate parent company AT&T. Is the era of the Hollywood blockbuster over? Twelve films to watch in December AMC boss Adam Aron, said: ""These coronavirus-impacted times are uncharted waters for all of us, which is why AMC signed on to an HBO Max exception to customary practices for one film only, Wonder Woman 1984, being released by Warner Brothers at Christmas when the pandemic appears that it will be at its height."" Keanu Reeves will reprise his role as Neo in The Matrix 4 It accused Warner Bros of subsidising its HBO Max by its move: ""We will do all in our power to ensure that Warner does not do so at our expense. We will aggressively pursue economic terms that preserve our business. ""We have already commenced an immediate and urgent dialogue with the leadership of Warner on this subject."" This video can not be played As ever more people sign up to streaming services, are fewer going to the movies? Ann Sarnoff, chair and chief executive of WarnerMedia Studios, said the pandemic called for ""creative solutions"". ""No one wants films back on the big screen more than we do,"" she said. ""We know new content is the lifeblood of theatrical exhibition, but we have to balance this with the reality that most theatres in the US will likely operate at reduced capacity throughout 2021."" AMC banned all Universal films after the studio said it would release new movies at home and on the big screen on the same day. The two firms eventually agreed that Universal films can go to digital services after just 17 days of viewing in cinemas. Explaining Warner Bros' decision, Ms Sarnoff said the ""unique one-year plan"" would give ""moviegoers who may not have access to theatres, or aren't quite ready to go back to the movies, the chance to see our amazing 2021 films"". ""We see it as a win-win for film lovers and exhibitors, and we're extremely grateful to our filmmaking partners for working with us on this innovative response to these circumstances.""

LiveLiveUK âgoing to do really wellâ with vaccine â Fauci3 minutes ago,"The reproduction or R number of UK virus transmission has fallen to between 0.8 and 1, the second week running it's been below 1 Virus levels are falling across most of England - except the North East - and in all age groups, the Office for National Statistics says The UK is ""confident"" it will have 800,000 coronavirus vaccine doses by next week, with immunisations starting on Tuesday The first consignment of Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine arrived in the UK on Thursday - with a total of 40 million doses on order The business secretary called Britain's medical regulator ""absolutely meticulous"", as US diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci apologised for appearing to criticise it Meanwhile, US President-elect Joe Biden has said he will ask Americans to wear masks for his first 100 days in office The French PM has called for the âbiggest number possibleâ to get themselves vaccinated in an âaltruistic actâ to fight Covid-19 From Friday evening, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Wales will be banned from serving alcohol - and will have to close at 18:00 GMT every evening Edited by Helier Cheung and Holly Wallis That's it for our live coverage today. It was
brought to you by our teams from the UK and US. The writers were Joshua
Cheetham, Francesca Gillett, Lauren Turner, Sophie Williams and Holly
Honderich, and the editors were Helier Cheung and Holly Wallis. Thanks for joining us as we've brought you the latest coronavirus news. Here's a reminder of some of the main headlines of the day from the UK.    The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says he is pleased that progress on vaccines means ""we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel"". However, Tedros Adhanom adds the ""WHO is concerned there is a growing perception that the Covid-19 pandemic is over"". ""The truth is that at present, many places are witnessing very high transmission of the Covid-19 virus, which is putting enormous pressure on hospitals, intensive care units and health workers."" In other developments around the world today:  Major Lee Wooten, a World War II veteran from Alabama, has recovered from Covid-19 and made it back home from the hospital just in time to celebrate his 104th birthday. Madison Hospital in Madison, Alabama posted a video of Wooten - known as ""Pop Pop"" - being discharged from the hospital, his wheelchair decorated with balloons, as staff cheer and wave him on. His granddaughter, Holly Wooten McDonald told the Associated Press that her grandfather, ""their family's treasure"", appears to be feeling better. Wooten was drafted into the US Army in 1943 and served as a railroad carpenter stationed in Paris in WWII. Bahrain has recorded 87,000 cases since the pandemic began Bahrain has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine for emergency use authorisation, becoming the second country to approve it after the UK,state media report,external. The countryâs National Health Regulatory
Authority (NHRA) announced the move on Friday, saying it had followed âthorough
analysis and reviewâ of all available data. Earlier this month Bahrain approved the
use of the Sinopharm vaccine for frontline workers. Dr Mariam Al Jalahma, CEO of NHRA said: âThe
approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to
the Kingdomâs national Covid-19 response, which has strongly prioritised
protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic.â Bahrain has recorded 341 deaths and 87,432
cases since the pandemic began. A number of Royal Navy personnel have tested positive for coronavirus at its HMNB Clyde base, also known as Faslane, and are under medical supervision. The Royal Navy said that those identified as close contacts are now isolating. HMNB Clyde, on Gare Loch in Argyll and Bute, is the navy's base for nuclear submarines and hunter-killer submarines. A spike of 96 positive cases were confirmed in the Argyll and Bute council area, where the base is located, today. This is much higher than the area's recent weekly number of positive cases.

Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The recovery in employment continued last
month, after the heavy job losses in the first wave of the pandemic in the US. According to new official data, the
number of people with jobs rose by 245,000 last month and the unemployment rate
declined to 6.7%. But the job creation figure was less than
expected and less than the previous month and is seen by economists as
disappointing.  Almost 15m people said they were unable to work because their employer closed or lost business as a result of the pandemic. Nearly four million others said they couldnât even look for work due to the pandemic. The outlook for jobs in the near future is clouded by rising infections and official restrictions. But recent vaccine developments mean longer term labour market prospects are more upbeat. Yesterday, we covered reports that cyber spies had targeted international organisations involved in the supply chain of coronavirus vaccines. The American technology firm, IBM, said hackers had been trying to access the so-called ""cold chain"" - the delivery chain used to ensure vaccines are kept at the right temperature while being transported. Dr Ian Levy, from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, says his organisation is working to ensure vaccine delivery is as ""protected as can be"" from cyber attacks. ""In April we pivoted our work to better protect the health sector and so there is a massive community effort in protecting the health sector and the vaccine supply chain, all the way from research through to delivery and distribution,"" he tells the BBC. He declined to say which states had been targeting vaccine efforts. Another 16,298 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total to 1,690,432, according to new government figures. There have been another 504 deaths, of people who had a positive test result within the previous 28 days. There have now been 60,617 deaths, under that measure.   Madrid has cancelled its New
Yearâs Eve celebrations including the traditional event in Puerta del Sol
Square where people eat 12 grapes at the stroke of midnight. The event is incredibly popular and watched around the world. The regional government announced the cancellation on Friday, where it also revealed the measures that will be in place during Christmas and New Year. Christmas markets will have their capacity cut, while spectators at Christmas parades, usually held on 5 January, will have to be seated. Earlier this week, Spain's government announced that travel between regions will only be allowed for those visiting family. Gatherings on December 24, 25 and January 1are limited to 10 people.,external Spain is one of the worst affected countries
in Europe. More than 46,000 people have died and more than 1.6 million cases
since the pandemic began. Other European countries also have Christmas restrictions in place.Italy, for example, is banning travel between its regionsfrom 21 December to 6 January. Two coronavirus vaccines are expected to be approved for use in Northern Ireland this week We know that the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived in the UK by Eurostar yesterday, and nowNorthern Ireland reportsthat it has received its first allocation. Nearly 25,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine were delivered to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on Friday morning. Health Minister Robin Swann said confirmation of which groups will get the Covid-19 vaccine first is expected next week. It is thought the seven vaccination centres that have been earmarked, including leisure centres and hospitals, will be used as satellite centres in order to roll out the vaccine to those care homes which are located nearby. Meanwhile,the NI business community has welcomedcomments from the first minister that there will be no further Covid restrictions this side of Christmas. Lockdown restrictions are currently under way in NI - but It has now been announced that they will be loosened from 00.01 GMT on Friday 11 December. Non-essential retail and some parts of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland can reopen. Hazel ShearingBBC News When Bethany Wakenshaw started her nursing course this year, she could ask for practical advice from her teachers in person as she practised CPR and other life support skills. But after coronavirus cases began to rise again across the UK, her classes moved online last month. Despite the teaching staff's best efforts, she finds online learning frustrating. ""It's so hard to concentrate when you're in your own room because they can't see you,"" she says. ""Even quickly checking your phone for five seconds can turn into being on your phone for 10 minutes.""

Some forms of PPEcould be decontaminated to make them reusablein an emergency measure, scientists have found. Cardiff University said some types of respirators could be effectively decontaminated in just 90 seconds by industrial-grade microwave ovens or using dry heat. It is not a safe method to use at home, the research team warned. Reporting their findings in the Journal of Hospital Infection, the study found that using an industrial-grade microwave oven, and a baby bottle steriliser containing water, could dramatically increase the number of respirators available to staff. This could allow the reuse of some PPE when stocks are low.

A war against coronavirus and a war against stupidity. The Chief Medical Officer at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston went viral earlier this week when an image of him comforting an elderly patient ended up on social media. The US is seeing a surge in the number of people entering hospital with Covid-19, and several states are concerned that health care facilities could soon be overwhelmed. As coronavirus spread across the US last month, health officials urged people to refrain from travel to see friends and family over the Thanksgiving holiday. But data shows that millions of Americans ignored these calls. While air travel was much lower than in previous years, airports still reported some of their busiest days since the start of the pandemic. The US Transportation Security Administration said it had screened over one million passengers on several days during the holiday period. Experts have warnedthe US could see ""surge upon surge"" of Covid-19cases as a result, while the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned that even a small number of infected travellers could lead to hundreds of thousands of new infections. Meanwhile vehicle travel surged around Thanksgiving, peaking at only around 5% less than last year, according to transport analytics firm Streetlight Data. The company's founder, Laura Schewel,told the Associated Press,externalthat this showed ""people were less willing to change their behaviour than any other day during the pandemicâ. Officials have made similar calls for people to avoid travel over Christmas and New Year period, as hospitalisation numbers soar to record highs.

place. From Saturday, people will have to remain in their home from 18:30 until
08:00. Shops will remain open, however they must close by 18:00. On weekends, a full lockdown will be in place. The territory's healthcare system is severely strainedand ill-equipped as a result of conflict, blockade and a political rift

What are the new Covid restrictions in Wales?,"In Wales people are still out and about shopping, but what is happening over the border? Wales ""could not suppress coronavirus"" after its firebreak lockdown and must act now, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has insisted. It comes as new national restrictions come into force in Wales later to try and curb the spread of Covid-19. New rules include a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol on the premises. They come in to force at 18:00 GMT and will be reviewed on 17 December, ahead ofUK-wide rules over Christmas. The Welsh Government faced a backlash for the new rules from business owners and other political parties. Plaid Cymru said hospitality was ""paying the price"" for a lack of stricter measuresafter the firebreak lockdown ended on 9 November. The Conservative leader in the Senedd, Paul Davies, said the national approach was unfair on areas with low Covid rates. But speaking on Friday, Mr Gething said without action, more people would die. Cases ""would rise"" without the rules, said Vaughan Gething ""This is really about the fact we couldn't suppress coronavirus after the firebreak, and we then have a responsibility as a government,"" Mr Gething toldBBC Breakfast. ""We either act, and act in way we know causes harm, or we don't act in this way and we accept much greater harm and much great loss of life that could be avoided."" The health minister said coronavirus cases went down duringthe 17-day firebreak lockdown in October and Novemberbut cases have now ""gone up and up"". The case rate is currently 237.9 case per 100,000 in Wales, higher than before the firebreak. Meanwhile, the latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests infections have stopped falling in Wales. The ONS takesthroat and nose swab tests from more than 19,500 people at random in Wales over six weeks.,external From the results, it can estimate that 18,100 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 28 November, 1,700 more than the week before. This is one in 170 people or 0.60% of the population. The ONS said ""our modelling suggests, in the most recent week, the percentage of those testing positive is no longer decreasing in Wales"". Mr Gething added: ""I don't enjoy these measures having to be introduced, but if we don't we can be confident - terribly confident, I'm afraid - that cases would rise and more of our people would not be here."" The Welsh Government has said the decision to stop bars and pubs serving alcoholwas backed by evidence it has published from its scientific advisors,external, and supported by evidence from the UK advisory groupsSage,external. Q&A: Can people from Wales go to England to drink? What is the evidence for new hospitality rules? How many more Covid deaths in Wales? People will now be able to travel between Wales and England'stier one and two areas again, after a ban on non-essential travel was put in place following the firebreak lockdown ending on 9 November. Travel into tier three zones is still prohibited Licensed pubs, cafes and restaurantswill have to stop serving alcohol. Those with an off-licence can sell alcoholic drinks to take away. They will have to close at 18:00 every day until further notice but can operate a takeaway service for food and drink after 18:00 However, the rule allowingfour people from four different householdsto meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place Only people you have formed an extended household (or bubble) with can come into your home, except in very limited circumstances, such as tradespeople having to undertake work Cinemas, bowling alleys, bingo halls, soft-play areas, casinos, museums, galleries and heritage sites, and other indoor entertainment venues will be forced to shut - outdoor visitor attractions will not be affected International travel will be permitted again but the government advises against it unless ""essential"". People will also be subject toexisting 14-day quarantine rules on return, depending on where you've been. The Welsh Government said it would provide an extra Â£340m to support businesses affected by the tougher restrictions One venue has had less than a week to take their annual Christmas event outside Simon Pickard, owner of Silver Mountain Experience in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, said the situation was ""ongoing and difficult"", having closed a large number of the activities they offer, including the over and underground tours, and would now have to move their Christmas event outside He said he was still unsure what the restrictions would be on 17 December and had incurred costs for outdoor equipment at a time when income was low. ""We lost all our business in the October half-term from the firebreak lockdown, which was a real first blow. We were promised everything would open up for Christmas and now we're in the same situation."" He called the rules disproportionate and said they were not reflective of the situation in Wales. ""We understand the health issues as everyone does but we feel that the restrictions have not been targeted to the right areas and not based on any real science. It has felt like a knee-jerk reaction.""

Government to 'redefine treasure finds' in UK,"A Roman figurine found near Chelmsford, Essex, in 2014, would now be classed as treasure Plans aimed at protecting newly-uncovered treasure in England and Wales have been unveiled by the government. Changes to the 1996 Treasure Act will see artefacts defined as treasure if they are of historical or cultural significance. They are intended to ensure significant artefacts are not lost to the public and will instead be able to go on display in museums. The move follows the growth in popularity of metal detecting. V&A snaps up 600-year-old brooch found on farm What is it like to find 'treasure'? Finder 'had no idea coin was worth Â£10k' Under the pre-existing rules, objects are classified as treasure if they are found to be more than 300 years old, made of gold or silver, or found with artefacts made of precious metals. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said a number of Roman finds on UK soil had not met the current criteria for the definition of treasure. ""The search for buried treasures by budding detectorists has become more popular than ever before and many ancient artefacts now see the light of day in museums' collections,"" said culture minister Caroline Dinenage. ""However it is important that we pursue plans to protect more of our precious history and make it easier for everyone to follow the treasure process."" Once they have officially been identified as treasure they become the property of the Crown and can be acquired by museums for public display. Rise in illegal metal detecting at historic sites The DCMS said the new rules would have protected discoveries like that of a Roman figurine, depicting a British person, found near Chelmsford, Essex, in 2014.

It was
brought to you by our teams from the UK and US. The writers were Joshua
Cheetham, Francesca Gillett, Lauren Turner, Sophie Williams and Holly
Honderich, and the editors were Helier Cheung and Holly Wallis. Thanks for joining us as we've brought you the latest coronavirus news. Here's a reminder of some of the main headlines of the day from the UK.    The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says he is pleased that progress on vaccines means ""we can now start to see the light at the end of the tunnel"". However, Tedros Adhanom adds the ""WHO is concerned there is a growing perception that the Covid-19 pandemic is over"". ""The truth is that at present, many places are witnessing very high transmission of the Covid-19 virus, which is putting enormous pressure on hospitals, intensive care units and health workers."" In other developments around the world today:  Major Lee Wooten, a World War II veteran from Alabama, has recovered from Covid-19 and made it back home from the hospital just in time to celebrate his 104th birthday. Madison Hospital in Madison, Alabama posted a video of Wooten - known as ""Pop Pop"" - being discharged from the hospital, his wheelchair decorated with balloons, as staff cheer and wave him on. His granddaughter, Holly Wooten McDonald told the Associated Press that her grandfather, ""their family's treasure"", appears to be feeling better. Wooten was drafted into the US Army in 1943 and served as a railroad carpenter stationed in Paris in WWII. Bahrain has recorded 87,000 cases since the pandemic began Bahrain has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech
vaccine for emergency use authorisation, becoming the second country to approve it after the UK,state media report,external. The countryâs National Health Regulatory
Authority (NHRA) announced the move on Friday, saying it had followed âthorough
analysis and reviewâ of all available data. Earlier this month Bahrain approved the
use of the Sinopharm vaccine for frontline workers. Dr Mariam Al Jalahma, CEO of NHRA said: âThe
approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to
the Kingdomâs national Covid-19 response, which has strongly prioritised
protecting the health of all citizens and residents during the pandemic.â Bahrain has recorded 341 deaths and 87,432
cases since the pandemic began. A number of Royal Navy personnel have tested positive for coronavirus at its HMNB Clyde base, also known as Faslane, and are under medical supervision. The Royal Navy said that those identified as close contacts are now isolating. HMNB Clyde, on Gare Loch in Argyll and Bute, is the navy's base for nuclear submarines and hunter-killer submarines. A spike of 96 positive cases were confirmed in the Argyll and Bute council area, where the base is located, today. This is much higher than the area's recent weekly number of positive cases.

Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent The recovery in employment continued last
month, after the heavy job losses in the first wave of the pandemic in the US. According to new official data, the
number of people with jobs rose by 245,000 last month and the unemployment rate
declined to 6.7%. But the job creation figure was less than
expected and less than the previous month and is seen by economists as
disappointing.  Almost 15m people said they were unable to work because their employer closed or lost business as a result of the pandemic. Nearly four million others said they couldnât even look for work due to the pandemic. The outlook for jobs in the near future is clouded by rising infections and official restrictions. But recent vaccine developments mean longer term labour market prospects are more upbeat. Yesterday, we covered reports that cyber spies had targeted international organisations involved in the supply chain of coronavirus vaccines. The American technology firm, IBM, said hackers had been trying to access the so-called ""cold chain"" - the delivery chain used to ensure vaccines are kept at the right temperature while being transported. Dr Ian Levy, from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, says his organisation is working to ensure vaccine delivery is as ""protected as can be"" from cyber attacks. ""In April we pivoted our work to better protect the health sector and so there is a massive community effort in protecting the health sector and the vaccine supply chain, all the way from research through to delivery and distribution,"" he tells the BBC. He declined to say which states had been targeting vaccine efforts. Another 16,298 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total to 1,690,432, according to new government figures. There have been another 504 deaths, of people who had a positive test result within the previous 28 days. There have now been 60,617 deaths, under that measure.   Madrid has cancelled its New
Yearâs Eve celebrations including the traditional event in Puerta del Sol
Square where people eat 12 grapes at the stroke of midnight. The event is incredibly popular and watched around the world. The regional government announced the cancellation on Friday, where it also revealed the measures that will be in place during Christmas and New Year. Christmas markets will have their capacity cut, while spectators at Christmas parades, usually held on 5 January, will have to be seated. Earlier this week, Spain's government announced that travel between regions will only be allowed for those visiting family. Gatherings on December 24, 25 and January 1are limited to 10 people.,external Spain is one of the worst affected countries
in Europe. More than 46,000 people have died and more than 1.6 million cases
since the pandemic began. Other European countries also have Christmas restrictions in place.Italy, for example, is banning travel between its regionsfrom 21 December to 6 January. Two coronavirus vaccines are expected to be approved for use in Northern Ireland this week We know that the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived in the UK by Eurostar yesterday, and nowNorthern Ireland reportsthat it has received its first allocation. Nearly 25,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine were delivered to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on Friday morning. Health Minister Robin Swann said confirmation of which groups will get the Covid-19 vaccine first is expected next week. It is thought the seven vaccination centres that have been earmarked, including leisure centres and hospitals, will be used as satellite centres in order to roll out the vaccine to those care homes which are located nearby. Meanwhile,the NI business community has welcomedcomments from the first minister that there will be no further Covid restrictions this side of Christmas. Lockdown restrictions are currently under way in NI - but It has now been announced that they will be loosened from 00.01 GMT on Friday 11 December. Non-essential retail and some parts of the hospitality sector in Northern Ireland can reopen. Hazel ShearingBBC News When Bethany Wakenshaw started her nursing course this year, she could ask for practical advice from her teachers in person as she practised CPR and other life support skills. But after coronavirus cases began to rise again across the UK, her classes moved online last month. Despite the teaching staff's best efforts, she finds online learning frustrating. ""It's so hard to concentrate when you're in your own room because they can't see you,"" she says. ""Even quickly checking your phone for five seconds can turn into being on your phone for 10 minutes."" Bethany is one of dozens of students who have taken to social media to vent their concerns ahead of allteaching having to move online by 9 December in England, ahead of the Christmas holidays.For students in Wales, all lectures went online yesterday. For those who are struggling - whether at uni or elsewhere - we've put together five tips to get better at learning online, from sorting out your room to learning with mates.Read more here.  Some forms of PPEcould be decontaminated to make them reusablein an emergency measure, scientists have found. Cardiff University said some types of respirators could be effectively decontaminated in just 90 seconds by industrial-grade microwave ovens or using dry heat. It is not a safe method to use at home, the research team warned. Reporting their findings in the Journal of Hospital Infection, the study found that using an industrial-grade microwave oven, and a baby bottle steriliser containing water, could dramatically increase the number of respirators available to staff. This could allow the reuse of some PPE when stocks are low. This video can not be played Coronavirus: US doctor who has worked 258 days straight goes viral Dr Joseph Varon believes he is fighting two wars. A war against coronavirus and a war against stupidity. The Chief Medical Officer at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston went viral earlier this week when an image of him comforting an elderly patient ended up on social media. The US is seeing a surge in the number of people entering hospital with Covid-19, and several states are concerned that health care facilities could soon be overwhelmed. As coronavirus spread across the US last month, health officials urged people to refrain from travel to see friends and family over the Thanksgiving holiday. But data shows that millions of Americans ignored these calls. While air travel was much lower than in previous years, airports still reported some of their busiest days since the start of the pandemic. The US Transportation Security Administration said it had screened over one million passengers on several days during the holiday period. Experts have warnedthe US could see ""surge upon surge"" of Covid-19cases as a result, while the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned that even a small number of infected travellers could lead to hundreds of thousands of new infections. Meanwhile vehicle travel surged around Thanksgiving, peaking at only around 5% less than last year, according to transport analytics firm Streetlight Data. The company's founder, Laura Schewel,told the Associated Press,externalthat this showed ""people were less willing to change their behaviour than any other day during the pandemicâ. Officials have made similar calls for people to avoid travel over Christmas and New Year period, as hospitalisation numbers soar to record highs. Read more:Millions travel for Thanksgiving despite warnings A partial lockdown is set to come into effect in Gaza on
Saturday, with mosques, schools, universities and kindergartens set to close, amid a
surge in cases. High schools and nurseries will remain open, the interior
ministry said in a statement. Under the new measures, a night time curfew will also be in
place. From Saturday, people will have to remain in their home from 18:30 until
08:00. Shops will remain open, however they must close by 18:00. On weekends, a full lockdown will be in place. The territory's healthcare system is severely strainedand ill-equipped as a result of conflict, blockade and a political rift
with the rival West-Bank based Palestinian Authority. Around
88% of hospital beds with ventilators for Covid-19 patients in critical
condition are already occupied, theGaza health ministry said on Wednesday night,external. Earlier, we brought you the news that the R number for the UK had fallen slightly to between 0.8 and 1 - the second week running it's been below 1. We've got more details here on what the R number is in different regions of the UK here: Meanwhile, the growth rate, which estimates how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day, is between -3% and -1% for the UK as a whole. That means the number of new infections is shrinking by between 1% and 3% every day. There's more on the latest stats here. Pauline Demaline was fit and healthy and only 56 years old when she fell ill with Covid-19 in March. But within days of going into hospital she had died. She worked as a parish administrator at the Holy Trinity parish church in Skipton, North Yorkshire, and it may be here that she caught the virus, in the early days of the pandemic. She and her husband, Nigel, were very careful. They didn't go out much and Nigel would do the shopping early in the day, when the shops were quiet. But Pauline had to go into work and would sometimes meet other parishioners - couples about to get married, for example, and their parents. Now, Nigel has spoken about how the personal tragedy prompted him to volunteer for one of the many Covid vaccines in trials. Read the full article here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Police issue 'thundersnow' reassurance,"This video can not be played The sound of thundersnow is heard across parts of Scotland Police Scotland has reassured residents in Edinburgh after hundreds of people reported being woken by the sound of explosions. However, police said that what people were actually hearing was the phenomenon known as ""thundersnow"". Two ""extraordinarily loud"" thunder claps were heard over the capital just before 05:00. The snow caused disruption across many areas, including temporarily closing the Queensferry Crossing. This video can not be played BBC Weather presenter Nick Miller explains how thundersnow happens BBC weather forecaster Gemma Plumb said snow had also fallen overnight and on Friday morning across parts of northern and eastern England as well as on the high ground of south west England and Wales. Further snow was expected to continue falling in the afternoon in northern England and Wales and in parts of the Midlands and Scotland, but would become increasingly confined to higher ground. There could also be some snow on the high ground of the rest of Wales, south west England and perhaps Northern Ireland in the afternoon, with much of the UK having outbreaks of rain - and potentially sleet or snow on higher ground later on Friday. And there will be a chance of ice in some areas - particularly in the south east of England. A number of yellow warnings for ice and snow are in place across large areas of Scotland and Northern Ireland and stretch down into North Yorkshire. In pictures: Snowy scenes in many parts of UK The coldest night of the autumn/winter so far was recorded at Altnaharra in the Highlands, where temperatures dipped to -9.6C (14.72F). Some residents in Midlothian, including in Penicuik and Loanhead, reported what they thought was a bomb exploding or a building collapse. The sound, which is created when thunder and lightning combine with a heavy snowstorm, also caused dozens of car alarms to go off. Allow Twitter content?

After receiving a number of calls, Police Scotland took to Twitter to reassure residents that there was no need to be alarmed. ""We have received a number of calls regarding people concerned about explosions heard. ""Please do not be alarmed, we are currently experiencing thunder and lightning,"" a tweet from their control room said. Saoirse Morton, 19, in Leith, was up late listening to music when she heard the thundersnow. ""I heard what I thought was an explosion so I started looking for a factory nearby that could have exploded,"" she said. ""I just sat for 10 seconds in shock before checking on my pets. I was convinced something had exploded. I messaged some friends on Facebook and said something had exploded and they said 'no, no it's thunder and lightning' and started trying to convince me. I took some convincing."" The noise heard in Kirkcaldy was ""crazy"", according to Leanne Duffy Anne Ash, who lives in Edinburgh, told the BBC the ""extremely loud noise"" woke her up. She described it as sounding ""a bit like a sonic boom"". ""I leapt out of bed and ran to the window and saw it was snowing quite heavily. ""My husband said it was thunder and I was unsure so googled it and learned the term 'thundersnow'. ""A little while later there was a second loud boom which went for a bit longer."" She said the weather later quietened down, and the snow was starting to melt away. The noise was also heard in Fife, with Leanne Duffy tweeting that it was ""crazy"" to hear the phenomenon. The snowfall has also caused issues on the area's roads, with the Queensferry Crossing closed for several hours in both directions on Friday morning because of falling ice and snow. However, it reopened at about 08:30. How do you stop ice falling from bridge cables? Some schools and nurseries have been closed due to the wintry weather. In the Highlands, 10 primaries, two secondary schools and seven nurseries have been closed for the day, affecting almost 2,000 pupils. A small number of schools in Aberdeenshire, Moray and Dumfries and Galloway were closed due to the adverse weather. In the Scottish Borders, schools were open but some bus services were not operating. ScotRail also warned,externalthat train journeys across multiple routes were facing ""significant disruption"", and asked passengers to check their plans before setting off. Snowfall in the North East - including in Banchory, pictured - led to police warning motorists of dangerous driving conditions Parts of Ayrshire also saw snow fall, including in Cumnock Forecasters have warned that Friday will be a cold and windy day across the UK, with spells of rain, sleet and snow -  mainly over the north and east of the country. In the north east of Scotland, police warned of dangerous driving conditions on the A93 and the B993. And in Ayrshire, officers urged people to take extra care on the roads because of the snow. Also in the east of the country, the A70 Lanark Road West, just after Balerno, was closed after an articulated lorry got stuck due to the weather. How do you stop ice falling from bridge cables?

UK appoints entrepreneur as first tech envoy to US,"The UK has appointed an entrepreneur as its first technology envoy to the United States and consul-general to San Francisco. Joe White has worked for 20 years in the digital sector, including as a Silicon Valley investor. It is the first time the two roles have been combined and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the move underlined the UK's commitment to the tech sector. Mr White said it was an honour to represent the UK at a ""critical time"". The Foreign Office said he had extensive experience as an entrepreneur and venture capital investor and most recently worked as a general partner at tech fund Entrepreneur First. He was made an MBE in 2017 for services to technology businesses. Mr Raab said: ""The UK and the US are the largest investors in each other's economies and this important appointment further underlines our commitment to the tech sector. ""I am delighted Joe will take on this enhanced role as we look to build back better and support an innovative post-pandemic global economy."" Mr White said: ""It is an honour to represent the UK at this critical time, and a pleasure to support our world renowned tech sector which continues to go from strength to strength. ""I am looking forward to working closely with UK government tech teams in the US and in the UK, to further our growing and important relationship with the US tech community."" Mr White will take up his appointment later this year and report to the British ambassador to the US. Diplomacy was once about nation talking unto nation. Well, not anymore. For power these days is held not just by countries but also by corporations - especially the technology giants in California. So the UK has decided it needs a technology envoy to represent Britain to the likes of Apple and Amazon, Google and Facebook. Our new man in Silicon Valley, Joe White, is not a smooth-talking Foreign Office lifer but a successful technology entrepreneur. His job will be to engage with the technology sector, spot commercial opportunities and support collaboration on everything from trade to research and development. His biggest challenge, however, may be defending the interests of millions of Britons whose daily lives are shaped by these powerful firms and their ubiquitous products.

Big cat mauls volunteer at Tiger King sanctuaryCarole Baskin's Big Cat Rescue said the volunteer had broken rules by sticking her hand in the cage.,"The Florida sanctuary owned by Carole Baskin (pictured) was featured on Tiger King A tiger ""nearly tore"" off the arm of a volunteer at a big cat sanctuary in Florida that featured in the Netflix series Tiger King. Candy Crouser, 69, a volunteer at Big Cat Rescue - the animal refuge made famous by Tiger King character Carole Baskin - was injured on Thursday. In a statement, the sanctuary said Ms Crouser was hurt after Kimba, a male tiger rescued from Guatemala, bit her. She broke protocols by sticking her hand into his cage, it added. Ms Crouser, who had been with the sanctuary for five years, had arrived for feeding to find that the tiger was ""locked in a section that was away from where he was usually fed"",the statement,externalsaid. After reaching inside to unlatch a door, the tiger ""grabbed her arm and nearly tore it off at the shoulder"". The statement added: ""Candy said she just wasn't thinking when she reached in to un-clip it [the door]."" The rush to make Tiger King spin-offs and sequels Tiger King star Lowe accused of animal cruelty Netflix Tiger King doc âlies to get viewersâ Bystanders used a belt as a tourniquet, and packed ice around Ms Crouser's arm in an effort to save it. Ambulance workers arrived to transport her to hospital in around 20 minutes, the statement adds. Kimba was rescued from a Guatemalan circus Ms Crouser was still conscious after the attack, ""and insisted that she did not want Kimba Tiger to come to any harm for this mistake"". The organisation added that her arm had been broken in three places and that her shoulder had been ""badly damaged"". The tiger is being kept in quarantine for 30 days as a precaution, Big Cat Rescue said, adding, ""but [he] was just acting normal due to the presence of food and the opportunity"". The incident came as the US House of Representatives passed a law 272-114 on Thursday that would ban private big cat ownership and the handling of young cubs. The Big Cat Public Safety Act was championed by Ms Baskin and Big Cat Rescue, which cited Thursday's incident as evidence for why the law must be passed. It ""confirms the inherent danger in dealing with these animals and why we need the Big Cat Public Safety Act to eliminate having them untracked in backyards around the country and ending up in sanctuaries"", the group said. The Tampa-based sanctuary is home to over 50 exotic cats including lions, bobcats and servals.

Singer challenges MLAs on theatre reopening plans,"Theatres and concert venues in Northern Ireland have not been given a date to reopen for audiences One of Northern Ireland's leading performers has said he ""can't get my head around"" why there has not been a plan to allow venues and theatres to reopen safely. Peter Corry was giving evidence about the effect of Covid-19 restrictions on the arts to a Stormont committee. He also said many young people were ""struggling mentally"" as arts and performance classes had been cancelled. Theatres and concert venues havenot yet been given a date to reopen. Assembly members (MLAs) on the Communities Committee were also told that Â£29m in emergency funding for arts, culture and heritage has all been allocated. As well as performing, Mr Corry runs a production company and is the artistic director of Belfast Performing Arts School. ""Like many, in March our diaries completely disappeared,"" he told MLAs. ""Everything that we had lined up for the year has gone. ""We are down to about 20% of what we thought we would have brought in in 2020."" Peter Corry said imaginative ways should be found ""to open up performances"" Mr Corry said he could not understand why there was not a plan to allow venues to open and performances to resume safely, even with limited capacity. ""I found it very confusing, like many people in my sector, how whenever restaurants and pubs opened, when they did open up and people were allowed to socially distance and sit beside total strangers, that wasn't applied to concerts and theatres,"" he told MLAs. ""I still can't get my head around that, especially when it was then shown that singing was no more dangerous than speaking at the same volume. ""We need the support to find imaginative ways to open up performance."" Ministers have previously insisted that the rules on what can and cannot open are the safest way to avoid the spread of Covid-19 and are evidence-based. Mr Corry also said the effect of restrictions had been ""hugely difficult"" for teachers and pupils at Belfast Performing Arts School. ""Many teachers have been utterly confused about what they can do and what they can't,"" he said. ""As a result, classes are cancelled no matter the size of the class or safety or suitability. ""That's to the detriment, not just to the livelihoods of the teachers, but also to the mental wellbeing of the students. ""I've spoken to many young people and many pupils in my school and they are struggling mentally with the uncertainty and the lack of routine, the inability to do what they enjoy most. ""For many young people, performing is the one place they feel they belong."" Mr Corry said online lessons worked ""to a certain extent"" but could not replace physical classes. ""I'm concerned that we are at a point where pupils are starting to disengage due to the lack of physical classes. ""Parents are also concerned about the amount of time their children are spending in front of a screen."" About Â£29m of emergency funding for the arts, culture, heritage and languages wasagreed by the Stormont executive in September. Officials from the Department for Communities (DfC) told MLAs on the committee that all of that funding had now been allocated to a number of schemes but not all had yet been spent.

Exam replacements must 'stand test of time',"A decision to scrap next summer's exams was made in Wales last month The man responsible for working out the details of next year's exam assessments in Wales says he hopes pupils and teachers will get clarity by January. Former head teacher Geraint Rees said his group's ambition is to deliver both fairness to students and qualifications which ""stand the test of time"". GCSE, A-level and AS exams will be replaced by assessments in 2021 due to Covid-19 disruption. Mr Rees said the qualifications must be ""worth what they say on the tin"". The senior education consultant is chair of the design and delivery group, tasked by the Welsh Government with working out details of the assessments. Education Minister Kirsty Williamsdecided last month to scrap exams in 2021 because of fears there would not be a level playing field due to the pandemic. School heads and college principals are also part of the 15-strong group, aimed at making sure there is both fair deal for students but also integrity in the qualifications themselves. Mr Rees, a former head teacher of Ysgol Plasmawr in Cardiff, said students needed to know their qualifications were ""worth what it said on the tin and that I worked hard for it."" He said some adjustments would be made to reflect the disruption but the core of each subject had to remain and pupils needed to learn and understand them. The eventual assessments will be ""copper-bottomed"" ones that can be signed off by Qualifications Wales and everybody in the system could say they knew what they were doing and ""what we did was right for learners and what they receive in the summer will stand the test of time"". He expects the group to pass its recommendations to the education minister by the end of the month. ""My hope is in January, everyone will have clarity around what it means for them and what the next few months will look like in terms of teaching, learning and assessment,"" said Mr Rees. ""For young people, the only advice I'd give is keep learning and keep driving yourself forward and it's everyone else's job to make sure the system is fair and reflects the circumstances we're in."" Q&A: What does Wales scrapping 2021 exams mean? The life-changing exam that won't stop for a pandemic Pupils to be told which exam topics they will face In England,extra measures were announced on Thursdayto ""boost fairness and support students"" for next summer's GCSE and A-level exams, which are going ahead there. More generous grading, advance notice of exam topics and ""second chance"" exams in July have been promised there to make up for the disruption faced by students during the pandemic. Cancelling exams answered one big question but it posed many others. They include: What exactly is meant by ""teacher-managed classroom-based assessments"" and what else will count towards grades? Over to the design and delivery advisory group with the big task of building a detailed model before Christmas. How courses will be assessed is one thing, how the A*s, Cs, and Es compare with this and other years is another. In England, where exams are still planned for next year, grades are set to be awarded in line with last summer. How grading is decided here is bound to take account of that. Qualifications Wales said it was continuing to ""work closely"" with regulators in England and Northern Ireland to protect ""the interests of learners in Wales"". Former university vice-chancellor and higher education consultant Sir Deian Hopkin said he did not feel any differences between the nations would harm students' chances at university. ""I am under no doubt at all that universities are going to accept students from Wales just as they always have,"" he said. ""The reality is students come in all shapes and sizes and universities make all sorts of offers, sometimes with no conditions attached at all. ""Universities are competing for students. The student numbers have dropped and Brexit is about to hit us. ""The reality is universities are very glad to get as many students as they can and therefore I think Welsh students will be just as attractive to them - exam or not.""

I'm A Celeb brings in over Â£1m for Welsh economy,"I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here has brought in over Â£1m to Wales' economy, say the owners of the castle hosting the reality TV show. This year's series, which finishes on Friday, is being filmed at Gwrych Castle, near Abergele, Conwy. The castle's trust insisted local firms were employed as part of the deal to use the Grade I listed building. One local coach company said the work had been a ""lifeline"" during the coronavirus pandemic. TV presenter Vernon Kay, author and podcast presenter Giovanna Fletcher and radio DJ Jordan North are inFriday night's finalafter Eastenders actor Shane Richie was voted out on Thursday night.

""The programme is one of the biggest TV productions in Europe, and that's been reflected in the number of people on site and the amount of money that's been spent in the area,"" said Mr Baker. ""Local companies have supplied everything from the t-shirts the celebrities are wearing to the bags of castle coins that they win in their daily challenges. ""All in all, we've counted up to 50 Welsh businesses involved just in getting the castle ready for filming."" Liz Castro said working with the show has meant a 'hectic few weeks' Liz Castro runs Place2Print in Llandudno, and printed the t-shirts, clothing and accessories worn by the celebrity contestants. The timing could not have been better, having been forced to close earlier in the year due to the pandemic. ""It's really exciting.

""It's been a hectic few weeks, but we've been working with an amazing bunch of people. ""We had to move fast and get everything ready at speed when the names of the celebrities were confirmed. ""People may not realise, but all the celebrities have name tags in their sleeping bags and on their water bottles, so they know which is theirs. We printed them all. A few miles away from Gwrych Castle, Voel Coaches has described the programme as a ""lifeline"".

""We run excursions and holidays and our business was almost non-existent after March. We suddenly found ourselves having to refund everyone. ""But in the last few months, we've been able to create jobs and take on new staff. It is still tough, but this work means we will get through.

Now or never for trade deal,"Talks appeared to be going late into the evening as the pizzas arrived in Westminster Whether they were double pepperonis, Hawaiians, or even just basic cheese and tomato, there was a tell-tale suggestion tonight that the Brexit negotiating teams were hard at it. They don't work late into the night if there is nothing to talk about, and if there is no pressure. So a delivery of boxes and boxes of pizza arriving at the venue where the talks are taking place in central London suggest, at least, they believe there is stuff that's worth chewing over (sorry) and that needs to be concluded urgently. And while I have every sympathy if you read this and just feel you have seen it all before, there is more than just the takeaway that tells us it's nearly now or never. Are both sides running out of road for a Brexit deal? What happens next with Brexit? After months and months, and yes, months of talks, several sources have told me on Wednesday that the process is likely to be concluded in the next few days. One ambassador told me there was a hope the agreement could be finalised on Friday, with another diplomatic source confirming a deal at the end of this week is a possibility - suggesting the agreement is basically done, even though ""it could all still fall apart"". As my colleague, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler, wrote earlier, the EU chief negotiator updated the bloc's members in a video call today, and it's certainly the case there are nerves on that side about how much he might give away. It's certainly not the case though the negotiators have managed to find ingenious solutions to every single issue raised in these vast talks that will placate both sides 100%. But there are two very good reasons - aside from whispers from those involved - that a conclusion is now very near. There is a real fear that the deal, if it's done, can't be turned into law in time unless that process starts by the middle of next week. The deal will have to go through Parliament here, and in the EU, before the transition period ends in a few weeks' time. There's always been a mythical threat around this - and be wary of a politician claiming a deadline - but simply, given the number of days that Parliament is due to sit between now and the end of the year, it becomes pretty much impossible unless it gets going next week. It is also the case that if there isn't a deal, which still could come to pass, then ministers are worried about scrambling to get businesses prepared to cope with what might happen. They are concerned about that frankly in any case, because even with an agreement, a big change is on the way. But one cabinet minister confident that a deal will be done by early next week, told me Boris Johnson had become increasingly worried about reaping the political consequences of failing to reach a deal - he doesn't want queues of lorries in Kent to be blamed on him. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. There is another technical reason for speed now, as alongside that, the government plans to bring in a new Taxation Bill and continue its fight over the UK Internal Market Bill soon too. The first might make an appearance in the middle of next week, and happilythe BBC's economics editor, Faisal Islam, has written about it here. And the UKIM -that caused such a stink over ministers' admissions that it could lead them to breach international law - is likely to be back in the Commons the week after next. Those draft laws could provoke such a storm in the EU - essentially undermining the deal the UK did with Brussels last year - that they could torpedo the talks at the last moment. Two well-placed EU sources were clear in conversation today that if the government pressed ahead with the controversial clauses in those bits of legislation before a deal had been done, it would kill the chances stone dead. But, despite nudges and winks around the place that the process is nearly there, despite the solid reasons that point to a finale in the next few days, there is still a question about whether the two sides have ever come to understand each other. One minister involved in one of the tricky aspects of the talks is absolutely adamant the EU was still being downright unreasonable. One member state source told me that it feels like ""doing a pre-nup agreement"", adding: ""We want a long and stable marriage, but Boris Johnson is trying to get enough freedom to cheat."" It seems like the two sides are just about ready to commit. But the mantra we have learned in this last four years is as instructive as it was at the start - ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" - and more pizza nights might still be required. P.S. If a deal is done, then as I mentioned, it will have to then pass through Parliament, which will throw up its own intrigue. There is likely, of course, to be some belly aching among the true believers in the Brexit camp. There have been fears about Boris Johnson conceding too much, so don't expect there to be no pushback. But given this time last year Tory MPs were elected on their promise to ""Get Brexit Done"", it seems unlikely - unless the deal is a true shocker from their point of view - that the prime minister will have significant trouble from his own side. What will also be interesting to watch, however, is how Labour responds. Most of the party's MPs thought the idea of leaving the EU was crackers, and their leader, Sir Keir Starmer, was one of the strongest voices pushing for another referendum. But, given the choice in Parliament before them will hypothetically be between a deal or not having an agreement at all, it seems most likely they will choose to back an agreement and move on. However, there is likely to be tension over the decision, with some senior voices perhaps pushing to abstain. P.P.S. It's worth saying that theoretically there might not have to be a vote on the treaty. But the government has already made it clear that there will be legislation that will need at least one vote, and in fact likely a whole series of votes. It is not clear exactly what kind of votes there will be, and as it's Parliament and Brexit, there's probably likely to be a row about exactly how it unfolds. But from a political point of view, both Labour and the Tories are already discussing whether to back 'the deal', even though the process once it hits the Commons may be more complex than that.

Brexit: Will the borders be ready?,"For months, the government has been urging businesses to get ready for a new era in trading with the EU. But it was only on Boxing Day that details of all the new rules were actually published. Business groups are relieved that the threat of a no-deal Brexit, which would have meant tariffs (or taxes) on goods crossing the border with the EU, has been removed. But companies that trade with the EU are still facing a lot of new bureaucracy. And the disruption in mid-December, caused by border closures related to the new variant of Covid-19, was a reminder of how dependent the UK economy is on trade across the English Channel. From 1 January 2021, goods entering the EU from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) face large amounts of new paperwork and checks, including: customs declarations rules of origin checks product safety certificates food inspections This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Hauliers will also need to make sure they have the right transportation paperwork before they drive to the border. There is particular focus on the ""short straits"" route between Dover and Calais, and the nearby Channel Tunnel, which taken together handle about four million lorries a year. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" says William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. Full controls on British exports to the EU began on 1 January. Thefirst day of the new regimeappears to have gone relatively smoothly. But it's feared that later in the year, the new controls could cause disruption, even though new border infrastructure has been built at ports such as Calais, to help process vehicles more efficiently. There are some mitigating measures though. In response to the Covid crisis, the government is delaying full controls on goods entering Great Britain from the EU for a further six months. There will be checks from 1 January on controlled substances such as alcohol and tobacco, and traders deemed to be a risk will also be asked to fill in customs declarations. But most checks on goods coming in from the EU will be delayed until 1 July, a deadline that could in theory be extended. ""I think we will want to monitor it,"" the chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, Jim Harra, told MPs in November. ""Hopefully we will not still be in a situation where Covid-19 is consuming as much of people's attention."" Other measures to tackle potential disruption include diverting trade to other ports around the country and opening lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. Some of these contingencies were put into action early, to deal with the Covid border closures in December. Operation Brock, for example, involved changing the layout of a section of the M20, using a concrete barrier to allow lorries heading for mainland Europe to queue safely on the motorway. Thousands of lorries were also diverted to temporary parking at a disused airport at Manston. From 1 January drivers of lorries weighing more than 7.5 tonnes will need to acquire a Kent Access Permit before they enter the county. They will have to show that they have all the paperwork they need to ferry goods to Europe. But that doesn't deal with the challenge of the thousands of vans that cross the Channel every week. ""What has been serially misunderstood by various parts of government is the scale of the complexity for people on the ground dealing with the paperwork,"" says Duncan Buchanan, the Policy Director of the Road Haulage Association. That could mean that instead of queues on motorways, many traders won't be able to leave their depots. ""Either they won't be able to get vets to sign off on their meat exports, or they won't be able to get their permit because they don't have the right bits of paper,"" says Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Storage Federation. ""We might see a quite significant holding off of trading - people just not moving stuff in the first few weeks."" Eighty-five per cent of the volume of trade between the EU and Great Britain is carried by EU hauliers, who are often paid not by the hour, but by the kilometre. If they think there will be too many delays, many may simply not come. The government says the readiness of traders to deal with the new system remains its biggest concern. Lorries parked on the M20 in Kent ""The sheer scale of the overall operation means there are literally many millions of moving parts,"" permanent secretary of the cabinet office Alex Chisholm told MPs. ""Inevitably there are going to be some difficulties for some individual people as they adjust to the new regime."" The government has also announced a new Border Operations Centre as part of plans ""for the UK to have the world's most effective border by 2025"". Questions have been asked about how changes at the border might affect food supply. The short answer is no-one can say for sure, but nearly 30% of all the food consumed in the UK is imported from the EU. The good news is that there is a deal, which makes a big difference. But the challenge is particularly acute because the UK grows relatively small amounts of fruit and vegetables in January and February and is most dependent on supplies from southern Europe at this time of year. So, if there are delays, they could cause some shortages on the shelves. ""Some gaps are possible but we're not going to run out of food - that's not going to happen"" says Ian Wright. When it comes to non-perishable items, there had been some stockpiling in preparation for either outcome, but extra supplies won't last forever. ""The crunch point is probably not going to be in the first few days or weeks of January,"" William Bain argues. ""Towards the end of the month, when new orders start being placed and delivered, we will start to see the processes in Kent and the other ports really tested."" And it's not only about food. Other retailers, which are used to moving their stock freely around the EU customs union, have had to create separate supply chains for the UK. That is costing them more money, and their new systems have yet to be tested properly. It's not just about trade across the English Channel. Trade across the Irish Sea between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland will be subject to the same pressures, while Northern Ireland will be a special case under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. Northern Ireland will remain in the EU single market for goods, and unlike the rest of the UK it will continue to enjoy frictionless trade with the EU with no checks of any kind at the land border with the Republic. But there is a price to pay for that - new bureaucracy within the UK between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU, for example, has strict rules on products of animal origin: meat, milk, fish and eggs. These products must enter the single market (and, from 1 January, Northern Ireland) through a border control post where paperwork is checked, and a proportion of goods physically inspected. There will be a grace period of three months for supermarkets and their suppliers, but some smaller traders may have to get used to thenew rules,externalstraight away. All shipments from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will also need a safety and security declaration, and a customs declaration from a new IT system which none of the traders have used before. The government has set up a Trader Support Service to help. The details of the new trading arrangements for Northern Ireland were announced separately in early December, and provided some clarity. They include an agreement which means the vast majority of goods being shipped from GB to NI will not be at risk of having tariffs imposed. But there are plenty of unresolved issues. Traders are seeking answers about how to send parcels from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, and someonline retailers have already suspended deliveries. The trade from British to Northern Irish ports often involves multiple small shipments on a single lorry - all of which will need the right paperwork. ""We need clear rules for everyone in the supply chain,"" says Duncan Buchanan, ""and when you scratch the surface it is just not ready."" It is expected that many checks will be carried out on a 'light touch' basis to begin with. But anyone trading between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is going to have to get used to a new way of working very quickly. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Breakthrough chance 'recedes' as UK-EU talks go on,"EU negotiator Michel Barnier is staying in London for talks, rather than returning to Brussels, as planned The UK and the EU have resumed talks on post-Brexit trade in London, with time running out to achieve a deal. A senior UK government source said the prospects of a breakthrough were ""receding"" and accused the EU of making ""11th-hour"" demands. But a Brussels source denied this, with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier calling Friday an ""important day"". Both sides have to agree and ratify any deal by 31 December, when the current rules on EU-UK trade end. If they do not, they will do business on World Trade Organization rules, meaning the introduction of tariffs, or taxes on imports. Kuenssberg: Have talks taken a turn for the worse? What happens next with Brexit? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is a level playing field? The negotiating teams are seeking compromises in key areas - including fishing rights and business competition rule - in time for EU leaders to discuss them at a summit scheduled for Thursday. And, rather than returning to Brussels as planned on Friday, Mr Barnier is staying in London to continue discussions. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Business Secretary Alok Sharma told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the talks were ""in a difficult phase"". He added that the UK must be recognised as ""a sovereign and independent nation"" and it was ""on the basis of that that a deal will be done"". This video can not be played Business Secretary Alok Sharma said ""time is short"" on Brexit negotiations Fishing rights remain a major area of contention between the UK and France - one of the EU's most powerful members. France's Europe minister, Clement Beaune, warned that his government could ""veto"" any deal reached between the UK and EU, if it did not satisfy his country's demands. But European Council President Charles Michel urged the EU's 27 member states to maintain ""unity"" as negotiations continue. With Brexit, talks don't just go to the wire. They go beyond it. Remember, the UK left the EU nearly a year after it was intended. So the fact it's taking this long to reach a trade deal shouldn't come as a shock. But there really is pressure in the next few days to declare ""deal or no deal"". On Monday, the Internal Market Bill returns to the Commons. It would allow the UK to sidestep aspects of the agreement that was reached to leave the EU - and break international law in a ""limited and specific way"". Brussels has warned the government that this could scupper a trade deal. That aside, any deal would have to be ready before EU leaders are invited to sign it off at a summit on Thursday. It doesn't augur well that the UK and EU are even disagreeing about their disagreements. The government says Brussels has hardened its position on how competition rules are policed; the EU counters that it has made no new demands. But it's not surprising that both sides are crying ""ouch"" as the thorniest issues are now being grasped. But while No 10 talks of ""setbacks"", it hasn't yet said negotiations have broken down. While discussions between both sides continue, the prospect of a deal is still possible. Any deal would have to be signed off by the European and UK Parliaments before it can come into force. It could also require eventual ratification in the 27 EU national parliaments, depending on the contents. The UK and EU have been in negotiation since March to determine their future relations once the UK's Brexit transition period - under which it still follows most of the EU's rules - ends in less than four weeks' time. Fishing is a tiny part of the overall economy on both sides of the Channel, but it has a political importance which allows it to punch well above its weight in these negotiations. It was a big part of the Leave campaign in the run-up to the Brexit referendum in 2016, and it is a totemic issue for those who argue that national sovereignty must be fully regained. But it's a sensitive issue in other countries as well. French President Emmanuel Macron will want to win regions with big fishing communities in the next presidential election in 2022. And any proposed deal needs the agreement of all EU countries - it can't just be signed off by the European Commission. Read more here What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks?

Have talks taken turn for the worse?,"Michel Barnier and his team were working late into the night with their UK counterparts To do business with each other from January, the UK and the EU agree there will have to be some shared rules. It's called the level playing field, if you want to use the jargon, andyou can read about it in all the detail you want here. But again and again, the two sides have clashed over who should be in charge of the rules and, particularly, what happens if things go wrong. Alongside who gets to catch fish in whose waters, this part of the talks has been the most problematic. Late on Wednesday though, there were signs that a deal was nearly concluded. 'Prospect of breakthrough receding' in UK-EU talks It's nearly now or never for UK-EU trade deal The pizzas fuelled the negotiators into what seemed like a good place -you can read about the state of play last night here. A swift deal was not inevitable, but it certainly felt like the jigsaw pieces were lining up, with sources on both sides of the Channel agreeing that agreement on Friday or Saturday could be very lightly pencilled in. But after another day of talks on Thursday, just before 19:00 GMT, things seemed to take a turn for the worse. UK sources said the talks had ""gone back 24 hours"", claiming the EU has toughened its stance on an independent regulator to police what happens if the shared rules and regulations are broken, and things go wrong. A senior government source told the BBC: ""At the eleventh hour, the EU is bringing new elements into the negotiation. A breakthrough is still possible in the next few days but that prospect is receding."" It's been claimed that the French government has been leading a charge for a more robust system of oversight, trying to push the UK into a position they cannot accept. An EU source told the BBC the talks were in difficulty and had become ""extremely sluggish"", confirming that the main point of tension was over enforcing the rules and regulations. But another EU insider suggested the UK might just be posturing, and that there was bafflement at the suggestion anything new was put on the table - the theatrics, perhaps, in the closing moments of the negotiations. Frankly, at the moment, it is extremely hard to work out exactly what is going on - although we know for sure the negotiators are still hard at it (Thursday's food delivery was from the food chain Leon.) Every Brexit negotiation has had last minute dramas, where very often, just in the nick of time, victory is snatched from the jaws of defeat. It's true that both sides want a deal. It's also true that both sides can see the shape of a possible deal. But when there is so much at stake, taking it for granted that it will happen is quite an assumption to make.

UK appoints entrepreneur as first tech envoy to USJoe White will also act as consul-general to San Francisco when he takes on the role later this year.,"The UK has appointed an entrepreneur as its first technology envoy to the United States and consul-general to San Francisco. Joe White has worked for 20 years in the digital sector, including as a Silicon Valley investor. It is the first time the two roles have been combined and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the move underlined the UK's commitment to the tech sector. Mr White said it was an honour to represent the UK at a ""critical time"". The Foreign Office said he had extensive experience as an entrepreneur and venture capital investor and most recently worked as a general partner at tech fund Entrepreneur First. He was made an MBE in 2017 for services to technology businesses. Mr Raab said: ""The UK and the US are the largest investors in each other's economies and this important appointment further underlines our commitment to the tech sector. ""I am delighted Joe will take on this enhanced role as we look to build back better and support an innovative post-pandemic global economy."" Mr White said: ""It is an honour to represent the UK at this critical time, and a pleasure to support our world renowned tech sector which continues to go from strength to strength. ""I am looking forward to working closely with UK government tech teams in the US and in the UK, to further our growing and important relationship with the US tech community."" Mr White will take up his appointment later this year and report to the British ambassador to the US. Diplomacy was once about nation talking unto nation. Well, not anymore. For power these days is held not just by countries but also by corporations - especially the technology giants in California. So the UK has decided it needs a technology envoy to represent Britain to the likes of Apple and Amazon, Google and Facebook. Our new man in Silicon Valley, Joe White, is not a smooth-talking Foreign Office lifer but a successful technology entrepreneur. His job will be to engage with the technology sector, spot commercial opportunities and support collaboration on everything from trade to research and development. His biggest challenge, however, may be defending the interests of millions of Britons whose daily lives are shaped by these powerful firms and their ubiquitous products.

"Minister: UK got jab first as it's better countryThe EU says vaccines are not a ""football competition"" after Gavin Williamson's comment.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Williamson: 'We are a much better country' for approving vaccine The UK is getting a coronavirus vaccine first because it is a ""much better country"" than France, Belgium and the US, says the education secretary. Some UK ministers claim Brexit speeded the process up - but Gavin Williamson said it was down to having superior medical experts. On Wednesday the UK's medical regulator was the first to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use. The EU said it was ""definitely not in the game of comparing regulators"". A source close to Mr Williamson said that his intention had been to ""praise the scientific brilliance of the regulator, but he is known to be enthusiastically patriotic and that enthusiasm clearly shone through in what was a broadly light-hearted conversation with the studio host"". The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's decision means the vaccine will start to be rolled out to the most vulnerable people from next week. People will need two doses, three weeks apart, so the vaccination project is expected to take several months to complete. Reality Check: Did Brexit speed up the UK's vaccine approval? Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week How does the Pfizer vaccine work? PM hails vaccine but warns it is 'not game over' Speaking to LBC radio on Thursday,,externalMr Williamson said: ""I just reckon we've got the very best people in this country and we've obviously got the best medical regulator, much better than the French have, much better than the Belgians have, much better than the Americans have. ""That doesn't surprise me at all, because we're a much better country than every single one of them."" This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given He said the UK had a ""real competitive advantage, but do you know who it's down to? It's down to those brilliant, brilliant clinicians in the regulator who've made it happen so fast, so our thanks go out to them because by doing what they've done, they're going to have saved lives."" But European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said the MHRA's experts are ""very good"" but ""we are definitely not in the game of comparing regulators across countries, nor on commenting on claims as to who is better"". ""This is not a football competition, we are talking about the life and health of people,"" he said. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Concern over vaccine deployment to care homes Conservative peer Lord Forsyth said it was ""disappointing to see some folk trying to make political capital out of the brilliant vaccine news"". ""Frankly it's just unseemly and we should just be united in our thanks to those responsible for this breakthrough and the hope it brings to every person on the planet,"" the former Scotland Secretary wrote in a tweet.

And some have expressed concern that the UK approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine too quickly. Dr Anthony Fauci, who is leading the response to the pandemic in the US,told Fox News that the US Food and Drug Administration was being more careful.and suggested the UK's process had been ""rushed"". ""The way the FDA is, our FDA is doing it, is the correct way,"" Dr Fauci said. ""We really scrutinize the data very carefully to guarantee to the American public that this is a safe and efficacious vaccine."" This video can not be played Dr Fauci told the BBC: ""I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint"" But he later rowed back on his claims, saying he had a ""great deal of confidence"" in the UK's scientific and regulatory standards and he had not meant to ""imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way"". ""Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK,"" he told the BBC. ""And that's just the reality."" Both the MHRA and the EU have rejected Health Secretary Matt Hancock's claim that Brexit allowed the UK to ""speed up"" doing ""all the same safety checks and the same processes"" as the EU. The MHRA's chief executive, Dr June Raine, said on Wednesday that ""we have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January"".
