South Africans fear impact of new variant measures,"Travellers to London from Johannesburg were being tested on Friday morning but flights have now been suspended South Africans have responded sharply to the news that the UK, and a growing list of other countries, have reacted to the emergence of a new Covid variant with red-listings and travel bans. While there is genuine pride here in the country's scientific expertise, and the speed with which South Africa has been able to identify and share information about new variants, there is also a strong sense that the nation is being unfairly punished for its successes. ""The world should provide support to South Africa and Africa and not discriminate or isolate it,"" said Prof Tulio de Oliveira, the Durban-based scientist leading efforts to understand the new variant. In a series of tweets,external, he pointed out that South Africa has been ""very transparent with scientific information. We did this to protect our country and the world in spite of potentially suffering massive discrimination."" South Africa has a sophisticated monitoring infrastructure that allows it to do the sequencing work effectively. Prof de Oliveira urged ""billionaires and financial institutions"" to help the country cope with the economic damage caused by new travel restrictions. South Africa's Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor was also quick to condemn the UK's travel ban, describing it as ""rushed"" and damaging to tourism and business, and urging the UK government ""to reconsider this decision"". News of the flight bans has caused inevitable frustration among many South Africans who had hoped to see visiting friends and family over the southern hemisphere summer holidays in December. South Africa was one of the last countries to have previously been removed from the red list last month.

""My sister just got on the flight [from London] but I think she'll be staying here for a long time. We were just getting on our feet again with tourism, and this is going to just kill it."" ""The new ban is a knee-jerk reaction of the UK government that puts airlines, hotels, travel businesses and travellers in a very difficult situation,'' said Otto de Vries, CEO of South Africa's travel agents' association, Asata. One industry analysis estimated that South Africa lost 26 million rand ($1.6m; Â£1.2m) for every day it spent on the UK's red list. ""The UK being our largest inbound international market, last night's news by the British government has caused widespread disbelief and disappointment amongst our hospitality industry as we enter our peak festive season period,"" said Rosemary Anderson, national chairperson of the Federated Hospitality Association of South Africa. Overall, tourism employs 2.8 million people and in 2018 it earned the country about $8bn (Â£6bn). The variant was first sequenced in neighbouring Botswana, and then in South Africa's capital, Pretoria. That was where a group of students, exactly how many is not known, took PCR tests which all contained an anomaly that prompted experts to send their samples to Prof de Oliviera's Durban laboratory for genome sequencing. ""His team then found all these mutations. So we've only know about it for a few days, and because it's a new variant we have no idea how it will actually behave,"" said Prof Salim Karim, former chair of the South African government's Covid advisory committee. ""All we can do is extrapolate some of the likely behaviour based on previous similar mutations. But we do know that it spreads fast - we've seen how rapidly it spread in Pretoria. It sky-rocketed."" From a relatively low base, the numbers of confirmed cases in South Africa have shot up this week - from less than 700 on Sunday to almost 2,500 on Thursday. It is believed the increase is largely down to the new variant. South Africa's vaccination programme has slowed in recent months - not because of a lack of supplies, but due to public indifference. An estimated 42% of the population has had at least one jab. But roughly two-thirds of those aged over 60 have been vaccinated. Experts are hopeful that the variant may help encourage more people to get jabbed. The government has urged people to come forward, saying: ""Let us crush the power of the new variant by vaccinating to limit the number of mutations."" ""It's going to be a shock to the system. I think it can have a positive effect [on vaccination rates],"" said Stavros Nicolaou, senior executive at Aspen Pharmacare Group. ""We know this variant is more contagious. My sense is that the current vaccines are likely to reduce morbidity. They might not be as effective in terms of preventing people getting infected. All the more reason, if you've got a more contagious variant, that you should go out and get vaccinated."" The bigger concern is the potential impact of the variant if it spreads to other parts of the continent where, on average, roughly 3% of the population has been vaccinated.

New variant classed 'of concern' and named Omicron,"Only about 24% of South Africans have been fully vaccinated so far The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a new coronavirus variant to be ""of concern"" and named it Omicron. It had a large number of mutations, and early evidence suggested an increased reinfection risk, the WHO said. It was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November, and has also been identified in Botswana, Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel. A number of countries around the world have now decided to ban or restrict travel to and from southern Africa. Travellers from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini will not be able to enter the UK,externalunless they are UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents. US officials said flights from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi would be blocked, mirroring earlier moves taken by the EU.It will come into effect on Monday. Brazil and Australia also introduced travel restrictions. On Friday, the WHO said the number of casesÂ of this variant, initially named B.1.1.529, appeared toÂ be increasingÂ in almost all of South Africa's provinces.Â ""This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning,""the UN public health body said in a statement.,external It said ""the first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November"". The WHO said it would take a few weeks to understand the impact of the new variant, as scientists worked to determine how transmissible it was. South Africans fear impact of new variant measures How worrying is the new Covid variant? The UK's red list is back... which countries are on it? A top UK health official warned that vaccines would ""almost certainly"" be less effective against the new variant. But Professor James Naismith, a structural biologist from the University of Oxford, added: ""It is bad news but it's not doomsday."" He said mutations in the variant suggested it may spread more quickly - but transmissibility ""is not just as simple as 'this amino acid does this'"" and was determined by how mutations worked together. Only about 24% of South Africa's population is fully vaccinated, which could spur a rapid spread of cases there, Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (Spi-M), told the BBC on Friday. Meanwhile, US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci said that while the reports on the new variant threw up a ""red flag"", it was possible that vaccines might still work to prevent serious illness. ""Until it's properly tested... we don't know whether or not it evades the antibodies that protect you against the virus"", Dr Fauci told CNN. This video can not be played Watch: WHO name omicron ""variant of concern"" The WHO has warned against countries hastily imposing travel restrictions, saying they should look to a ""risk-based and scientific approach"". However, in addition to the UK, and the US and the EU, a host of other countries have also announced restrictions: Australiaannounced on Saturday that flights from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, the Seychelles, Malawi, and Mozambique would be suspended for 14 days. Non-Australians who have been in those countries in the past two weeks are now banned from entering Australia Japanhas announced that from Saturday, travellers from much of southern Africa will need to quarantine for 10 days and take a total of four tests during that time Indiahas ordered more rigorous screening and testing for travellers arriving from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong Iranwill ban travellers from six southern African countries, including South Africa. Iranians arriving from the region will be admitted after testing negative twice, state TV says Brazilalso said it was restricting travel to the regionfrom six countries in Africa,external South Africa's Health Minister Joe Phaahla told reporters that the flight bans were ""unjustified"". ""The reaction of some of the countries, in terms of imposing travel bans, and such measures, are completely against the norms and standards as guided by the World Health Organization,"" he said. Echoing his words, Angelique Coetzee, chairperson of the South African Medical Association, told the BBC that the travel restrictions on her country were premature. ""For now, it is a storm in a tea cup,"" she said. Only about 24% of South Africa's population is fully vaccinated, which could spur a rapid spread of cases there, Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (Spi-M), told the BBC on Friday. Stock markets across the world also fell sharply on Friday, reflecting the fears of investors over the potential economic impact. The FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares closed 3.7% down, while main markets in Germany, France and the US also sank. A ""variant of concern"" is the World Health Organization's top category of worrying Covid variants. The decision adds weight to the mounting scientific worry about the potential of this new variant, but it doesn't change any of the facts. The variant has an astounding collection of mutations which are thought to increase its ability to spread and bypass some, but not all, of the protection from vaccines. However, we still don't have the clear real-world data. We don't know for sure that it spreads faster, makes vaccines or drugs less effective or whether it leads to more severe disease. The WHO have also given it a name and ended days of speculation that we would end up in the slightly ridiculous position of calling the new variant the ""Nu variant"". There have even been arguments about the correct pronunciation of the Greek letter Nu (it's technically a ""Nee""). Instead, you can guarantee we'll be talking a lot about Omicron in the weeks to come.

Kurdish woman is first Channel victim to be named,"This video can not be played Watch: The family and friends of Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin react to her death A 24-year-old Kurdish woman from northern Iraq has become the first victim of this week's mass drowning in the Channel to be identified. Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin was one of 27 people who died while attempting to cross to Britain on Wednesday. Her fiancÃ©, who lives in the UK, told the BBC she was messaging him as the group's dinghy started deflating. She tried to reassure him that they would be rescued. But help came too late, and she and 17 men, six other women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children died after their inflatable boat sank into the sea off the northern French coast. There were only two survivors - an Iraqi and a Somali. The disaster marked the biggest loss of life by drowning in the Channel in many years. Her fiancÃ© said Maryam, nicknamed Baran, had been on the boat with a female relative. He had not known beforehand about the attempted Channel crossing and said Maryam's arrival in the UK was supposed to be a surprise. They were messaging each other on Snapchat just before the dinghy began to lose air, he said. Maryam told him that the boat was deflating and that they were trying to get the water out of it. He said she had been trying to reassure him in her last message, and give him hope that the authorities were on their way to rescue them. What's being done to stop Channel crossings? Why do migrants leave France for the UK? The migrant debate can't escape European politics Reports from Calais say the two survivors of Wednesday's sinking have been discharged from hospital and are due to be questioned about how many people were on the boat. Maryam's uncle confirmed to the BBC that she was one of the people who drowned in the English Channel. He said the family heard the news from two people who were with her, and the family were waiting for her body to be flown back to Iraq. Maryam's family said she had tried to reach the UK legally twice and that she had been to the British embassy but the process was ""delayed"", forcing her instead to take the route she did. Nuri Hamadamin, Maryam's father, told the BBC: ""The whole world talks about Europe as a place that is calm, that is pleasant, is this what calm means? Around 30 people dying in the middle of the sea? ""This is a sin to put people through this."" On Friday night her father, family and friends gathered at their home in northern Iraq to share their grief and remember her. Maryam's best friend Imann Hassan said that her friend was ""very humble"" and had ""a very big heart"". ""When she left Kurdistan she was very happy, she couldn't believe that she was going to meet her husband,"" Ms Hassan told the BBC on Friday night. ""At her engagement party she was telling me: 'I will buy a house and live nearby you ... we are going to live together.'"" Ms Hassan said that she wanted to send a message to the world ""that no one deserves to die likes this"". ""She tried to live a better life, she chose the UK, but she died.""

On Friday night, about 3ft of snow fell at the Tan Hill Inn in the Yorkshire Dales, which is 1,732ft (528m) above sea level - meaning 60 people were unable to leave. Beds in the pub's lounge area were set up for the 20 guests who had not planned an overnight stay, but the pub said it had plenty of supplies to keep people warm and fed. Sleet fell across parts of Scotland and northern England with some heavy snow on higher ground. Part of the M62 near Rochdale between junctions 21 and 22 was closed, with 120 lorries stuck in the snow after one of them jack-knifed.

Travel warnings in place as storm batters Scotland,"This video can not be played Storm Arwen batters north east coast of Scotland About 80,000 homes in Scotland are without electricity as a result of the damage caused by Storm Arwen. The main areas affected are Aberdeenshire, Angus, Perthshire and the Moray coast. Police warned people not to travel ""under any circumstances"" in areas covered by a Met Office red warning following a 90mph wind forecast. The Met Office's highest storm level warning was in place until 02:00 on Saturday. Many parts of Scotland have suffered storm damage and travel disruption as a result of the high winds. Coastal areas of Angus, Fife, Aberdeenshire, Moray, East Lothian and the Scottish Borders, along with Aberdeen and Dundee have been the worst affected. A tree was blown over a road in Alford, Aberdeenshire Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said that as of 22:00 on Friday, 80,000 customers were off supply. The utility firm has managed to restore power to a further 25,000 homes affected by the storms but warned the weather was severely hampering its work. On Friday night, Mark Rough, director of customer operations at SSEN, said: ""Storm Arwen has brought some of the most severe and challenging weather we have experienced in recent years, resulting in significant disruption across the north of Scotland. ""Despite detailed preparations, the prolonged and severe nature of the weather front has hampered efforts to restore supplies, with the high winds expected to continue until the early hours of the morning. ""We therefore expect many customers to remain without power into tomorrow, particularly in the Aberdeenshire area."" Red wind warning issued for parts of UK Travel is disrupted as Storm Arwen strikes NI Train services across the country have been stopped because of the weather conditions. There has been a landslip as well as trees falling on to overhead power cables and railway lines, leaving people stranded on carriages and at railway stations. A barn was blown on to the line near Polmont. ScotRail urged passengers on its trains in the north east delayed by fallen trees to ""sit tight,external"". Network rail warned it ""may take some time"" for its staff to reach them. Supt Simon Bradshaw said: ""The high winds being experienced along the coastal areas of the north, east and southern parts of Scotland have led to red weather warnings coming into effect and as such, any motorist within these affected regions should not travel under any circumstances."" Following a meeting of the Scottish government's Resilience Room (SGoRR), First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in atweet,externalthat the ""conditions pose a potential risk to life"". Transport minister Graeme Dey said people should be prepared for possible travel disruption across Scotland. A Met Office amber warning for gales and a yellow alert for high winds and snow have also been issued for other parts of the country. Red warnings mean there could be danger to life, damage to property, travel and power disruption, and dangerous seas. The Met Office said: ""A spell of exceptionally strong northerly winds will affect eastern coastal districts of Scotland from later this afternoon moving south into south-east Scotland and north-east England this evening. ""Gusts of 80-90 mph are likely and these will generate some very large waves."" The strongest gusts have been recorded in Inverbervie at 78mph (125km/h). In Lossiemouth, the 74mph (119km/h) gusts are the highest recorded since 2015. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the red weather warning was ""rare"". ""People in these affected areas should not travel under any circumstances, including motorists,"" he said. ""Yellow and amber weather warnings also remain in place for a number of areas and people should continue to exercise extreme caution and plan any necessary journeys in advance as there is disruption to transport services. ""The Scottish government is in close contact with local authorities and the emergency services to ensure people in the affected areas receive the latest information, advice and support where needed.""

In addition, yellow weather warnings forhigh winds,externalandsnow,externalare in place through to Saturday evening, with gusts of 55 to 65mph forecast for coastal areas. Arwen is the first of the Met Office'slatest list of named storms,externalthis winter. There has been disruption on Scotland's roads. The A1 has been closed to high-sided vehicles, and a 10-mile (16km) stretch has been closed in both directions between Thistly Cross roundabout and Abbotsview Junction due to high winds. Trunk roads company Bear Scotland said wind speeds of up to 84mph (135km/h) were forecast at the bridge over the River Tyne near East Linton. A diversion route is in place via the A199. HM Coastguard warned people not to take risks on the coastline The A96 between Elgin and Forres has been blocked by a number of fallen trees and the A90 is closed after Brechin because of ""multiple incidents on the carriageway,external"". Traffic Scotland,externalhas reported numerous other road closures across the area affected by Storm Arwen, including an overturned HGV on the A90 near Bogbrae. There are multiple fallen trees on a 20-mile stretch of the A9 from Dalwhinnie to House of Bruar, blocking the north bound carriageway. The A85 at Crieff and between Tarbet and Tyndrum, as well as the A84 between Doune and Callander were also closed due to fallen trees. The Tay Road Bridge was also closed to all traffic at 22:00.

Bus services were also withdrawn in large swathes of eastern Scotland. Network Rail Scotland said the line between Keith and Elgin in the north of Scotland had been blocked by a landslip and engineers were assessing the damage. The track operator said high winds were blowing large objects on to the railways and this ranged ""from trees and trampolines to an entire barn"". ScotRail services had already been withdrawn on the line between Aberdeen and Inverness because of Storm Arwen.

US joins EU in restricting South Africa flights,"The US will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other southern African countries to try to contain a new coronavirus variant spreading there. From Monday, only US citizens and residents will be allowed to travel from the region. This follows similar restrictions imposed by the EU and the UK. Canada is also introducing travel restrictions. The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier declared the new variant to be ""of concern"", naming it Omicron. US officials said travellers from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi will be blocked, mirroring earlier moves taken by the EU. The ban will come into effect on Monday. In a statement, President Joe Biden called the move a ""precautionary measure"" taken until more is known about the variant. Canada is also shutting its borders to foreign travellers who have recently been to South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Foreign citizens will be banned from Canada if they have been to the seven nations in the past 14 days. The Omicron variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November, and has since been identified in other countries. South Africa's health ministry has criticised the rush to impose new travel restrictions, calling them ""draconian"", and contrary to WHO guidance. Scientists say they still have much to learn about the virus's new mutations, and the WHO has said it will take a few weeks to understand the impact of the new variant, as experts work to determine how transmissible it is. The WHO on Friday said preliminary evidence suggested the new variant carried a higher risk of reinfection than other variants. Scientists have said it is the most heavily mutated version yet, which means Covid vaccines, which were designed using the original strain from Wuhan, China, may not be as effective. What do we know about the new variant so far? South Africans fear impact of new variant measures Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The WHO says so far fewer than 100 sample sequences have been reported. Cases have mainly been confirmed in South Africa, but have also been detected in Hong Kong, Israel, Botswana and Belgium. Most of the cases in South Africa have been from its most populated province, Gauteng, of which Johannesburg is the capital city. The UK's red list is back... which countries are on it? Shares hit as new Covid variant rattles investors The WHO has warned against countries hastily imposing travel restrictions, saying they should look to a ""risk-based and scientific approach"". This video can not be played Travellers at Cape Town airport respond to new UK quarantine measures over Covid variant South African Health Minister Joe Phaahla told reporters that the restrictions were ""unjustified"". But health officials in the Netherlands warned that passengers on two KLM flights from South Africa to Amsterdam on Friday were likely infected. Tests were being done to determine whether it could be the new variant. Passengers travelling from Cape Town to Manchester via Amsterdam told the BBC that they were held on the tarmac at Schiphol Airport in the Dutch capital for four hours, before eventually disembarking to take PCR tests. Meanwhile, the flight bans threaten to separate families over the festive season. Ruth Daines-Slack, 70, had booked to fly from Cape Town to the UK next week for Christmas and her mother's 100th birthday celebration.She told the BBC she is ""beyond devastated""that she will no longer be able to make the trip, adding that the UK's travel ban is a ""knee-jerk reaction"".

"Girl, 12, stabbed to death during city centre row","Ava White died after being assaulted while out with friends A 12-year-old girl has been stabbed to death during an argument in a city centre. Ava White was with friends in Liverpool when she was assaulted at 20:40 GMT on Thursday, shortly after the city's Christmas lights switch-on. Merseyside Police said she suffered ""catastrophic injuries"" and a weapon was yet to be found. Four teenage boys, aged between 13 and 15 and from Toxteth, have been arrested on suspicion of her murder. Police said officers found Ava collapsed on the ground on Church Alley and a member of the public, who had witnessed the incident, was giving her first aid. Ava, who attended Notre Dame Catholic College in Everton, was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital with critical injuries but died a short time later. ""We know at the moment that Ava was with her friends in Liverpool city centre and there has been a verbal argument which has escalated to an assault on her involving a knife,"" Det Supt Sue Coombs said. ""We are able to say there has been a verbal argument and there has been an assault, and the offenders ran off up School Lane, across Hanover Street and into Fleet Street."" Assistant Chief Constable Ngaire Waine said police were not looking for anyone else in connection with Ava's death. ""It's very sad for the city but it is even sadder for her family, their lives are never going to be the same,"" she said. ""This is a very, very rare event, so I hope that will reassure people."" This video can not be played Assistant mayor of Liverpool, Sarah Doyle, said Ava's death was ""devastating"" Paying tribute to Ava, her head teacher Peter Duffy said the Year Eight pupil was a ""much loved, valued and unique member of the Notre Dame family"". ""She was an incredibly popular girl with a fantastic group of friends,"" he said. ""My staff are working with students to provide all the support they need at this traumatic time."" Rebecca Flynn, her head teacher at Trinity RC Primary School, said she was a ""popular and caring"" girl who was ""bright and respectful"". Peace campaigner Colin Parry, whose son Tim was killed in the Warrington bomb in 1993,tweeted that Ava,externalhad been given a peace ambassador award by his charity in 2019 and her death was a ""tragic loss"". Metro Mayor of Liverpool City Region, Steve Rotheram, said he was ""horrified"" by Ava's death. ""I am angry today for Ava and her family, for the parents across the region worrying about their children's safety and angry that such a heinous act should take place here,""he tweeted,external. Sarah Doyle, the assistant mayor of Liverpool, said she was ""heartbroken"" at the ""extremely devastating"" news. ""It's senseless and I know it will bring a lot of fear to communities across the city,"" she said. ""I just want to send a message of reassurance that our city is a safe place but I know this will be giving a lot of anxiety to people. We all share in [her family's] unimaginable grief."" Posting on Twitter,,externalDame Rachel de Souza, children's commissioner for England, said: ""This kind of violence involving a child and with such tragic consequences is shocking at any time, but when the victim is 12 it's particularly so."" Floral tributes to Ava have been left near the scene This video can not be played Det Supt Sue Coombs Mary Katilius, 65, from Limerick, said she had been nearby with her granddaughter when Ava was attacked. ""We heard screams and someone said to call an ambulance. We rushed over straight away but there was already a man helping her,"" she said. Det Supt Coombs said a lot of the witnesses were young and would be given special treatment when being interviewed. Floral tributes have been left near the scene, with one message saying: ""Rest in peace angel."" Lacey, 17, who came to lay flowers and a balloon, said her younger sister had been close friends with Ava. ""She was just a bubbly character, so loving and caring,"" she added. By Andy Gill, BBC North West Tonight reporter There is a massive police presence in Liverpool with several of the city's main shopping streets taped off. Dozens of police vehicles are parked close to the scene where 12-year-old Ava was fatally attacked. Many shoppers and tourists are having to ask officers how they can get to their destinations as many are unaware of the tragedy which lies behind the disruption to their usual routine. Ava died on what is called White Ribbon Day, a worldwide campaign to end violence against women and girls. Civic leaders came together yesterday to mark it and start 16 days of activity to highlight the issue. The death of a girl, not yet in her teens, throws the need for the campaign into the starkest relief. Forensic teams could be seen carrying out fingertip searches The four boys - a 13-year-old, two 14-year-olds and a 15-year-old - remain in custody for questioning. They were arrested at different locations during Thursday evening and into the early hours of Friday, police said. A police cordon was in place surrounding Williamson Square, Tarleton Street, Church Street, Church Alley and School Lane crossing over Hanover Street on to Fleet Street. Several shops on Church Street, one of the city's main shopping streets, remained closed on Black Friday due to the cordon.

Motsi Mabuse to miss Strictly after Covid contact,"Mabuse's German Covid vaccinations are not accepted for travel to the UK Strictly Come Dancing judge Motsi Mabuse will miss Saturday's show after coming into close contact with a person who tested positive for Covid-19. In an Instagram post,,externalMabuse explained she was fully vaccinated, which would normally mean exemption from isolation. However, Mabuse is currently in Germany and not able to travel back due to UK government guidelines, which do not recognise the vaccines she received. Singer and actress Cynthia Erivo will take her place on the panel. It will be Erivo's second week as a judge, aftershe stood in for Craig Revel Horwoodlast weekend. Horwood had tested positive for Covid-19 but will return to the panel this weekend, a Strictly spokesman confirmed. Erivo, Mabuse, Shirley Ballas and Anton Du Beke judged last week's show ""Motsi Mabuse will not be taking part in Strictly Come Dancing this weekend,"" a representative for the show said on Friday. ""We are delighted that Cynthia Erivo will be joining us as a guest judge again, joining Craig Revel Horwood, Anton Du Beke and head judge Shirley Ballas on the judging panel. We look forward to having Motsi back with us next weekend."" Other stars to have missed episodes of Strictly due to Covid this year include celebrity contestantsTom FletcherandJudi Love. Writing on Instagram, Mabuse said she was ""gutted"" to have to miss Strictly. ""I was contacted by NHS Test and Trace as being in close contact with someone on Sunday 21 Nov who has since tested positive,"" she explained. ""Being double vaccinated and booster as I am, would normally mean exemption from isolation under the close contact rules, but unfortunately German EU vaccines are not recognised and neither is my booster in this instance, so I must follow UK Government guidance and can only return after 30 November to UK."" The government website states,externalthat the EU Digital Covid Certificate (EUDCC) is not recognised as proof of vaccination for passengers travelling to the UK from Germany. Tom Fletcher and Amy Dowden, who exited the show last week, also previously missed an episode due to Covid While the UK recognises the certificate for passengers travelling from some European countries, for those travelling from Germany the guidelines state: ""You cannot currently use your EUDCC to verify your vaccination status via the UK passenger locator form."" It adds that people whose EUDCC was issued in Germany can use it to prove vaccination status within the UK, however it does not apply for travel. Mabuse said: ""Our health is the most important thing and luckily I have been tested multiple times this week and am negative. I am healthy, I am with my family, that's what matters! I wish everyone good luck, sending you my love. Keep dancing. Until then, lots of love and stay safe.""

Thoughts and prayers with whichever poor dancer is lumbered with me."" The broadcaster appears to have overcome his previous reluctance to appear on the show. In 2019 he wrote anarticle in The Guardian,externalheadlined: ""I have been begged to do Strictly Come Dancing. Here's why I turned it down."" ""Home alone, shimmying around beautifully, I know I am a simply superb mover. It is just that, as soon as a set of eyeballs alights on me, it is game over,"" he wrote. ""As for actual dancefloors, I become paralysed with shame and embarrassment, quite unable to move at all."" Anne-Marie is a singer and world karate champion SingerAnne-Marieis paired with Graziano Di Prima for the festive special. The nine-time Brit Awards nominee and world karate champion, who was also a winning coach in ITV singing show The Voice, said she was ""excited"" to be taking part.

Here's a summary of the latest developments:  Today's live page was edited by Hamish Mackay, Rob Corp, Francesca Gillett, Alice Cuddy and Tom Spender and was written by Jack Hunter, Dulcie Lee, Mal Siret, Paul McLaren, Mary O'Connor, Adam Durbin, Matt Murphy and George Wright. Reality Check Vaccine supplies arriving earlier this year in DR Congo There have been repeated calls for wealthier
countries who have fully vaccinated a significant proportion of their
populations to share doses with others who havenât. A WHO target for 10% of the worldâs population to be fully
vaccinated by the end of September was missed by dozens of countries,many of them in Africa. The average for Africa is currently around 7% fully
vaccinated, with some countries as low as just 3%. There are some countries elsewhere in the world with very low
vaccination rates - often in conflict zones - like Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and
Myanmar. But Asia, Europe and the Americas have on average already
gone past 40% of their populations fully vaccinated, which is the WHO target for the end of this
year. It's no surprise that a new variant has emerged given the unequal distribution of vaccines to poorer countries, the co-chair of the African Union's Vaccine Delivery Alliance for Covid has told the BBC. But Dr Ayoade Ala-kija expressed doubt that there would now be a change of policy. ""The lack of political will and the failure to vaccinate the world was going to result in variants emerging. I think my surprise is that there are more variants out there not just in Africa but all over the world,"" she said. She said South Africa deserved praise for detecting the mutation but the Omicron variant might not have originated there and could already be spreading around the world. Travel bans affecting southern African nations were ""shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted"", she said. ""So will it mean that people will suddenly discover their sense of morality and and begin to distribute vaccines more equitably across the African continent? I'm not holding my breath."" Dr Ala-kija pointed out that the likes of the UK, Israel and the EU haven't placed travel bans on Belgium, despite it reporting a case of the new variant. Anti-vaccination protesters demonstrated in The Hague A rise in Covid cases - unrelated to the new Omicron variant - has prompted fresh restrictions in the Netherlands. From Sunday all hospitality venues must close from 17:00 to 05:00 local time, though some essential business such as supermarkets may remain open until 20.00. Amateur sports will also cease at 17.00. Schools will remain open, but students in secondary schools will have to wear masks. ""From Sunday, the whole of the Netherlands is effectively closed between 5pm and 5am,"" PM Mark Rutte told reporters during a press conference. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said the tougher restrictions were necessary to prevent the country's health system being overwhelmed. A small group anti-vaccination protesters gathered near parliament in The Hague, but they were outnumbered by riot police who kept watch. Emergency orders have been issued for the centre of The Hague and several other Dutch towns and cities to avoid a repeat of last weekend's riots. The head of the lab that first sequenced the new Covid variant Omicron has told the BBC that the strain has mutations not seen before. Professor Anne von Gottberg of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg said that most strains of the virus have about five to 10 spike mutations, but the Omicron has around 25 to 32. ""So it really was immediately noticeable that something unusual had happened,"" she said. ""There are a lot of mutations that are new and that we haven't seen before,"" she said. She said it was as yet unclear what can be determined from the multiple mutations. But she said it was precisely because they couldn't fully understand its characteristics that merited further study and a cautious approach to the new strain. As we've been reporting, a number ofcountries are tightening their travel restrictions after a new coronavirus variantwas identified in southern Africa earlier this week. Here are some of the major restrictions that have been announced so far: The United Statesis banning on South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi. US citizens and lawful permanent residents will be exempt from the restrictions, but will still need to test negative before flying. Canadais shutting its borders to all foreign travellers who have been to South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Mozambique in the past 14 days. EU nationswill impose an emergency flight ban on countries in southern Africa, after Europe's first case of the variant was discovered in Belgium. The ban will be applied to travellers from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, EU Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer said. Switzerlandwill require a 10-day quarantine period and a negative Covid test for travellers from Belgium,
Israel and Hong Kong, as well imposing travel bans on southern
African countries, Reuters news agency reports. TheUKhas temporarily halted flights from six southern African countries: South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Eswatini and Lesotho Singapore, Italy, FranceandIsraelhave also placedMozambiqueon their red lists. A number of North African and Middle-Eastern nations includingBahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt and Moroccohave introduced varying bans on travellers from the eight countries. Japanhas announced that from Saturday, travellers from much of southern Africa will need to quarantine for 10 days and take four tests during that time. Indiahas ordered more rigorous screening and testing for travellers arriving from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong, local media is reporting. AndIranwill ban travellers from six southern African countries, including South Africa. Iranians arriving from the region will be admitted after testing negative twice, state TV said. The World Health Organization has designated the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 as being ""of concern"", following its discovery by South African scientists. But what do we know about it so far? Broadly speaking there are thousands of different types, or variants, of Covid circulating around the world. Which is to be expected because viruses mutate constantly. But what has experts particularly worried with this strain of the virus, which is also known as B.1.1.529, is that it has mutated heavily and is very different to the original coronavirus strain which emerged in China, which current vaccines were designed to fight. There are 50 genetic changes in total and of these, 32 are in the spike protein of the virus - the part which is the target of vaccines. However, it is too soon to know how much of a omicron threat poses to vaccine efficacy and it will take several weeks before we have enough data to know for sure, experts have said. Read more about what we know about omicronhere. This video can not be played WHO name Omicron 'variant of concern' Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead, has been telling the BBC about the body's decision to label Omicron a variant of concern. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has postponed its first ministerial meeting in four years due to the new Omicron Covid-19 variant. Ministers from more than 160 WTO members were due to meet next
week in the Swiss city of Geneva for an event seen as a test of the body's relevance. WTO members reportedly took the decision at an urgent meeting held tonight. The European Centre for Disease Control (CDC) says that it has classified the new Omnicron coronavirus variant as being ""of concern"". Officials say that the level of risk associated with the variant is ""very high"" and that it is extremely likely that the variant will spread across the EU. The agency added that it feared the profile of the variant may mean that the effectiveness of vaccines could be reduced and that natural immunity may be decreased. Former UK PM Gordon Brown has been speaking to BBC Newsnight about pandemic and the emergence of new variants. He says, as he has done previously, that the UK government must do more to vaccinate poorer nations around the world. This video can not be played The pharmaceuticals manufacturer Novavax has begun work on a new version of its Covid-19 vaccine, aimed at targeting the Omicron variant. It says it hopes the vaccine will be ready for testing and manufacturing within a matter of weeks. Other vaccine companies have also been cautiously optimistic about their ability to counter any potential new challenges posed by the variant. BioNTech says it could produce and ship an updated version of its vaccine within 100 days if the new Covid variant detected in southern Africa is found to evade existing immunity. And AstraZeneca says it is already conducting research in Botswana and Eswatini, where the variant has been identified, to collect real-world data on how its shot performs against the new variant. Moderna has also said it will develop a booster shot for the new variant. People read information at a Covid-19 testing centre at the International Airport in Duesseldorf Here's a round-up of the latest developments if you're just joining us: Omicron is not the first ""variant of concern"" to have emerged during the pandemic. There are many different types of Covid-19 circulating around the world, which is to be expected because viruses mutate regularly. The most potentially dangerous ones are given the ""variants of concern,external"" classification and are kept under close observation. These include:  For more on the key Covid variantsclick here. US President Joe Biden has called on countries meeting at the World Trade Organization
next week to agree to waive intellectual property protections
for Covid vaccines in the wake of the new variant's discovery. He has reissued a calloriginally made in Mayby the US government for a temporary lift on patent protections This could allow vaccines to be manufactured faster and in more places around the world, as production would not be restricted by the patent rights owned by the pharmaceutical companies who developed them. However, manufacturers say it will not have the desired effect and critics argue it strips financial rewards and incentives from cutting-edge developers. The president also said other nations need to ramp up their vaccine donations to ""match Americaâs speed and generosity"". ""The news about this new variant should make clearer than
ever why this pandemic will not end until we have global
vaccinations,""he said in a statement,external. More now on the United States announcing travel restrictions on southern Africa. The travel ban will start on Monday, and include South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi, officials told reporters. The restrictions will not apply to US citizens and lawful permanent residents, but they will still need to test negative for coronavirus prior to travelling. Officials say the policy is being implemented ""out of an abundance of caution"". There was no indication of how long the bans will be in place. Canada is also shutting its borders to
foreign travelers who have recently been to South
Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and
Mozambique. Foreign citizens will be banned from Canada if they have
been to the seven nations in the past 14 days, Health
Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said. The US and Canada join the UK, EU and others in tightening
border controls over the Omicron variant. This video can not be played James Gallagher and Caroline Davies answer your questions on the new Covid variant. In case you missed it earlier, here's our health correspondent James Gallagher and transport correspondent Caroline Davies answering viewers' questions on the new variant and travel restrictions. The questions they look at included: Boris Johnson and Cyril Ramaphosa previously met at the G7 summit in Cornwall in June We've recently heard that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa this afternoon after the UK announced a travel ban on six nations in the region to limit the spread of the new Covid variant. A Downing Street spokesman said the two leaders ""discussed the challenges posed globally by the new Covid-19 variant and ways to work together to deal with it and reopen international travel"". He said Johnson praised South Africa's rapid genomic sequencing and ""leadership in transparently sharing scientific data"", with the pair agreeing to ""stay in close contact"" as they continue to deal with the pandemic. The United States has joined the European Union, UK and others in implementing travel restrictions on visitors from southern Africa after the discovery of a new Covid variant. A senior administration official said that the restrictions will apply to South
Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini,
Mozambique, and Malawi. The curbs were being âimplemented out of an
abundance of caution in light of a new Covid-19 variant
circulating in Southern Africaâ, the official said. Prof John Edmunds, a member of the UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) which advises the government, says the new variant, B.1.1.529, is a ""huge worry"" and could escape current Covid vaccines. ""The molecular data is extremely worrying...[it] would point to that perhaps this thing might be able to evade the immune response,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. Asked if the new variant could be resistant to current vaccines, Edmunds - an infectious diseases expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - confirms this is scientists' ""great fear"" but it is not yet known to what extent the variant might be able to do so. ""Our fears are it would do so to a large extent,"" he adds. Citing cases of the new variant in Belgium and Israel, Prof Edmunds warns the new variant will reach the UK and calls on the government to be prepared to take extra action for when it does. He says ministers will need to look at whether border restrictions need to be extended, and suggests mass Covid testing and localised measures should be considered alongside making the booster jabs rollout quicker. Explaining that a ""rapid rise"" in the new variant in South Africa had followed a ""huge wave"" of the Delta strain, he warns the UK is ""still fighting a Delta wave"" and does not want to be ""fighting both at the same time"" as it could create a ""very, very, very difficult situation"".

Adele album becomes 2021's fastest seller,"Adele's sales are down on her last album, but that's at least partially down to a changing music consumption landscape Adele's 30 has shot to number one, overtaking Abba to become the fastest-selling album of the year so far. Its 261,000 first-week chart sales mean it sped pastthe Swedish pop group's comeback album Voyage, which opened with 204,000 sales. However, Adele's sales figures are significantly lower than those of her previous album 25, released in 2015. That album, her third, opened with 800,000 first-week sales, which means 30 has sold 32% of its predecessor. The drop can be partially explained by the huge growth of streaming in the last six years. Added to which, there was a greater incentive for fans to buy 25, as it was kept off streaming platforms for its first six months of release. Adele's opening sales have topped those of Abba's long-awaited comeback album Voyage Adele won out over Ed Sheeran's = (Equals) album to claim top spot this week. This means she has now secured a chart double, with the album's lead single Easy On Me remaining number one for a sixth consecutive week. Adele's opening week success with 30 ensures all four of her albums have now reached number one - a record for a female act. Allow YouTube content?

The album made up 67% of all physical sales and became the most-streamed album of the week, with 55.7 million plays across all tracks. The numbers mark the biggest first week for an album since Sheeran's Ã· (Divide) in 2017. It is also strongest opening week for a female solo album since Adele's last studio album 25, which was released in November 2015. The London-born star has said that 30 is an attempt to explain her divorce from her husband to nine-year-old son Angelo. The BBC's reviewsaid it finds an ""emotionally bewildered"" Adele ""at the top of her game"". Adele's last album achieved platinum status in 24 hours, selling 300,000 copies in a single day. Her latest hasn't reached that figure after a week on sale. But go easy on her - album sales have fallen precipitously in the six years since Adele released 25. Back then, streaming accounted for just 11% of the UK's music market - and no-one thought it was odd for Adele to withhold her album from Spotify and Apple. By relying on CDs, vinyl and downloads, she racked upa record-breaking 800,000 sales in the space of a week. Today, 80% of music consumption is on streaming services and most of Adele's fans are happy not to own a hard copy of 30. That's reflected in lower sales figures - but Adele is still setting fire to the rain. In the US, 30 is already the biggest-seller of the year, overtaking albums by Drake and Olivia Rodrigo. In the UK, her first-week total of 261,000 is miles ahead of the 7,317 copies Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia sold on its fourth week at number one last May (the lowest ever total for a UK chart topper). The record industry and the media still rely on album sales as a measure of success - but in reality, the public has moved on. Adele's success should really be measured in cultural impact. Her US TV special was watched by more people than the Grammys or the Oscars. The British equivalent drew a peak audience of 5.4 million viewers, helping ITV achieve its biggest Sunday night of the year. The real question is whether, after this publicity blitz, her new music will hang around. ""Success may be more about whether, two months down the line, we still have memes flooding TikTok and James Corden doing skits,""observed music industry analyst Mark Mulligan,external. ""This will say as much about how the world is responding to her music than how many streams she clocks up.""

In the singles rundown, Adele's chart domination means her biggest competition remains... herself.

Mark Swinglehurst, 62, told the BBC the train had reached Huntly at about 17:00 GMT on Friday before coming to a halt. Asked about the experience, he said: ""I don't think it will get rave reviews on any sort of travel site."" He said it had been cold but comfortable and although there was a lack of refreshments initially, staff managed to secure bacon rolls and pies for the stranded passengers during their ordeal.

On Friday night, about 3ft of snow fell at the Tan Hill Inn in the Yorkshire Dales, which is 1,732ft (528m) above sea level - meaning 60 people were unable to leave. Beds in the pub's lounge area were set up for the 20 guests who had not planned an overnight stay, but the pub said it had plenty of supplies to keep people warm and fed. Sleet fell across parts of Scotland and northern England with some heavy snow on higher ground. Part of the M62 near Rochdale between junctions 21 and 22 was closed, with 120 lorries stuck in the snow after one of them jack-knifed.

Mutations prompt new coronavirus variant concern,"Only about 24% of South Africans have been fully vaccinated so far The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a new coronavirus variant to be ""of concern"" and named it Omicron. It had a large number of mutations, and early evidence suggested an increased reinfection risk, the WHO said. It was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November, and has also been identified in Botswana, Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel. A number of countries around the world have now decided to ban or restrict travel to and from southern Africa. Travellers from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini will not be able to enter the UK,externalunless they are UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents. US officials said flights from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi would be blocked, mirroring earlier moves taken by the EU.It will come into effect on Monday. Brazil and Australia also introduced travel restrictions. On Friday, the WHO said the number of casesÂ of this variant, initially named B.1.1.529, appeared toÂ be increasingÂ in almost all of South Africa's provinces.Â ""This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning,""the UN public health body said in a statement.,external It said ""the first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November"". The WHO said it would take a few weeks to understand the impact of the new variant, as scientists worked to determine how transmissible it was. South Africans fear impact of new variant measures How worrying is the new Covid variant? The UK's red list is back... which countries are on it? A top UK health official warned that vaccines would ""almost certainly"" be less effective against the new variant. But Professor James Naismith, a structural biologist from the University of Oxford, added: ""It is bad news but it's not doomsday."" He said mutations in the variant suggested it may spread more quickly - but transmissibility ""is not just as simple as 'this amino acid does this'"" and was determined by how mutations worked together. Only about 24% of South Africa's population is fully vaccinated, which could spur a rapid spread of cases there, Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (Spi-M), told the BBC on Friday. Meanwhile, US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci said that while the reports on the new variant threw up a ""red flag"", it was possible that vaccines might still work to prevent serious illness. ""Until it's properly tested... we don't know whether or not it evades the antibodies that protect you against the virus"", Dr Fauci told CNN. This video can not be played Watch: WHO name omicron ""variant of concern"" The WHO has warned against countries hastily imposing travel restrictions, saying they should look to a ""risk-based and scientific approach"". However, in addition to the UK, and the US and the EU, a host of other countries have also announced restrictions: Australiaannounced on Saturday that flights from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, the Seychelles, Malawi, and Mozambique would be suspended for 14 days. Non-Australians who have been in those countries in the past two weeks are now banned from entering Australia Japanhas announced that from Saturday, travellers from much of southern Africa will need to quarantine for 10 days and take a total of four tests during that time Indiahas ordered more rigorous screening and testing for travellers arriving from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong Iranwill ban travellers from six southern African countries, including South Africa. Iranians arriving from the region will be admitted after testing negative twice, state TV says Brazilalso said it was restricting travel to the regionfrom six countries in Africa,external South Africa's Health Minister Joe Phaahla told reporters that the flight bans were ""unjustified"". ""The reaction of some of the countries, in terms of imposing travel bans, and such measures, are completely against the norms and standards as guided by the World Health Organization,"" he said. Echoing his words, Angelique Coetzee, chairperson of the South African Medical Association, told the BBC that the travel restrictions on her country were premature. ""For now, it is a storm in a tea cup,"" she said. Only about 24% of South Africa's population is fully vaccinated, which could spur a rapid spread of cases there, Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (Spi-M), told the BBC on Friday. Stock markets across the world also fell sharply on Friday, reflecting the fears of investors over the potential economic impact. The FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares closed 3.7% down, while main markets in Germany, France and the US also sank. A ""variant of concern"" is the World Health Organization's top category of worrying Covid variants. The decision adds weight to the mounting scientific worry about the potential of this new variant, but it doesn't change any of the facts. The variant has an astounding collection of mutations which are thought to increase its ability to spread and bypass some, but not all, of the protection from vaccines. However, we still don't have the clear real-world data. We don't know for sure that it spreads faster, makes vaccines or drugs less effective or whether it leads to more severe disease. The WHO have also given it a name and ended days of speculation that we would end up in the slightly ridiculous position of calling the new variant the ""Nu variant"". There have even been arguments about the correct pronunciation of the Greek letter Nu (it's technically a ""Nee""). Instead, you can guarantee we'll be talking a lot about Omicron in the weeks to come.

Macron and Johnson clash over migrant boats,"Emmanuel Macron has reacted angrily to Boris Johnson's public call for France to take back migrants who reach the UK. The French president accused the UK prime minister of not being ""serious"" by making the call on Twitter, after the deaths of 27 people on Wednesday. The diplomatic row erupted after France withdrew a summit invitation to Home Secretary Priti Patel. The UK government urged it to reconsider, with the PM saying: ""This is a problem we have to fix together."" Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany and the European Commission are due to attend Sunday's talks in Calais, which Mr Macron set up to deal with the recent surge in migrant crossings of the Channel. The diplomatic spat comes as French fishermen are holding a day of action, including blockades, to disrupt cross-Channel traffic, in protest at post-Brexit fishing rights granted by the UK. Why Iraqi Kurds risk their lives to reach the West Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Scramble to identify dead in Channel tragedy The sinking of an inflatable boat on Wednesday marked the biggest loss of life by drowning in the Channel in many years, with 17 men, seven women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children dying. Ahead of Sunday's meeting, in a letter to Mr Macron on Thursday which was shared on Twitter, Mr Johnson set out five steps which he said could help avoid a repeat of the tragedy. These included joint patrols, better use of technology such as sensors and radar, maritime patrols in each other's waters and stronger cooperation by intelligence services. The letter also called for immediate work on a policy of returning migrants who reach the UK to France, alongside talks to establish a UK-EU returns agreement. French boats blocked the entrance to the port of St Malo in protest at post-Brexit fishing rules But the French government reacted furiously, withdrawing Ms Patel's invitation to the Calais meeting. At a press conference on Friday, Mr Macron attacked Mr Johnson over the posting of the letter on Twitter, saying: ""I spoke two days ago with Prime Minster Johnson in a serious way. ""For my part I continue to do that, as I do with all countries and all leaders. I am surprised by methods when they are not serious. ""We do not communicate from one leader to another on these issues by tweets and letters that we make public. We are not whistleblowers."" A French government spokesman accused Mr Johnson of saying different things in his conversation with Mr Macron and in the letter, adding: ""We are sick of double-speak."" The UK insists the prime minister's letter was sincere, meant to be constructive, not combative. But the French suspicion is that the letter was actually directed more at Mr Johnson's Conservative Party than Paris. The French believe Mr Johnson is in an uncomfortable position with his supporters now, having promised that Brexit would mean ""taking back control"" of UK waters and borders. The UK government insists the letter was sent in good faith. Paris says such a delicate matter as migration, especially between France and post-Brexit UK, should be handled with care, away from the media glare. Read Katya's blog in full But a Downing Street spokesman said: ""We have spoken about many of these ideas before. The public understandably want to know what we are doing to prevent this happening again. We want to work closely with France."" ""If you look at the tone of the letter, this is about deepening our co-operation,"" the spokesman added. This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps: ""I hope that the French will reconsider"" Home Office officials are still taking part in talks with their French counterparts in Paris on how to deal with the Channel crisis. Reports from Calais say the two survivors of Wednesday's sinking - one Iraqi and the other Somali - have been discharged from hospital and are due to be questioned about how many people were on the boat. For Labour, shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the prime minister of a ""grave error of judgement"" in sending the letter and of having ""completely lost control of the situation in the Channel"". But Conservative MP Tim Loughton, a member of the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, called France's decision not to invite Ms Patel to the Calais meeting ""incredible"", adding that Mr Johnson's letter had been ""perfectly reasonable"".

Dressing room culture part of cricket anti-racism plan,"This video can not be played Emotional Rafiq tells MPs about racism at Yorkshire A full review of dressing-room culture is part of a wide-ranging action plan to tackle discrimination and racism in cricket in England and Wales. It has been issued following allegations made by Azeem Rafiq and a number of other players. The five-point plan has ""12 tangible actions"", while the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has pledged Â£25m over five years. The ECB will also form a new anti-discrimination unit within six months. Last week, former Yorkshire spinner Rafiq told a Digital, Culture, Media & Sport select committee the English game is ""institutionally racist"". Rafiq's allegations against the county have been echoed by former academy player Irfan Amjad and another anonymous player. This video can not be played 'It sounds like the Wild West' - MP Julie Elliott on ECB regulatory process Jahid Ahmed, Maurice Chambers and Zoheb Sharif have also made claims about their time with Essex. Sports minister Nigel Huddleston said the government could take the ""nuclear option"" of creating an independent regulator if the ECB does not ""put its house in order"" over racism. Listen: TMS podcast - the future of cricket ""The last few weeks have been very, very tough,"" said ECB chief executive Tom Harrison. ""It feels like an earthquake has hit us. ""Our game has been portrayed in the worst possible way in the world's media. Azeem's testimony and testimony from others has revealed serious issues which we have collectively not dealt with for many decades. ""There are clearly large numbers of people in the country who feel like cricket has not been there for them. This is our latest attempt to say we are listening and we are desperate to solve the problem."" The action plan, jointly published by the ECB, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), Professional Cricketers' Association, 41 counties, women's regions and recreational network is described as a ""game-wide response to discrimination"". The 12 actions each fall under one of the five points, as follows: Listen, care and educate- the setting up of of a standardised approach to handling complaints, promoting the aims of the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket and providing all who work in cricket with ongoing Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) education. Address dressing-room culture- publish a full review of dressing-room culture in all professional teams, reassess player and coach education. Remove barriers in the talent pathway- improve support for people from diverse backgrounds, identify talent from non-traditional backgrounds and take action towards reaching a minimum 20% gender diversity and appropriate level of ethnic diversity. Create welcoming environments for all- full-scale review into crowd behaviour at professional matches, ensure venues are welcoming to all faiths and cultures, upgrade education in recreational cricket. Publish localised action plans within six months- each organisation will deliver board diversity (30% female, representative ethnicity) by April 2022, adopt an anonymised recruitment tool for all senior roles, every senior executive in the game to have personalised EDI objectives. Harrison could not confirm who will lead the review into dressing-room culture, which will look at every professional men's and women's team in the country. ECB central funding could be withheld where EDI minimum standards are not met, the governing body said. Rafiq alleged his former Yorkshire team-mate Gary Ballance used the term 'Kevin' to describe a person of colour during his four years playing for England between 2013 and 2017. There are eight members of England men's Ashes squad that played international cricket alongside Ballance. None of them have yet to comment on Rafiq's allegations. ""I know the impact of recent events has been embraced in full by the England men in Australia. They have spoken about it,"" said Harrison. ""How does the dressing room continue to evolve its culture, and effectively reflect the feeling that is coming out of the conversation which the game is having at the moment? ""There is a constantly evolving requirement to move culture along with national sentiment and the way the world is changing."" With regard to 'whistleblowing', the ECB confirmed that responsibility for handling complaints and allegations could be given to a third party in order to prevent a conflict of interest. Despite the actions detailed in the report, Harrison said he feels it ""probably"" could have gone further. When asked about his own future as ECB chief executive, he said he was ""so committed to sorting this issue within the game"". ""I understand I have the backing of the game,"" added Harrison. ""I know that we are in the dock for words, words, words and no action. ""I don't think is something that cricket has ever got right. We need to get out into communities and talk to people. ""Is there room for a truth and reconciliation exercise? It feels like until we have a shared understanding of what our history has been like, it is very difficult for us to move forward together."" Jahid Ahmed, who isone of three former Essex playersto allege he experienced racist abuse at the club, said he welcomed the ECB's plans. ""Children I work with will be encouraged and empowered when they see people in a senior position from a similar background,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Those of us who have spoken out have been trying to point out there was a culture and inequality that has been normal in cricket. ""I hope this action from the ECB doesn't fade away when the news stories fade away. I hope they can keep it up.""

EU to block flights after Belgium new variant case,"The US will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other southern African countries to try to contain a new coronavirus variant spreading there. From Monday, only US citizens and residents will be allowed to travel from the region. This follows similar restrictions imposed by the EU and the UK. Canada is also introducing travel restrictions. The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier declared the new variant to be ""of concern"", naming it Omicron. US officials said travellers from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi will be blocked, mirroring earlier moves taken by the EU. The ban will come into effect on Monday. In a statement, President Joe Biden called the move a ""precautionary measure"" taken until more is known about the variant. Canada is also shutting its borders to foreign travellers who have recently been to South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Foreign citizens will be banned from Canada if they have been to the seven nations in the past 14 days. The Omicron variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November, and has since been identified in other countries. South Africa's health ministry has criticised the rush to impose new travel restrictions, calling them ""draconian"", and contrary to WHO guidance. Scientists say they still have much to learn about the virus's new mutations, and the WHO has said it will take a few weeks to understand the impact of the new variant, as experts work to determine how transmissible it is. The WHO on Friday said preliminary evidence suggested the new variant carried a higher risk of reinfection than other variants. Scientists have said it is the most heavily mutated version yet, which means Covid vaccines, which were designed using the original strain from Wuhan, China, may not be as effective. What do we know about the new variant so far? South Africans fear impact of new variant measures Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The WHO says so far fewer than 100 sample sequences have been reported. Cases have mainly been confirmed in South Africa, but have also been detected in Hong Kong, Israel, Botswana and Belgium.

"EU to block flights after Belgium new variant caseThe EU imposes a flight ban on southern Africa as the new variant is classified as being ""of concern"".World","The US will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other southern African countries to try to contain a new coronavirus variant spreading there. From Monday, only US citizens and residents will be allowed to travel from the region. This follows similar restrictions imposed by the EU and the UK. Canada is also introducing travel restrictions. The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier declared the new variant to be ""of concern"", naming it Omicron. US officials said travellers from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi will be blocked, mirroring earlier moves taken by the EU. The ban will come into effect on Monday. In a statement, President Joe Biden called the move a ""precautionary measure"" taken until more is known about the variant. Canada is also shutting its borders to foreign travellers who have recently been to South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Foreign citizens will be banned from Canada if they have been to the seven nations in the past 14 days. The Omicron variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November, and has since been identified in other countries. South Africa's health ministry has criticised the rush to impose new travel restrictions, calling them ""draconian"", and contrary to WHO guidance. Scientists say they still have much to learn about the virus's new mutations, and the WHO has said it will take a few weeks to understand the impact of the new variant, as experts work to determine how transmissible it is. The WHO on Friday said preliminary evidence suggested the new variant carried a higher risk of reinfection than other variants. Scientists have said it is the most heavily mutated version yet, which means Covid vaccines, which were designed using the original strain from Wuhan, China, may not be as effective. What do we know about the new variant so far? South Africans fear impact of new variant measures Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The WHO says so far fewer than 100 sample sequences have been reported. Cases have mainly been confirmed in South Africa, but have also been detected in Hong Kong, Israel, Botswana and Belgium. Most of the cases in South Africa have been from its most populated province, Gauteng, of which Johannesburg is the capital city. The UK's red list is back... which countries are on it?

Better links between Wales and England recommended,"Upgrades to the A55 in north Wales are recommended by Sir Peter Hendy Road and rail improvements between north Wales and north-west England are among the recommendations of a UK government transport review. Sir Peter Hendy also recommended improvements to public transport should be used to alleviate M4 congestion. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has invited the Welsh government to work ""collaboratively"" on the proposals. The Welsh government has said it is the UK government's responsibility to invest in rail networks in Wales. The Union Connectivity Review, chaired by Sir Peter Hendy, began work in October 2020 with a remit to review the quality and availability of transport infrastructure across the UK. Shapps says government wants to 'fix' A55 and M4 All new road building projects frozen in Wales Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We must strengthen the rail and road links across Wales if we are to truly level up the UK - enhancing the connectivity of Welsh towns and cities and bringing communities closer together."" He said the UK government would reflect on the review, ""boost key transport connections"" and ""more evenly distribute opportunity and prosperity"" through close working with the Welsh government. However the report omits any plans to electrify the network in north Wales and across south Wales, which Mr Waters said was a ""big disappointment"" as it had been promised by the UK government. ""The way that the transport system across the UK is working is dysfunctional, because the UK government has responsibility for the rail infrastructure but is not funding Wales, the funding is still going around London,"" said Mr Waters. ""We are not getting our fair share, we're not getting our share of HS2. ""This report is really welcome but now the UK government has to follow through."" A relief road is not recommended to alleviate M4 congestion near Newport, instead improvements should be made to public transport The Welsh government should ""retain the option"" of M4 improvements, including a relief road, if public transport improvements do not alleviate congestion Devolution ""has been good for transport"", but has resulted in cross-border transport schemes being less of a priority The north Wales transport corridor needs a UK and Welsh government review focused on HS2 connectivity, travel to and from Ireland, and improvements to the A55, M53, and M56 All new road building projects in Wales are being frozen while a review takes place Currently,all new road building projects in Wales are being frozenwhile the Welsh government conducts a review. Transport Secretary for England Grant Shapps toldRadio Waleson Friday: ""On a road you can drive an electric carâ¦ so I don't think necessarily we can imagine a world in which we'll all get around without any roads at all and where there are roads we'll want to deal with the congestions."" Mr Shapps said the Welsh government had been involved in discussions ahead of the report's release and both governments would work together to resolve issues around transport, such as congestion. ""I don't think there's any surprises in the report itselfâ¦ the top lines are all the things he's been talking to the Welsh government about,"" Mr Shapps added. ""We know we need to resolve the problems of the south Wales corridorâ¦ how we do it is a matter for discussion."" He added proposals for a UK network ""would certainly be of interest to sort out those problems around the M4"". Wales' deputy minister for climate change and transport, Lee Waters said: ""We need to work together, this report now firmly endorses our actions around Newport, it turns away from the M4 and says public transport is the way ahead. ""Now the UK has to help with the investment because they have responsibility for rail."" A Cardiff Parkway station in St Mellons is planned to serve up to 32,000 residents Transport for Wales warned over pricing claims People left 'isolated' without bus services Sir Peter advised the UK government to support measures to reduce congestion on the M4, which runs from Carmarthenshire to London, as well as improving the M4 junction with the M5. This would support another of Sir Peter's suggestions - to improve connectivity between south Wales and the Midlands. Suggested rail improvements in south Wales include upgrading and building new stations on the south Wales main line. It also advises the UK government to increase connectivity and reduce journey times between Cardiff and Birmingham, including better rolling stock, timetable changes and enhanced infrastructure. New mainline stations are already planned for the south Wales mainline, including aCardiff Parkway station near St Mellons. Stuart Cole, Emeritus professor of transport at the University of South Wales, toldRadio Wales Breakfast: ""There's been a concentration in the report very much on the two big corridors, north Wales into England and south Wales into England. ""But little mention, as far as we can see, of the electrification of Cardiff to Swansea - and indeed a straightening of that track which could reduce the journey time to 35 minutes - and the electrification of the north Wales rail line which I worked on in 1978. ""I just hope we don't have another 40 years before we wait for that line to be electrified."" More capacity at Chester railway station is ""particularly important"", says Flintshire council leader The Labour leader of Flintshire council, Ian Roberts, said he wanted the UK government to ""deliver"" on union connectivity. Mr Roberts is also vice chair of the Growth Track 360 campaign which is lobbying for rail improvements in north Wales and Cheshire. He said he hoped Chester station would be upgraded as a result of the review, because the track layout ""needs modernisation"". ""The Welsh government has announced that next year there will be trains running from Llandudno to Liverpool Lime Street,"" he said. ""We genuinely wonder how they are going to get through Chester station because current capacity is just not enough. ""Some of our asks for north Wales are - not to put too fine a point on it - in England. Chester is the key station, and unlocking capacity there is particularly important."" Mr Roberts said ""pinch-points"" on roads across north Wales had become exacerbated during the pandemic, with holidaymakers highlighting the need to improve certain stretches of roads including the A55. He added that public transport for many in north Wales was a ""forlorn hope"". One haulier director says his drivers experienced ""two and a half, three hour delays earlier this week"" 'Better public transport' needed for M4 congestion M4 relief road planning protection scrapped Chris Bird, the director of Llantrisant-based hauliers CJ Bird Transport, said he had little faith that issues with the road network in south Wales would be resolved in the wake of the report. ""They'll spend an arm and a leg on a report and nothing's going to change,"" he said. Referencing the shelved plans to build a relief road for the M4 around Newport, Mr Bird said a solution had not yet been put forward. ""The pinch-point seems to be Newport"", he said. ""My main concern is getting in and out of Wales in a timely fashion and when you have an incident it turns into a one-track road. ""We were having two-and-a-half, three hour delays earlier this week. That's drivers' time wasted, that's extra wear and tear."" Mr Bird added he remained unconvinced by plans to improve the rail network in south Wales given people's reticence to use public transport because of Covid fears. Matthew Fell, chief policy director for the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said Sir Peter's review made ""important recommendations which will help deliver a modern, integrated transport network"". ""Strong collaboration between the UK and devolved governments will be vital to making this vision a reality,"" he said.

Adele album becomes 2021's fastest-seller,"Adele's sales are down on her last album, but that's at least partially down to a changing music consumption landscape Adele's 30 has shot to number one, overtaking Abba to become the fastest-selling album of the year so far. Its 261,000 first-week chart sales mean it sped pastthe Swedish pop group's comeback album Voyage, which opened with 204,000 sales. However, Adele's sales figures are significantly lower than those of her previous album 25, released in 2015. That album, her third, opened with 800,000 first-week sales, which means 30 has sold 32% of its predecessor. The drop can be partially explained by the huge growth of streaming in the last six years. Added to which, there was a greater incentive for fans to buy 25, as it was kept off streaming platforms for its first six months of release. Adele's opening sales have topped those of Abba's long-awaited comeback album Voyage Adele won out over Ed Sheeran's = (Equals) album to claim top spot this week. This means she has now secured a chart double, with the album's lead single Easy On Me remaining number one for a sixth consecutive week. Adele's opening week success with 30 ensures all four of her albums have now reached number one - a record for a female act. Allow YouTube content?

The album made up 67% of all physical sales and became the most-streamed album of the week, with 55.7 million plays across all tracks. The numbers mark the biggest first week for an album since Sheeran's Ã· (Divide) in 2017. It is also strongest opening week for a female solo album since Adele's last studio album 25, which was released in November 2015. The London-born star has said that 30 is an attempt to explain her divorce from her husband to nine-year-old son Angelo. The BBC's reviewsaid it finds an ""emotionally bewildered"" Adele ""at the top of her game"". Adele's last album achieved platinum status in 24 hours, selling 300,000 copies in a single day. Her latest hasn't reached that figure after a week on sale. But go easy on her - album sales have fallen precipitously in the six years since Adele released 25. Back then, streaming accounted for just 11% of the UK's music market - and no-one thought it was odd for Adele to withhold her album from Spotify and Apple. By relying on CDs, vinyl and downloads, she racked upa record-breaking 800,000 sales in the space of a week. Today, 80% of music consumption is on streaming services and most of Adele's fans are happy not to own a hard copy of 30. That's reflected in lower sales figures - but Adele is still setting fire to the rain. In the US, 30 is already the biggest-seller of the year, overtaking albums by Drake and Olivia Rodrigo. In the UK, her first-week total of 261,000 is miles ahead of the 7,317 copies Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia sold on its fourth week at number one last May (the lowest ever total for a UK chart topper). The record industry and the media still rely on album sales as a measure of success - but in reality, the public has moved on. Adele's success should really be measured in cultural impact. Her US TV special was watched by more people than the Grammys or the Oscars. The British equivalent drew a peak audience of 5.4 million viewers, helping ITV achieve its biggest Sunday night of the year. The real question is whether, after this publicity blitz, her new music will hang around. ""Success may be more about whether, two months down the line, we still have memes flooding TikTok and James Corden doing skits,""observed music industry analyst Mark Mulligan,external. ""This will say as much about how the world is responding to her music than how many streams she clocks up."" Abba's Voyage slips to third place this week, while Oasis are a new entry at number four with the live recording of their Britpop-defining Knebworth gig from 1996. Other debut entries in the top 10 include Robert Plant and Alison Krauss' second collaboration Raise The Roof and London rap collective D Block Europe's new mixtape Home Alone 2. Rock-pop veterans Elbow also feature with their latest album Flying Dream 1. Adele gets Spotify to take shuffle off album pages What we learned from Adele's Oprah interview Adele's comeback single: Hit or miss? In the singles rundown, Adele's chart domination means her biggest competition remains... herself. The singer's 101,000 chart sales and 11.5 million streams of Easy On Me beat out her two other tracks from 30 - Oh My God, which claims the week's highest new entry at number two, and I Drink Wine at number four. Easy On Me is now Adele's longest-running chart-topper, outstripping Someone Like You. Ed Sheeran is Adele's only competition in the top 5 of the singles chart Her closest competition in the singles chart, Sheeran, slipped to third with Shiver, while Bad Habits spent its 22nd week in the top 10 at number five.

UK car output suffers worst October for 65 years,"UK car production dropped by more than 40% last month to the lowest level recorded for October since 1956. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the fall was due to ""a global shortage of semiconductors which led to production stoppages"". It added that the decline, compared to last year, was exacerbated bythe closure of a Honda plant in Swindonat the end of July. ""These figures are extremely worrying,"" said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes. He added that they ""show how badly the global semiconductor shortage is hitting UK car manufacturers and their suppliers"". New cars often include dozens of microchips - also called semiconductors - but a shortage has put pressure on a number of carmakers, who are competing directly with tech companies and the consumer electronics sector for supply. Why is there a chip shortage? The UK manufactured 64,729 cars in October, down 41.4% compared with the same month last year. The SMMT said it was the fourth consecutive month of decline. ""Britain's automotive sector is resilient but with Covid resurgent across some of our largest markets and global supply chains stretched and even breaking, the immediate challenges in keeping the industry operational are immense,"" said Mr Hawes. The shift away from traditional petrol and diesel cars continued, with production of battery electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid vehicles comprising 30.9% of all cars made in October. The SMMT said battery electric vehicle production rose by 17.5% to 8,454 cars. ""So far this year, UK car makers have produced more than 50,000 zero emission vehicles, exceeding the total built in the whole of the pre-pandemic 2019,"" it said. The UK has said it will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and hybrids by 2035.

"We must act quickly over Covid variant - ministerThe health secretary says southern African travel restrictions were imposed due to a ""substantial risk"" to health.UK","The new Covid variant circulating in South Africa that prompted UK travel restrictions is a ""huge international concern"", the health secretary says. Sajid Javid said experience has shown ""we must move quickly and at the earliest possible moment"". He said it might be more transmissible, vaccines might be less effective against it and it might affect one of the UK's major treatments, Ronapreve. No cases of the variant have yet been detected in the UK. Mr Javid told the House of Commons it was ""highly likely"" the B.1.1.529 variant had already spread from South Africa and Botswana, where confirmed cases have been found, to other countries. Travellers from these countries, as well as Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini, will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with those arriving after 04:00 GMT on Sunday required to quarantine in a hotel. All flights from the six countries are also being suspended until the hotel quarantine system is in operation. Other countries have also imposed travel restrictionson them, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called for air travel to the European Union from these countries, and others affected by the variant, to be suspended ""until we have a clear understanding about the danger posed by this new variant"". What do we know about this new variant? Borders shut as new coronavirus variant emerges South Africans fear impact of new variant measures Mr Javid said he was concerned the variant ""may pose substantial risk to public health"" as it has ""an unusually high number of mutations"". He said as well as possibly boosting transmission and affecting vaccine protection, the mutations may weaken the antibody treatment Ronapreve, which is beinggiven to the most vulnerable hospital patients. ""One of the lessons of this pandemic has been that we must move quickly, and at the earliest possible moment,"" he said. ""We're heading into winter and our booster programme is still ongoing, so we must act with caution."" South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana have identified just 59 cases of the variant, so far. Belgium announced on Friday afternoon it had Europe's first case of the variant, while Israeli media also reported one case involving a traveller. Scientists say the variant has 50 mutations overall and more than 30 on the spike protein, which is the target of most vaccines and the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at Oxford University, said: ""It's bad news, but it's not doomsday."" The variant would ""almost certainly"" make vaccines less effective, but they would still work to some extent. New drugs to treat Covid-19 would not be affected by the variant, he suggested. One scientist told me this was the worst variant they'd seen - look at it on paper and it's not hard to see why. It is the most heavily mutated variant so far and is now radically different to the form that emerged in Wuhan, China. That means vaccines, which were designed using the original, may not be as effective. And some of its mutations are known to increase the ability of coronaviruses to spread. But there have been many variants that looked bad on paper before, but haven't taken off. There are early signs this virus is spreading in South Africa and may already be in every province in the country. But the big questions - how much does it evade vaccines, is it more severe, does it spread faster that Delta - are unanswerable for now. Read more from James. It had not been proven the variant was more transmissible, but it has mutations consistent with the Delta variant and appeared to spread more quickly than other variants, Prof Naismith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The travel ban will slow it down,"" he said. ""It will get here but it will give us a few more weeks."" From midday non-UK and Irish residents will be banned from entering England if they have been in the six countries in the past 10 days. Any British or Irish resident arriving from the countries after 04:00 GMT on Sunday will have to quarantine in a hotel, with those returning before that being asked to isolate at home. The announcements prompteda slump in airline stocks, with the share price of British Airways' owner IAG dropping by 15%. Overall, London's main FTSE-100 share index closed down more than 3% and saw its biggest fall in points since the early days of the pandemic in March. This video can not be played Travellers at Cape Town airport respond to new UK quarantine measures over Covid variant At Cape Town airport, one woman whose sister had just made it on to a flight back to the UK said: ""It's absolutely ridiculous they've imposed it again so quickly without really investigating this new variant. ""We're just trying to get on our feet again with tourism and this will just kill it."" But another traveller was unconcerned. ""I love being back in Cape Town, so if I get stuck here - what a pleasure!"" Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, said the variant was the ""most worrying that we've seen"". Shares hit as new variant rattles investors What are the latest changes to UK travel rules? She said scientists needed to learn more about the variant before they could be certain but it appeared that ""there's mutations which increase infectivity, mutations that evade the immune response - both from vaccines and from natural immunity - and mutations that cause increased transmissibility"". She said South Africa had a very low rate of cases which more than doubled in two weeks. But she added the variant, which was first reported on 22 November, could be detected easily with genomic sequencing and it was ""reassuring"" it had not been seen in the UK yet. While there have been no cases of the new variant, there have been a further 50,091 Covid cases in the UK and another 160 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, thelatest government figures show,external. Nearly 400,000 boosters have been administered, meaning about 16.8 million people in the UK have had a third dose of a Covid vaccine - 29.2% of the population aged over 12. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it wasnot time to ""press the panic button""over the new variant, and said that there was no need to revisit the recent decision not to extend the nation's vaccine passport scheme. People who have returned to the UK from the six red list countries will be asked to take a PCR test to try to identify any cases. Severalother countries joined the UK in imposing travel restrictionson southern African nations, including Japan, Singapore and Israel. But a scientist leading efforts in South Africa to understand the new variant, Prof Tulio de Oliveira, said: ""The world should provide support to South Africa and Africa and not discriminate or isolate it."" He saidthe country needed scientific and financial helpto ensure the variant does not spread worldwide, including support for deprived people who could not otherwise endure a lockdown.

""One of the lessons of this pandemic has been that we must move quickly, and at the earliest possible moment,"" he said. ""We're heading into winter and our booster programme is still ongoing, so we must act with caution."" South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana have identified just 59 cases of the variant, so far. Belgium announced on Friday afternoon it had Europe's first case of the variant, while Israeli media also reported one case involving a traveller. Scientists say the variant has 50 mutations overall and more than 30 on the spike protein, which is the target of most vaccines and the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at Oxford University, said: ""It's bad news, but it's not doomsday."" The variant would ""almost certainly"" make vaccines less effective, but they would still work to some extent. New drugs to treat Covid-19 would not be affected by the variant, he suggested. One scientist told me this was the worst variant they'd seen - look at it on paper and it's not hard to see why. It is the most heavily mutated variant so far and is now radically different to the form that emerged in Wuhan, China. That means vaccines, which were designed using the original, may not be as effective. And some of its mutations are known to increase the ability of coronaviruses to spread. But there have been many variants that looked bad on paper before, but haven't taken off. There are early signs this virus is spreading in South Africa and may already be in every province in the country. But the big questions - how much does it evade vaccines, is it more severe, does it spread faster that Delta - are unanswerable for now. Read more from James. It had not been proven the variant was more transmissible, but it has mutations consistent with the Delta variant and appeared to spread more quickly than other variants, Prof Naismith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The travel ban will slow it down,"" he said. ""It will get here but it will give us a few more weeks."" From midday non-UK and Irish residents will be banned from entering England if they have been in the six countries in the past 10 days. Any British or Irish resident arriving from the countries after 04:00 GMT on Sunday will have to quarantine in a hotel, with those returning before that being asked to isolate at home. The announcements prompteda slump in airline stocks, with the share price of British Airways' owner IAG dropping by 15%. Overall, London's main FTSE-100 share index closed down more than 3% and saw its biggest fall in points since the early days of the pandemic in March. This video can not be played Travellers at Cape Town airport respond to new UK quarantine measures over Covid variant At Cape Town airport, one woman whose sister had just made it on to a flight back to the UK said: ""It's absolutely ridiculous they've imposed it again so quickly without really investigating this new variant. ""We're just trying to get on our feet again with tourism and this will just kill it."" But another traveller was unconcerned. ""I love being back in Cape Town, so if I get stuck here - what a pleasure!"" Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, said the variant was the ""most worrying that we've seen"". Shares hit as new variant rattles investors What are the latest changes to UK travel rules? She said scientists needed to learn more about the variant before they could be certain but it appeared that ""there's mutations which increase infectivity, mutations that evade the immune response - both from vaccines and from natural immunity - and mutations that cause increased transmissibility"". She said South Africa had a very low rate of cases which more than doubled in two weeks. But she added the variant, which was first reported on 22 November, could be detected easily with genomic sequencing and it was ""reassuring"" it had not been seen in the UK yet. While there have been no cases of the new variant, there have been a further 50,091 Covid cases in the UK and another 160 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, thelatest government figures show,external. Nearly 400,000 boosters have been administered, meaning about 16.8 million people in the UK have had a third dose of a Covid vaccine - 29.2% of the population aged over 12. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it wasnot time to ""press the panic button""over the new variant, and said that there was no need to revisit the recent decision not to extend the nation's vaccine passport scheme. People who have returned to the UK from the six red list countries will be asked to take a PCR test to try to identify any cases. Severalother countries joined the UK in imposing travel restrictionson southern African nations, including Japan, Singapore and Israel. But a scientist leading efforts in South Africa to understand the new variant, Prof Tulio de Oliveira, said: ""The world should provide support to South Africa and Africa and not discriminate or isolate it."" He saidthe country needed scientific and financial helpto ensure the variant does not spread worldwide, including support for deprived people who could not otherwise endure a lockdown.

Black Friday tipped to hit record sales,"Black Friday sales are on track to beat the bumper shopping bonanzas of the last two years, latest data suggests. Barclaycard, which processes about Â£1 in every Â£3 spent using cards, said by 17:00 GMT, there were 23% more transactions than that point in 2020. And the firm said there was a 2.4% rise in the volume of payments compared with the same period on Black Friday 2019. Analysts PwC predict Â£8.7bn will be spent on Friday, twice the amount spent last year, during lockdown. It is also higher than the Â£7.8bn spent before the pandemic in 2019. The increase comes despite warnings to expect less generous discounts and some shortages. Black Friday, which began in the US, sees retailers slash prices to entice shoppers ahead of the Christmas period. It is officially on Friday 26 November but retailers' campaigns span the whole month and started earlier than ever this year, with some in October. 'I don't need a new TV, but I'll probably get one' Warning over Black Friday price offers Tech retailers warn of low Black Friday stock Rob Cameron, chief executive of Barclaycard Payments, said Black Friday was off to a ""strong start"" despite the country's economic challenges. ""As we reach the end of the Black Friday, it is great to see that the trend we have been seeing throughout the day has continued, and retailers will be happy that today's trading figures have surpassed those secured in 2019. ""They will be hoping for this spending pattern to continue, not only in the last few hours of trading, and into Cyber Monday, but also in the run up to the festive season."" Metapack, a firm that connects major retailers with parcel delivery services, said data indicated that the biggest shipping days would take place on Monday and Tuesday, the same as last year. PwC predicts about 60% of adults in the UK will make purchases, spending an average of Â£280 each. Campaigners are blocking multiple entrances using bamboo structures, lock-ons, and banners But people are not only venturing out for shopping trips. On Friday, protestors gathered at Amazon buildings in the UK, US and Europe, with unions, equality and environmental groups sayingBlack Friday ""epitomises an obsession with over-consumption"". Meanwhile, Extinction Rebellion has targetedAmazon depots in the UK, blocking entrances and access roads. Linda Ellett, head of consumer markets at analysts KPMG, said deals were likely to be worse this year as retailers struggled with global supply issues linked to the pandemic, and shortages of HGV drivers and warehouse staff. Black Friday is the first big test for supply chains in the all important ""golden quarter"" for retailers. Shoppers have been buying early, worried they won't get the presents they want if they leave it until the last minute this year. Black Friday started as a one-day event but is now almost a month long blizzard of promotions. But expect fewer deals overall this time around amid all the problems over stock availability and labour shortages. Many retailers can ill afford to slash prices when their costs are soaring. Retailers also want to smooth out demand to try to reduce the pressure on distribution centres where goods are picked, packed and despatched over the big Black Friday weekend. A lot of businesses have been removing next day delivery options to help them cope. Some businesses, especially smaller independents, will shun this event altogether. It may have a lost a bit of its lustre, but Black Friday is still a massive shopping event. And it will probably be the most well organised retailers with scale and the biggest clout over suppliers who will cope the best. There are concerns some retailers will not be able to meet demand on the day, leading to long waits for orders to be processed and delivered. But analysts say most brands have spent months preparing for the sale and will have enough stock - although shoppers will not always get their first choice of product. John Lewis told the BBC: ""We've worked closely with our suppliers and we are confident we've got an extensive range of deals across a wide range of categories that represent great value for our customers."" AO World, which has hired 500 extra drivers ahead of the day, said: ""Like all electrical retailers, we are currently unable to get all the stock we need in categories like gaming to meet customer demand largely because of global microchip shortages. ""We are working closely with our partners so that our customers continue to get the exceptional service and range they rely on."" Metapack thinks most retailers will avoid a ""perfect storm"" but a few could be unlucky. ""We've already seen retailers reach out and suggest customers buy early for Christmas which should ease the pressure,"" said senior vice president Tom Forbes. This video can not be played ""It's harder to give those big headline discounts"" Some big brands such as M&S and Next have shunned Black Friday this year, with M&S again saying its focus was on ""offering great value throughout the whole season"". Many independent shops have also opted-out as they cannot afford to offer deep discounts in the vital Christmas shopping period. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, urged shoppers to support smaller local businesses who are ""pinning their hopes to a bumper festive season"" after last year's restrictions. He said: ""Rather than reaching for the same old brands - where deals might not be all they seem in any case - shop bespoke, receive one-to-one personal service and give some new restaurants, cafes and pubs a try."" Shoppers have also been warned to check whether offers are all they seem. An investigation by consumer rights group Which? found that 92% of Black Friday deals in 2020 were the same price or cheaper in the six months before the event. The Potions Cauldron gift shop in York is one of the independent retailers not taking part in Black Friday. Manager Phil Pinder thinks it's an American invention driven by retailers like Amazon who want to ""squeeze everyone else out"". ""I read a story saying that some of the electrical retailers are going to run out of stock by Christmas from doing Black Friday deals. ""I'm not playing that game... it seems illogical."" The shop, which sells magical themed drinks, sweets and gifts, has been doing well this year but it is struggling with product shortages due to supply chain issues. Phil says it is missing about Â£50,000 of stock it hoped to sell before Christmas which is ""a real headache"". His message to shoppers this festive season is buy early: ""If you want to get a specific present, go out and get it now. There are probably not going to be many of those last minute sales this Christmas because I don't think the retailers will have the stock."" Protests hit Amazon on Black Friday Arrests after activists target Amazon warehouses 'I don't need a new TV, but I'll probably get one' 'It's harder to give those big headline discounts' Video, 00:01:46'It's harder to give those big headline discounts' Warning over Black Friday price offers Tech retailers warn of low Black Friday stock Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

From Monday, only US citizens and residents will be allowed to travel from the region. This follows similar restrictions imposed by the EU and the UK. Canada is also introducing travel restrictions. The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier declared the new variant to be ""of concern"", naming it Omicron. US officials said travellers from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi will be blocked, mirroring earlier moves taken by the EU. The ban will come into effect on Monday. In a statement, President Joe Biden called the move a ""precautionary measure"" taken until more is known about the variant. Canada is also shutting its borders to foreign travellers who have recently been to South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Foreign citizens will be banned from Canada if they have been to the seven nations in the past 14 days. The Omicron variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November, and has since been identified in other countries. South Africa's health ministry has criticised the rush to impose new travel restrictions, calling them ""draconian"", and contrary to WHO guidance. Scientists say they still have much to learn about the virus's new mutations, and the WHO has said it will take a few weeks to understand the impact of the new variant, as experts work to determine how transmissible it is. The WHO on Friday said preliminary evidence suggested the new variant carried a higher risk of reinfection than other variants.

LiveLiveDriver walkout hits six Tube linesCommuters face travel disruption as 24-hour strike action hits the London Underground.,"Action taken by drivers affected the Piccadilly, Jubilee, Victoria, Central, Northern and Waterloo & City lines Harry LowBBC London News That's it for Friday's coverage of London's most widespread strike action in three years. You can read the full storyhere. We'll have more coverage across the weekend as the Night Tube's resumption is affected by further walkouts on Saturday. Oh, and yes, some of us will be tackling the Tube on the journey home. Transport for London's director of customer relations Nick Dent has told BBC London the Night Tube WILL relaunch tomorrow night. However, he recommended that passengers check before travelling as ""there may be a reduced level of service"". He said: ""We're confident we'll be running a Night Tube service on the Victoria and Central lines. ""It's a very important milestone for London."" Harry LowBBC London News Attention turns to the weekend and Sunday's planned resumption of the Night Tube, on the Central and Victoria lines, which is also due to be disrupted. Another walkout from 20:30 GMT on Saturday means that passengers planning to take their first Night Tube since March 2020 will have to wait a little longer.  Allow Twitter content?

Harry LowBBC London News  Six London Underground lines have been halted by the city's most widespread strike action since 2018. Friday's industrial action by the RMT union meant that only 60% of services were able to run, according to Transport for London (TfL). Three of the lines affected were suspended during various parts of the day with others unable to maintain the frequency of service expected, even with reduced numbers of post-lockdown commuters. This is the first in a series of walkouts with no indication that talks between TfL and the RMT are due to take place.  Queues for taxis are growing at two major railway stations as Friday's rush hour gets into full swing. At both King's Cross St Pancras and Euston, queues were seen snaking around as people sought to get to their destination ahead of the weekend.  Keith Prince, Conservative spokesman for the London Assembly's transport committee, has told BBC Radio London today's strike is ""almost suicidal on behalf of the unions"" given the parlous state of Transport for London's finances. He said: ""It's a mess that's of the mayor's own making but I think the Tube strikers are being very selfish. ""We're in the middle of a pandemic, we're trying to get London back on its feet. This is not the way to do it.""  Two lines remain suspended entirely. Five other lines are operating special services or with severe delays,according to TfL,external. One of London's most iconic venues has warned gig-goers to check travel routes before attending. Brixton Academy hosts Manchester rock band The Courteeners this evening. But the nearest tube station, Brixton, is facing a disrupted service until 04.30 GMT on Saturday due to the RMT walkout on the Victoria line. The venue is accessible by several bus routes and via Northern line trains, which are also facing disruption. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

John Leach from the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union says today's walk-out is ""an indication of how strongly the workforce feel about it"". He told BBC London: âHundreds and hundreds and hundreds of RMT train drivers havenât come to work today. âWe think the Tube is a great place to work normally and is a great asset for London. ""We would encourage proper investment for it and for people to be encouraged to use it."" ""We remain open for talks but
nothing planned currently,"" a spokesman for Transport for London says.  Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London A picture of a strike from 2012 This isnât a full strike across all unions and all lines â
it affected six and involved only RMT drivers. That means the impact isnât as
much as in some of the full-scale strikes we have seen previously. You can also factor in the lower levels of passengers anyway and the fact working from
home on a Friday seems to be the new norm for many. However, the strike took out
40% of services and the RMT union will regard that as a significant in getting
their message across. Seven more strikes are planned so youâd hope there will be
talks on Monday. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News The RMT Union's John Leach has been speaking to BBC London at one of its picket lines in Stratford, east London. He said: """"I hope TfL and the Mayor of London recognise why these fantastic
men and women, who kept London moving through the pandemic, have gone on strike. ""This
should be a wake-up call for them."" Another strike is planned tomorrow â intended to hit the
relaunch of the Night Tube The mayor of London must ""face down"" the unions in order to get the Night Tube working, a conservative assembly member has said. Emma Best, a Conservative London Assembly
Member, called the RMT's walkout on the London Underground ""an
unwarranted attack on London's commuters and visitors by a deluded trade union"". Ms Best, who has previously campaigned for the Nigh Tube to reopen to improve women's safety, said: ""Disrupting Londonersâ lives and wrecking the return of London's much-needed
Night Tube will achieve nothing. ""Transport
for London is only asking drivers to do four shifts a year on the Night Tube to
provide Londoners with a safe route home at night. Other trade unions have
already agreed to the change. ""The
Mayor personally assured me in the London Assembly that he would resolve this
dispute so the Night Tube could reopen tomorrow. ""He must stand up for
Londoners, face down the RMT union, and ensure the Night Tube reopens in full
as soon as possible.""  Thomas MackintoshBBC London News Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lacey, 17, who came to lay flowers and a balloon, said her younger sister had been close friends with Ava. ""She was just a bubbly character, so loving and caring,"" she added. By Andy Gill, BBC North West Tonight reporter There is a massive police presence in Liverpool with several of the city's main shopping streets taped off. Dozens of police vehicles are parked close to the scene where 12-year-old Ava was fatally attacked. Many shoppers and tourists are having to ask officers how they can get to their destinations as many are unaware of the tragedy which lies behind the disruption to their usual routine. Ava died on what is called White Ribbon Day, a worldwide campaign to end violence against women and girls. Civic leaders came together yesterday to mark it and start 16 days of activity to highlight the issue. The death of a girl, not yet in her teens, throws the need for the campaign into the starkest relief. Forensic teams could be seen carrying out fingertip searches The four boys - a 13-year-old, two 14-year-olds and a 15-year-old - remain in custody for questioning. They were arrested at different locations during Thursday evening and into the early hours of Friday, police said. A police cordon was in place surrounding Williamson Square, Tarleton Street, Church Street, Church Alley and School Lane crossing over Hanover Street on to Fleet Street. Several shops on Church Street, one of the city's main shopping streets, remained closed on Black Friday due to the cordon.

Macron and Johnson clash over migrant boatsThe French president accuses the UK prime minister of not being serious as diplomatic row escalates.Europe,"Emmanuel Macron has reacted angrily to Boris Johnson's public call for France to take back migrants who reach the UK. The French president accused the UK prime minister of not being ""serious"" by making the call on Twitter, after the deaths of 27 people on Wednesday. The diplomatic row erupted after France withdrew a summit invitation to Home Secretary Priti Patel. The UK government urged it to reconsider, with the PM saying: ""This is a problem we have to fix together."" Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany and the European Commission are due to attend Sunday's talks in Calais, which Mr Macron set up to deal with the recent surge in migrant crossings of the Channel. The diplomatic spat comes as French fishermen are holding a day of action, including blockades, to disrupt cross-Channel traffic, in protest at post-Brexit fishing rights granted by the UK. Why Iraqi Kurds risk their lives to reach the West Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Scramble to identify dead in Channel tragedy The sinking of an inflatable boat on Wednesday marked the biggest loss of life by drowning in the Channel in many years, with 17 men, seven women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children dying. Ahead of Sunday's meeting, in a letter to Mr Macron on Thursday which was shared on Twitter, Mr Johnson set out five steps which he said could help avoid a repeat of the tragedy. These included joint patrols, better use of technology such as sensors and radar, maritime patrols in each other's waters and stronger cooperation by intelligence services. The letter also called for immediate work on a policy of returning migrants who reach the UK to France, alongside talks to establish a UK-EU returns agreement. French boats blocked the entrance to the port of St Malo in protest at post-Brexit fishing rules But the French government reacted furiously, withdrawing Ms Patel's invitation to the Calais meeting. At a press conference on Friday, Mr Macron attacked Mr Johnson over the posting of the letter on Twitter, saying: ""I spoke two days ago with Prime Minster Johnson in a serious way. ""For my part I continue to do that, as I do with all countries and all leaders. I am surprised by methods when they are not serious. ""We do not communicate from one leader to another on these issues by tweets and letters that we make public. We are not whistleblowers."" A French government spokesman accused Mr Johnson of saying different things in his conversation with Mr Macron and in the letter, adding: ""We are sick of double-speak."" The UK insists the prime minister's letter was sincere, meant to be constructive, not combative. But the French suspicion is that the letter was actually directed more at Mr Johnson's Conservative Party than Paris. The French believe Mr Johnson is in an uncomfortable position with his supporters now, having promised that Brexit would mean ""taking back control"" of UK waters and borders. The UK government insists the letter was sent in good faith. Paris says such a delicate matter as migration, especially between France and post-Brexit UK, should be handled with care, away from the media glare. Read Katya's blog in full But a Downing Street spokesman said: ""We have spoken about many of these ideas before. The public understandably want to know what we are doing to prevent this happening again. We want to work closely with France."" ""If you look at the tone of the letter, this is about deepening our co-operation,"" the spokesman added. This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps: ""I hope that the French will reconsider"" Home Office officials are still taking part in talks with their French counterparts in Paris on how to deal with the Channel crisis. Reports from Calais say the two survivors of Wednesday's sinking - one Iraqi and the other Somali - have been discharged from hospital and are due to be questioned about how many people were on the boat. For Labour, shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the prime minister of a ""grave error of judgement"" in sending the letter and of having ""completely lost control of the situation in the Channel"". But Conservative MP Tim Loughton, a member of the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, called France's decision not to invite Ms Patel to the Calais meeting ""incredible"", adding that Mr Johnson's letter had been ""perfectly reasonable"".

Floral tributes have been left near the scene, with one message saying: ""Rest in peace angel."" Lacey, 17, who came to lay flowers and a balloon, said her younger sister had been close friends with Ava. ""She was just a bubbly character, so loving and caring,"" she added. By Andy Gill, BBC North West Tonight reporter There is a massive police presence in Liverpool with several of the city's main shopping streets taped off. Dozens of police vehicles are parked close to the scene where 12-year-old Ava was fatally attacked. Many shoppers and tourists are having to ask officers how they can get to their destinations as many are unaware of the tragedy which lies behind the disruption to their usual routine. Ava died on what is called White Ribbon Day, a worldwide campaign to end violence against women and girls. Civic leaders came together yesterday to mark it and start 16 days of activity to highlight the issue. The death of a girl, not yet in her teens, throws the need for the campaign into the starkest relief. Forensic teams could be seen carrying out fingertip searches The four boys - a 13-year-old, two 14-year-olds and a 15-year-old - remain in custody for questioning. They were arrested at different locations during Thursday evening and into the early hours of Friday, police said. A police cordon was in place surrounding Williamson Square, Tarleton Street, Church Street, Church Alley and School Lane crossing over Hanover Street on to Fleet Street. Several shops on Church Street, one of the city's main shopping streets, remained closed on Black Friday due to the cordon.

Black Friday tipped to hit strongest ever sales,"Black Friday sales are on track to beat the bumper shopping bonanzas of the last two years, latest data suggests. Barclaycard, which processes about Â£1 in every Â£3 spent using cards, said by 17:00 GMT, there were 23% more transactions than that point in 2020. And the firm said there was a 2.4% rise in the volume of payments compared with the same period on Black Friday 2019. Analysts PwC predict Â£8.7bn will be spent on Friday, twice the amount spent last year, during lockdown. It is also higher than the Â£7.8bn spent before the pandemic in 2019. The increase comes despite warnings to expect less generous discounts and some shortages. Black Friday, which began in the US, sees retailers slash prices to entice shoppers ahead of the Christmas period. It is officially on Friday 26 November but retailers' campaigns span the whole month and started earlier than ever this year, with some in October. 'I don't need a new TV, but I'll probably get one' Warning over Black Friday price offers Tech retailers warn of low Black Friday stock Rob Cameron, chief executive of Barclaycard Payments, said Black Friday was off to a ""strong start"" despite the country's economic challenges. ""As we reach the end of the Black Friday, it is great to see that the trend we have been seeing throughout the day has continued, and retailers will be happy that today's trading figures have surpassed those secured in 2019. ""They will be hoping for this spending pattern to continue, not only in the last few hours of trading, and into Cyber Monday, but also in the run up to the festive season."" Metapack, a firm that connects major retailers with parcel delivery services, said data indicated that the biggest shipping days would take place on Monday and Tuesday, the same as last year. PwC predicts about 60% of adults in the UK will make purchases, spending an average of Â£280 each. Campaigners are blocking multiple entrances using bamboo structures, lock-ons, and banners But people are not only venturing out for shopping trips. On Friday, protestors gathered at Amazon buildings in the UK, US and Europe, with unions, equality and environmental groups sayingBlack Friday ""epitomises an obsession with over-consumption"". Meanwhile, Extinction Rebellion has targetedAmazon depots in the UK, blocking entrances and access roads. Linda Ellett, head of consumer markets at analysts KPMG, said deals were likely to be worse this year as retailers struggled with global supply issues linked to the pandemic, and shortages of HGV drivers and warehouse staff. Black Friday is the first big test for supply chains in the all important ""golden quarter"" for retailers. Shoppers have been buying early, worried they won't get the presents they want if they leave it until the last minute this year. Black Friday started as a one-day event but is now almost a month long blizzard of promotions. But expect fewer deals overall this time around amid all the problems over stock availability and labour shortages. Many retailers can ill afford to slash prices when their costs are soaring. Retailers also want to smooth out demand to try to reduce the pressure on distribution centres where goods are picked, packed and despatched over the big Black Friday weekend. A lot of businesses have been removing next day delivery options to help them cope. Some businesses, especially smaller independents, will shun this event altogether. It may have a lost a bit of its lustre, but Black Friday is still a massive shopping event. And it will probably be the most well organised retailers with scale and the biggest clout over suppliers who will cope the best. There are concerns some retailers will not be able to meet demand on the day, leading to long waits for orders to be processed and delivered. But analysts say most brands have spent months preparing for the sale and will have enough stock - although shoppers will not always get their first choice of product. John Lewis told the BBC: ""We've worked closely with our suppliers and we are confident we've got an extensive range of deals across a wide range of categories that represent great value for our customers."" AO World, which has hired 500 extra drivers ahead of the day, said: ""Like all electrical retailers, we are currently unable to get all the stock we need in categories like gaming to meet customer demand largely because of global microchip shortages. ""We are working closely with our partners so that our customers continue to get the exceptional service and range they rely on."" Metapack thinks most retailers will avoid a ""perfect storm"" but a few could be unlucky. ""We've already seen retailers reach out and suggest customers buy early for Christmas which should ease the pressure,"" said senior vice president Tom Forbes. This video can not be played ""It's harder to give those big headline discounts"" Some big brands such as M&S and Next have shunned Black Friday this year, with M&S again saying its focus was on ""offering great value throughout the whole season"". Many independent shops have also opted-out as they cannot afford to offer deep discounts in the vital Christmas shopping period. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, urged shoppers to support smaller local businesses who are ""pinning their hopes to a bumper festive season"" after last year's restrictions. He said: ""Rather than reaching for the same old brands - where deals might not be all they seem in any case - shop bespoke, receive one-to-one personal service and give some new restaurants, cafes and pubs a try."" Shoppers have also been warned to check whether offers are all they seem. An investigation by consumer rights group Which? found that 92% of Black Friday deals in 2020 were the same price or cheaper in the six months before the event. The Potions Cauldron gift shop in York is one of the independent retailers not taking part in Black Friday. Manager Phil Pinder thinks it's an American invention driven by retailers like Amazon who want to ""squeeze everyone else out"". ""I read a story saying that some of the electrical retailers are going to run out of stock by Christmas from doing Black Friday deals. ""I'm not playing that game... it seems illogical."" The shop, which sells magical themed drinks, sweets and gifts, has been doing well this year but it is struggling with product shortages due to supply chain issues. Phil says it is missing about Â£50,000 of stock it hoped to sell before Christmas which is ""a real headache"". His message to shoppers this festive season is buy early: ""If you want to get a specific present, go out and get it now. There are probably not going to be many of those last minute sales this Christmas because I don't think the retailers will have the stock.""

UK car output suffers worst October for 65 yearsChip shortages lead to production dropping to the lowest level recorded for October since 1956.Business,"UK car production dropped by more than 40% last month to the lowest level recorded for October since 1956. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the fall was due to ""a global shortage of semiconductors which led to production stoppages"". It added that the decline, compared to last year, was exacerbated bythe closure of a Honda plant in Swindonat the end of July. ""These figures are extremely worrying,"" said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes. He added that they ""show how badly the global semiconductor shortage is hitting UK car manufacturers and their suppliers"". New cars often include dozens of microchips - also called semiconductors - but a shortage has put pressure on a number of carmakers, who are competing directly with tech companies and the consumer electronics sector for supply. Why is there a chip shortage? The UK manufactured 64,729 cars in October, down 41.4% compared with the same month last year. The SMMT said it was the fourth consecutive month of decline. ""Britain's automotive sector is resilient but with Covid resurgent across some of our largest markets and global supply chains stretched and even breaking, the immediate challenges in keeping the industry operational are immense,"" said Mr Hawes. The shift away from traditional petrol and diesel cars continued, with production of battery electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid vehicles comprising 30.9% of all cars made in October. The SMMT said battery electric vehicle production rose by 17.5% to 8,454 cars. ""So far this year, UK car makers have produced more than 50,000 zero emission vehicles, exceeding the total built in the whole of the pre-pandemic 2019,"" it said. The UK has said it will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and hybrids by 2035.

Shares hit as new Covid variant rattles investors,"Shares in BA owner IAG saw some of the biggest falls Stock markets across the world have fallen sharply after the discovery of a new Covid variant raised fears over the economic recovery. The FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares closed 3.7% down, while main markets in Germany, France and the US also sank. Shares in airlines and travel firms were hit hard, with BA-owner IAG and Wizz Air down 15%. Tui shed 10%. The UK and other nations have introduced a ban on flights from six southern African countries. UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said scientists were ""deeply concerned"" about the new Covid strain and its potential to evade immunity. The UK has temporarily banned flights from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini starting from midday on Friday until 04:00 on Sunday. What are the UK travel rules? Live: Latest on the new variant All six counties are being added to the UK's travel red list. It means that any British or Irish resident arriving from the countries after 04:00 on Sunday will have to quarantine in a hotel, with those returning before that being asked to isolate at home. The FTSE 100 indexsuffered its biggest one day drop in more than a year. Shares of major UK lenders HSBC, Lloyds Bank, NatWest and Barclays all fell about 7% as investors scaled back expectations of a Bank of England interest rate rise in December. The biggest FTSE 100 riser was food delivery firm Ocado, up 4.5%, on anticipation that online firms could be a beneficiary if tighter restrictions are reintroduced. Cruise operator Carnival suffered a 15% slide, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250, while EasyJet tumbled 11.5%. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said investors fear a new Covid variant ""will lead to fresh lockdowns, mobility restrictions and lower economic growth"". On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index slumped 2.8% in its shortened trading day following Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday. ""It's Black Friday today for the retailers, but it's 'Red Friday' right now for the stock market,"" said Patrick O'Hare at Briefing.com. Concern the new variant could slow global economic growth sent oil prices sharply lower. US WTI crude tumbled 11.3% to $69.53 per barrel, while European benchmark Brent retreated 10.2% to $73.81. The price of gold, a haven for investors in troubled times, rose. Despite the fall in the FTSE 100, the index is still trading nearly 12% higher than it was a year ago. A number of other countries - such as Germany, Italy and Israel - have banned flights from the six southern African nations. Both Germany and France's leading stock market indexes fell by more than 3% on Friday. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that other EU nations should also ""activate the emergency brake"" to stop travel from these countries. Allow Twitter content?

Overnight stock markets in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia also fell as did indexes in India and South Korea. Oil prices also declinedon fears the new Covid strain could lead to restrictions and dampen demand. Brent crude extended earlier declines to fall by 5.86% to $77.43 a barrel by early afternoon. ""The drop in the oil price is the market's way of saying it is worried about a reduction in economic activity,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. In London, shares in oil giant BP dropped by 6.2%% while rival Shell also saw its share price fall by more than 4.6%. But Mr Mould added: ""The flipside of falling commodity prices is that a weaker oil price should provide some relief in terms of inflationary pressures. ""That may cause central banks to be more cautious towards raising rates in the near-term, however it does depend on whether the new Covid strain causes significant disruption or can be contained as best as possible in a rapid manner."" Mr Javid said more needed to be learned about the new Covid variant. Only 59 confirmed cases have been identified in South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana so far. UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid says more needs to be learned about the new Covid variant However, he said the variant had a significant number of mutations, ""perhaps double the number of mutations that we have seen in the Delta variant"". He said that adding the six countries to the red list was about ""being cautious and taking action and trying to protect, as best we can, our borders"". How worrying is the new Covid variant? Covid variants: Do we need new vaccines yet? BA said: ""We'll be contacting affected customers with information about their flight."" It added it was advising passengers to monitor the latest travel advice with the UK government and on the BA website. Virgin Atlantic said its flights from Johannesburg to London Heathrow would be cancelled between midday on Friday to early on Sunday morning. ""We're currently reviewing our schedule of South Africa operations for the coming week,"" it added. The carrier said any customers booked to travel to or from South Africa with Virgin Atlantic should check on the company's website. If they have booked through third parties or agents, they should get in touch with them. We must act quickly over Covid variant - minister Omicron: Is it milder despite dodging immunity?

"Ambulances queue daily outside A&Es, study suggests","Ambulances transferring patients in the West Midlands earlier this year Ambulances are being forced to queue outside the majority of emergency departments before they can unload patients, a new survey suggests. Under NHS guidance, ambulance handovers should be completed within 15 minutes. But about two-thirds of A&Es polled by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) indicated they were struggling to meet the standard every day. The Department of Health said extra funding is being provided to boost staff numbers in key areas. RCEM president Dr Katherine Henderson said: ""We are facing a crisis in urgent care and a crisis of patient safety."" Lives at risk from long 999 waits, say paramedics Patient harm 'almost certain' with handover delays Patient had fatal heart attack in queuing ambulance The Royal College surveyed A&E departments across the UK between 8 and 14 November, receiving responses from 70 of about 230 units. During that week: 94% of clinical directors said that ambulances had been held outside their buildings at some point before patients could be taken into the hospital 61% said ambulances were being forced to queue every day About half of emergency departments said care had been provided to patients in non-medical areas such as corridors every day ""These results show the serious state that our urgent and emergency care system is in,"" said Dr Henderson. ""None of us want to have patients held in ambulances, treated in corridors, or waiting very long times to go up to a ward bed."" A separate RCEM report, published earlier this month, estimated that 4,519 patients had died after waiting more than 12 hours in emergency departments in England in 2020-2021. A spokesperson for England's Department of Health said: ""Ambulance Trusts have been given an extra Â£55m to boost staff numbers in control rooms and on the front line. ""This is on top of our record investment this year, including Â£5.4bn over the next six months to tackle the backlog, as well as Â£36bn for health and care over the next three years.""

Analysts PwC predict Â£8.7bn will be spent on Friday, twice the amount spent last year, during lockdown. It is also higher than the Â£7.8bn spent before the pandemic in 2019. The increase comes despite warnings to expect less generous discounts and some shortages. Black Friday, which began in the US, sees retailers slash prices to entice shoppers ahead of the Christmas period. It is officially on Friday 26 November but retailers' campaigns span the whole month and started earlier than ever this year, with some in October. 'I don't need a new TV, but I'll probably get one' Warning over Black Friday price offers Tech retailers warn of low Black Friday stock Rob Cameron, chief executive of Barclaycard Payments, said Black Friday was off to a ""strong start"" despite the country's economic challenges. ""As we reach the end of the Black Friday, it is great to see that the trend we have been seeing throughout the day has continued, and retailers will be happy that today's trading figures have surpassed those secured in 2019. ""They will be hoping for this spending pattern to continue, not only in the last few hours of trading, and into Cyber Monday, but also in the run up to the festive season."" Metapack, a firm that connects major retailers with parcel delivery services, said data indicated that the biggest shipping days would take place on Monday and Tuesday, the same as last year. PwC predicts about 60% of adults in the UK will make purchases, spending an average of Â£280 each. Campaigners are blocking multiple entrances using bamboo structures, lock-ons, and banners But people are not only venturing out for shopping trips. On Friday, protestors gathered at Amazon buildings in the UK, US and Europe, with unions, equality and environmental groups sayingBlack Friday ""epitomises an obsession with over-consumption"". Meanwhile, Extinction Rebellion has targetedAmazon depots in the UK, blocking entrances and access roads. Linda Ellett, head of consumer markets at analysts KPMG, said deals were likely to be worse this year as retailers struggled with global supply issues linked to the pandemic, and shortages of HGV drivers and warehouse staff. Black Friday is the first big test for supply chains in the all important ""golden quarter"" for retailers. Shoppers have been buying early, worried they won't get the presents they want if they leave it until the last minute this year. Black Friday started as a one-day event but is now almost a month long blizzard of promotions. But expect fewer deals overall this time around amid all the problems over stock availability and labour shortages. Many retailers can ill afford to slash prices when their costs are soaring. Retailers also want to smooth out demand to try to reduce the pressure on distribution centres where goods are picked, packed and despatched over the big Black Friday weekend. A lot of businesses have been removing next day delivery options to help them cope. Some businesses, especially smaller independents, will shun this event altogether. It may have a lost a bit of its lustre, but Black Friday is still a massive shopping event. And it will probably be the most well organised retailers with scale and the biggest clout over suppliers who will cope the best. There are concerns some retailers will not be able to meet demand on the day, leading to long waits for orders to be processed and delivered. But analysts say most brands have spent months preparing for the sale and will have enough stock - although shoppers will not always get their first choice of product. John Lewis told the BBC: ""We've worked closely with our suppliers and we are confident we've got an extensive range of deals across a wide range of categories that represent great value for our customers."" AO World, which has hired 500 extra drivers ahead of the day, said: ""Like all electrical retailers, we are currently unable to get all the stock we need in categories like gaming to meet customer demand largely because of global microchip shortages. ""We are working closely with our partners so that our customers continue to get the exceptional service and range they rely on."" Metapack thinks most retailers will avoid a ""perfect storm"" but a few could be unlucky. ""We've already seen retailers reach out and suggest customers buy early for Christmas which should ease the pressure,"" said senior vice president Tom Forbes. This video can not be played ""It's harder to give those big headline discounts"" Some big brands such as M&S and Next have shunned Black Friday this year, with M&S again saying its focus was on ""offering great value throughout the whole season"". Many independent shops have also opted-out as they cannot afford to offer deep discounts in the vital Christmas shopping period. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, urged shoppers to support smaller local businesses who are ""pinning their hopes to a bumper festive season"" after last year's restrictions. He said: ""Rather than reaching for the same old brands - where deals might not be all they seem in any case - shop bespoke, receive one-to-one personal service and give some new restaurants, cafes and pubs a try."" Shoppers have also been warned to check whether offers are all they seem. An investigation by consumer rights group Which? found that 92% of Black Friday deals in 2020 were the same price or cheaper in the six months before the event. The Potions Cauldron gift shop in York is one of the independent retailers not taking part in Black Friday. Manager Phil Pinder thinks it's an American invention driven by retailers like Amazon who want to ""squeeze everyone else out"". ""I read a story saying that some of the electrical retailers are going to run out of stock by Christmas from doing Black Friday deals. ""I'm not playing that game... it seems illogical."" The shop, which sells magical themed drinks, sweets and gifts, has been doing well this year but it is struggling with product shortages due to supply chain issues. Phil says it is missing about Â£50,000 of stock it hoped to sell before Christmas which is ""a real headache"". His message to shoppers this festive season is buy early: ""If you want to get a specific present, go out and get it now. There are probably not going to be many of those last minute sales this Christmas because I don't think the retailers will have the stock.""

LiveLiveNew Covid variant of huge international concern - Javid1 minute ago,"The World Health Organization designates the new highly mutated strain of Covid a ""variant of concern"" and gives it the Greek name Omicron Health Secretary Sajid Javid says there is ""huge international concern"" over the variant - but there are no UK cases The variant has been found in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong - and one case has been confirmed in Europe, in Belgium The US, UK, EU states and Switzerland halt travel to and from seven African nations Other countries including the UAE, Israel, Japan, Kenya and Singapore have also restricted travel The World Health Organization cautions against travel bans but has held a special meeting to discuss the variant A top UK health official calls it ""the most significant variant"" to date, while an Oxford scientist tells the BBC: ""It is bad news but it's not doomsday"" Edited by Alice Cuddy Dozens of countries have re-imposed travel bans We're closing our live page coverage for today. Here's a summary of the latest developments:  Today's live page was edited by Hamish Mackay, Rob Corp, Francesca Gillett, Alice Cuddy and Tom Spender and was written by Jack Hunter, Dulcie Lee, Mal Siret, Paul McLaren, Mary O'Connor, Adam Durbin, Matt Murphy and George Wright. Reality Check Vaccine supplies arriving earlier this year in DR Congo There have been repeated calls for wealthier
countries who have fully vaccinated a significant proportion of their
populations to share doses with others who havenât. A WHO target for 10% of the worldâs population to be fully
vaccinated by the end of September was missed by dozens of countries,many of them in Africa. The average for Africa is currently around 7% fully
vaccinated, with some countries as low as just 3%. There are some countries elsewhere in the world with very low
vaccination rates - often in conflict zones - like Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and
Myanmar. But Asia, Europe and the Americas have on average already
gone past 40% of their populations fully vaccinated, which is the WHO target for the end of this
year. It's no surprise that a new variant has emerged given the unequal distribution of vaccines to poorer countries, the co-chair of the African Union's Vaccine Delivery Alliance for Covid has told the BBC. But Dr Ayoade Ala-kija expressed doubt that there would now be a change of policy. ""The lack of political will and the failure to vaccinate the world was going to result in variants emerging. I think my surprise is that there are more variants out there not just in Africa but all over the world,"" she said. She said South Africa deserved praise for detecting the mutation but the Omicron variant might not have originated there and could already be spreading around the world. Travel bans affecting southern African nations were ""shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted"", she said. ""So will it mean that people will suddenly discover their sense of morality and and begin to distribute vaccines more equitably across the African continent? I'm not holding my breath."" Dr Ala-kija pointed out that the likes of the UK, Israel and the EU haven't placed travel bans on Belgium, despite it reporting a case of the new variant. Anti-vaccination protesters demonstrated in The Hague A rise in Covid cases - unrelated to the new Omicron variant - has prompted fresh restrictions in the Netherlands. From Sunday all hospitality venues must close from 17:00 to 05:00 local time, though some essential business such as supermarkets may remain open until 20.00. Amateur sports will also cease at 17.00. Schools will remain open, but students in secondary schools will have to wear masks. ""From Sunday, the whole of the Netherlands is effectively closed between 5pm and 5am,"" PM Mark Rutte told reporters during a press conference. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said the tougher restrictions were necessary to prevent the country's health system being overwhelmed. A small group anti-vaccination protesters gathered near parliament in The Hague, but they were outnumbered by riot police who kept watch. Emergency orders have been issued for the centre of The Hague and several other Dutch towns and cities to avoid a repeat of last weekend's riots. The head of the lab that first sequenced the new Covid variant Omicron has told the BBC that the strain has mutations not seen before. Professor Anne von Gottberg of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg said that most strains of the virus have about five to 10 spike mutations, but the Omicron has around 25 to 32. ""So it really was immediately noticeable that something unusual had happened,"" she said. ""There are a lot of mutations that are new and that we haven't seen before,"" she said. She said it was as yet unclear what can be determined from the multiple mutations. But she said it was precisely because they couldn't fully understand its characteristics that merited further study and a cautious approach to the new strain. As we've been reporting, a number ofcountries are tightening their travel restrictions after a new coronavirus variantwas identified in southern Africa earlier this week. Here are some of the major restrictions that have been announced so far: The United Statesis banning on South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi. US citizens and lawful permanent residents will be exempt from the restrictions, but will still need to test negative before flying. Canadais shutting its borders to all foreign travellers who have been to South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Mozambique in the past 14 days. EU nationswill impose an emergency flight ban on countries in southern Africa, after Europe's first case of the variant was discovered in Belgium. The ban will be applied to travellers from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, EU Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer said. Switzerlandwill require a 10-day quarantine period and a negative Covid test for travellers from Belgium,
Israel and Hong Kong, as well imposing travel bans on southern
African countries, Reuters news agency reports. TheUKhas temporarily halted flights from six southern African countries: South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Eswatini and Lesotho Singapore, Italy, FranceandIsraelhave also placedMozambiqueon their red lists. A number of North African and Middle-Eastern nations includingBahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt and Moroccohave introduced varying bans on travellers from the eight countries. Japanhas announced that from Saturday, travellers from much of southern Africa will need to quarantine for 10 days and take four tests during that time. Indiahas ordered more rigorous screening and testing for travellers arriving from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong, local media is reporting. AndIranwill ban travellers from six southern African countries, including South Africa. Iranians arriving from the region will be admitted after testing negative twice, state TV said. The World Health Organization has designated the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 as being ""of concern"", following its discovery by South African scientists. But what do we know about it so far? Broadly speaking there are thousands of different types, or variants, of Covid circulating around the world. Which is to be expected because viruses mutate constantly. But what has experts particularly worried with this strain of the virus, which is also known as B.1.1.529, is that it has mutated heavily and is very different to the original coronavirus strain which emerged in China, which current vaccines were designed to fight. There are 50 genetic changes in total and of these, 32 are in the spike protein of the virus - the part which is the target of vaccines. However, it is too soon to know how much of a omicron threat poses to vaccine efficacy and it will take several weeks before we have enough data to know for sure, experts have said. Read more about what we know about omicronhere. This video can not be played WHO name Omicron 'variant of concern' Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead, has been telling the BBC about the body's decision to label Omicron a variant of concern. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has postponed its first ministerial meeting in four years due to the new Omicron Covid-19 variant. Ministers from more than 160 WTO members were due to meet next
week in the Swiss city of Geneva for an event seen as a test of the body's relevance. WTO members reportedly took the decision at an urgent meeting held tonight. The European Centre for Disease Control (CDC) says that it has classified the new Omnicron coronavirus variant as being ""of concern"". Officials say that the level of risk associated with the variant is ""very high"" and that it is extremely likely that the variant will spread across the EU. The agency added that it feared the profile of the variant may mean that the effectiveness of vaccines could be reduced and that natural immunity may be decreased. Former UK PM Gordon Brown has been speaking to BBC Newsnight about pandemic and the emergence of new variants. He says, as he has done previously, that the UK government must do more to vaccinate poorer nations around the world. This video can not be played The pharmaceuticals manufacturer Novavax has begun work on a new version of its Covid-19 vaccine, aimed at targeting the Omicron variant. It says it hopes the vaccine will be ready for testing and manufacturing within a matter of weeks. Other vaccine companies have also been cautiously optimistic about their ability to counter any potential new challenges posed by the variant. BioNTech says it could produce and ship an updated version of its vaccine within 100 days if the new Covid variant detected in southern Africa is found to evade existing immunity. And AstraZeneca says it is already conducting research in Botswana and Eswatini, where the variant has been identified, to collect real-world data on how its shot performs against the new variant. Moderna has also said it will develop a booster shot for the new variant. People read information at a Covid-19 testing centre at the International Airport in Duesseldorf Here's a round-up of the latest developments if you're just joining us: Omicron is not the first ""variant of concern"" to have emerged during the pandemic. There are many different types of Covid-19 circulating around the world, which is to be expected because viruses mutate regularly. The most potentially dangerous ones are given the ""variants of concern,external"" classification and are kept under close observation. These include:  For more on the key Covid variantsclick here. US President Joe Biden has called on countries meeting at the World Trade Organization
next week to agree to waive intellectual property protections
for Covid vaccines in the wake of the new variant's discovery. He has reissued a calloriginally made in Mayby the US government for a temporary lift on patent protections This could allow vaccines to be manufactured faster and in more places around the world, as production would not be restricted by the patent rights owned by the pharmaceutical companies who developed them. However, manufacturers say it will not have the desired effect and critics argue it strips financial rewards and incentives from cutting-edge developers. The president also said other nations need to ramp up their vaccine donations to ""match Americaâs speed and generosity"". ""The news about this new variant should make clearer than
ever why this pandemic will not end until we have global
vaccinations,""he said in a statement,external. More now on the United States announcing travel restrictions on southern Africa. The travel ban will start on Monday, and include South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi, officials told reporters. The restrictions will not apply to US citizens and lawful permanent residents, but they will still need to test negative for coronavirus prior to travelling. Officials say the policy is being implemented ""out of an abundance of caution"". There was no indication of how long the bans will be in place. Canada is also shutting its borders to
foreign travelers who have recently been to South
Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and
Mozambique. Foreign citizens will be banned from Canada if they have
been to the seven nations in the past 14 days, Health
Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said. The US and Canada join the UK, EU and others in tightening
border controls over the Omicron variant. This video can not be played James Gallagher and Caroline Davies answer your questions on the new Covid variant. In case you missed it earlier, here's our health correspondent James Gallagher and transport correspondent Caroline Davies answering viewers' questions on the new variant and travel restrictions. The questions they look at included: Boris Johnson and Cyril Ramaphosa previously met at the G7 summit in Cornwall in June We've recently heard that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa this afternoon after the UK announced a travel ban on six nations in the region to limit the spread of the new Covid variant. A Downing Street spokesman said the two leaders ""discussed the challenges posed globally by the new Covid-19 variant and ways to work together to deal with it and reopen international travel"". He said Johnson praised South Africa's rapid genomic sequencing and ""leadership in transparently sharing scientific data"", with the pair agreeing to ""stay in close contact"" as they continue to deal with the pandemic. The United States has joined the European Union, UK and others in implementing travel restrictions on visitors from southern Africa after the discovery of a new Covid variant. A senior administration official said that the restrictions will apply to South
Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini,
Mozambique, and Malawi. The curbs were being âimplemented out of an
abundance of caution in light of a new Covid-19 variant
circulating in Southern Africaâ, the official said. Prof John Edmunds, a member of the UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) which advises the government, says the new variant, B.1.1.529, is a ""huge worry"" and could escape current Covid vaccines. ""The molecular data is extremely worrying...[it] would point to that perhaps this thing might be able to evade the immune response,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. Asked if the new variant could be resistant to current vaccines, Edmunds - an infectious diseases expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - confirms this is scientists' ""great fear"" but it is not yet known to what extent the variant might be able to do so. ""Our fears are it would do so to a large extent,"" he adds. Citing cases of the new variant in Belgium and Israel, Prof Edmunds warns the new variant will reach the UK and calls on the government to be prepared to take extra action for when it does. He says ministers will need to look at whether border restrictions need to be extended, and suggests mass Covid testing and localised measures should be considered alongside making the booster jabs rollout quicker. Explaining that a ""rapid rise"" in the new variant in South Africa had followed a ""huge wave"" of the Delta strain, he warns the UK is ""still fighting a Delta wave"" and does not want to be ""fighting both at the same time"" as it could create a ""very, very, very difficult situation"".

"UK put safety first over Covid variant - ShappsFears about the impact on vaccines mean travel from six African countries had to be restricted, he adds.","The new Covid variant circulating in South Africa that prompted UK travel restrictions is a ""huge international concern"", the health secretary says. Sajid Javid said experience has shown ""we must move quickly and at the earliest possible moment"". He said it might be more transmissible, vaccines might be less effective against it and it might affect one of the UK's major treatments, Ronapreve. No cases of the variant have yet been detected in the UK. Mr Javid told the House of Commons it was ""highly likely"" the B.1.1.529 variant had already spread from South Africa and Botswana, where confirmed cases have been found, to other countries. Travellers from these countries, as well as Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini, will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with those arriving after 04:00 GMT on Sunday required to quarantine in a hotel. All flights from the six countries are also being suspended until the hotel quarantine system is in operation. Other countries have also imposed travel restrictionson them, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called for air travel to the European Union from these countries, and others affected by the variant, to be suspended ""until we have a clear understanding about the danger posed by this new variant"". What do we know about this new variant? Borders shut as new coronavirus variant emerges South Africans fear impact of new variant measures Mr Javid said he was concerned the variant ""may pose substantial risk to public health"" as it has ""an unusually high number of mutations"". He said as well as possibly boosting transmission and affecting vaccine protection, the mutations may weaken the antibody treatment Ronapreve, which is beinggiven to the most vulnerable hospital patients. ""One of the lessons of this pandemic has been that we must move quickly, and at the earliest possible moment,"" he said. ""We're heading into winter and our booster programme is still ongoing, so we must act with caution."" South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana have identified just 59 cases of the variant, so far. Belgium announced on Friday afternoon it had Europe's first case of the variant, while Israeli media also reported one case involving a traveller. Scientists say the variant has 50 mutations overall and more than 30 on the spike protein, which is the target of most vaccines and the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at Oxford University, said: ""It's bad news, but it's not doomsday."" The variant would ""almost certainly"" make vaccines less effective, but they would still work to some extent. New drugs to treat Covid-19 would not be affected by the variant, he suggested. One scientist told me this was the worst variant they'd seen - look at it on paper and it's not hard to see why. It is the most heavily mutated variant so far and is now radically different to the form that emerged in Wuhan, China. That means vaccines, which were designed using the original, may not be as effective. And some of its mutations are known to increase the ability of coronaviruses to spread. But there have been many variants that looked bad on paper before, but haven't taken off. There are early signs this virus is spreading in South Africa and may already be in every province in the country. But the big questions - how much does it evade vaccines, is it more severe, does it spread faster that Delta - are unanswerable for now. Read more from James. It had not been proven the variant was more transmissible, but it has mutations consistent with the Delta variant and appeared to spread more quickly than other variants, Prof Naismith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The travel ban will slow it down,"" he said. ""It will get here but it will give us a few more weeks."" From midday non-UK and Irish residents will be banned from entering England if they have been in the six countries in the past 10 days. Any British or Irish resident arriving from the countries after 04:00 GMT on Sunday will have to quarantine in a hotel, with those returning before that being asked to isolate at home. The announcements prompteda slump in airline stocks, with the share price of British Airways' owner IAG dropping by 15%. Overall, London's main FTSE-100 share index closed down more than 3% and saw its biggest fall in points since the early days of the pandemic in March. This video can not be played Travellers at Cape Town airport respond to new UK quarantine measures over Covid variant At Cape Town airport, one woman whose sister had just made it on to a flight back to the UK said: ""It's absolutely ridiculous they've imposed it again so quickly without really investigating this new variant. ""We're just trying to get on our feet again with tourism and this will just kill it."" But another traveller was unconcerned. ""I love being back in Cape Town, so if I get stuck here - what a pleasure!"" Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, said the variant was the ""most worrying that we've seen"". Shares hit as new variant rattles investors What are the latest changes to UK travel rules? She said scientists needed to learn more about the variant before they could be certain but it appeared that ""there's mutations which increase infectivity, mutations that evade the immune response - both from vaccines and from natural immunity - and mutations that cause increased transmissibility"". She said South Africa had a very low rate of cases which more than doubled in two weeks. But she added the variant, which was first reported on 22 November, could be detected easily with genomic sequencing and it was ""reassuring"" it had not been seen in the UK yet. While there have been no cases of the new variant, there have been a further 50,091 Covid cases in the UK and another 160 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, thelatest government figures show,external. Nearly 400,000 boosters have been administered, meaning about 16.8 million people in the UK have had a third dose of a Covid vaccine - 29.2% of the population aged over 12. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it wasnot time to ""press the panic button""over the new variant, and said that there was no need to revisit the recent decision not to extend the nation's vaccine passport scheme. People who have returned to the UK from the six red list countries will be asked to take a PCR test to try to identify any cases. Severalother countries joined the UK in imposing travel restrictionson southern African nations, including Japan, Singapore and Israel. But a scientist leading efforts in South Africa to understand the new variant, Prof Tulio de Oliveira, said: ""The world should provide support to South Africa and Africa and not discriminate or isolate it."" He saidthe country needed scientific and financial helpto ensure the variant does not spread worldwide, including support for deprived people who could not otherwise endure a lockdown.

"Ambulances queue daily outside A&Es, study suggestsNHS guidance says that ambulance handovers should be completed within 15 minutes.","Ambulances transferring patients in the West Midlands earlier this year Ambulances are being forced to queue outside the majority of emergency departments before they can unload patients, a new survey suggests. Under NHS guidance, ambulance handovers should be completed within 15 minutes. But about two-thirds of A&Es polled by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) indicated they were struggling to meet the standard every day. The Department of Health said extra funding is being provided to boost staff numbers in key areas. RCEM president Dr Katherine Henderson said: ""We are facing a crisis in urgent care and a crisis of patient safety."" Lives at risk from long 999 waits, say paramedics Patient harm 'almost certain' with handover delays Patient had fatal heart attack in queuing ambulance The Royal College surveyed A&E departments across the UK between 8 and 14 November, receiving responses from 70 of about 230 units. During that week: 94% of clinical directors said that ambulances had been held outside their buildings at some point before patients could be taken into the hospital 61% said ambulances were being forced to queue every day About half of emergency departments said care had been provided to patients in non-medical areas such as corridors every day ""These results show the serious state that our urgent and emergency care system is in,"" said Dr Henderson. ""None of us want to have patients held in ambulances, treated in corridors, or waiting very long times to go up to a ward bed."" A separate RCEM report, published earlier this month, estimated that 4,519 patients had died after waiting more than 12 hours in emergency departments in England in 2020-2021. A spokesperson for England's Department of Health said: ""Ambulance Trusts have been given an extra Â£55m to boost staff numbers in control rooms and on the front line. ""This is on top of our record investment this year, including Â£5.4bn over the next six months to tackle the backlog, as well as Â£36bn for health and care over the next three years.""

UK put safety first over Covid variant - Shapps,"The new Covid variant circulating in South Africa that prompted UK travel restrictions is a ""huge international concern"", the health secretary says. Sajid Javid said experience has shown ""we must move quickly and at the earliest possible moment"". He said it might be more transmissible, vaccines might be less effective against it and it might affect one of the UK's major treatments, Ronapreve. No cases of the variant have yet been detected in the UK. Mr Javid told the House of Commons it was ""highly likely"" the B.1.1.529 variant had already spread from South Africa and Botswana, where confirmed cases have been found, to other countries. Travellers from these countries, as well as Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini, will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with those arriving after 04:00 GMT on Sunday required to quarantine in a hotel. All flights from the six countries are also being suspended until the hotel quarantine system is in operation. Other countries have also imposed travel restrictionson them, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called for air travel to the European Union from these countries, and others affected by the variant, to be suspended ""until we have a clear understanding about the danger posed by this new variant"". What do we know about this new variant? Borders shut as new coronavirus variant emerges South Africans fear impact of new variant measures Mr Javid said he was concerned the variant ""may pose substantial risk to public health"" as it has ""an unusually high number of mutations"". He said as well as possibly boosting transmission and affecting vaccine protection, the mutations may weaken the antibody treatment Ronapreve, which is beinggiven to the most vulnerable hospital patients. ""One of the lessons of this pandemic has been that we must move quickly, and at the earliest possible moment,"" he said. ""We're heading into winter and our booster programme is still ongoing, so we must act with caution."" South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana have identified just 59 cases of the variant, so far. Belgium announced on Friday afternoon it had Europe's first case of the variant, while Israeli media also reported one case involving a traveller. Scientists say the variant has 50 mutations overall and more than 30 on the spike protein, which is the target of most vaccines and the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at Oxford University, said: ""It's bad news, but it's not doomsday."" The variant would ""almost certainly"" make vaccines less effective, but they would still work to some extent. New drugs to treat Covid-19 would not be affected by the variant, he suggested. One scientist told me this was the worst variant they'd seen - look at it on paper and it's not hard to see why. It is the most heavily mutated variant so far and is now radically different to the form that emerged in Wuhan, China. That means vaccines, which were designed using the original, may not be as effective. And some of its mutations are known to increase the ability of coronaviruses to spread. But there have been many variants that looked bad on paper before, but haven't taken off. There are early signs this virus is spreading in South Africa and may already be in every province in the country. But the big questions - how much does it evade vaccines, is it more severe, does it spread faster that Delta - are unanswerable for now. Read more from James.

Red warning of 90mph winds during Storm Arwen,"This video can not be played Storm Arwen batters north east coast of Scotland About 80,000 homes in Scotland are without electricity as a result of the damage caused by Storm Arwen. The main areas affected are Aberdeenshire, Angus, Perthshire and the Moray coast. Police warned people not to travel ""under any circumstances"" in areas covered by a Met Office red warning following a 90mph wind forecast. The Met Office's highest storm level warning was in place until 02:00 on Saturday. Many parts of Scotland have suffered storm damage and travel disruption as a result of the high winds. Coastal areas of Angus, Fife, Aberdeenshire, Moray, East Lothian and the Scottish Borders, along with Aberdeen and Dundee have been the worst affected. A tree was blown over a road in Alford, Aberdeenshire Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said that as of 22:00 on Friday, 80,000 customers were off supply. The utility firm has managed to restore power to a further 25,000 homes affected by the storms but warned the weather was severely hampering its work. On Friday night, Mark Rough, director of customer operations at SSEN, said: ""Storm Arwen has brought some of the most severe and challenging weather we have experienced in recent years, resulting in significant disruption across the north of Scotland. ""Despite detailed preparations, the prolonged and severe nature of the weather front has hampered efforts to restore supplies, with the high winds expected to continue until the early hours of the morning. ""We therefore expect many customers to remain without power into tomorrow, particularly in the Aberdeenshire area."" Red wind warning issued for parts of UK Travel is disrupted as Storm Arwen strikes NI Train services across the country have been stopped because of the weather conditions. There has been a landslip as well as trees falling on to overhead power cables and railway lines, leaving people stranded on carriages and at railway stations. A barn was blown on to the line near Polmont. ScotRail urged passengers on its trains in the north east delayed by fallen trees to ""sit tight,external"". Network rail warned it ""may take some time"" for its staff to reach them. Supt Simon Bradshaw said: ""The high winds being experienced along the coastal areas of the north, east and southern parts of Scotland have led to red weather warnings coming into effect and as such, any motorist within these affected regions should not travel under any circumstances."" Following a meeting of the Scottish government's Resilience Room (SGoRR), First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in atweet,externalthat the ""conditions pose a potential risk to life"". Transport minister Graeme Dey said people should be prepared for possible travel disruption across Scotland. A Met Office amber warning for gales and a yellow alert for high winds and snow have also been issued for other parts of the country. Red warnings mean there could be danger to life, damage to property, travel and power disruption, and dangerous seas. The Met Office said: ""A spell of exceptionally strong northerly winds will affect eastern coastal districts of Scotland from later this afternoon moving south into south-east Scotland and north-east England this evening. ""Gusts of 80-90 mph are likely and these will generate some very large waves."" The strongest gusts have been recorded in Inverbervie at 78mph (125km/h). In Lossiemouth, the 74mph (119km/h) gusts are the highest recorded since 2015. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the red weather warning was ""rare"". ""People in these affected areas should not travel under any circumstances, including motorists,"" he said. ""Yellow and amber weather warnings also remain in place for a number of areas and people should continue to exercise extreme caution and plan any necessary journeys in advance as there is disruption to transport services.

Harry LowBBC London News  Six London Underground lines have been halted by the city's most widespread strike action since 2018. Friday's industrial action by the RMT union meant that only 60% of services were able to run, according to Transport for London (TfL). Three of the lines affected were suspended during various parts of the day with others unable to maintain the frequency of service expected, even with reduced numbers of post-lockdown commuters. This is the first in a series of walkouts with no indication that talks between TfL and the RMT are due to take place.  Queues for taxis are growing at two major railway stations as Friday's rush hour gets into full swing. At both King's Cross St Pancras and Euston, queues were seen snaking around as people sought to get to their destination ahead of the weekend.  Keith Prince, Conservative spokesman for the London Assembly's transport committee, has told BBC Radio London today's strike is ""almost suicidal on behalf of the unions"" given the parlous state of Transport for London's finances. He said: ""It's a mess that's of the mayor's own making but I think the Tube strikers are being very selfish. ""We're in the middle of a pandemic, we're trying to get London back on its feet.

it affected six and involved only RMT drivers. That means the impact isnât as
much as in some of the full-scale strikes we have seen previously. You can also factor in the lower levels of passengers anyway and the fact working from
home on a Friday seems to be the new norm for many. However, the strike took out
40% of services and the RMT union will regard that as a significant in getting
their message across. Seven more strikes are planned so youâd hope there will be
talks on Monday. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News The RMT Union's John Leach has been speaking to BBC London at one of its picket lines in Stratford, east London. He said: """"I hope TfL and the Mayor of London recognise why these fantastic
men and women, who kept London moving through the pandemic, have gone on strike. ""This

for London is only asking drivers to do four shifts a year on the Night Tube to
provide Londoners with a safe route home at night. Other trade unions have
already agreed to the change. ""The

"Girl, 12, killed during row with group of boys","Ava White died after being assaulted while out with friends A 12-year-old girl has been stabbed to death during an argument in a city centre. Ava White was with friends in Liverpool when she was assaulted at 20:40 GMT on Thursday, shortly after the city's Christmas lights switch-on. Merseyside Police said she suffered ""catastrophic injuries"" and a weapon was yet to be found. Four teenage boys, aged between 13 and 15 and from Toxteth, have been arrested on suspicion of her murder. Police said officers found Ava collapsed on the ground on Church Alley and a member of the public, who had witnessed the incident, was giving her first aid. Ava, who attended Notre Dame Catholic College in Everton, was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital with critical injuries but died a short time later. ""We know at the moment that Ava was with her friends in Liverpool city centre and there has been a verbal argument which has escalated to an assault on her involving a knife,"" Det Supt Sue Coombs said. ""We are able to say there has been a verbal argument and there has been an assault, and the offenders ran off up School Lane, across Hanover Street and into Fleet Street."" Assistant Chief Constable Ngaire Waine said police were not looking for anyone else in connection with Ava's death. ""It's very sad for the city but it is even sadder for her family, their lives are never going to be the same,"" she said. ""This is a very, very rare event, so I hope that will reassure people."" This video can not be played Assistant mayor of Liverpool, Sarah Doyle, said Ava's death was ""devastating"" Paying tribute to Ava, her head teacher Peter Duffy said the Year Eight pupil was a ""much loved, valued and unique member of the Notre Dame family"". ""She was an incredibly popular girl with a fantastic group of friends,"" he said. ""My staff are working with students to provide all the support they need at this traumatic time."" Rebecca Flynn, her head teacher at Trinity RC Primary School, said she was a ""popular and caring"" girl who was ""bright and respectful"". Peace campaigner Colin Parry, whose son Tim was killed in the Warrington bomb in 1993,tweeted that Ava,externalhad been given a peace ambassador award by his charity in 2019 and her death was a ""tragic loss"". Metro Mayor of Liverpool City Region, Steve Rotheram, said he was ""horrified"" by Ava's death. ""I am angry today for Ava and her family, for the parents across the region worrying about their children's safety and angry that such a heinous act should take place here,""he tweeted,external. Sarah Doyle, the assistant mayor of Liverpool, said she was ""heartbroken"" at the ""extremely devastating"" news. ""It's senseless and I know it will bring a lot of fear to communities across the city,"" she said. ""I just want to send a message of reassurance that our city is a safe place but I know this will be giving a lot of anxiety to people. We all share in [her family's] unimaginable grief."" Posting on Twitter,,externalDame Rachel de Souza, children's commissioner for England, said: ""This kind of violence involving a child and with such tragic consequences is shocking at any time, but when the victim is 12 it's particularly so."" Floral tributes to Ava have been left near the scene This video can not be played Det Supt Sue Coombs Mary Katilius, 65, from Limerick, said she had been nearby with her granddaughter when Ava was attacked. ""We heard screams and someone said to call an ambulance. We rushed over straight away but there was already a man helping her,"" she said. Det Supt Coombs said a lot of the witnesses were young and would be given special treatment when being interviewed. Floral tributes have been left near the scene, with one message saying: ""Rest in peace angel."" Lacey, 17, who came to lay flowers and a balloon, said her younger sister had been close friends with Ava. ""She was just a bubbly character, so loving and caring,"" she added. By Andy Gill, BBC North West Tonight reporter There is a massive police presence in Liverpool with several of the city's main shopping streets taped off. Dozens of police vehicles are parked close to the scene where 12-year-old Ava was fatally attacked. Many shoppers and tourists are having to ask officers how they can get to their destinations as many are unaware of the tragedy which lies behind the disruption to their usual routine. Ava died on what is called White Ribbon Day, a worldwide campaign to end violence against women and girls. Civic leaders came together yesterday to mark it and start 16 days of activity to highlight the issue. The death of a girl, not yet in her teens, throws the need for the campaign into the starkest relief. Forensic teams could be seen carrying out fingertip searches The four boys - a 13-year-old, two 14-year-olds and a 15-year-old - remain in custody for questioning. They were arrested at different locations during Thursday evening and into the early hours of Friday, police said. A police cordon was in place surrounding Williamson Square, Tarleton Street, Church Street, Church Alley and School Lane crossing over Hanover Street on to Fleet Street. Several shops on Church Street, one of the city's main shopping streets, remained closed on Black Friday due to the cordon.

France scraps UK talks over Johnson migrants letter,"Emmanuel Macron has reacted angrily to Boris Johnson's public call for France to take back migrants who reach the UK. The French president accused the UK prime minister of not being ""serious"" by making the call on Twitter, after the deaths of 27 people on Wednesday. The diplomatic row erupted after France withdrew a summit invitation to Home Secretary Priti Patel. The UK government urged it to reconsider, with the PM saying: ""This is a problem we have to fix together."" Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany and the European Commission are due to attend Sunday's talks in Calais, which Mr Macron set up to deal with the recent surge in migrant crossings of the Channel. The diplomatic spat comes as French fishermen are holding a day of action, including blockades, to disrupt cross-Channel traffic, in protest at post-Brexit fishing rights granted by the UK. Why Iraqi Kurds risk their lives to reach the West Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Scramble to identify dead in Channel tragedy The sinking of an inflatable boat on Wednesday marked the biggest loss of life by drowning in the Channel in many years, with 17 men, seven women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children dying. Ahead of Sunday's meeting, in a letter to Mr Macron on Thursday which was shared on Twitter, Mr Johnson set out five steps which he said could help avoid a repeat of the tragedy. These included joint patrols, better use of technology such as sensors and radar, maritime patrols in each other's waters and stronger cooperation by intelligence services. The letter also called for immediate work on a policy of returning migrants who reach the UK to France, alongside talks to establish a UK-EU returns agreement. French boats blocked the entrance to the port of St Malo in protest at post-Brexit fishing rules But the French government reacted furiously, withdrawing Ms Patel's invitation to the Calais meeting. At a press conference on Friday, Mr Macron attacked Mr Johnson over the posting of the letter on Twitter, saying: ""I spoke two days ago with Prime Minster Johnson in a serious way. ""For my part I continue to do that, as I do with all countries and all leaders. I am surprised by methods when they are not serious. ""We do not communicate from one leader to another on these issues by tweets and letters that we make public. We are not whistleblowers."" A French government spokesman accused Mr Johnson of saying different things in his conversation with Mr Macron and in the letter, adding: ""We are sick of double-speak."" The UK insists the prime minister's letter was sincere, meant to be constructive, not combative. But the French suspicion is that the letter was actually directed more at Mr Johnson's Conservative Party than Paris. The French believe Mr Johnson is in an uncomfortable position with his supporters now, having promised that Brexit would mean ""taking back control"" of UK waters and borders. The UK government insists the letter was sent in good faith. Paris says such a delicate matter as migration, especially between France and post-Brexit UK, should be handled with care, away from the media glare. Read Katya's blog in full But a Downing Street spokesman said: ""We have spoken about many of these ideas before. The public understandably want to know what we are doing to prevent this happening again. We want to work closely with France."" ""If you look at the tone of the letter, this is about deepening our co-operation,"" the spokesman added. This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps: ""I hope that the French will reconsider"" Home Office officials are still taking part in talks with their French counterparts in Paris on how to deal with the Channel crisis. Reports from Calais say the two survivors of Wednesday's sinking - one Iraqi and the other Somali - have been discharged from hospital and are due to be questioned about how many people were on the boat. For Labour, shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the prime minister of a ""grave error of judgement"" in sending the letter and of having ""completely lost control of the situation in the Channel"". But Conservative MP Tim Loughton, a member of the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, called France's decision not to invite Ms Patel to the Calais meeting ""incredible"", adding that Mr Johnson's letter had been ""perfectly reasonable"".

UK put safety first over Africa travel - Shapps,"The new Covid variant circulating in South Africa that prompted UK travel restrictions is a ""huge international concern"", the health secretary says. Sajid Javid said experience has shown ""we must move quickly and at the earliest possible moment"". He said it might be more transmissible, vaccines might be less effective against it and it might affect one of the UK's major treatments, Ronapreve. No cases of the variant have yet been detected in the UK. Mr Javid told the House of Commons it was ""highly likely"" the B.1.1.529 variant had already spread from South Africa and Botswana, where confirmed cases have been found, to other countries. Travellers from these countries, as well as Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini, will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with those arriving after 04:00 GMT on Sunday required to quarantine in a hotel. All flights from the six countries are also being suspended until the hotel quarantine system is in operation. Other countries have also imposed travel restrictionson them, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called for air travel to the European Union from these countries, and others affected by the variant, to be suspended ""until we have a clear understanding about the danger posed by this new variant"". What do we know about this new variant? Borders shut as new coronavirus variant emerges South Africans fear impact of new variant measures Mr Javid said he was concerned the variant ""may pose substantial risk to public health"" as it has ""an unusually high number of mutations"". He said as well as possibly boosting transmission and affecting vaccine protection, the mutations may weaken the antibody treatment Ronapreve, which is beinggiven to the most vulnerable hospital patients. ""One of the lessons of this pandemic has been that we must move quickly, and at the earliest possible moment,"" he said. ""We're heading into winter and our booster programme is still ongoing, so we must act with caution."" South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana have identified just 59 cases of the variant, so far. Belgium announced on Friday afternoon it had Europe's first case of the variant, while Israeli media also reported one case involving a traveller. Scientists say the variant has 50 mutations overall and more than 30 on the spike protein, which is the target of most vaccines and the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at Oxford University, said: ""It's bad news, but it's not doomsday."" The variant would ""almost certainly"" make vaccines less effective, but they would still work to some extent. New drugs to treat Covid-19 would not be affected by the variant, he suggested. One scientist told me this was the worst variant they'd seen - look at it on paper and it's not hard to see why. It is the most heavily mutated variant so far and is now radically different to the form that emerged in Wuhan, China. That means vaccines, which were designed using the original, may not be as effective. And some of its mutations are known to increase the ability of coronaviruses to spread. But there have been many variants that looked bad on paper before, but haven't taken off. There are early signs this virus is spreading in South Africa and may already be in every province in the country. But the big questions - how much does it evade vaccines, is it more severe, does it spread faster that Delta - are unanswerable for now. Read more from James. It had not been proven the variant was more transmissible, but it has mutations consistent with the Delta variant and appeared to spread more quickly than other variants, Prof Naismith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The travel ban will slow it down,"" he said. ""It will get here but it will give us a few more weeks."" From midday non-UK and Irish residents will be banned from entering England if they have been in the six countries in the past 10 days. Any British or Irish resident arriving from the countries after 04:00 GMT on Sunday will have to quarantine in a hotel, with those returning before that being asked to isolate at home. The announcements prompteda slump in airline stocks, with the share price of British Airways' owner IAG dropping by 15%. Overall, London's main FTSE-100 share index closed down more than 3% and saw its biggest fall in points since the early days of the pandemic in March. This video can not be played Travellers at Cape Town airport respond to new UK quarantine measures over Covid variant At Cape Town airport, one woman whose sister had just made it on to a flight back to the UK said: ""It's absolutely ridiculous they've imposed it again so quickly without really investigating this new variant. ""We're just trying to get on our feet again with tourism and this will just kill it."" But another traveller was unconcerned. ""I love being back in Cape Town, so if I get stuck here - what a pleasure!"" Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, said the variant was the ""most worrying that we've seen"". Shares hit as new variant rattles investors What are the latest changes to UK travel rules? She said scientists needed to learn more about the variant before they could be certain but it appeared that ""there's mutations which increase infectivity, mutations that evade the immune response - both from vaccines and from natural immunity - and mutations that cause increased transmissibility"". She said South Africa had a very low rate of cases which more than doubled in two weeks. But she added the variant, which was first reported on 22 November, could be detected easily with genomic sequencing and it was ""reassuring"" it had not been seen in the UK yet. While there have been no cases of the new variant, there have been a further 50,091 Covid cases in the UK and another 160 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, thelatest government figures show,external. Nearly 400,000 boosters have been administered, meaning about 16.8 million people in the UK have had a third dose of a Covid vaccine - 29.2% of the population aged over 12. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it wasnot time to ""press the panic button""over the new variant, and said that there was no need to revisit the recent decision not to extend the nation's vaccine passport scheme. People who have returned to the UK from the six red list countries will be asked to take a PCR test to try to identify any cases. Severalother countries joined the UK in imposing travel restrictionson southern African nations, including Japan, Singapore and Israel. But a scientist leading efforts in South Africa to understand the new variant, Prof Tulio de Oliveira, said: ""The world should provide support to South Africa and Africa and not discriminate or isolate it."" He saidthe country needed scientific and financial helpto ensure the variant does not spread worldwide, including support for deprived people who could not otherwise endure a lockdown.

"Ambulances queue daily outside A&Es, study suggestsNHS guidance says that ambulance handovers should be completed within 15 minutes.Health","Ambulances transferring patients in the West Midlands earlier this year Ambulances are being forced to queue outside the majority of emergency departments before they can unload patients, a new survey suggests. Under NHS guidance, ambulance handovers should be completed within 15 minutes. But about two-thirds of A&Es polled by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) indicated they were struggling to meet the standard every day. The Department of Health said extra funding is being provided to boost staff numbers in key areas. RCEM president Dr Katherine Henderson said: ""We are facing a crisis in urgent care and a crisis of patient safety."" Lives at risk from long 999 waits, say paramedics Patient harm 'almost certain' with handover delays Patient had fatal heart attack in queuing ambulance The Royal College surveyed A&E departments across the UK between 8 and 14 November, receiving responses from 70 of about 230 units. During that week: 94% of clinical directors said that ambulances had been held outside their buildings at some point before patients could be taken into the hospital 61% said ambulances were being forced to queue every day About half of emergency departments said care had been provided to patients in non-medical areas such as corridors every day ""These results show the serious state that our urgent and emergency care system is in,"" said Dr Henderson. ""None of us want to have patients held in ambulances, treated in corridors, or waiting very long times to go up to a ward bed."" A separate RCEM report, published earlier this month, estimated that 4,519 patients had died after waiting more than 12 hours in emergency departments in England in 2020-2021. A spokesperson for England's Department of Health said: ""Ambulance Trusts have been given an extra Â£55m to boost staff numbers in control rooms and on the front line. ""This is on top of our record investment this year, including Â£5.4bn over the next six months to tackle the backlog, as well as Â£36bn for health and care over the next three years.""

"Black Friday spending set to soar despite fewer dealsAnalysts say this year's sale will be the biggest ever, but retailers won't offer as many discounts.Business","Black Friday sales are on track to beat the bumper shopping bonanzas of the last two years, latest data suggests. Barclaycard, which processes about Â£1 in every Â£3 spent using cards, said by 17:00 GMT, there were 23% more transactions than that point in 2020. And the firm said there was a 2.4% rise in the volume of payments compared with the same period on Black Friday 2019. Analysts PwC predict Â£8.7bn will be spent on Friday, twice the amount spent last year, during lockdown. It is also higher than the Â£7.8bn spent before the pandemic in 2019. The increase comes despite warnings to expect less generous discounts and some shortages. Black Friday, which began in the US, sees retailers slash prices to entice shoppers ahead of the Christmas period. It is officially on Friday 26 November but retailers' campaigns span the whole month and started earlier than ever this year, with some in October. 'I don't need a new TV, but I'll probably get one' Warning over Black Friday price offers Tech retailers warn of low Black Friday stock Rob Cameron, chief executive of Barclaycard Payments, said Black Friday was off to a ""strong start"" despite the country's economic challenges. ""As we reach the end of the Black Friday, it is great to see that the trend we have been seeing throughout the day has continued, and retailers will be happy that today's trading figures have surpassed those secured in 2019. ""They will be hoping for this spending pattern to continue, not only in the last few hours of trading, and into Cyber Monday, but also in the run up to the festive season."" Metapack, a firm that connects major retailers with parcel delivery services, said data indicated that the biggest shipping days would take place on Monday and Tuesday, the same as last year. PwC predicts about 60% of adults in the UK will make purchases, spending an average of Â£280 each. Campaigners are blocking multiple entrances using bamboo structures, lock-ons, and banners But people are not only venturing out for shopping trips. On Friday, protestors gathered at Amazon buildings in the UK, US and Europe, with unions, equality and environmental groups sayingBlack Friday ""epitomises an obsession with over-consumption"". Meanwhile, Extinction Rebellion has targetedAmazon depots in the UK, blocking entrances and access roads. Linda Ellett, head of consumer markets at analysts KPMG, said deals were likely to be worse this year as retailers struggled with global supply issues linked to the pandemic, and shortages of HGV drivers and warehouse staff. Black Friday is the first big test for supply chains in the all important ""golden quarter"" for retailers. Shoppers have been buying early, worried they won't get the presents they want if they leave it until the last minute this year. Black Friday started as a one-day event but is now almost a month long blizzard of promotions. But expect fewer deals overall this time around amid all the problems over stock availability and labour shortages. Many retailers can ill afford to slash prices when their costs are soaring. Retailers also want to smooth out demand to try to reduce the pressure on distribution centres where goods are picked, packed and despatched over the big Black Friday weekend. A lot of businesses have been removing next day delivery options to help them cope. Some businesses, especially smaller independents, will shun this event altogether. It may have a lost a bit of its lustre, but Black Friday is still a massive shopping event. And it will probably be the most well organised retailers with scale and the biggest clout over suppliers who will cope the best. There are concerns some retailers will not be able to meet demand on the day, leading to long waits for orders to be processed and delivered. But analysts say most brands have spent months preparing for the sale and will have enough stock - although shoppers will not always get their first choice of product. John Lewis told the BBC: ""We've worked closely with our suppliers and we are confident we've got an extensive range of deals across a wide range of categories that represent great value for our customers."" AO World, which has hired 500 extra drivers ahead of the day, said: ""Like all electrical retailers, we are currently unable to get all the stock we need in categories like gaming to meet customer demand largely because of global microchip shortages. ""We are working closely with our partners so that our customers continue to get the exceptional service and range they rely on."" Metapack thinks most retailers will avoid a ""perfect storm"" but a few could be unlucky. ""We've already seen retailers reach out and suggest customers buy early for Christmas which should ease the pressure,"" said senior vice president Tom Forbes. This video can not be played ""It's harder to give those big headline discounts"" Some big brands such as M&S and Next have shunned Black Friday this year, with M&S again saying its focus was on ""offering great value throughout the whole season"". Many independent shops have also opted-out as they cannot afford to offer deep discounts in the vital Christmas shopping period. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, urged shoppers to support smaller local businesses who are ""pinning their hopes to a bumper festive season"" after last year's restrictions. He said: ""Rather than reaching for the same old brands - where deals might not be all they seem in any case - shop bespoke, receive one-to-one personal service and give some new restaurants, cafes and pubs a try."" Shoppers have also been warned to check whether offers are all they seem. An investigation by consumer rights group Which? found that 92% of Black Friday deals in 2020 were the same price or cheaper in the six months before the event. The Potions Cauldron gift shop in York is one of the independent retailers not taking part in Black Friday. Manager Phil Pinder thinks it's an American invention driven by retailers like Amazon who want to ""squeeze everyone else out"". ""I read a story saying that some of the electrical retailers are going to run out of stock by Christmas from doing Black Friday deals. ""I'm not playing that game... it seems illogical."" The shop, which sells magical themed drinks, sweets and gifts, has been doing well this year but it is struggling with product shortages due to supply chain issues. Phil says it is missing about Â£50,000 of stock it hoped to sell before Christmas which is ""a real headache"". His message to shoppers this festive season is buy early: ""If you want to get a specific present, go out and get it now. There are probably not going to be many of those last minute sales this Christmas because I don't think the retailers will have the stock.""

LiveLiveNew Covid variant is 'most significant' seen so far1 minute ago,"The World Health Organization designates the new highly mutated strain of Covid a ""variant of concern"" and gives it the Greek name Omicron Health Secretary Sajid Javid says there is ""huge international concern"" over the variant - but there are no UK cases The variant has been found in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong - and one case has been confirmed in Europe, in Belgium The US, UK, EU states and Switzerland halt travel to and from seven African nations Other countries including the UAE, Israel, Japan, Kenya and Singapore have also restricted travel The World Health Organization cautions against travel bans but has held a special meeting to discuss the variant A top UK health official calls it ""the most significant variant"" to date, while an Oxford scientist tells the BBC: ""It is bad news but it's not doomsday"" Edited by Alice Cuddy Dozens of countries have re-imposed travel bans We're closing our live page coverage for today. Here's a summary of the latest developments:  Today's live page was edited by Hamish Mackay, Rob Corp, Francesca Gillett, Alice Cuddy and Tom Spender and was written by Jack Hunter, Dulcie Lee, Mal Siret, Paul McLaren, Mary O'Connor, Adam Durbin, Matt Murphy and George Wright. Reality Check Vaccine supplies arriving earlier this year in DR Congo There have been repeated calls for wealthier
countries who have fully vaccinated a significant proportion of their
populations to share doses with others who havenât. A WHO target for 10% of the worldâs population to be fully
vaccinated by the end of September was missed by dozens of countries,many of them in Africa. The average for Africa is currently around 7% fully
vaccinated, with some countries as low as just 3%. There are some countries elsewhere in the world with very low
vaccination rates - often in conflict zones - like Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and
Myanmar. But Asia, Europe and the Americas have on average already
gone past 40% of their populations fully vaccinated, which is the WHO target for the end of this
year. It's no surprise that a new variant has emerged given the unequal distribution of vaccines to poorer countries, the co-chair of the African Union's Vaccine Delivery Alliance for Covid has told the BBC. But Dr Ayoade Ala-kija expressed doubt that there would now be a change of policy. ""The lack of political will and the failure to vaccinate the world was going to result in variants emerging. I think my surprise is that there are more variants out there not just in Africa but all over the world,"" she said. She said South Africa deserved praise for detecting the mutation but the Omicron variant might not have originated there and could already be spreading around the world. Travel bans affecting southern African nations were ""shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted"", she said. ""So will it mean that people will suddenly discover their sense of morality and and begin to distribute vaccines more equitably across the African continent? I'm not holding my breath."" Dr Ala-kija pointed out that the likes of the UK, Israel and the EU haven't placed travel bans on Belgium, despite it reporting a case of the new variant. Anti-vaccination protesters demonstrated in The Hague A rise in Covid cases - unrelated to the new Omicron variant - has prompted fresh restrictions in the Netherlands. From Sunday all hospitality venues must close from 17:00 to 05:00 local time, though some essential business such as supermarkets may remain open until 20.00. Amateur sports will also cease at 17.00. Schools will remain open, but students in secondary schools will have to wear masks. ""From Sunday, the whole of the Netherlands is effectively closed between 5pm and 5am,"" PM Mark Rutte told reporters during a press conference. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said the tougher restrictions were necessary to prevent the country's health system being overwhelmed. A small group anti-vaccination protesters gathered near parliament in The Hague, but they were outnumbered by riot police who kept watch. Emergency orders have been issued for the centre of The Hague and several other Dutch towns and cities to avoid a repeat of last weekend's riots. The head of the lab that first sequenced the new Covid variant Omicron has told the BBC that the strain has mutations not seen before. Professor Anne von Gottberg of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg said that most strains of the virus have about five to 10 spike mutations, but the Omicron has around 25 to 32. ""So it really was immediately noticeable that something unusual had happened,"" she said. ""There are a lot of mutations that are new and that we haven't seen before,"" she said. She said it was as yet unclear what can be determined from the multiple mutations. But she said it was precisely because they couldn't fully understand its characteristics that merited further study and a cautious approach to the new strain. As we've been reporting, a number ofcountries are tightening their travel restrictions after a new coronavirus variantwas identified in southern Africa earlier this week. Here are some of the major restrictions that have been announced so far: The United Statesis banning on South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi. US citizens and lawful permanent residents will be exempt from the restrictions, but will still need to test negative before flying. Canadais shutting its borders to all foreign travellers who have been to South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Mozambique in the past 14 days. EU nationswill impose an emergency flight ban on countries in southern Africa, after Europe's first case of the variant was discovered in Belgium. The ban will be applied to travellers from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, EU Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer said. Switzerlandwill require a 10-day quarantine period and a negative Covid test for travellers from Belgium,
Israel and Hong Kong, as well imposing travel bans on southern
African countries, Reuters news agency reports. TheUKhas temporarily halted flights from six southern African countries: South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Eswatini and Lesotho Singapore, Italy, FranceandIsraelhave also placedMozambiqueon their red lists. A number of North African and Middle-Eastern nations includingBahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt and Moroccohave introduced varying bans on travellers from the eight countries. Japanhas announced that from Saturday, travellers from much of southern Africa will need to quarantine for 10 days and take four tests during that time. Indiahas ordered more rigorous screening and testing for travellers arriving from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong, local media is reporting. AndIranwill ban travellers from six southern African countries, including South Africa. Iranians arriving from the region will be admitted after testing negative twice, state TV said. The World Health Organization has designated the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 as being ""of concern"", following its discovery by South African scientists. But what do we know about it so far? Broadly speaking there are thousands of different types, or variants, of Covid circulating around the world. Which is to be expected because viruses mutate constantly. But what has experts particularly worried with this strain of the virus, which is also known as B.1.1.529, is that it has mutated heavily and is very different to the original coronavirus strain which emerged in China, which current vaccines were designed to fight. There are 50 genetic changes in total and of these, 32 are in the spike protein of the virus - the part which is the target of vaccines. However, it is too soon to know how much of a omicron threat poses to vaccine efficacy and it will take several weeks before we have enough data to know for sure, experts have said. Read more about what we know about omicronhere. This video can not be played WHO name Omicron 'variant of concern' Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead, has been telling the BBC about the body's decision to label Omicron a variant of concern. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has postponed its first ministerial meeting in four years due to the new Omicron Covid-19 variant. Ministers from more than 160 WTO members were due to meet next
week in the Swiss city of Geneva for an event seen as a test of the body's relevance. WTO members reportedly took the decision at an urgent meeting held tonight. The European Centre for Disease Control (CDC) says that it has classified the new Omnicron coronavirus variant as being ""of concern"". Officials say that the level of risk associated with the variant is ""very high"" and that it is extremely likely that the variant will spread across the EU. The agency added that it feared the profile of the variant may mean that the effectiveness of vaccines could be reduced and that natural immunity may be decreased. Former UK PM Gordon Brown has been speaking to BBC Newsnight about pandemic and the emergence of new variants. He says, as he has done previously, that the UK government must do more to vaccinate poorer nations around the world. This video can not be played The pharmaceuticals manufacturer Novavax has begun work on a new version of its Covid-19 vaccine, aimed at targeting the Omicron variant. It says it hopes the vaccine will be ready for testing and manufacturing within a matter of weeks. Other vaccine companies have also been cautiously optimistic about their ability to counter any potential new challenges posed by the variant. BioNTech says it could produce and ship an updated version of its vaccine within 100 days if the new Covid variant detected in southern Africa is found to evade existing immunity. And AstraZeneca says it is already conducting research in Botswana and Eswatini, where the variant has been identified, to collect real-world data on how its shot performs against the new variant. Moderna has also said it will develop a booster shot for the new variant. People read information at a Covid-19 testing centre at the International Airport in Duesseldorf Here's a round-up of the latest developments if you're just joining us: Omicron is not the first ""variant of concern"" to have emerged during the pandemic. There are many different types of Covid-19 circulating around the world, which is to be expected because viruses mutate regularly. The most potentially dangerous ones are given the ""variants of concern,external"" classification and are kept under close observation. These include:  For more on the key Covid variantsclick here. US President Joe Biden has called on countries meeting at the World Trade Organization
next week to agree to waive intellectual property protections
for Covid vaccines in the wake of the new variant's discovery. He has reissued a calloriginally made in Mayby the US government for a temporary lift on patent protections This could allow vaccines to be manufactured faster and in more places around the world, as production would not be restricted by the patent rights owned by the pharmaceutical companies who developed them. However, manufacturers say it will not have the desired effect and critics argue it strips financial rewards and incentives from cutting-edge developers. The president also said other nations need to ramp up their vaccine donations to ""match Americaâs speed and generosity"". ""The news about this new variant should make clearer than
ever why this pandemic will not end until we have global
vaccinations,""he said in a statement,external. More now on the United States announcing travel restrictions on southern Africa. The travel ban will start on Monday, and include South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi, officials told reporters. The restrictions will not apply to US citizens and lawful permanent residents, but they will still need to test negative for coronavirus prior to travelling. Officials say the policy is being implemented ""out of an abundance of caution"". There was no indication of how long the bans will be in place. Canada is also shutting its borders to
foreign travelers who have recently been to South
Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and
Mozambique. Foreign citizens will be banned from Canada if they have
been to the seven nations in the past 14 days, Health
Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said. The US and Canada join the UK, EU and others in tightening
border controls over the Omicron variant. This video can not be played James Gallagher and Caroline Davies answer your questions on the new Covid variant. In case you missed it earlier, here's our health correspondent James Gallagher and transport correspondent Caroline Davies answering viewers' questions on the new variant and travel restrictions. The questions they look at included: Boris Johnson and Cyril Ramaphosa previously met at the G7 summit in Cornwall in June We've recently heard that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa this afternoon after the UK announced a travel ban on six nations in the region to limit the spread of the new Covid variant. A Downing Street spokesman said the two leaders ""discussed the challenges posed globally by the new Covid-19 variant and ways to work together to deal with it and reopen international travel"". He said Johnson praised South Africa's rapid genomic sequencing and ""leadership in transparently sharing scientific data"", with the pair agreeing to ""stay in close contact"" as they continue to deal with the pandemic. The United States has joined the European Union, UK and others in implementing travel restrictions on visitors from southern Africa after the discovery of a new Covid variant. A senior administration official said that the restrictions will apply to South
Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini,
Mozambique, and Malawi. The curbs were being âimplemented out of an
abundance of caution in light of a new Covid-19 variant
circulating in Southern Africaâ, the official said. Prof John Edmunds, a member of the UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) which advises the government, says the new variant, B.1.1.529, is a ""huge worry"" and could escape current Covid vaccines. ""The molecular data is extremely worrying...[it] would point to that perhaps this thing might be able to evade the immune response,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. Asked if the new variant could be resistant to current vaccines, Edmunds - an infectious diseases expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - confirms this is scientists' ""great fear"" but it is not yet known to what extent the variant might be able to do so. ""Our fears are it would do so to a large extent,"" he adds. Citing cases of the new variant in Belgium and Israel, Prof Edmunds warns the new variant will reach the UK and calls on the government to be prepared to take extra action for when it does. He says ministers will need to look at whether border restrictions need to be extended, and suggests mass Covid testing and localised measures should be considered alongside making the booster jabs rollout quicker. Explaining that a ""rapid rise"" in the new variant in South Africa had followed a ""huge wave"" of the Delta strain, he warns the UK is ""still fighting a Delta wave"" and does not want to be ""fighting both at the same time"" as it could create a ""very, very, very difficult situation"".
