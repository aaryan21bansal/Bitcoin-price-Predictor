Dutch police break up anti-lockdown protest,"This video can not be played Protesters used umbrellas to shield themselves from water cannon Police in the Netherlands have used water cannon to clear anti-government demonstrators from a park in The Hague. Some 2,000 demonstrators rallied in the centre of the city to protest against Covid-19 restrictions and other government policies. Mounted officers as well as riot police with batons and dogs moved in after some of the protesters refused to leave at the end of the demonstration. The protests come a day before voting begins in a general election. The vote is taking place over three days to avoid congestion that would risk spreading coronavirus at polling stations. How are European countries tackling the pandemic? What Europeans have learned from a year of Covid The authorities had set a limit of 200 people for the protest at the Malieveld area near the city's central station and not far the Dutch parliament, but police said that number had been exceeded. Train services to the city were halted for a while to prevent more people from joining the demonstration. Police have arrested several people, according to local media. Protesters are opposed to the government's anti-Covid measures One video, widely shared on social media, appeared to show officers hitting a man on the ground with their truncheons. Police said he had attacked them with a stick, says the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague. Dutch police later said a warning shot had been fired as officers cleared away the demonstrators. A statement said the incident was being investigated. ""There might be a virus, but the shutdown of the total society is not proportional,"" protester Michel Koot, 68, told the AFP news agency. ""I see that a lot of our rights are easily taken away and the majority of the people don't even notice, but there's a lot going on. So I'm concerned for my grandchildren."" A night-time curfew - from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) to 04:30 - imposed in January led to rioting in several Dutch cities. The Netherlands had not seen a curfew since the Nazi occupation in World War Two. It is expected to remain in place till the end of March. Bars and restaurants remain closed, along with non-essential shops. Gatherings of more than two people are banned. The Netherlands has had more than 1.1 million confirmed Covid cases since the start of the outbreak, with more than 16,000 deaths, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University in the US.

"Early Grammys go to BeyoncÃ©, Gaga and Billie Eilish","Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Billie Eilish were among the early winners BeyoncÃ© has picked up her 25th and 26th Grammy Awards, as ""music's biggest night"" kicks off in Los Angeles. The star won best music video for Brown Skin Girl and best rap performance for her duet with Megan Thee Stallion, Savage (Remix). Billie Eilish, who dominated last year's awards, also won a prize for her Bond theme, No Time To Die. Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande's Rain On Me became the first female duet to win best the best pop duo category. The stars beat Korean pop group BTS in to the prize. The seven-piece boyband had hoped to be the first K-Pop act to win a Grammy with their hit single, Dynamite. Grammys 2021: In pictures Harry Styles and Billie Eilish kick off the Grammys Grammys 2021: Seven things to look out for Grammys 2021: BeyoncÃ© and Dua Lipa lead nominations Grammy Awards 2021: Winners and nominees The awards were announced online ahead of the main Grammys ceremony on Sunday night, which is expected to be a hybrid of live and pre-taped performances. Host Trevor Noah said the show would be different to the usual event, where music's biggest stars congregate at Los Angeles' Staples Center, but promised a night of spectacular entertainment. ""They have figured out how to make an awards show for the time as opposed to trying to crowbar an awards show into it,"" he said last week. ""It's not Zoom, it's not pandemic-y... The bands are sort of going to be performing for each other."" BeyoncÃ© had the most nominations going into the ceremony - with nine in total. If she wins two more, she will overtake bluegrass singer Alison Krauss as the most-awarded woman in Grammy history. Beyonce's Grammy success added to an already record-breaking career Taylor Swift and Dua Lipa both have six nominations each, alongside rapper Roddy Ricch. British star Harry Styles will open the ceremony, with other performances due from BTS, Taylor Swift, Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion and Chris Martin of Coldplay. The early pre-ceremony raced through dozens of genre categories - from world music to rap and bluegrass - as well as some of the more esoteric awards, like best packaging (which went to rock supergroup The Desert Sessions for their album Vols 11 & 12). Megan Thee Stallion's win in the best rap category could make her a strong contender for song of the year Kanye West took the Grammy for his gospel album Jesus is King, while John Prine won two posthumous awards for his song I Love Life. The star, who died last April of Covid-19, was honoured with best American roots performance and American roots song. Nigerian stars Burna Boy and Wizkid win Grammys Bruce Springsteen leads tributes to John Prine The Grammy nominee making music in his childhood bedroom London-born musician Jacob Collier made Grammy history by becoming the first British artist ever to win a prize for each of his first four albums. The 26-year-old, who is also up for album of the year at the main ceremony, won the best arrangement for his track He Won't Hold You. Nigeria's Burna Boy won the best global music album for Twice As Tall album; while his fellow countryman Wizkid shared the award for best music video with Beyonce and her daughter Blue Ivy. In the rock categories, The Strokes picked up best album for The New Abnormal; and Fiona Apple's Fetch The Bolt Cutters took home best alternative album. The award show is taking place against the backdrop of controversy surrounding its voting procedures. Canadian superstar The Weeknd said he will boycott the awards in future due to what he described as the ""secret committees"" that vote for the winners. He was a surprise snub at this year's ceremony despite having one of 2020's biggest-selling albums. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

BA plans app-based Covid travel pass,"British Airways is planning to make it easier for passengers to prove they are safe to travel once they have been vaccinated against Covid. Under the plans, people who have had both jabs will be able to register their status on BA's smartphone app. The airline's chief executive, Sean Doyle, hailed the UK's ""great progress"" in tackling the pandemic. Last month, BA ownerIAG called for digital health passes""to reopen our skies safely"". IAG's boss, Luis Gallego, said at the time that the airline group wanted international common testing standards for travel. The UK government has said it will give the go-ahead for a return to international travel on 17 May at the earliest. The announcement prompted a flood of bookings, but it remains unclear which routes will be available. BA's move comes amid heated debate about the possibility that ""vaccine passports"" could become a feature of foreign travel and even be used within the UK to allow entry to places such as pubs or sports stadiums. Will I need a vaccine passport? In his latest comments to journalists, BA's Mr Doyle said the UK should be a global leader in reopening international travel. He urged the government to ""set an example"" and ""be ambitious"" in developing systems, including the use of digital technology to verify the vaccination and test status of passengers. ""We're making great progress in Britain in dealing with the pandemic,"" he said, pointing to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the success of the UK's vaccination programme. ""It's fair to say that Britain has developed a really strong leadership position in coming out the other end of the pandemic,"" he said. ""What we want to make sure is that we also take that leadership position into restoring travel and restoring the economy."" In another incentive for passengers, BA said it had already reintroduced free water and snacks on short-haul economy flights and that this policy would continue. In another development, rival airline Virgin Atlantic has said it is close to finalising a Â£160m financing package to tide it over until travel restrictions are lifted. The money is coming from loans made by existing shareholders, including the Virgin Group and US airline Delta. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: ""We continue to bolster our balance sheet in anticipation of the lifting of international travel restrictions during the second quarter of 2021. ""This latest Â£160m financing provides further resilience against a slower revenue recovery in 2021 and follows a $230m financing on two Boeing 787s in January, which allowed us to pay down debt and strengthen our cash position. ""We remain confident that Virgin Atlantic will emerge a sustainably profitable airline and would like to thank our creditors and shareholders, Virgin Group and Delta, for their ongoing support and unwavering belief in our future.""

"Call for all homes to be minutes from green spaceOne in eight households did not have access to a garden, yard or balcony in lockdown, figures show.Wales","The grounds of Cardiff Castle were opened for socially distanced picnics last summer Cities, towns and villages must be redesigned to improve access to nature in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, campaigners have said. The future generations commissioner wants everyone to have a public green space within four minute's walk. During the first lockdown one in eight households in Wales did not have access to a garden, yard or balcony, official statistics show. The Welsh government has committed Â£110m to transforming towns in Wales. Planning experts and designers said the pandemic was a ""profound opportunity"" to rethink communities to tackle climate change and health issues. Ideas include planting trees, more cycle routes, reopening disused railway lines, creating ""pocket"" parks, and a campaign to create neighbourhoods where everything needed is within a 20-minute walk. Sophie Howe said access to green spaces should be a right for everyone Future generations commissioner Sophie Howe said public green spaces had been a ""lifeline"" for many during lockdowns and were vital for physical and mental health. Ms Howe wants to see changes to towns, cities and villages, to make sure no-one in Wales lives more than four minutes' walk - about 330yds or 300m - from a public green space. She said people who did not have a garden were reliant on being able to access open public spaces - but many had struggled to do that due to travel restrictions. ""It shouldn't be based on where you live, and the price of your house, it should be a right for everyone,"" said Ms Howe. The Welsh Government said its local places nature fund had created more than 400 wildlife gardens in and around residential areas in the past year. Some people set up ""fairy homes"" in woods during the first lockdown It is almost a year since Wales was first placed under lockdown, with people only allowed to leave home for essential reasons, including to exercise. While about a fifth of Wales is covered by national parks, the mountains and coastlines have been off-limits during lockdowns to all but those who live on their doorsteps. How much of the country do parks, fields and public gardens make up (not including National Parks)? 10,000 areasof accessible public green spaces, such as parks, fields and gardens Less than 1%of Wales is made up of publically accessible green space 432.22 metresaverage distance people live from a public park or garden 3.61public green spaces on average in a 1,000m radius of homes At the start of the first lockdown, official figures showed 133,542 Welsh households did not have access to a private outdoor space. This is the equivalent of 9% of households in Wales,according to Office for National Statistics figures,external. The data also shows at least 36% of those living in flats in Wales did not have access to a private space, a higher rate than in England or Scotland. More than 17,000 people on the shielding list, who were told not to leave their homes, had noaccess to any outdoor space,external. This video can not be played ""How do we make Swansea better?"" Some councils are investing more in improving green spaces, while others have reported conflict as more people use footpaths. In Cardiff, the council is planning to spend around Â£2m improving green spaces, parks and pavements in 2021-22. While in Rhondda Cynon Taf, the council said a significant increase in people using footpaths had led to a number of landowners ""taking matters into their own hands"" and closing paths. Â£38m announced for cycling and walking routes Meanwhile in Swansea, the council and Natural Resources Wales are ploughing ahead with plans to double the city's green space, including building the first park in the city since Victorian times. This video can not be played Cardiffâs Castle Street was turned into an al fresco dining area last summer In many towns and cities, Covid forced adaptations, with one-way systems in high streets and more space for outside seating. While some of the measures were divisive - limiting parking and delivery spaces or shutting major roads - there were other calls to make them permanent. Not-for-profit group For Cardiff, which represents more than 700 businesses, said with more people set to work from home in the long term, changes had to be made to draw people into the city. Adrian Field, executive director, said having more outdoor seating had allowed many businesses to survive and the group was looking at whether a new public space could be opened. ""It might have entertainment... PE equipment or a big screen to watch films or sporting events... there is an eagerness for that space to be used,"" he said. ""I think all towns and cities need to create environments where people can linger, interact, exercise... hopefully that includes pocket parks, if we can get more tables and chairs outside I think there will be a lot of demand long term."" Charity Sustrans said despite efforts, no area in Wales had been designated an official 20-minute neighbourhood in Wales - where every facility is within a 10-minute bike ride or walk of their home. This video can not be played Could changes we have been forced to make in the pandemic become long-term environmental solutions? One major issue planners have been looking at is how to connect rural communities which may have been cut off from neighbours in lockdown. Sarah Featherstone, of consultants VeloCity, hopes villages can be linked up using footpaths and cycle routes to create ""villages in a garden"". ""We call it the big back garden,"" said the Brecon-based architect. She said while there was a housing crisis, sprawling development meant many were now having to get in their cars to get to the middle of their village to access shops. Her vision is for the area to be used for people to grow food and for community gardens, while villages would pool together to address issues like poorly maintained pavements, pot holes and reducing speed limits. Parks have seen increased numbers of walkers, cyclists and runners ""All of the traffic has been pushed to the edges, so that you have this much safer, greener landscape between the villages that can be safeguarded and used for leisure,"" she said. Ms Featherstone said changing planning laws and addressing infrastructure could allow more people to move out of flats in cities to live and work in rural communities. ""There's a potential for a fresh look at things, but we need to keep that momentum going, otherwise we could easily slip back into jumping back in cars again,"" she said. The Welsh government said more than Â£50m had been allocated for permanent and temporary improvements to walking and cycling routes routes ""to allow people to safely and conveniently travel"" to local destinations, including outdoor spaces. The tight-knit design of valleys communities was partly blamed by some on high case rates in the area Last year a spike in Covid cases in valleys communities was partly blamed by some on the design of the areas, with tightly packed lines of terraced houses. In Merthyr Tydfil - which in November had the highest Covid case rate in the UK - the council kept parks open during the firebreak lockdown,as the Brecon Beacons national park was just out of reach for many. There are also thoughts on how south Wales valley communities could be reimagined and opened up with more access to green spaces. Matthew Jones said the recovery post-Covid was an opportunity to ""profoundly change"" towns, as more people worked from home and had developed an appreciation for local shops, paths and parks. ""There's a potential to really rethink what we do with public spaces... how streets connect together, how people can move safely around where they live,"" he said. Dr Jones, who has looked at the future of towns for the Design Commission for Wales, said homes and workspaces could be redesigned to include garden elements. Planners believe more buildings with green spaces built in could appear, like these plans in Swansea In Swansea, plans have been approved for a ""living"" building, with rooftop gardens and allotments, and Dr Jones said ideas like this could help towards a bid for Wales to have carbon neutral emissions by 2050. He said it would be interesting to see which communities chose to keep temporary measures - such as shutting roads and widening pavements - to create more room for walking and cycling once the pandemic ended. The Welsh government said it was already delivering green infrastructure schemes worth Â£9m to make town centres ""greener, more attractive and safer"". It has also launched a national forest programme to create a ""connected woodland extending the length of Wales"". In the first year of the programme, projects included more than 20 small woodlands created by and for schoolchildren. Covid jobs: how can Wales have a 'green recovery'?

Scotland hospitality urges lockdown levels rethink,"Hospitality leaders have urged the Scottish government to change its Covid lockdown levels to stop businesses failing. An industry group has submitted its own version of the system to ministers. The document, seen by the BBC, urges ministers to mirror the plans for England - extending opening times and naming dates. The Scottish government said lockdown exit will be driven by data, not dates. Five of Scotland's main hospitality trade bodies said if changes are implemented, 60,000 jobs in the sector could be saved. Tighter rules will be used to decide Covid levels Relaxation of Scotland's rules on outdoor meeting Analysis was commissioned by the Scottish Hospitality Group, UK Hospitality Scotland, Scottish Licensed Trade Association, Night Time Industries Association and the Scottish Beer and Pub Association. They said that under current level three restrictions almost half of hospitality businesses could operate. But if changes are made, this increases to almost three quarters. Under theprevious level three rules,external, alcohol was not allowed to be served. But the industry is lobbying for it to be sold outdoors, or indoors with a meal. On closing times, the last entry was 17:00 with venues were to close by 18:00. The industry would like to see two-hour time slots for indoor customers, with closing time at 22:30. Outdoors it wants a 23:30 close. It claims this could contribute more than Â£1.2bn to the economy in the short term. Michael Grieve, chairman of Night Time Industries Association Scotland and owner of Glasgow's Sub Club,told BBC's The Sunday Showthat indicative dates would be vitally important to businesses like his. He said: ""What we're asking for is that all restrictions are removed at level zero and things return to normal. ""We think it's imperative that there's a date put against that as a best case scenario as a date to work towards. ""But we need to have some kind of framework there because at the moment we're completely running blind here - we have no idea when we'll be able to operate."" The Scottish government has said that the previous levels system will be updated to account for changes in the situation - for example, the new variant of coronavirus and the rollout of the vaccination programme. Mike Grieve has sad it is difficult to see a future for clubs until coronavirus is eliminated Michael Grieve added: ""The positive impact of adopting our proposed plan are huge for relatively minor tweaks. ""We're not going to achieve zero Covid. We need to accept that Covid is in society. ""So, with vaccination being rolled out... we see no reason why in parallel indicative dates can't be put in place to give the industry some hope that we can reopen and that life can start to return to some kind of normal."" The Scottish government said it understood the desire for certainty for all sectors of the economy. It said in a statement: ""We need to be driven by data not dates, and we are regrettably not able to provide fixed dates as to when nightclubs and theatres which involve large audiences and customers in enclosed spaces can reopen. ""We will continue to listen to the needs of the sector and do everything within our powers to support them through this on-going crisis."" It said work was underway to develop a route-map towards an incremental and cautious re-opening of live events and performances. The Scottish government said more than Â£140m of additional Covid funding to support culture and heritage in Scotland had been allocated, with more than Â£3bn in support for business since the start of the pandemic.

"The art dealer, the Â£10m bronze and the Holocaust","This Benin Bronze sold to a private collector for a record fee of Â£10m Countless historic artefacts were looted from around the world during the colonial era and taken to Europe but there is now a growing campaign to return them. Among the most famous are the Benin Bronzes seized from modern-day Nigeria. Barnaby Phillips finds out about one family's dilemma. One morning in April 2016, a woman walked into Barclays Bank on London's exclusive Park Lane, to retrieve a mysterious object that had been locked in the vaults for 63 years. Attendants ushered her downstairs. Three men waited upstairs, perched anxiously on an uncomfortable sofa, watching customers go about their business. Twenty minutes later the woman appeared, carrying something covered in an old dishcloth. She unwrapped it, and everyone gasped. A youthful face cast in bronze or brass stared out at them. He had a beaded collar around his neck and a gourd on his head. The men, an art dealer called Lance Entwistle and two experts from the auctioneers Woolley and Wallis, recognised it as an early Benin Bronze head, perhaps depicting an oba, or king, from the 16th Century. It was in near-immaculate condition, with the dark grey patina of old bronze, much like a contemporary piece from the Italian Renaissance. They suspected it was worth millions of pounds. The bank staff quickly led them into a panelled room, where they placed the head on a table. The woman who went down into the vaults is a daughter of an art dealer called Ernest Ohly, who died in 2008. I have chosen to call her Frieda and not reveal her married name to protect her privacy. Ernest's father, William Ohly, who was Jewish, fled Nazi Germany and was prominent in London's mid-century art scene. William Ohly's exhibitions in the late 1940s attracted aesthetes and celebrities William Ohly lived ""at the nexus of culture, society and artists"", says Entwistle. His ""Primitive Art"" exhibitions attracted collectors, socialites, and artists such as Jacob Epstein, Lucian Freud, Henry Moore, Francis Bacon, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. He died in 1955. Ernest Ohly inherited his love of art, but was a more reserved character. ""A very, very difficult man to know. He didn't let anything out. You did not know what he was thinking,"" said Entwistle. Ernest Ohly's death provoked a ripple of excitement at the lucrative top end of the ethnographic art world. He was rumoured to have an extensive collection. His statues from Polynesia and masks from West Africa were auctioned in 2011 and 2013. And that, dealers assumed, was that. But his children knew otherwise. In old age, he had told them he had one more sculpture. It was in a Barclays safe box and not to be sold, he specified, unless there was another Holocaust. In 2016 matters were taken out of the children's hands. Barclays on Park Lane was closing its safe boxes; it told customers to collect their belongings. I met Lance Entwistle in 2019, in his library lined with books on African sculpture. His website said his company has been ""leading tribal art dealers for over 40 years"". ""Tribal art"" is a term that Western museums now avoid, but is still common in the world of auctions and private sales. Entwistle has rarely been to Africa, and never to Nigeria, but he's well connected. The British Museum, the MusÃ©e du Quai Branly in Paris and the Metropolitan in New York have all bought pieces from him. I asked him how he had felt when Frieda pulled the cloth away from the Benin Bronze head in the bank. ""I was bowled over,"" he said. ""It was beautiful, moving, and its emergence from obscurity was so exciting. I'm very used to being told about a Benin head, a Benin plaque, a Benin horse and rider. Generally I'm not excited because 99 times out of 100 they're fake, and often the remaining 1% has been stolen."" Provenance is everything in Entwistle's world. This time, thanks to the Ernest Ohly connection, he was confident he was dealing with a bona fide piece. He told Frieda the Benin Bronze head was significant and unusual, and convinced her to take it home in a taxi, to her terraced house in Tooting, south London. The Benin Bronzes were brought to Europe in the spring of 1897, the loot of British soldiers and sailors who conquered the West African kingdom of Benin, in modern day Nigeria's Edo state. Although they are called Benin Bronzes, they are actually thousands of brass and bronze castings and ivory carvings. When some were displayed in the British Museum that autumn, they caused a sensation. Africans, the British believed at the time, did not possess skills to produce pieces of such sophistication or beauty. Nor were they supposed to have much history. But the bronzes - some portrayed Portuguese visitors in medieval armour - were evidently hundreds of years old. Benin had been denigrated in British newspapers as a place of savagery, a ""City of Blood"".  Now those newspapers described the Bronzes as ""surprising"", ""remarkable"" and admitted they were ""baffled"". Some of these bronzes are still owned by descendants of those who pillaged Benin, while others have passed from owner to owner. Victor Ehikhamenor, an artist from Edo state, told me the bronzes were not made only for aesthetic enjoyment. ""They were our documents, our archives, the 'photographs' of our kings. When they were taken our history was exhumed."" But as their value in the West has increased, they've also become prestige investments, held by the wealthy and reclusive. London auction sales tell the story. In 1953, Sotheby's sold a Benin Bronze head for Â£5,500. The price raised eyebrows; the previous record for a Benin head was Â£780. In 1968 Christie's sold a Benin head for Â£21,000. (It had been discovered months earlier by a policeman who was pottering around his neighbour's greenhouse and noticed something interesting amidst the plants). In the 1970s, ""Tribal Art"" prices soared, and Benin Bronzes led the way.  And so it went on, all the way to 2007 when Sotheby's in New York sold a Benin head for $4.7m (Â£2.35m). This video can not be played Find out how the ancient trade of Benin bronzes lives on Entwistle kept an eye on that 2007 sale. The buyer, whose identity was not publicly revealed, was one of his trusted clients. Nine years later, presented by Frieda with the challenge of selling Ernest Ohly's head, Lance knew where to turn. ""It was the first client I offered it to, which is what you want, there was no need to shop around,"" he said. There was only a minor haggle over price. The client, Entwistle insisted, was motivated by his love of African art. ""He will never sell, in my view."" Whoever he is, wherever he is, he paid another world record fee. The ""Ohly head"", as Entwistle calls it, was sold for Â£10m - a figure not previously disclosed. If you envisaged the woman who sold the world's most expensive Benin Bronze, you might not come up with Frieda. We met in the Tate Modern gallery, overlooking the Thames. She had travelled from Tooting by underground. She is a grandmother, with grey close-cropped hair and glasses. She used to work in children's nurseries, but is retired. ""My family is riddled with secrets,"" she said. ""My father refused to speak about his Jewish ancestry."" She did her own research on relatives who were killed in Nazi concentration camps. Ernest Ohly was haunted, ""paranoid"", says Frieda, by the prospect of another catastrophe engulfing the Jews. Six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust - and, according to the Jewish Claims Conference, the Nazis seized an estimated 650,000 artworks and religious items from Jews and other victims. The artworks produced in Benin City still seek to chronicle events - like this one depicting the slave trade Ernest Ohly distrusted strangers and lived in a world of cash and secret objects. He kept a suitcase of Â£50 notes under the bed. ""Ernie the Dealer"" was the family nickname. The children grew up surrounded by art. But by the end he was tired of life. His house was chaotic, his Persian rugs infested with moths. The family found the suitcase of banknotes but discovered they were no longer legal tender. Ernest Ohly may have let things slide, but he had been a formidable collector. ""He and my grandfather never went to Africa or the South Pacific, but got their knowledge from being around objects,"" said Freida. ""There was a whole group of European dealers in London, in the 1940s through to the 1970s."" The British Empire was ending, and the deaths of its last administrators and soldiers brought rich pickings. ""I never understood why my father was so interested in reading obituary pages. The Telegraph, the Times, really studying them. If they were Foreign Office, armed forces, anything to do with Empire, he wrote to the widows."" Ernest Ohly listed his buys in ledger books. That's how Entwistle found what he was looking for: ""Benin Bronze head... Dec 51, Â£230"" from Glendining's - a London auctioneers where he also bought coins and stamps. Ernest Ohly's ledger showed how much he paid for the Benin Bronze in 1951 In today's money, that is just over Â£7,000. In other words, a substantial purchase. But Ernest Ohly knew what he was doing. He had a steal. He put the head in the safe box in 1953, and it stayed there until 2016. ""It was like a lump of gold,"" said Frieda. The windfall was not quite as large as it might have been. Ernest Ohly's affairs were a mess, and the taxman took a substantial amount. Still, Frieda says, she can sleep easy now. The Benin head bought care for her family, and property for her children. Frieda is married to a man of Caribbean descent - and her son is a journalist. A few years ago he wrote an article about how the Edo - the people of the Benin Kingdom - tried to stop the sale at Sotheby's of a Benin ivory mask. In fact, although he did not know this, it was a mask that his great-grandfather, William Ohly, displayed at his gallery in 1947. The article described Edo outrage that the family who owned the mask - relatives of a British official who looted it in 1897 - should profit from what they regarded as theft and a war crime. Frieda is too intelligent and sensitive not to appreciate the layers of irony behind her story. She had followed the arguments about whether the Benin Bronzes should be returned to Nigeria. Britain has laws to enable the return of art looted by the Nazis, but there is no similar legislation to cover its own colonial period. ""Part of me will always feel guilty for not giving it to the Nigeriansâ¦ It's a murky past, tied up with colonialism and exploitation."" Her voice trailed off. ""But that's in the past, lots of governments aren't stable and things have been destroyed. I'm afraid I took the decision to sell. I stand by it. I wanted my family to be secure."" Frieda is not the only owner of Benin Bronzes who has wrestled with their conscience in recent years. Mark Walker, a doctor from Wales, returned two Bronzes which had been taken by his grandfather, an officer on the 1897 expedition. Mark Walker (R) was feted in 2014 when he returned an oro bird and a bell to call ancestors stolen by his grandfather He receiveda hero's welcomein Benin City. Others are hesitant. In an imposing west London mansion block I met an elderly woman whose grandfather also looted Bronzes in 1897. Ten, or even five years ago, it would not have been difficult to get somebody in her position to talk. But today the owners of Benin Bronzes are cautious, and I agreed to hide this woman's identity. She showed me two brass oro ""prophecy birds"". I asked if they made her feel uncomfortable. ""I've felt misgivings, considerations that crossed my mindâ¦ Maybe misgivings is too strong a word. I don't feel like giving them anything."" There was a long silence. ""You know,"" she said, ""one bumbles along for 77 years, and suddenly this has become a sensitive subject. It never was before."" Frieda and I left the Tate and were walking along the Thames. I was about to say goodbye. Unprompted, she returned to the Benin Bronzes. Sometimes, she said, she wished her father had sold that head when he was still alive. A dilemma would have been taken out of her hands. ""It was difficult for me,"" she said again. ""Part of me felt we should have given it back."" Then she was gone. A collection of intricately made brass and bronze sculptures and plaques from the palace of Oba Ovonramwen Nogbaisi Created by specialist guilds working for the royal court The plaques provide a historical record of the Kingdom of Benin, including the first contact with Portuguese emissaries Many of the pieces were made for ancestral altars of past kings and queen mothers The term ""Benin Bronzes"" is also used to refer to artefacts made from ivory, leather, coral and wood In February 1897, the British launched a punitive expedition against the kingdom after seven British officials and traders were killed Benin City was overrun; British forces looted the Royal Palace, which was burnt down.

Sexton kicks Ireland to win over Scots,"This video can not be played Six Nations 2021: Scotland 24-27 Ireland highlights Guinness Six Nations: Scotland v Ireland Scotland (10) 24 Tries:Russell, Jones, WatsonCons:Russell, Hogg 2Pens:Russell Ireland: (14) 27 Tries:Henshaw, BeirneCons:SextonPens:Sexton 5 Johnny Sexton knocked over a late penalty as Ireland survived a surge from Scotland to eke out a hectic Six Nations victory at Murrayfield. A converted try from Hamish Watson brought the hosts level with five minutes remaining but Sexton held his nerve to kick the winning points. Robbie Henshaw and Finn Russell traded unconventional first-half scores. Soon after a Tadhg Beirne score, Ireland led 24-10 before Huw Jones began a comeback that fell just short. A sixth successive win over Scotland lifts Ireland up to second in the table, although they go into their final match at home to England with no chance of winning the championship. Scotland, who opened with a historic win at Twickenham, are stuck in fifth place, having lost three in a row in Edinburgh for the first time since March 2015. Reaction & as it happened Listen: Rugby Podcast reaction to Ireland win over Scotland Gregor Townsend's side had four weeks to stew over a careless one-point loss to Wales after the postponement of their visit to Paris and made a sluggish start. Ireland were on the front foot straight away, with powerful carrying from their forwards, and Sexton was soon clipping over a simple penalty. The Scottish line-out malfunctioned horribly and the first of a staggering six losses from eight throws resulted in the opening try as Sexton hoisted a cross-field kick into scoring zone. Stuart Hogg and Chris Harris both went up against Keith Earls with no one able to gather and the ball popped loose for Henshaw to pounce on. Sexton's conversion attempt from a tight angle clipped the post - that would be the veteran fly-half's only miss. This video can not be played Henshaw pounces to give Ireland opening try Scotland reduced the deficit with a Russell penalty but struggled to find any momentum because of the haphazard nature of their set-piece. If there was a touch of fortune about the game's opening try, the second was downright freakish. Hogg charged down a kick then managed to hack the ball on twice, with the first attempt coming off his own chin. Russell won the race to reach it but his touch with the boot seemed too heavy. However, James Lowe, in his attempt to intercept only succeeded in patting the ball up in the air and it fell perfectly for Russell to gather and score before he added the extras. Somehow the hosts were in front, although not for long. Ireland snaffled yet another dreadful line-out and quickly hammered it forward to earn a penalty, which Sexton knocked over with ease and, on the cusp of half-time, Sexton was at it again thanks to an offside gift from Ali Price. The second half was nine minutes old when Beirne crashed through for Ireland's second try. Sexton slotted the conversion and was soon adding another penalty, with Scotland second best at the breakdown. The hosts were down by 14 points and looking rather lost before an exceptional score from Jones hauled them back into the mix. Sam Johnson ate up ground with purpose and the ball was worked wide on the right for the replacement centre to motor onto, with his power and pace taking him away from the grasping hands of four opponents. This video can not be played Russell scores after try review to put Scotland in front A glut of injuries meant a major reshuffle for the Scots but suddenly they were energised and battering away under the posts. Duhan van der Merwe was almost in and kept a cool head to keep the ball alive, with Watson burrowing over from close range. Hogg crashed over the extras and it was a level game with just a few minutes on the clock. Ireland must have been sick after surrendering such a commanding lead but they summoned one more venture forward and when Ryan Baird charged down Price's kick, the home scrum-half was penalised for holding on, allowing Sexton the final word. Johnny Sexton kicks the winning penalty at Murrayfield No contest. Much of the pre-match narrative was of Russell snapping at the heels of Sexton for a British and Irish Lions place but the Irish captain was streets ahead, pinging over a tricky fifth penalty of the afternoon to seal victory. The 35-year-old also set up the game's first try, spotting a yawning gap in behind the home defence. Yes, Russell touched down, but it came from some bizarre pinball. The Scotland number 10 sent a wild penalty attempt wide in the first half and blazed a kick to touch in the corner miles out on the full when Scotland were in need of a lift early in the second half. He was removed on 62 minutes after a bang on the head, which will likely rule him out against Italy next week, and Scotland actually looked more dynamic with Hogg taking over at fly-half. Beirne brought menace to the Irish back row and his try was all about raw power Scotland captain Stuart Hogg:""Ireland were outstanding for 80 minutes and fully deserved the win. ""The frustrating thing for us is giving them 24 points in the first place. Credit to Ireland, they took their opportunities but for the second week in a row we've been ill-disciplined, allowed them easy field position and kind of killed ourselves at times."" Ireland captain Johnny Sexton:""I probably got a little bit lucky [with the winning kick] it was not my best strike - and it got there thankfully. ""We're just letting in soft tries, which is not acceptable at international level, and it is a little frustrating as we dominated the game. But, if we can finish second after a poor start to the Six Nations, we'll be happy.""

Updates were brought to you today by Jo Couzens, Sarah Collerton, Jennifer Meierhans and Claire Heald. Do join us again tomorrow. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has urged people to take the coronavirus vaccine when they are offered it as he received his first dose. The 58-year-old thanked staff and volunteers as he had his jab at the Francis Crick Institute in his Holborn and St Pancras constituency earlier. He says: ""From the help they gave our local hospitals with testing last year, to this vaccination centre, they have been at the forefront of efforts to support our NHS and keep our community safe. ""It has been such a difficult year and the vaccination programme is the light at the end of the tunnel. ""The vaccine is safe, effective and I urge everyone in our community to take it when it's their turn."" Meanwhile Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was ""delighted"" to be vaccinated and explained that, although aged in his 40s,a kidney condition puts him in a priority group. Liverpool's cultural heritage has helped it become a magnet for events and tourism Liverpool will bepart of a pilot scheme to test crowd safetybefore lockdown rules in England ease later this year. The government said it will work with organisers to get spectators for test events at a nightclub, comedy club and business events venue in the city. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said they would help audiences return ""safely without social distancing"". The test events - includingthe FA Cup final and the World Snooker Championship- will take place nationwide this spring as part of the government's Events Research Programme (ERP). Claire McColgan, director of culture and tourism in Liverpool, said: ""Our experience as the pilot city for mass testing means we have the knowledge and infrastructure in place to deliver complicated projects safely."" In November, all Liverpool residents - about 498,000 of them - were offered regular Covid-19 tests over a two-week period in thefirst trial of whole city testingin England. The prime minister has told the Scottish Conservative conference that the UK will
""beat Covid"" in the coming months. Boris Johnson says ""in the not-too-distant
future"" businesses will be able to reopen and people will once again be
able to hold family and friends. He spoke about how the ""kindness and perseverance of
the British spirit"" had shown ""how much we can achieve when we all
pull together"" during the coronavirus pandemic. And with the UK vaccination programme having ""roared
into life in every corner of this country"", he says restrictions that have
been in place across the UK for much of the last year can soon be removed. Johnson thanked everyone who had been involved in delivering the vaccination
programme. ""It shows that the great British spirit that saw us
through so much adversary in the past, lives on in us today,"" he says. Plans to keep indoor hospitality venues closed for weeks longer than non-essential shops in England are facing a legal challenge from a leading restaurateur. Hugh Osmond, the founder of Punch Taverns and a former director of Pizza Express, and Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester's night time economy adviser, have submitted a claim for a judicial review to the government. They believe there is ""no evidence or justification for the prioritisation"" of non-essential retail over hospitality, and said it could have a ""potentially indirectly discriminatory effect"" on young people and people from BAME backgrounds working in hospitality. The letter to the government's legal department argues that hospitality venues are safer than non-essential retail, and that they are essential for local communities and mental health. Under the prime minister's roadmap for unlocking restrictions in England, non-essential retail will open no earlier than April 12. But indoor hospitality venues will not open until at least May 17. There have been a further 52 coronavirus deaths in the UK,government daily figures show.,external This brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 125,516. There were also 4,618 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. A total of 24,196,211 people have received their first dose of a vaccine in the UK. Meanwhile, 1,584,909 people have received their second dose. Rangers manager Steven Gerrard hasurged the club's fans to stay away from next Sunday's Old Firm derbyat Celtic Park. It comes afterfans broke Covid rules to celebrate the Glasgow club's title successlast weekend. Sunday's game could be postponed if the Scottish government cannot be assured similar scenes will not be repeated. Last weekend fans gathered to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership ""Make no doubt about it, we want you there with us, but sadly, right now, you canât be,"" Gerrard told fans in an open letter. The former England and Liverpool captain said the best place to support him and his players ""is from the comfort of your own home"". ""We know you are with us here in spirit and we know how much last weekend meant to you when we secured the title. ""We know all of you enjoyed it, but we must stay safe, and stay at home."" We've got more from the Netherlands where riot police have used water cannon and mounted police to disperse several thousand anti-lockdown protesters in the centre of The Hague. Local media says several arrests were made but there are no immediate reports of injuries. Dutch authorities had stopped train services to the city, the seat of government, to prevent more protesters arriving, according to Reuters. Police initially told people to go home and announced over loudspeakers that the event was over. They warned they would break up the protest by force if necessary. The Netherlands has been under a tough lockdown since late Januarywith gatherings of more than two people banned, restaurants and bars shut, and with the country having its first night-time curfew since World War Two. Dutch riot police have used a water cannon and batons to disperse a crowd of anti-lockdown protesters gathered at a field in the centre of The Hague a day before general elections, according to Reuters. The demonstration was broken up after the crowd violated social distancing rules and ignored a police warning to leave. It follows months of protestsover coronavirus curfews.We will bring you more as we have it. Cousins Cleona, John, Sadie and Hugo were born within a couple of months last year Coronavirus restrictions - and the weather in some places - has put a bit of a dampener on Mother's Day celebrations across the UK. In Scotland and Wales, four adults from two households can meet up outdoors. But in England and Northern Ireland the limit is two. This is no help to NI grandmother Marie Lindsay, whose two daughters each gave birth to a set of twins during the pandemic. But Marie says she is just grateful for the safe arrival of Hugo, ClÃ­ona, John and Sadie during lockdown. ""These are tough times and we are so, so thankful to have these blessings in our lives,"" she says. In June 2020, when coronavirus restrictions allowed, the proud parents got to show off their newborns together to ""the happiest grandparents in the world"" at a socially-distanced gathering in a back garden. The whole family are unable to meet up in person for Mother's Day this year, but will be celebrating virtually. Marie, like many other grandmothers, says she is counting down the days until she can see all of her grandchildren in person once again.But for now here's some lovely pictures of how the twins have grown. The official vigil planned at Clapham Common was cancelled, but hundreds still gathered to pay their respects We've been bringing you reaction to the vigil for Sarah Everard in London which ended with police moving in to enforce coronavirus regulations. The events last night on Clapham Common came after hundreds gathered despite an organised vigil being called off due to Covid restrictions. Meanwhile, across the UK, people were paying their respects to the 33-year-old marketing executive by holding their own vigils.Here are some photographs of the tributes in memory of Sarah Everard. College Green in Bristol Birmingham City Centre Queen Victoria statue in Dalton Square, Lancaster The University of Leeds in West Yorkshire Hospitality leaders have urged the Scottish government to change its Covid lockdown levels to stop businesses failing. An industry group has submitted its own version of the system to ministers. The document, seen by the BBC, urges ministers to mirror the reopening plans for England - stripping away curfews and naming dates. The Scottish government said lockdown exit will be driven by data, not dates. Five of Scotland's main hospitality trade bodies said if changes are implemented,60,000 jobs in the sector could be saved. We've been hearing today about the next group of people to be called forward to have their coronavirus vaccine.Three Covid-19 vaccines have been approved for use in the UK. It means a lot of people are asking: ""When will I get the Covid vaccine? What are the groups for the Covid vaccine? Who is classed as extremely clinically vulnerable?"" Immunisations with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and Oxford-AstraZeneca began on 8 December and 4 January for those in priority groups. Shots of the Moderna vaccine will not arrive until Spring 2021. Margaret Keenan, 91, was thefirst person in the UK to be given the Covid jab. BBC health reporter Laura Foster explains who was first in line to get the shot and why. This video can not be played Covid-19 vaccine rollout: Who will get the vaccine first in UK? People hoping to spruce up their gardens in anticipation of some al fresco socialising may face problems due to a garden furniture shortage. A combination ofhigh demand and shipping problems is being blamed, with furniture giant Ikea among the retailers experiencing supply issues. Companies say shipping costs to import goods from countries such as China have risen dramatically. The Leisure and Outdoor Furniture Association, which represents 70 manufacturers and wholesalers, says all of its members are having problems with outdoor furniture supply. Ikea says the shortages have been caused by both a huge rise in demand through the pandemic, as people spend more time at home, and problems with its global supply chain. However, the retail giant says it hopes to have things back to normal by the time its stores reopen. Coronavirus has heightened anxieties around food for those with eating disorders, experts say. Charity Beat says demand for its helpline ""soared"" as a result of the pandemic. Spokesman Tom Quinn says: ""It's not surprising, as those affected and their families have had to cope with extreme changes to their daily routines, support networks and care plans, all while also dealing with the additional stress the pandemic has brought."" Phoenix Richardson, 15, has avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, or ARFID. When the pandemic hit, his mum Vickie was frantically buying up ""safe"" foods that he would eat, stockpiling pasta and sausages while some were buying up toilet roll. Phoenix says loss of control forms part of his anxiety around food: ""For a period of time, I could only trust Mum or myself to cook, otherwise I would panic. My own dad couldn't even cook... or granny. Even if I watched I would be like 'this is different, I don't like it, I'm panicking'."" Find out more about the effect of the pandemic on those with eating disordershere. We've got more from Professor Sir Ian Diamond, head of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on its work to track levels of coronavirus antibodies in the population. Sir Ian told the BBC's Andrew Marr show there was evidence of ""quite remarkable increases in the level of antibodies in the over-80s, and increasingly in the over-70s"". He says he is ""very, very confident that the vaccine rollout is really starting to provide some real protection"". At the other end of the age bracket, there are ""relatively high levels (of antibodies) amongst young people"", he says. ""Which just shows how much young people have been affected by the virus"". But he says the data on antibodies across the UK shows ""a lot of regional variation"". ""We find 30% of London have antibodies whereas only 16% in the South West, so we need to recognise that as well,"" he says. Hairdressers are set to reopen in Wales on Monday - but
mobile stylists say theyâre confused as to whether they can pick up the
scissors again. On Friday, the Welsh government saidall hairdressers,
including mobile salons, could reopen. But the Nation Hair & Beauty Federation (NHBF) said it
had been told mobile stylists ""might not be able to resume"". The Welsh government said they could work only ""where
the client physically cannot leave the home"". Mobile hairdresser Antonia Sparkles, 32, from Pencoed,
Bridgend, says she does not understand the rules. ""It should only be a yes or no, with clear instructions
on what services we can do,"" she says. ""I feel a bit confused. I know three people who can't
leave the house physically - that is not going to pay my bills. ""In the last hour I've had more confused clients saying
I'm allowed back - it's more stress. I'm telling clients there's no answer yet,
it's not clear."" Hereâs more on that story. The use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been suspended in the Republic of Ireland. The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended the move following reports of serious blood clotting events in adults in Norway. In a tweet, the Irish Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it was a""precautionary step"".,external Last week,Denmark and Norway suspended the use of vaccine. But the World Health Organisation said countriesshould not stop using the vaccineover fears it causes blood clots as there is no indication this is true. We've got the full story here. On Mother's Day we've been hearing the experiences of women like Tash, who gave birth to son Ziggy during the pandemic It's lunchtime in the UK, so let's have a recap on the stories we've been talking about. Last year, Covid rules meant some expectant mothers faced being alone for baby scans, appointments and giving birth. Bristol-based portrait photographer, Nina Raingold, met mothers who have experienced the challenges of giving birth during Covid restrictions in the UK. Here's what they shared in their own words. Jo and her daughter Olive ""The hardest part about being pregnant in lockdown was that my husband Pete couldn't come to my appointments or scans, and it's quite scary to do that by yourself. ""We were always a bit worried that one of us would get sick; it put a fog of anxiety over the last trimester. ""Pete couldn't be with me for some of my labour. I had to go into the maternity triage and he wasn't allowed in. ""All the stuff you prepare for labour is with your birth partner; I hadn't planned to do 45 minutes of it in the waiting room on my own!"" Naomi and her son Akirou ""We were in complete lockdown on the day I gave birth. ""It was so quiet getting to the hospital. Looking out of the window, there was nobody on the streets. ""I thought maybe I wanted to give birth at home because of the virus, but they said I had to have the baby in the labour ward. ""The virus was so new and they didn't know what was going to happen. ""They just had the high numbers of deaths from all the other countries. I remember it being a very surreal time. ""So many people were dying every day. To have that on your mind and then to go to hospital where you'll be in contact with so many different people was a scary thought."" Steph and her daughter Nora ""The worst thing in the whole pregnancy was that after an incredibly long labour, [my partner] Joe had to leave the hospital an hour after I had given birth. ""We did skin-to-skin contact with the baby with me, and then with him, and then he had to go. ""I had to stay with her for two days by myself. If he'd have been there, I think I would have been fine. ""I was dealing with it because all the other women were dealing with it, but it didn't feel good at all. ""Being pregnant during the pandemic wasn't actually that bad because we had some lovely 'us time', much more than we would have done before having a baby. ""If you're getting on with your partner, then actually you go into a lovely little cocoon. ""But it's sad for your partner not to be with the baby immediately.""

Death prompts calls for change,"Posters of Sarah Everard were shared widely ""Missing: Please Help Our dear friend Sarah Everard,"" read the posters that went up on south London streets and local social media forums in the days after the 33-year-old disappeared on her walk home in early March. It was concerning but such appeals are not exactly a rare sight, and the hope was that she would soon turn up safe and sound. But in the days that followed, as police put out a CCTV image of Sarah and gave details of her last known movements, concern grew to alarm, then dread, then fear, shock and sadness. Sarah Everard's journey from Clapham Common to Brixton had taken her through some of the capital's most populated, brightly-lit, and well-walked parts. Hundreds of people - many of them young women - tread those pavements every day and consider the streets in and around them home. As the police investigation ramped up, local women were warned to be careful about venturing out alone. When a police officer was arrested - and subsequently charged with Sarah's murder - the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick acknowledged that women in London and beyond ""will be worried and may well be feeling scared"", although she said for a woman to be abducted off the street was an ""incredibly rare"" event. Sarah Everard disappeared while walking along a busy road But the case had touched a nerve, particularly as walking is one of the few activities to have been allowed during Britain's coronavirus lockdown. Women across the country took to social media to discuss their own experiences of walking the streets and the lengths they went to to feel safe.Out poured stories of being followed, harassed, catcalled, assaulted and exposed to. Helena Wadia was one of those. She told BBC Radio 5 Live she wanted to highlight how common it was for women to feel unsafe. ""The first time I was catcalled I think I was about 12 years old,"" she said. ""I have been self-policing since then. We moderate everything - our clothing, our drinking. We get taxis where maybe we can't afford it. We hold keys between our fingers. We don't wear headphones when we're jogging. We stick to well-lit areas. It's exhausting."" One tweet asking women if they have ever faked phone calls, changed route, or even run in fear after feeling threatened by men in public spaces was liked more than 120,000 times. People even began sharing tips on what apps were out thereto help women stay safe. Flowers and messages have been lain in Clapham Common Anna Birley is one of many people in recent days to have underlined that the narrative around women's safety must change. ""What's so upsetting is it shouldn't be our problem,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's not our fault. Women aren't the reason women get attacked."" A vigil she helped plan at Clapham Common - one of several around the country - as a way of ""reclaiming our public spaces and coming together to feel a level of solidarity"" in itself became controversial when it resulted inclashes with police and women were seen being physically restrained. Several hundred people had turned up despite being told it had to be cancelled because it breached lockdown restrictions. The organisers had criticised the police for failing to ""constructively engage"" with them on efforts to make the event Covid-safe, instead of urging mourners to hold candle-lit vigils at home. The Metropolitan Police defended their actions at the Clapham vigil. They said they ""were placed in this position because of the overriding need to protect people's safety"", but have faced intense criticism from across the political spectrum. On International Women's Day every year, British MP Jess Phillips reads out the names of all the women and girls killed over the previous 12 months, where a man has been convicted or charged as the main perpetrator. This video can not be played Jess Phillips lists all women killed in the UK over the last year where a man has been convicted or charged. This year it fell on the day remains were found in the hunt for Sarah Everard, and she read out 118 names. ""Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives,"" Ms Phillips told Parliament. ""Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common."" How many attacks on UK women are there? In a separate debate in the Lords, Parliament's upper chamber, Baroness Jenny Jones of Moulescoomb called for an 18:00 curfew for men on the streets. She later told Sky News that while she hadn't been ""entirely serious"", she wanted to make the point that ""when the police victim-blame by asking women to stay home, we don't react. We just think it's normal."" So what has been the response of men? As women took to social media to tell their stories, Stuart Edwards, who lives five minutes away from where Sarah went missing,tweeted,external: ""Aside from giving as much space as possible on quieter streets and keeping face visible, is there anything else men can reasonably do to reduce the anxiety/spook factor?"" The tweet received 27,000 likes and more than 3,000 retweets. Among those who joined the conversation was food critic Jay Rayner, who also lives in south London. ""If I find myself walking behind a single woman on a quiet street I always cross the road to the other side and ideally accelerate away as quickly as possible. I am a big man and absolutely aware what my silhouette looks like in the darkness,"" he tweeted. Some however have been keen to point out that it's a tiny minority of men who are attackers - using the hashtag #NotAllMen. But the issue of violence against women is not one for the UK alone. The World Health Organization this week published a report sayingone in three women globally, around 736 million, had been subjected to physical or sexual violence in their lifetimes. WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said violence against women was ""endemic in every country and culture"", and had been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. ""Unlike Covid-19, violence against women cannot be stopped with a vaccine,"" he said, as the WHO called for more investment in services to help vulnerable women.

"Bitcoin surges past $60,000 for first timeThe volatile cryptocurrency extends its record-breaking run to reach a new high.BusinessComments","Cryptocurrency Bitcoin has risen for the first time above $60,000 (Â£43,100), continuing its record-breaking run. Bitcoin - which has more than tripled in value since the end of last year - has been powered on by well-known companies adopting it as a method of payment. But some analysts said this latest surge came in part due to the huge US stimulus package approved this week. Bitcoin's total market value last month exceeded $1tn. However, Bitcoin has a track record of wild price swings and has fallen sharply a number of times since it was created in 2009. Bitcoin hits new record of $50,000 Man has two guesses to unlock bitcoin fortune Bitcoin consumes 'more electricity than Argentina' The recent spikes have been fuelled by big companies. In February, Elon Musk revealed that his electric carmaker Tesla had bought $1.5bn worth of Bitcoin and would be accepting it as payment for its cars in future. Mastercard also plans to accept certain cryptocurrencies as a form of payment while BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is exploring ways it can use the digital currency. The Covid-19 pandemic has also played its part in Bitcoin's price rise, as more people go online for shopping, moving further away from physical coins and notes. Critics argue Bitcoin is less of a currency and more of a speculative trading tool that is open to market manipulation.

Scotland hospitality urges lockdown levels rethinkIndustry groups wants Scotland to mirror England's reopening plans by extending opening times and naming dates.Scotland business,"Hospitality leaders have urged the Scottish government to change its Covid lockdown levels to stop businesses failing. An industry group has submitted its own version of the system to ministers. The document, seen by the BBC, urges ministers to mirror the plans for England - extending opening times and naming dates. The Scottish government said lockdown exit will be driven by data, not dates. Five of Scotland's main hospitality trade bodies said if changes are implemented, 60,000 jobs in the sector could be saved. Tighter rules will be used to decide Covid levels Relaxation of Scotland's rules on outdoor meeting Analysis was commissioned by the Scottish Hospitality Group, UK Hospitality Scotland, Scottish Licensed Trade Association, Night Time Industries Association and the Scottish Beer and Pub Association. They said that under current level three restrictions almost half of hospitality businesses could operate. But if changes are made, this increases to almost three quarters. Under theprevious level three rules,external, alcohol was not allowed to be served. But the industry is lobbying for it to be sold outdoors, or indoors with a meal. On closing times, the last entry was 17:00 with venues were to close by 18:00. The industry would like to see two-hour time slots for indoor customers, with closing time at 22:30. Outdoors it wants a 23:30 close. It claims this could contribute more than Â£1.2bn to the economy in the short term. Michael Grieve, chairman of Night Time Industries Association Scotland and owner of Glasgow's Sub Club,told BBC's The Sunday Showthat indicative dates would be vitally important to businesses like his. He said: ""What we're asking for is that all restrictions are removed at level zero and things return to normal. ""We think it's imperative that there's a date put against that as a best case scenario as a date to work towards. ""But we need to have some kind of framework there because at the moment we're completely running blind here - we have no idea when we'll be able to operate."" The Scottish government has said that the previous levels system will be updated to account for changes in the situation - for example, the new variant of coronavirus and the rollout of the vaccination programme. Mike Grieve has sad it is difficult to see a future for clubs until coronavirus is eliminated Michael Grieve added: ""The positive impact of adopting our proposed plan are huge for relatively minor tweaks. ""We're not going to achieve zero Covid. We need to accept that Covid is in society. ""So, with vaccination being rolled out... we see no reason why in parallel indicative dates can't be put in place to give the industry some hope that we can reopen and that life can start to return to some kind of normal."" The Scottish government said it understood the desire for certainty for all sectors of the economy. It said in a statement: ""We need to be driven by data not dates, and we are regrettably not able to provide fixed dates as to when nightclubs and theatres which involve large audiences and customers in enclosed spaces can reopen. ""We will continue to listen to the needs of the sector and do everything within our powers to support them through this on-going crisis."" It said work was underway to develop a route-map towards an incremental and cautious re-opening of live events and performances. The Scottish government said more than Â£140m of additional Covid funding to support culture and heritage in Scotland had been allocated, with more than Â£3bn in support for business since the start of the pandemic.

"Ageing equipment puts Army at risk, MPs warnThe British army is likely to find itself ""outgunned"" in any conflict with Russian forces, a report says.UK","The Army is likely to find itself ""outgunned"" in any conflict with Russian forces, MPs have warned. In a damning report, the Commons Defence Committee described efforts to modernise the Army's fleet of Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFV) as ""woeful"". The ageing and depleted fleet puts the Army at ""serious risk"" of being outmatched by adversaries, it states. The Ministry of Defence has promised ""an upgraded, digitised and networked armoured force to meet future threats"". In the report - entitled Obsolescent and Outgunned - the committee highlighted the ""bureaucratic procrastination""  and ""general ineptitude"" which had ""bedevilled"" attempts to re-equip the Army over the past two decades. In 1990, the UK had around 1,200 main battle tanks in its inventory - today it has 227, the report states. It said armoured vehicle capability had reached ""a point of batch obsolescence, falling behind that of our allies and potential adversaries"". British Army considers a future without tanks UK defence secretary denies plan to mothball tanks Defence funding boost 'extends British influence' ""The Army's Armoured Fighting Vehicle programme has been plagued with uncertainties,"" said Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood. ""The decision to invest in fighting vehicles is too often hampered by uncertainties over what the Army wants them for and pitted against the desire to fund other defence priorities,"" the Conservative MP added, a reference to thegovernment's clear intention to move from industrial age to information-era technology. The report comes ahead of publication of the government's Integrated Review of foreign, defence, security and development policy, which will be set out by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday. Described as the most important defence review since the end of the Cold War, it is expected to focus on developing new technology such as robots, autonomous systems and meeting new threats in the domains of space and cyber. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: ""We thank the Defence Committee for their report and acknowledge their recommendations as we look to improve the management of our large and complex equipment programmes. ""Aided by the substantial Â£24bn settlement for defence, the Integrated Review will provide resources to deliver an upgraded, digitised and networked armoured force to meet future threats."" A defence review, due to be published shortly, will promise to transform and modernise Britain's armed forces to fight the wars of the future. But this report raises serious questions as to whether the Ministry of Defence can actually deliver. MPs describe the MoD and specifically the British army's efforts to modernise its ageing fleet of armoured vehicles as ""a woeful story of bureaucratic procrastination, military indecision, financial mismanagement and general ineptitude"". Hundreds of millions of pounds have been ""squandered"" with little to show for it. It's left the Army with tanks and armoured vehicles outmatched  and outgunned by a peer adversary like Russia. To modernise its tanks, the Army will have to significantly cut numbers. Some programmes, like the upgrade to hundreds of Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicles, are likely to be scrapped altogether. The MoD says the defence review will ""deliver an upgraded, digitised and networked armoured force to meet future threats"". MPs are not so sure. They say the Army's armoured capabilities are ""at risk of being denuded on the basis of promises of technically advanced 'jam tomorrow'"". Last November,Mr Johnson announced a ""once-in-a-generation modernisation"" of the armed forces. Ahead of Tuesday's review, the Committee urged government not to ignore the ""decaying"" AFV fleet. The report stated the Army is four years away from being able to field a ""warfighting division"", which, even under the Ministry Of Defence's (MOD) own current plans, would still be ""hopelessly under-equipped"". It said soldiers called on to fight a 'peer adversary' - namely Russia - in the next few years ""would, disgracefully, be forced to go into battle in a combination of obsolescent or even obsolete armoured vehicles, most of them at least 30 years old or more"". MPs added the MOD needs to urgently address its shortfalls in artillery, air defence and anti-drone capabilities, citing the Russian investment in modern missile and rocket artillery systems which defined their rapid victory in Ukraine in 2014. ""A mixture of bureaucratic procrastination, military indecision, financial mismanagement and general ineptitude has led to a severe and sustained erosion of our military capabilities,"" said Mr Ellwood. ""This will have a profound and potentially devastating impact on our ability to respond to threats from adversaries."" ""In a conflict, the capable men and women working for the armed forces may find themselves outmatched, reliant on a fleet of outdated and outmoded fighting vehicles. ""The government should make no mistake, these failures may cost lives."" Commenting on the report, Labour said ""Conservative defence cuts and indecision"" had weakened the Army. ""Our Army would currently be forced to go into battle with out-of-date armoured vehicles that could be heavily outgunned. Nothing characterises Boris Johnson's 'era of retreat' over the last decade more starkly than this,"" said shadow defence secretary John Healey. Does size matter for Britain's shrinking Army?

Call for all homes to be minutes from green space,"The grounds of Cardiff Castle were opened for socially distanced picnics last summer Cities, towns and villages must be redesigned to improve access to nature in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, campaigners have said. The future generations commissioner wants everyone to have a public green space within four minute's walk. During the first lockdown one in eight households in Wales did not have access to a garden, yard or balcony, official statistics show. The Welsh government has committed Â£110m to transforming towns in Wales. Planning experts and designers said the pandemic was a ""profound opportunity"" to rethink communities to tackle climate change and health issues. Ideas include planting trees, more cycle routes, reopening disused railway lines, creating ""pocket"" parks, and a campaign to create neighbourhoods where everything needed is within a 20-minute walk. Sophie Howe said access to green spaces should be a right for everyone Future generations commissioner Sophie Howe said public green spaces had been a ""lifeline"" for many during lockdowns and were vital for physical and mental health. Ms Howe wants to see changes to towns, cities and villages, to make sure no-one in Wales lives more than four minutes' walk - about 330yds or 300m - from a public green space. She said people who did not have a garden were reliant on being able to access open public spaces - but many had struggled to do that due to travel restrictions. ""It shouldn't be based on where you live, and the price of your house, it should be a right for everyone,"" said Ms Howe. The Welsh Government said its local places nature fund had created more than 400 wildlife gardens in and around residential areas in the past year. Some people set up ""fairy homes"" in woods during the first lockdown It is almost a year since Wales was first placed under lockdown, with people only allowed to leave home for essential reasons, including to exercise. While about a fifth of Wales is covered by national parks, the mountains and coastlines have been off-limits during lockdowns to all but those who live on their doorsteps. How much of the country do parks, fields and public gardens make up (not including National Parks)? 10,000 areasof accessible public green spaces, such as parks, fields and gardens Less than 1%of Wales is made up of publically accessible green space 432.22 metresaverage distance people live from a public park or garden 3.61public green spaces on average in a 1,000m radius of homes At the start of the first lockdown, official figures showed 133,542 Welsh households did not have access to a private outdoor space. This is the equivalent of 9% of households in Wales,according to Office for National Statistics figures,external. The data also shows at least 36% of those living in flats in Wales did not have access to a private space, a higher rate than in England or Scotland. More than 17,000 people on the shielding list, who were told not to leave their homes, had noaccess to any outdoor space,external. This video can not be played ""How do we make Swansea better?"" Some councils are investing more in improving green spaces, while others have reported conflict as more people use footpaths. In Cardiff, the council is planning to spend around Â£2m improving green spaces, parks and pavements in 2021-22. While in Rhondda Cynon Taf, the council said a significant increase in people using footpaths had led to a number of landowners ""taking matters into their own hands"" and closing paths. Â£38m announced for cycling and walking routes Meanwhile in Swansea, the council and Natural Resources Wales are ploughing ahead with plans to double the city's green space, including building the first park in the city since Victorian times. This video can not be played Cardiffâs Castle Street was turned into an al fresco dining area last summer In many towns and cities, Covid forced adaptations, with one-way systems in high streets and more space for outside seating. While some of the measures were divisive - limiting parking and delivery spaces or shutting major roads - there were other calls to make them permanent. Not-for-profit group For Cardiff, which represents more than 700 businesses, said with more people set to work from home in the long term, changes had to be made to draw people into the city. Adrian Field, executive director, said having more outdoor seating had allowed many businesses to survive and the group was looking at whether a new public space could be opened. ""It might have entertainment... PE equipment or a big screen to watch films or sporting events... there is an eagerness for that space to be used,"" he said. ""I think all towns and cities need to create environments where people can linger, interact, exercise... hopefully that includes pocket parks, if we can get more tables and chairs outside I think there will be a lot of demand long term."" Charity Sustrans said despite efforts, no area in Wales had been designated an official 20-minute neighbourhood in Wales - where every facility is within a 10-minute bike ride or walk of their home. This video can not be played Could changes we have been forced to make in the pandemic become long-term environmental solutions? One major issue planners have been looking at is how to connect rural communities which may have been cut off from neighbours in lockdown. Sarah Featherstone, of consultants VeloCity, hopes villages can be linked up using footpaths and cycle routes to create ""villages in a garden"". ""We call it the big back garden,"" said the Brecon-based architect. She said while there was a housing crisis, sprawling development meant many were now having to get in their cars to get to the middle of their village to access shops. Her vision is for the area to be used for people to grow food and for community gardens, while villages would pool together to address issues like poorly maintained pavements, pot holes and reducing speed limits. Parks have seen increased numbers of walkers, cyclists and runners ""All of the traffic has been pushed to the edges, so that you have this much safer, greener landscape between the villages that can be safeguarded and used for leisure,"" she said. Ms Featherstone said changing planning laws and addressing infrastructure could allow more people to move out of flats in cities to live and work in rural communities. ""There's a potential for a fresh look at things, but we need to keep that momentum going, otherwise we could easily slip back into jumping back in cars again,"" she said. The Welsh government said more than Â£50m had been allocated for permanent and temporary improvements to walking and cycling routes routes ""to allow people to safely and conveniently travel"" to local destinations, including outdoor spaces. The tight-knit design of valleys communities was partly blamed by some on high case rates in the area Last year a spike in Covid cases in valleys communities was partly blamed by some on the design of the areas, with tightly packed lines of terraced houses. In Merthyr Tydfil - which in November had the highest Covid case rate in the UK - the council kept parks open during the firebreak lockdown,as the Brecon Beacons national park was just out of reach for many. There are also thoughts on how south Wales valley communities could be reimagined and opened up with more access to green spaces. Matthew Jones said the recovery post-Covid was an opportunity to ""profoundly change"" towns, as more people worked from home and had developed an appreciation for local shops, paths and parks. ""There's a potential to really rethink what we do with public spaces... how streets connect together, how people can move safely around where they live,"" he said. Dr Jones, who has looked at the future of towns for the Design Commission for Wales, said homes and workspaces could be redesigned to include garden elements. Planners believe more buildings with green spaces built in could appear, like these plans in Swansea In Swansea, plans have been approved for a ""living"" building, with rooftop gardens and allotments, and Dr Jones said ideas like this could help towards a bid for Wales to have carbon neutral emissions by 2050. He said it would be interesting to see which communities chose to keep temporary measures - such as shutting roads and widening pavements - to create more room for walking and cycling once the pandemic ended. The Welsh government said it was already delivering green infrastructure schemes worth Â£9m to make town centres ""greener, more attractive and safer"". It has also launched a national forest programme to create a ""connected woodland extending the length of Wales"". In the first year of the programme, projects included more than 20 small woodlands created by and for schoolchildren. Covid jobs: how can Wales have a 'green recovery'?

Pandemic impact 'yet to be felt' on High Streets,"The coronavirus pandemic has thrown Britain's High Streets into crisis, yet the full force of its impact has yet to be felt, according to accountants PwC. More than 17,500 chain stores and other venues closed in Great Britain last year, according to new data. That's an average rate of 48 closures a day. But the figures, which include hospitality and leisure venues, but not independent retailers, suggest the trend began before the pandemic. The research was conducted by the Local Data Company which tracks vacancy rates in nearly 3,500 High Streets, shopping centres and retail parks. It recorded 17,532 closures in 2020. It also reported 7,665 store openings. This resulted in a net loss of 9,877 outlets, the worst annual decline researchers have seen in more than a decade. However, the full impact of the pandemic has yet to be felt, according to Lisa Hooker, head of consumer markets at PWC, so the picture is likely to get worse before it gets better. These numbers, for instance, only include store closures which are known to be permanent. Many outlets which have closed ""temporarily"" may never re-open. ""Unfortunately, there is still quite a lot to play out. You've seen the closures of the likes of Debenhams and Topshop and that's happening in 2021 so they're not even in our numbers,"" Ms Hooker says. ""Much of the impact is a reflection of things that happened before the pandemic. This was not just the move online but areas such as legislative changes, for example for betting shops, consolidation due to overexpansion, or chain-wide closures for restaurants and mobile phone stores that found themselves in trouble pre-Covid-19."" As a result closures were rising and openings were falling even before the pandemic hit. Shopping centres saw the largest proportion of their stores closed, whilst retail parks fared the best. Fashion retailers and betting shops were the worst performing categories. Meanwhile takeaway outlets, and cake shops, enjoyed some growth. And city centres are doing worse than suburbs and commuter towns, driven by the number of people working from home. Â£5bn fund to help High Street recover from Covid The High Street hoping for 'booming summer trade' Shops return to rural Sweden but are now staff-free ""Looking at where this this opening and closure activity has predominated really tells the story of changing consumer preferences and shifting demand, "" says Lucy Stainton, head of retail and strategic partnerships at the Local Data Company. ""On the whole, flagship, city centre high streets and shopping centres saw a greater decline in chain stores versus more local markets and retail parks which proved to be more convenient and perceptibly safer."" There is regional disparity, too. For the first time, London has been hit harder than other regions with a record increase in net closures this year. Together with the South East, they account for a third of the decline of all shops. Richmond, on the edge of south-west London, has suddenly found itself with a challenge on its hands. It's a prosperous, popular destination, but has lost about a dozen names over the last 12 months, including Moss Bross, Massimo Dutti, Cos and House of Fraser. ""Our High Street has undergone change and so has every High Street in Britain,"" says Gabriel Irwin, who owns a specialist shoe shop, Foot Solutions, just around the corner from the former House of Fraser store, the biggest vacant unit in town. ""It's a perfect storm, from internet shopping taking a greater market share to the perception amongst retailers, that we are a high-rent, high-rates district."" Gabriel Irwin has seen shops around his in Richmond, London, disappear But Mr Irwin says Richmond will bounce back and that, anecdotally, landlords have already been talking to potential new tenants, who are encouraged by lower rents. The House of Fraser site is also being redeveloped. PWC's Lisa Hooker also believes that as we emerge from the pandemic there will be opportunities for the gaps to be filled. ""After the global financial crisis, we saw the growth of discounters and food service chains that replaced exiting retailers. There is an opportunity for operators who can find the right location at the right time, to thrive, even despite the current uncertainty."" The High Street hoping for 'booming summer trade' Shops return to rural Sweden but are now staff-free Â£5bn fund to help High Street recover from Covid John Lewis warns of 'painful' store closures Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. Millions of vulnerable people with underlying health conditions, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease,are being urged to book their coronavirus jabs. Cancer Research UK, Mencap and the Terrence Higgins Trust are among 18 charities to write an open letter encouraging those in priority group six to book their vaccines. This includes those aged 16 to 64 with an underlying health condition, their carers, and people with learning disabilities. When will it beyour turn to get the vaccine?

""Around a dozen"" sporting and cultural events will be staged this spring, according to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Arsenal beat Chelsea behind closed doors at Wembley to win the 2019-20 FA Cup The sight of empty shelves in supermarkets have not been uncommon during the pandemic, but unlike those who were stockpiling toilet roll, Phoenix Richardson's familywere buying up his ""safe"" foods, such as pasta and sausages. The 15-year-old has avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, or ARFID, and will only eat very particular items. Meanwhile, MPs are calling for more action to support those with eating disordersamid a rise in people seeking help. Coronavirus measures in the past year have meant some expectant mothers faced being alone for baby scans, appointments and even giving birth.

"Bitcoin surges past $60,000 for first timeThe volatile cryptocurrency extends its record-breaking run to reach a new high.","Cryptocurrency Bitcoin has risen for the first time above $60,000 (Â£43,100), continuing its record-breaking run. Bitcoin - which has more than tripled in value since the end of last year - has been powered on by well-known companies adopting it as a method of payment. But some analysts said this latest surge came in part due to the huge US stimulus package approved this week. Bitcoin's total market value last month exceeded $1tn. However, Bitcoin has a track record of wild price swings and has fallen sharply a number of times since it was created in 2009. Bitcoin hits new record of $50,000 Man has two guesses to unlock bitcoin fortune Bitcoin consumes 'more electricity than Argentina' The recent spikes have been fuelled by big companies. In February, Elon Musk revealed that his electric carmaker Tesla had bought $1.5bn worth of Bitcoin and would be accepting it as payment for its cars in future. Mastercard also plans to accept certain cryptocurrencies as a form of payment while BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is exploring ways it can use the digital currency. The Covid-19 pandemic has also played its part in Bitcoin's price rise, as more people go online for shopping, moving further away from physical coins and notes. Critics argue Bitcoin is less of a currency and more of a speculative trading tool that is open to market manipulation. There is also concern over its environmental impact, with huge amounts of energy needed to conduct transactions. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work?

Updates were brought to you today by Jo Couzens, Sarah Collerton, Jennifer Meierhans and Claire Heald. Do join us again tomorrow. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has urged people to take the coronavirus vaccine when they are offered it as he received his first dose. The 58-year-old thanked staff and volunteers as he had his jab at the Francis Crick Institute in his Holborn and St Pancras constituency earlier. He says: ""From the help they gave our local hospitals with testing last year, to this vaccination centre, they have been at the forefront of efforts to support our NHS and keep our community safe. ""It has been such a difficult year and the vaccination programme is the light at the end of the tunnel. ""The vaccine is safe, effective and I urge everyone in our community to take it when it's their turn."" Meanwhile Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was ""delighted"" to be vaccinated and explained that, although aged in his 40s,a kidney condition puts him in a priority group. Liverpool's cultural heritage has helped it become a magnet for events and tourism Liverpool will bepart of a pilot scheme to test crowd safetybefore lockdown rules in England ease later this year. The government said it will work with organisers to get spectators for test events at a nightclub, comedy club and business events venue in the city. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said they would help audiences return ""safely without social distancing"". The test events - includingthe FA Cup final and the World Snooker Championship- will take place nationwide this spring as part of the government's Events Research Programme (ERP). Claire McColgan, director of culture and tourism in Liverpool, said: ""Our experience as the pilot city for mass testing means we have the knowledge and infrastructure in place to deliver complicated projects safely."" In November, all Liverpool residents - about 498,000 of them - were offered regular Covid-19 tests over a two-week period in thefirst trial of whole city testingin England. The prime minister has told the Scottish Conservative conference that the UK will
""beat Covid"" in the coming months. Boris Johnson says ""in the not-too-distant
future"" businesses will be able to reopen and people will once again be
able to hold family and friends. He spoke about how the ""kindness and perseverance of
the British spirit"" had shown ""how much we can achieve when we all
pull together"" during the coronavirus pandemic. And with the UK vaccination programme having ""roared
into life in every corner of this country"", he says restrictions that have
been in place across the UK for much of the last year can soon be removed. Johnson thanked everyone who had been involved in delivering the vaccination
programme. ""It shows that the great British spirit that saw us
through so much adversary in the past, lives on in us today,"" he says. Plans to keep indoor hospitality venues closed for weeks longer than non-essential shops in England are facing a legal challenge from a leading restaurateur. Hugh Osmond, the founder of Punch Taverns and a former director of Pizza Express, and Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester's night time economy adviser, have submitted a claim for a judicial review to the government. They believe there is ""no evidence or justification for the prioritisation"" of non-essential retail over hospitality, and said it could have a ""potentially indirectly discriminatory effect"" on young people and people from BAME backgrounds working in hospitality. The letter to the government's legal department argues that hospitality venues are safer than non-essential retail, and that they are essential for local communities and mental health. Under the prime minister's roadmap for unlocking restrictions in England, non-essential retail will open no earlier than April 12. But indoor hospitality venues will not open until at least May 17. There have been a further 52 coronavirus deaths in the UK,government daily figures show.,external This brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 125,516. There were also 4,618 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. A total of 24,196,211 people have received their first dose of a vaccine in the UK. Meanwhile, 1,584,909 people have received their second dose. Rangers manager Steven Gerrard hasurged the club's fans to stay away from next Sunday's Old Firm derbyat Celtic Park. It comes afterfans broke Covid rules to celebrate the Glasgow club's title successlast weekend. Sunday's game could be postponed if the Scottish government cannot be assured similar scenes will not be repeated. Last weekend fans gathered to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership ""Make no doubt about it, we want you there with us, but sadly, right now, you canât be,"" Gerrard told fans in an open letter. The former England and Liverpool captain said the best place to support him and his players ""is from the comfort of your own home"". ""We know you are with us here in spirit and we know how much last weekend meant to you when we secured the title. ""We know all of you enjoyed it, but we must stay safe, and stay at home."" We've got more from the Netherlands where riot police have used water cannon and mounted police to disperse several thousand anti-lockdown protesters in the centre of The Hague. Local media says several arrests were made but there are no immediate reports of injuries. Dutch authorities had stopped train services to the city, the seat of government, to prevent more protesters arriving, according to Reuters. Police initially told people to go home and announced over loudspeakers that the event was over. They warned they would break up the protest by force if necessary. The Netherlands has been under a tough lockdown since late Januarywith gatherings of more than two people banned, restaurants and bars shut, and with the country having its first night-time curfew since World War Two. Dutch riot police have used a water cannon and batons to disperse a crowd of anti-lockdown protesters gathered at a field in the centre of The Hague a day before general elections, according to Reuters. The demonstration was broken up after the crowd violated social distancing rules and ignored a police warning to leave. It follows months of protestsover coronavirus curfews.We will bring you more as we have it. Cousins Cleona, John, Sadie and Hugo were born within a couple of months last year Coronavirus restrictions - and the weather in some places - has put a bit of a dampener on Mother's Day celebrations across the UK. In Scotland and Wales, four adults from two households can meet up outdoors. But in England and Northern Ireland the limit is two. This is no help to NI grandmother Marie Lindsay, whose two daughters each gave birth to a set of twins during the pandemic. But Marie says she is just grateful for the safe arrival of Hugo, ClÃ­ona, John and Sadie during lockdown. ""These are tough times and we are so, so thankful to have these blessings in our lives,"" she says. In June 2020, when coronavirus restrictions allowed, the proud parents got to show off their newborns together to ""the happiest grandparents in the world"" at a socially-distanced gathering in a back garden. The whole family are unable to meet up in person for Mother's Day this year, but will be celebrating virtually. Marie, like many other grandmothers, says she is counting down the days until she can see all of her grandchildren in person once again.But for now here's some lovely pictures of how the twins have grown. The official vigil planned at Clapham Common was cancelled, but hundreds still gathered to pay their respects We've been bringing you reaction to the vigil for Sarah Everard in London which ended with police moving in to enforce coronavirus regulations. The events last night on Clapham Common came after hundreds gathered despite an organised vigil being called off due to Covid restrictions. Meanwhile, across the UK, people were paying their respects to the 33-year-old marketing executive by holding their own vigils.Here are some photographs of the tributes in memory of Sarah Everard. College Green in Bristol Birmingham City Centre Queen Victoria statue in Dalton Square, Lancaster The University of Leeds in West Yorkshire Hospitality leaders have urged the Scottish government to change its Covid lockdown levels to stop businesses failing. An industry group has submitted its own version of the system to ministers. The document, seen by the BBC, urges ministers to mirror the reopening plans for England - stripping away curfews and naming dates. The Scottish government said lockdown exit will be driven by data, not dates. Five of Scotland's main hospitality trade bodies said if changes are implemented,60,000 jobs in the sector could be saved. We've been hearing today about the next group of people to be called forward to have their coronavirus vaccine.Three Covid-19 vaccines have been approved for use in the UK. It means a lot of people are asking: ""When will I get the Covid vaccine? What are the groups for the Covid vaccine? Who is classed as extremely clinically vulnerable?"" Immunisations with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and Oxford-AstraZeneca began on 8 December and 4 January for those in priority groups. Shots of the Moderna vaccine will not arrive until Spring 2021. Margaret Keenan, 91, was thefirst person in the UK to be given the Covid jab. BBC health reporter Laura Foster explains who was first in line to get the shot and why. This video can not be played Covid-19 vaccine rollout: Who will get the vaccine first in UK? People hoping to spruce up their gardens in anticipation of some al fresco socialising may face problems due to a garden furniture shortage. A combination ofhigh demand and shipping problems is being blamed, with furniture giant Ikea among the retailers experiencing supply issues. Companies say shipping costs to import goods from countries such as China have risen dramatically. The Leisure and Outdoor Furniture Association, which represents 70 manufacturers and wholesalers, says all of its members are having problems with outdoor furniture supply. Ikea says the shortages have been caused by both a huge rise in demand through the pandemic, as people spend more time at home, and problems with its global supply chain. However, the retail giant says it hopes to have things back to normal by the time its stores reopen. Coronavirus has heightened anxieties around food for those with eating disorders, experts say. Charity Beat says demand for its helpline ""soared"" as a result of the pandemic. Spokesman Tom Quinn says: ""It's not surprising, as those affected and their families have had to cope with extreme changes to their daily routines, support networks and care plans, all while also dealing with the additional stress the pandemic has brought."" Phoenix Richardson, 15, has avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, or ARFID. When the pandemic hit, his mum Vickie was frantically buying up ""safe"" foods that he would eat, stockpiling pasta and sausages while some were buying up toilet roll. Phoenix says loss of control forms part of his anxiety around food: ""For a period of time, I could only trust Mum or myself to cook, otherwise I would panic. My own dad couldn't even cook... or granny. Even if I watched I would be like 'this is different, I don't like it, I'm panicking'."" Find out more about the effect of the pandemic on those with eating disordershere. We've got more from Professor Sir Ian Diamond, head of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on its work to track levels of coronavirus antibodies in the population. Sir Ian told the BBC's Andrew Marr show there was evidence of ""quite remarkable increases in the level of antibodies in the over-80s, and increasingly in the over-70s"". He says he is ""very, very confident that the vaccine rollout is really starting to provide some real protection"". At the other end of the age bracket, there are ""relatively high levels (of antibodies) amongst young people"", he says. ""Which just shows how much young people have been affected by the virus"". But he says the data on antibodies across the UK shows ""a lot of regional variation"". ""We find 30% of London have antibodies whereas only 16% in the South West, so we need to recognise that as well,"" he says. Hairdressers are set to reopen in Wales on Monday - but
mobile stylists say theyâre confused as to whether they can pick up the
scissors again. On Friday, the Welsh government saidall hairdressers,
including mobile salons, could reopen. But the Nation Hair & Beauty Federation (NHBF) said it
had been told mobile stylists ""might not be able to resume"". The Welsh government said they could work only ""where
the client physically cannot leave the home"". Mobile hairdresser Antonia Sparkles, 32, from Pencoed,
Bridgend, says she does not understand the rules. ""It should only be a yes or no, with clear instructions
on what services we can do,"" she says. ""I feel a bit confused. I know three people who can't
leave the house physically - that is not going to pay my bills. ""In the last hour I've had more confused clients saying
I'm allowed back - it's more stress. I'm telling clients there's no answer yet,
it's not clear."" Hereâs more on that story. The use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been suspended in the Republic of Ireland. The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended the move following reports of serious blood clotting events in adults in Norway. In a tweet, the Irish Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it was a""precautionary step"".,external Last week,Denmark and Norway suspended the use of vaccine. But the World Health Organisation said countriesshould not stop using the vaccineover fears it causes blood clots as there is no indication this is true. We've got the full story here. On Mother's Day we've been hearing the experiences of women like Tash, who gave birth to son Ziggy during the pandemic It's lunchtime in the UK, so let's have a recap on the stories we've been talking about. Last year, Covid rules meant some expectant mothers faced being alone for baby scans, appointments and giving birth. Bristol-based portrait photographer, Nina Raingold, met mothers who have experienced the challenges of giving birth during Covid restrictions in the UK. Here's what they shared in their own words. Jo and her daughter Olive ""The hardest part about being pregnant in lockdown was that my husband Pete couldn't come to my appointments or scans, and it's quite scary to do that by yourself. ""We were always a bit worried that one of us would get sick; it put a fog of anxiety over the last trimester. ""Pete couldn't be with me for some of my labour. I had to go into the maternity triage and he wasn't allowed in. ""All the stuff you prepare for labour is with your birth partner; I hadn't planned to do 45 minutes of it in the waiting room on my own!"" Naomi and her son Akirou ""We were in complete lockdown on the day I gave birth. ""It was so quiet getting to the hospital. Looking out of the window, there was nobody on the streets. ""I thought maybe I wanted to give birth at home because of the virus, but they said I had to have the baby in the labour ward. ""The virus was so new and they didn't know what was going to happen. ""They just had the high numbers of deaths from all the other countries. I remember it being a very surreal time. ""So many people were dying every day. To have that on your mind and then to go to hospital where you'll be in contact with so many different people was a scary thought."" Steph and her daughter Nora ""The worst thing in the whole pregnancy was that after an incredibly long labour, [my partner] Joe had to leave the hospital an hour after I had given birth. ""We did skin-to-skin contact with the baby with me, and then with him, and then he had to go. ""I had to stay with her for two days by myself. If he'd have been there, I think I would have been fine. ""I was dealing with it because all the other women were dealing with it, but it didn't feel good at all. ""Being pregnant during the pandemic wasn't actually that bad because we had some lovely 'us time', much more than we would have done before having a baby. ""If you're getting on with your partner, then actually you go into a lovely little cocoon. ""But it's sad for your partner not to be with the baby immediately.""

"Former F1 commentator Walker dies at 97He became synonymous with motorsport through his work on the BBC and ITV, before retiring in 2001.","This video can not be played BBC Sport looks back at the career of legendary Formula One commentator Murray Walker Legendary Formula 1 commentator Murray Walker has died at the age of 97. Walker commentated on his first grand prix for the BBC at Silverstone in 1949 and became a full-time F1 commentator in 1978. He became synonymous with F1 through his commentary, first with the BBC and then ITV, before retiring in 2001. ""Murray has been with me for my whole life and I don't think anybody thought this day would come, but sadly it has,"" said 1996 F1 champion Damon Hill. Murray Walker: A legend with effervescent enthusiasm Murray Walker at 90 on James Hunt and Ayrton Senna Listen: Special podcast - remembering Murray Walker One of Walker's most famous lines was, ""I've got to stop now, because I've got a lump in my throat"" as Britain's Hill won the 1996 Japanese Grand Prix - and with it his only World Championship. Hill added: ""Maybe old soldiers never die? His legacy and his memory is so strong, and what he gave to so many Formula 1 fans and number of people he affected, he became bigger than the sport, so we have got a lot to be thankful to Murray for. ""He could emote the events that happened in our sport. The shocking moments and the dramatic moments all have Murray's reaction to them and he made those events stick in your mind forever. ""And he allowed himself not to be the know-it-all commentator, but the fan who, at times, got over excited."" Walker, who is survived by his wife of more than 60 years Elizabeth, was appointed an OBE in 1996 for his services to broadcasting and motor racing. His co-commentators included the late James Hunt, who was F1 world champion in 1976, and the pair built up a memorable partnership. He also had a popular partnership with former grand prix driver Martin Brundle, who paid tribute on social media. ""Wonderful man in every respect,"" said Brundle. ""National treasure, communication genius, Formula 1 legend."" Three-time world champion Sir Jackie Stewart said he spent a lot of time with Walker, who served in a tank regiment during World War Two, as their fathers both knew each other. ""He was a very special man in every respect,"" the Scot told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I was lucky enough to know him well. In fact, I spoke to him several weeks ago where he was in a home. ""He was the perfect gentleman, a man who had great style and great skills with the English language. ""As a racing driver, from my own point of view, Murray was always the best."" Stewart added: ""He was very good at making mistakes. He made wonderful mistakes. He so much enjoyed the realisation of his error, he was such a character. ""A mistake didn't mean anything wrong for Murray. It was something else to make a joke of. ""He was full of energy, he never sat to do a commentary. He stood up for the whole time."" Walker was famous for his high-octane commentary style and memorable phrases that became known as Murrayisms Former team owner and BBC F1 chief analyst Eddie Jordan called Walker a ""legend"". ""He was so well prepared,"" added Jordan. ""He was very nonchalant about it, he didn't give that impression but he had the knowledge. ""When he was doing the commentary, he had every single angle covered. He was brilliant at it."" BBC director general Tim Davie said: ""Over decades, no-one conveyed the excitement and passion of motorsport like Murray Walker. ""For millions, he was quite simply the voice that captured the spirit of Formula 1. Respected by drivers and fans alike, he will be hugely missed."" ""He was to so many of us fans of F1 the voice that epitomised the sport we love,"" said Stuart Pringle, Silverstone managing director. ""Knowledgeable beyond words and with a passion that occasionally got the better of him in commentary, he brought the sport and some of its greatest moments to life in a way that ensured they remained seared in our memories for ever."" A statement from the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) said: ""It's with great sadness we share the news of the passing of BRDC associate member Murray Walker OBE. ""A friend, a true motorsport legend, the nation's favourite commentator and a contagious smile. ""We thank Murray for all he has done for our community. RIP our friend."" This video can not be played 'Murray Walker we adore you' - Formula 1 legend in his own words Reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton also paid tribute, saying: ""So sad to hear of Murray's passing. I remember growing up hearing your voice over the races. You made the sport so much more exciting and captivating. ""The iconic voice of our sport and a great man, thank you for all you did, you will never be forgotten. Rest in peace."" An F1 statement said: ""We are immensely sad to hear that Murray Walker has passed away. ""His passion and love of the sport inspired millions of fans around the world. He will forever be a part of our history, and will be dearly missed."" Reigning world champion constructor Mercedes echoed the view that Walker was ""the voice of F1 to millions"" and added that ""his love, passion and positivity for our sport were unmatched"". McLaren said: ""He brought our sport to generations by sharing his passion and knowledge with humour and humility. Our thoughts are with all who had the fortune to know him."" James Allen succeeded Walker in the commentary box at ITV and told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""He was so just much fun. ""The age difference between us was 45 years or something but he was so young in his mind. ""His career was in advertising, he was always aware of the audience. ""He was such a laugh. He didn't like driving much on the continent so, at all the foreign grands prix, I drove him around everywhere. ""One of my favourite stories, I drove him to a restaurant and when we came out there was a bunch of kids outside and one of them said 'that's Murray Walker's driver'. ""He had a life incredibly well lived."" Radio 1's Motivate Me Mix:Dermot Kennedy's favourite feel good tracks Completing an epic challenge:'My lowest point?

Pandemic impact 'yet to be felt' on high streets,"The coronavirus pandemic has thrown Britain's High Streets into crisis, yet the full force of its impact has yet to be felt, according to accountants PwC. More than 17,500 chain stores and other venues closed in Great Britain last year, according to new data. That's an average rate of 48 closures a day. But the figures, which include hospitality and leisure venues, but not independent retailers, suggest the trend began before the pandemic. The research was conducted by the Local Data Company which tracks vacancy rates in nearly 3,500 High Streets, shopping centres and retail parks. It recorded 17,532 closures in 2020. It also reported 7,665 store openings. This resulted in a net loss of 9,877 outlets, the worst annual decline researchers have seen in more than a decade. However, the full impact of the pandemic has yet to be felt, according to Lisa Hooker, head of consumer markets at PWC, so the picture is likely to get worse before it gets better. These numbers, for instance, only include store closures which are known to be permanent. Many outlets which have closed ""temporarily"" may never re-open. ""Unfortunately, there is still quite a lot to play out. You've seen the closures of the likes of Debenhams and Topshop and that's happening in 2021 so they're not even in our numbers,"" Ms Hooker says. ""Much of the impact is a reflection of things that happened before the pandemic. This was not just the move online but areas such as legislative changes, for example for betting shops, consolidation due to overexpansion, or chain-wide closures for restaurants and mobile phone stores that found themselves in trouble pre-Covid-19."" As a result closures were rising and openings were falling even before the pandemic hit. Shopping centres saw the largest proportion of their stores closed, whilst retail parks fared the best. Fashion retailers and betting shops were the worst performing categories. Meanwhile takeaway outlets, and cake shops, enjoyed some growth. And city centres are doing worse than suburbs and commuter towns, driven by the number of people working from home. Â£5bn fund to help High Street recover from Covid The High Street hoping for 'booming summer trade' Shops return to rural Sweden but are now staff-free ""Looking at where this this opening and closure activity has predominated really tells the story of changing consumer preferences and shifting demand, "" says Lucy Stainton, head of retail and strategic partnerships at the Local Data Company. ""On the whole, flagship, city centre high streets and shopping centres saw a greater decline in chain stores versus more local markets and retail parks which proved to be more convenient and perceptibly safer."" There is regional disparity, too. For the first time, London has been hit harder than other regions with a record increase in net closures this year. Together with the South East, they account for a third of the decline of all shops. Richmond, on the edge of south-west London, has suddenly found itself with a challenge on its hands. It's a prosperous, popular destination, but has lost about a dozen names over the last 12 months, including Moss Bross, Massimo Dutti, Cos and House of Fraser. ""Our High Street has undergone change and so has every High Street in Britain,"" says Gabriel Irwin, who owns a specialist shoe shop, Foot Solutions, just around the corner from the former House of Fraser store, the biggest vacant unit in town. ""It's a perfect storm, from internet shopping taking a greater market share to the perception amongst retailers, that we are a high-rent, high-rates district."" Gabriel Irwin has seen shops around his in Richmond, London, disappear But Mr Irwin says Richmond will bounce back and that, anecdotally, landlords have already been talking to potential new tenants, who are encouraged by lower rents. The House of Fraser site is also being redeveloped. PWC's Lisa Hooker also believes that as we emerge from the pandemic there will be opportunities for the gaps to be filled. ""After the global financial crisis, we saw the growth of discounters and food service chains that replaced exiting retailers. There is an opportunity for operators who can find the right location at the right time, to thrive, even despite the current uncertainty.""

Ageing equipment puts Army 'at risk' - report,"The Army is likely to find itself ""outgunned"" in any conflict with Russian forces, MPs have warned. In a damning report, the Commons Defence Committee described efforts to modernise the Army's fleet of Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFV) as ""woeful"". The ageing and depleted fleet puts the Army at ""serious risk"" of being outmatched by adversaries, it states. The Ministry of Defence has promised ""an upgraded, digitised and networked armoured force to meet future threats"". In the report - entitled Obsolescent and Outgunned - the committee highlighted the ""bureaucratic procrastination""  and ""general ineptitude"" which had ""bedevilled"" attempts to re-equip the Army over the past two decades. In 1990, the UK had around 1,200 main battle tanks in its inventory - today it has 227, the report states. It said armoured vehicle capability had reached ""a point of batch obsolescence, falling behind that of our allies and potential adversaries"". British Army considers a future without tanks UK defence secretary denies plan to mothball tanks Defence funding boost 'extends British influence' ""The Army's Armoured Fighting Vehicle programme has been plagued with uncertainties,"" said Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood. ""The decision to invest in fighting vehicles is too often hampered by uncertainties over what the Army wants them for and pitted against the desire to fund other defence priorities,"" the Conservative MP added, a reference to thegovernment's clear intention to move from industrial age to information-era technology. The report comes ahead of publication of the government's Integrated Review of foreign, defence, security and development policy, which will be set out by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday. Described as the most important defence review since the end of the Cold War, it is expected to focus on developing new technology such as robots, autonomous systems and meeting new threats in the domains of space and cyber. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: ""We thank the Defence Committee for their report and acknowledge their recommendations as we look to improve the management of our large and complex equipment programmes. ""Aided by the substantial Â£24bn settlement for defence, the Integrated Review will provide resources to deliver an upgraded, digitised and networked armoured force to meet future threats."" A defence review, due to be published shortly, will promise to transform and modernise Britain's armed forces to fight the wars of the future. But this report raises serious questions as to whether the Ministry of Defence can actually deliver. MPs describe the MoD and specifically the British army's efforts to modernise its ageing fleet of armoured vehicles as ""a woeful story of bureaucratic procrastination, military indecision, financial mismanagement and general ineptitude"". Hundreds of millions of pounds have been ""squandered"" with little to show for it. It's left the Army with tanks and armoured vehicles outmatched  and outgunned by a peer adversary like Russia. To modernise its tanks, the Army will have to significantly cut numbers. Some programmes, like the upgrade to hundreds of Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicles, are likely to be scrapped altogether. The MoD says the defence review will ""deliver an upgraded, digitised and networked armoured force to meet future threats"". MPs are not so sure. They say the Army's armoured capabilities are ""at risk of being denuded on the basis of promises of technically advanced 'jam tomorrow'"". Last November,Mr Johnson announced a ""once-in-a-generation modernisation"" of the armed forces. Ahead of Tuesday's review, the Committee urged government not to ignore the ""decaying"" AFV fleet. The report stated the Army is four years away from being able to field a ""warfighting division"", which, even under the Ministry Of Defence's (MOD) own current plans, would still be ""hopelessly under-equipped"". It said soldiers called on to fight a 'peer adversary' - namely Russia - in the next few years ""would, disgracefully, be forced to go into battle in a combination of obsolescent or even obsolete armoured vehicles, most of them at least 30 years old or more"". MPs added the MOD needs to urgently address its shortfalls in artillery, air defence and anti-drone capabilities, citing the Russian investment in modern missile and rocket artillery systems which defined their rapid victory in Ukraine in 2014. ""A mixture of bureaucratic procrastination, military indecision, financial mismanagement and general ineptitude has led to a severe and sustained erosion of our military capabilities,"" said Mr Ellwood. ""This will have a profound and potentially devastating impact on our ability to respond to threats from adversaries."" ""In a conflict, the capable men and women working for the armed forces may find themselves outmatched, reliant on a fleet of outdated and outmoded fighting vehicles. ""The government should make no mistake, these failures may cost lives."" Commenting on the report, Labour said ""Conservative defence cuts and indecision"" had weakened the Army. ""Our Army would currently be forced to go into battle with out-of-date armoured vehicles that could be heavily outgunned. Nothing characterises Boris Johnson's 'era of retreat' over the last decade more starkly than this,"" said shadow defence secretary John Healey. Does size matter for Britain's shrinking Army?

Wales eye Grand Slam after Italy routWales score seven tries against Italy in Rome to set up a Grand Slam chance against France in Paris next weekend.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Six Nations 2021: Wales score seven tries to thrash Italy 48-7 in Rome Guinness Six Nations: Italy v Wales Italy: (0) 7 Try:IoaneCon:Garbisi Wales: (27) 48 Tries:Adams, Faletau, Owens 2, North, Sheedy, Rees-ZammitCons:Biggar 3, Sheedy 2Pens:Biggar Wales set up a Grand Slam encounter against France in Paris next Saturday by clinically disposing of hapless Italy 48-7 in Rome. Hooker Ken Owens crossed for two tries, with further scores from Josh Adams, Taulupe Faletau, George North, Callum Sheedy and Louis Rees-Zammit. Italy only managed a try through wing Monty Ioane in response. Wayne Pivac's side can complete the Six Nations clean sweep by winning at the Stade de France next weekend. France and Scotland will still have a match to play after their third-round game was postponed because of coronavirus cases in the French camp. But Wales have the chance to create their own 'Super Saturday' with victory in Paris, where they could secure a second Grand Slam in three tournaments. The omens are good. Wales have already won their fifth Six Nations Triple Crown since 2000 and on each of the previous occasions they have done so, they have gone on to seal the Grand Slam. It represents a remarkable turnaround from a side that finished fifth in Pivac's first tournament in charge and managed only three wins in 10 games in 2020, although we have grown used to the boom-and-bust nature of Welsh rugby. It might also be a special day for captain Alun Wyn Jones, who could become the first Welshman to celebrate four Grand Slams. Wales have now matched their record of 17 Six Nations tries in one tournament with a game remaining. This was Wales' 16th successive victory over Italy, with the last defeat coming in 2007, and also represents their longest winning run against one opponent, overtaking a run of 15 victories against France from 1908-1927. Another heavy defeat will again raise the inevitable questions about Italy's position in the Six Nations and whether there should be relegation, with the likes of Georgia being given the chance to join the tournament. The facts are damning. It was a 31st successive defeat for the Azzurri in the competition, with their last victory coming against Scotland in 2015. They have not managed a home Six Nations win for eight years, with 20 successive losses. Italy have conceded 187 points and 26 tries in four games this year. Yet events off the field this week have actually strengthened their hand. The Â£365m CVC private equity deal secures Italy's status as an equal partner for the next five years, with Six Nations boss Ben Morel saying the championship is ""precious"" and any changes ""would need to be extremely carefully studied"". Before the match Pivac had warned not to expect any ""razzle dazzle"" from his Wales side, but that is exactly what the visitors provided in the Stadio Olimpico sunshine. It was one-way traffic after Wales opened the scoring through a Dan Biggar penalty, before Italy captain Luca Bigi was yellow carded by referee Wayne Barnes for cynically stopping scrum-half Gareth Davies taking a quick tap-penalty. Davies had been one of two changes in the Wales side for injured Kieran Hardy, who had scored from a similar move against England. From the resulting scrum, Wales made their numerical advantage tell as wing Adams, who claimed a hat-trick against Italy last year, dived over from a long Biggar pass. The fly-half converted. Wales' dominance continued and searing breaks from Rees-Zammit and Adams allowed the visitors to move the ball in both directions before number eight Faletau crashed over as 12 points were scored with the extra man. As it happened & reaction: Wales cruise to win in Rome Wales also demonstrated their forward power when hooker Owens was driven over for his fourth international try from an attacking line-out. Barnes then looked at television replays about a possible illegal tackle by Biggar on Italy flanker Johan Meyer. The English barrister deemed there was no case to answer, although a later challenge by Biggar at the following ruck was not looked at. The bonus point came in the 30th minute when Owens stretched over from another line-out for his second score. Wales appeared to have scored a fifth try through Rees-Zammit but television match official Tom Foley picked up a final forward pass from Biggar as the visitors led 27-0 at half-time. The onslaught continued after the break with Jonathan Davies releasing co-centre North, who sprinted away to equal Shane Williams' Wales record of 22 Six Nations tries. Italy responded with a fine individual effort from wing Ioane that Paolo Garbisi converted, while Adams was denied a second score after failing to ground the ball in time. Wales made a raft of replacements, including Scarlets second-row Jake Ball coming on for his 50th cap, before Italy replacement prop Marco Riccion was yellow-carded for dangerous use of the elbow. Wales took advantage with a first international try for Bristol fly-half Sheedy, before Rees-Zammit sped away spectacularly following an 80-metre interception to complete the scoring. While spectacular tries were being scored, flanker Josh Navidi provided the basis for the win with a tireless performance in defence and attack Italy:Trulla, Bellini, Brex,  Canna, Ioane, Garbisi, Varney; Fischetti, Bigi (capt), Zilocchi, Cannone, Sisi, Negri, Meyer, Lamaro. Replacements:Fabiani for Ioane (7-18), Lovotti for Fischetti (65) Riccioni for Zilocchi (33), Lazzaroni for Cannone (52), Mbanda for Meyer (26-36), Violi for Varney (63), Mori for Garbisi (54) Padovani for Trulla (44).

""On the whole, flagship, city centre high streets and shopping centres saw a greater decline in chain stores versus more local markets and retail parks which proved to be more convenient and perceptibly safer."" There is regional disparity, too. For the first time, London has been hit harder than other regions with a record increase in net closures this year. Together with the South East, they account for a third of the decline of all shops. Richmond, on the edge of south-west London, has suddenly found itself with a challenge on its hands. It's a prosperous, popular destination, but has lost about a dozen names over the last 12 months, including Moss Bross, Massimo Dutti, Cos and House of Fraser. ""Our High Street has undergone change and so has every High Street in Britain,"" says Gabriel Irwin, who owns a specialist shoe shop, Foot Solutions, just around the corner from the former House of Fraser store, the biggest vacant unit in town. ""It's a perfect storm, from internet shopping taking a greater market share to the perception amongst retailers, that we are a high-rent, high-rates district."" Gabriel Irwin has seen shops around his in Richmond, London, disappear But Mr Irwin says Richmond will bounce back and that, anecdotally, landlords have already been talking to potential new tenants, who are encouraged by lower rents. The House of Fraser site is also being redeveloped. PWC's Lisa Hooker also believes that as we emerge from the pandemic there will be opportunities for the gaps to be filled. ""After the global financial crisis, we saw the growth of discounters and food service chains that replaced exiting retailers. There is an opportunity for operators who can find the right location at the right time, to thrive, even despite the current uncertainty.""
