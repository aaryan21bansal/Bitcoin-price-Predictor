People 'bubbling out of pubs' since curfew,"Shadow justice secretary David Lammy has said that the introduction of a 22:00 curfew for pubs in England has led to people ""bubbling out of pubs"" at the same time. The Labour MP said that drinkers were ""hanging around towns and they're potentially spreading the virus"". Mr Lammy questioned the ""science"" behind the new restrictions, saying: ""It's not clear where that came from."" But the culture secretary said: ""There is definitely science behind it."" Oliver Dowden, speaking to BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, insisted: ""That's why we're requiring people to be seated in pubs and restaurants, so that stops the flow of them to and from the bar. ""We are reducing the closing times to stop people staying later and drinking."" ""And the point about all of this is that everyone has their part to play. If we all play by the rules, we can ensure that there are not further, more draconian restrictions,"" the culture secretary added. Extra police patrols as bar curfew begins What are the new coronavirus restrictions? How are pubs keeping customers safe? Under the new restrictions, which came into force on Thursday, all pubs, bars and restaurants in England are to shut no later than 22:00 each night. They are also restricted to table service only. But concerns have been raised by both businesses and community groups that the new curfew encourages customers to all leave at once and to carry on drinking together at one person's home.

Brewer and pub chain Greene King told the BBC: ""Without the usual slow 'wind-down' time that pubs would see with a gradual closure, customers were all leaving at once which presented more of a challenge for the pub teams managing people's safety on exiting the premises. ""We have also seen examples of people leaving our pubs to buy alcohol in shops to drink elsewhere,"" its statement said. It is calling on the government to reconsider many of the measures - which were introduced since the number of Covid-19 infections started to increase again. They urged additional help for the hospitality industry: ""The measures have not been well thought through and the combined impact of [the curfew], the challenges of table service-only and the fact that the government are unfairly targeting the hospitality sector has had a cumulative negative impact."" Pub chain operator Mitchells & Butlers, which runs brands like All Bar One, said it was too early to tell what impact the curfew might have on trade, although ""it creates an additional challenge as it forces customers to leave all at once rather than dispersing gradually"". A spokesman said it presented an extra hurdle ""in what are already very challenging and uncertain times for our industry"". The boss of the Wetherspoon pub chain has also questioned the introduction of the 22:00 curfew. Tim Martin said on Tuesday: ""The main problem with the 22:00 curfew is that it's another random and arbitrary move by the government, which lacks logic or scientific credibility."" He said that it would reduce sales for ""hard-pressed"" pubs and restaurants, while also increasing ""the level of unsupervised socialising"" at home and elsewhere. Speaking on the Marr show, Prof Mark Woolhouse, who sits on the government's advisory body that models pandemics, said that modelling of the effect of the new curfew had not been carried out to his knowledge. He explained: ""The models do not have the sort of granularity that you can explore in detail for closing times for pubs, or even different versions of the rule of six that we now have around the country. ""So those sorts of things have to be judgement calls based on the public health evidence."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Business said: ""These measures strike a balance between saving lives by protecting our NHS and the most vulnerable and minimising the wider impact on the economy and schools. She said the government had taken ""immediate action""  as the latest data suggested a ""considerable rise"" in the infection rate from within the hospitality sector in recent weeks."" ""We've acted decisively to support the hospitality sector throughout the coronavirus outbreak, and will keep all measures under constant review,"" she added. After falling from their April peak, confirmed new coronavirus cases in the UK have been rising again since early August. On Sunday, the UK recorded a further 5,693 cases and 17 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of deaths recorded over the weekend tends to be lower than during the week because of reporting delays.

Three more Welsh counties face local lockdown,"Barry Island is one of the major tourist attractions in the Vale of Glamorgan Three more counties are to be placed under local lockdowns on Monday, the Welsh Government has announced. Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan will have tighter Covid-19 restrictions from 18:00 BST on Monday. It means half of Wales' 22 local authority areas will be under local lockdowns, after rules came into force in Cardiff and Swansea on Sunday. Almost two million people in Wales - two-thirds of the population - will be under local lockdowns. Vale of Glamorgan council leader Neil Moore said it had not been an easy decision but pointed to the rate of infection rising to 34.4 people per 100,000 in the county borough. Cardiff and Swansea get ready for lockdown Covid cases increase by 362 in Wales ""We have taken a decision today for early and preventative action,"" he said. ""One of the main reasons for this is that the sooner we stop the increase in transmission, the sooner the restrictions can be lifted. ""We must now all work together to make that possible."" Blaenau Gwent on 202 per 100,000 and Merthyr Tydfil at 169 per 100,000 currently have the highest rates of infection. Neath Port Talbot will go into lockdown, meaning counties along the M4 corridor from Newport to Swansea will be under restrictions Neath Port Talbot council leader Rob Jones said: ""These restrictions are being imposed to protect public health, to protect you and your loved ones, and to stop people dying. ""Rates are much higher in local authority areas which border our county borough but we are now seeing rising rates here in Neath Port Talbot. ""We need the help of everyone across Neath Port Talbot to prevent the increasing spread of coronavirus and to bring the infection rates back down."" Mr Jones also urged people against panic buying, adding: ""There is no need to be concerned about stocks running low."" Torfaen council leader Anthony Hunt said: ""I know the introduction of restrictions is always a difficult decision, but it is a decision I support in order to protect people's health and to try and break the chain of transmission in Torfaen and stop the situation from getting worse. ""We have already seen this strategy work effectively in Caerphilly and Newport where numbers have dropped dramatically due to people adhering to the new rules."" Cwmbran is one of the towns which will be affected by restrictions in Torfaen Welsh local lockdown rules mean extended households must end and people are not allowed to leave or enter the council boundaries without a reasonable excuse. People are allowed to travel outside the area for a limited number of reasons. These include going to work if they are not able to work from home, to go to school, give care, or buy food or medical supplies. Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil, Newport and Rhondda Cynon Taf were already under lockdown, while Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, became the first town to have restrictions imposed which do not apply to the wider county. Cardiff and Swansea both went into lockdown at 18:00 BST on Sunday. Eleven council areas and one town in Wales will be subject to extra restrictions from Monday night From Monday evening, almost 1.9m of Wales' 3.1m people will be subject to local coronavirus rules. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""We are now taking further action and placing three more areas under local restrictions in south Wales - Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen, and the Vale of Glamorgan - because we are seeing rising rates in these three areas. These areas also share borders with local authority areas where rates are much higher. ""Introducing restrictions in any parts of Wales is always an incredibly difficult decision for us to make. But we're acting to protect people's health and to try and break the chain of transmission and stop the situation from getting worse. ""This is not a regional lockdown - this is a series of local restrictions in each local authority area to respond to a specific rise in cases in each area, which have distinct and unique chains of transmission."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said: ""The first minister might not want it to be described as a 'regional lockdown' but with two million people in the south Wales corridor now under some form of restrictions that's unfortunately what it is."" He called for a more targeted approach - ""local not regional"" - and said there needed to be urgent financial support for businesses affected. Meanwhile Mr Drakeford said a meeting would take place next week with leaders of councils in north Wales, where he said the position ""continues to be mixed"". ""If we need to take action, we will, but the position isn't as clear there yet as it has been in the south and I want to make sure that we look at it with the detail it deserves,"" he added.

Government defends students' return to university,"Hundreds of students are isolating in university accommodation including at Glasgow University The culture secretary has defended students going back to university in England after a union labelled the situation ""shambolic"". Oliver Dowden told the Andrew Marr Show it was important students did not ""give up a year of their life"" by not going. Labour has called on the government to consider pausing the returnafter Covid outbreaks meant thousands of students had to isolate in their accommodation. A scientist who advises the government said the situation was ""inevitable"". Mr Dowden said:  ""Young people have paid a huge price during this crisis and I think it is only fair to try and get them back - we have got clear guidelines for them to follow."" It comes as the UK recorded a further 5,693 cases and 17 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of deaths recorded over the weekend tends to be lower than during the week because of reporting delays. This video can not be played Oliver Dowden: ""They are going to university and paying the fees accordingly"". Prof Mark Woolhouse, who sits on the government's pandemic modelling group SPI-M, said the situation was ""entirely predictable"" and had been modelled. He said students were not to blame for the outbreaks and with students converging from around the country it was ""inevitable there would be some spread"". Modelling showed the risk areas were first-year halls of residence and face-to-face teaching, he said. Meanwhile,three more Welsh counties are to face tighter coronavirus restrictions on Monday- which will mean almost two-thirds of the Welsh population will be under local lockdowns. Sharp spike in Covid-19 infections among teenagers People 'bubbling out of pubs' since curfew Tips for coping at uni in a pandemic Students have been told to isolate in their accommodation at several universities in England and Scotland, including around 1,700 studentsat Manchester Metropolitan University- where students said they were being prevented from leaving by security guards and police. Ellie Jackson, a first-year at Manchester Met, said: ""We knew it would be different but we didn't think it would be this different. ""We've been told, if we leave, we can't come back."" Fellow student Jaimick Shah said his flatmates had all tested negative but still had to isolate. ""We're struggling to get food because everyone is trying to order it at the same time,"" he said. Manchester Met said it had communicated with students ""as soon as we could but it was not possible to give significant advanced notice due to the requirement to implement the isolation almost immediately"". The university said it was ""urgently preparing a care package"" and financial support for affected students to ensure they had the essentials they needed. The local University and College Union branch said it had raised concerns that ""the mass return of students would inevitably see institutions become Covid incubators"" - but it said these warnings went unheeded. In Scotlandthere are outbreaks at theUniversity of Glasgow, where 600 students have been isolating, as well as at universities in Dundee, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Coronavirus restrictions in Scotland currently ban people from visiting other households in their home - meaning students cannot return home to another address in Scotland from university accommodation for a short stay without a reasonable excuse, such as a family emergency. However,new guidance issued by the Scottish governmentclarifies that students can return home on a long-term basis. Students who have been told to self-isolate can return home if they need support to do so, including physical, financial or mental health support. This video can not be played David Lammy MP: ""The government is now threatening to lock them up at university"" Some students have questioned why they were told to return to their university accommodation when most of their teaching is being done remotely - and why they are still required to pay full tuition fees. Mr Dowden said students' experience at the start of this term was ""not as it would be"" due to the crisis, but that they should still pay tuition fees as they were being taught. Asked by Andrew Marr if students should get their fees back, Mr Lammy said: ""It's clear that there are actually lots of universities struggling financially so there's a balance here to be struck. Many of us have gone online, the key now is to get students online successfully and for them to have face-to-face [tuition] where it is safe to do so."" Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green told BBC Breakfast the government should consider pausing the start of term while an ""effective, efficient testing system"" was put in place, with students given a choice of learning from home if they felt safer there. Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students, said the union had ""long called for online learning to be the default"". ""If [students'] quality of learning is severely impacted then we also need to see tuition fees reimbursed,"" she said. She said students should be able to be released from rental contracts at their university accommodation and receive rent rebates so they could remain at home if they wished. ""We must remember this is happening because the government and universities told students to return to campus and this shambolic situation now demands flexibility,"" the union said. Thousands more students in England are turning up for the new university term this weekend - but the big question is whether they should be heading in the opposite direction and studying from home. Is it wise or fair for universities to bring students back if they're at increasing risk of being in a Covid outbreak and having to self-isolate? Accommodation blocks, with shared facilities and filled with young people wanting to socialise, have already seen a wave of outbreaks. So should the brakes be applied to stop this pattern repeating itself? After recruiting record numbers of students and promising them a mix of online and face-to-face teaching, it would be a very awkward U-turn for universities to switch back to the academic equivalent of working from home. And would that mean refunds on accommodation and tuition fees? There are likely to be some chaotic days ahead - and some big decisions to be made about whether to cut numbers on campus. And students must wonder how they've gone from being cooped up at home all summer to now being cooped up in university. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock wrote to directors of public health on Wednesday about the return of universities. In theletter,external, tweeted by Sheffield's director of public health Greg Fell, ministers said they should formulate ""a robust outbreak plan"" in collaboration with higher education providers. In the case of local restrictions, they said public health directors should ensure measures in response, such as closing some or all face-to-face learning ""do not lead to a migration of students away from their term-time accommodation back to their family homes"".

"Up to Â£10,000 fine for failure to self-isolate","A man self-isolating in April receives groceries from a local community group in High Wycombe Refusing to self-isolate when told to is now illegal in England, with fines of up to Â£10,000. Anyone who tests positive for Covid-19, or has been told they have been in contact with someone who has, now has a legal duty to quarantine. It comes as a study commissioned by the government found just 18% of people who had symptoms went into isolation. Meanwhile, the government has promised an ""uninterrupted supply"" of PPE for front-line workers over the winter. Four-month stockpiles of PPE - personal protective equipment such as masks, visors and gowns - will be available from November, the Department of Health has said. What are the self-isolation rules? The latest social distancing rules in England From Monday, it will be a punishable offence not to comply with an official instruction to self-isolate, with fines starting at Â£1,000 and rising to Â£10,000 for repeat offenders or serious breaches. Police officers can check that people are complying with the rules in virus hotspots and among high-risk groups based on ""local intelligence"", the government said. The law applies to people who have tested positive for coronavirus, or who have been told by NHS Test and Trace to self-isolate because they have been in close contact with someone with the virus. And if someone tests positive, it is illegal to knowingly give false information about their close contacts to NHS Test and Trace. This video can not be played Five ways to self-isolate successfully to prevent the spread of coronavirus People on low incomes who cannot work and are losing income while self isolating will be able to get a Â£500 payment. Nearly four million people who receive benefits in England will be eligible for the money, and it will be backdated once the scheme is properly set up in their council area, the Department of Health said. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the NHS Test and Trace App, which launched on Thursday, had been downloaded by 10m people by midday on Sunday. If the app tells you to self-isolate, you're supposed to, but it isnot a legal requirement,externalin the same way as when you test positive for the virus or are contacted directly by NHS test and trace. Home Secretary Priti Patel added the new fines were ""a clear sign that we will not allow those who break the rules to reverse the hard-won progress made by the law-abiding majority"". And Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government would ""not hesitate"" to introduce further measures if case numbers continued to rise. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told BBC Breakfast that NHS Test and Trace ""has now become as important in a sense as catching criminals, fighting fires and treating heart attacks"". ""It's a key public service and if it doesn't work, then we all suffer,"" he said. ""We've all got a role to play in making this service work - if you've got symptoms you need to get a test quickly; if the test turns out positive you've got to self-isolate, you've then got to pass your contacts on to Test and Trace."" He said that going into winter the country would need ""probably four times as many tests as we've currently got"" and he said there was a need to build testing facilities much closer to where people live and work. This video can not be played Are the lockdown restrictions too strict? As of the last week of August, more than 19,000 fines had been issued in England and Wales for alleged breaches of coronavirus laws, a letter from the attorney general said. The UK government hopes the new fines will be replicated in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - which all have powers to set their own coronavirus rules. Earlier this month, the Scottish health secretarysaid the issue would be under discussion. Meanwhile, Wales is the latest part of the UK tobring in further local lockdown rules,with new restrictions in Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan from 18:00 BST on Monday. It will mean nearly two-thirds of Wales' population will be under lockdown - with people not allowed to enter or leave their county unless for a limited number of reasons and banned from meeting other households indoors. The latest lockdown rules in Wales Thegovernment's self-isolation rules,externalmean a person cannot leave their house - even to buy food or other essentials, or to exercise. It requires anyone with symptoms or a positive test result to isolate for 10 days, while members of their household or people who have been contacted by Test and Trace must quarantine for 14 days. The crackdown on self-isolating comesas research carried out for the Department of Health,externalfound that the number of people with symptoms following the self-isolation rules was low. Although people's intention to self-isolate was high - about 70% - only 11% of people went into quarantine after being asked to by NHS Test and Trace. The most common reasons that people gave for not self-isolating were because they needed to go to the shops for groceries or a pharmacy or because their symptoms got better. Men and younger people were also less likely to follow the test, trace and isolate guidance, the research added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? Mr Hancock has also promised that health and social care workers will get enough PPE, as the number of UK coronavirus cases rises again. He said it had been a ""massive challenge"" to get enough at the start of the pandemic - when health and care staff warned of widespread shortages. ""That's why we have worked every day since to ensure we have an uninterrupted supply to meet the challenges in the coming months and protect those who are protecting us,"" he said. The Department of Health said 70% of the expected demand for PPE would be met by UK manufacturers from December.

Movers 'more likely to buy than first-time buyers',"First-time buyers - often cited as the lifeblood of the UK housing market - are becoming less likely to buy a home than movers, researchers predict. For more than a year, the highest proportion of sales were to people buying for the first time, according to property portal Zoopla. But the squeeze on mortgage lending and increased interest from movers will change the dynamic this year and next. The coronavirus crisis has changed conditions in the UK housing market. Four ways the property market 'will be tougher' for first-time buyers First-time buyers in Scotland at 'seven-year-low' Lockdown led to many people reconsidering their domestic arrangements, particularly as they have spent more time working from home. Gardens and space, as well as proximity of family, have risen on the priority list. That has led some existing homeowners to look around for an alternative property. First-time buyers, in contrast, have seen their options squeezed as lenders tighten their criteria for granting a mortgage - demanding larger deposits and guarantees of secure employment. The result, according to Zoopla, is that home movers will become the more likely buyers at the end of this year and next year. Pent-up demand, and government incentives such as a stamp duty holiday, led to property portals and estate agents reporting a surge in interest when lockdown restrictions were lifted. This resulted in some people, like Alex Phillips, buying their first home. The 27-year-old teacher bought a terraced house in Newport in August, on the same street as the primary school he attended as a child. Alex Phillips managed to secure a home loan with a 10% deposit ""The situation meant viewings were not straightforward, but it all went through in two months,"" he said. ""I did not want to be in limbo and for this to be a starting point."" He said a mortgage adviser helped him secure a home loan with a 10% deposit, which he said was ""vital"" for affordability. In August, agreed sales of homes with two bedrooms or fewer, excluding central London, were up 36% compared with the same month last year, according to property portal Rightmove. ""These types of homes are finding a buyer within 53 days on average, which is seven days quicker than last year,"" said Rightmove's director of property data, Tim Bannister. This demand is expected to fade as mortgage restrictions feed through. Zoopla research suggested demand from first-time buyers was already dropping following the post-lockdown peak, whereas demand from movers was ""holding steady"" at 37% higher than pre-Covid levels. ""First-time buyers have been a driving force of housing sales over the last decade,"" said Richard Donnell, research and insight director at Zoopla. ""They remain a key buyer group but lower availability of higher loan to value mortgages and increased movement by existing homeowners means a shift in the mix of home buyers into 2021.""

Donald Trump 'paid $750 in federal income taxes',"This video can not be played Trump describes allegations he avoided taxes as ""fake news"" Donald Trump paid just $750 (Â£580) in federal income tax both in 2016, the year he ran for the US presidency, and in his first year in the White House, the New York Times says. The newspaper - which says it obtained tax records for Mr Trump and his companies over two decades,external- also says that he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"", it says. Mr Trump called the report ""fake news"". ""Actually I paid tax. And you'll see that as soon as my tax returns - it's under audit, they've been under audit for a long time,"" he told reporters after the story was published on Sunday. ""The IRS [Internal Revenue Service] does not treat me wellâ¦ they treat me very badly,"" he said. Can Donald Trump release his tax returns? Trump's taxes: What you need to know How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mr Trump has faced legal challenges for refusing to share documents concerning his fortune and business. He is the first president since the 1970s not to make his tax returns public, though this is not required by law. The Times said the information scrutinised in its report was ""provided by sources with legal access to it"". The report came just days before Mr Trump's first presidential debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden and weeks before the 3 November election. The Times said it reviewed tax returns relating to President Trump and companies owned by the Trump Organization going back to the 1990s, as well as his personal returns for 2016 and 2017. Trump v Obama: Who's made the economy fly? It said the president paid just $750 in income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, while he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years, ""largely because he reported losing much more money than he made"". Before becoming president, Mr Trump was known as a celebrity businessman and property mogul, building an image of a hugely successful self-made billionaire which could be dented by the latest revelations, observers say. But the newspaper says his reports to the IRS ""portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes"". According to the US Bureau on Labor Statistics,the average American household paid $9,302 in federal income tax in 2018,external, on an average earnings figure of $78,635. In an annual financial disclosure that he is required to make as president, President Trump said he made at least $434.9m in 2018. The newspaper disputes this, alleging that his tax returns show the president had instead gone into the red, with $47.4m in losses. The Trump Organization joined the president in denying the allegations in the report. The company's chief legal officer, Alan Garten, told the Times that ""most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate"". The Trump Organization has rejected the New York Times' allegations, saying ""most"" of the facts are inaccurate ""Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,"" he said. By using the term ""personal taxes"", the New York Times points out, Mr Garten appears to be conflating other federal taxes paid by Mr Trump - such as social security, Medicare and taxes for people who work in his household - with federal income tax. The newspaper also claims that ""most"" of Mr Trump's biggest businesses - such as his golf courses and hotels - ""report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year"". ""That equation is a key element of the alchemy of Mr Trump's finances: using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses, then wielding their losses to avoid taxes,"" it says. It adds that the president is personally responsible for more than $300m in loans, which will come due in the next four years. The newspaper also alleges that some of President Trump's businesses have received money from ""lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favour"" from the president. President Trump, pictured in 2015 at the launch of The Celebrity Apprentice TV series, made $427.4m in 2018 from the show The Times says it used tax records to find out how much income the president makes from his companies overseas, alleging that he made $73m in revenue from abroad in his first two years at the White House. Much of that came from his golf courses in Ireland and Scotland, but the Times says the Trump Organization also received money ""from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics"". The Times alleges that the licensing deals netted $3m from the Philippines, $2.3m from India and $1m from Turkey. The newspaper claims that President Trump made $427.4m in total up until 2018 in revenues from The Apprentice US series, as well as from branding deals where organisations paid to use his name. He also made $176.5m in profit by investing in two office buildings, it is alleged. However, the Times alleges that the president paid almost no taxes on these sizeable earnings, because he reported that the businesses that he owns and runs made significant losses. The Times also alleges that Mr Trump reduced his taxable income by paying consulting fees to Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser. In financial disclosures filed in 2017, she reported receiving $747,622 from a consulting company she co-owned. Consulting fees of exactly the same amount were claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects, the Times says. Mr Trump is also said to have written off more than $70,000 in hair-styling costs as business expenses during his time on The Apprentice. President Trump's golf courses in Scotland, together with one in Ireland, made $63.3m in losses in 2018, the New York Times alleges The newspaper also claims that President Trump has been making use of a tax code that enables business owners to ""carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years"". For example, the newspaper says that President Trump's largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami, has made $162.3m in losses since he bought it in 2012. Similarly, his two golf courses in Scotland and one in Ireland have reported a combined $63.6m in losses, it is alleged. Tax lawyer and policy analyst Steve Rosenthal, who has previously worked with the Times looking into Mr Trump's finances, said the story ""goes to the heart of Trump's image as a successful businessman"". ""You cannot generate the level of losses Trump has generated without failing spectacularly. How he continues to generate losses and continues to operate suggests he is continuing to borrow money to keep operations afloat,"" he told the BBC World Service. But how much, if any, damage this will do to the president is up for debate, says the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel. This time four years ago, when Hilary Clinton upbraided him over how little tax he paid, Mr Trump replied: ""That makes me smart."" A lot of his supporters applauded, our editor points out. Mr Trump's political opponents condemned his reported tax arrangements. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, said the report showed Mr Trump had taken ""extraordinary measures"" to ""game the tax code and avoid paying his fair share of taxes"". Taking to Twitter, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer asked Americans to raise their hands if they had paid more in federal income tax than Mr Trump. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has not commented so far, but his campaign team highlighted on Twitter that teachers, firefighters and nurses all paid much more than $750 in tax. So this is what Donald Trump has been keeping out of public view for all these years? The president's tax returns, according to the New York Times, do not provide evidence of a nefarious connection to Russian mobsters or other shady figures, as some have speculated. Instead, they show that the real estate and reality television mogul's financial empire is built on sand - haemorrhaging money, hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, and arranged to pay almost nothing in federal taxes. These arrangements will be closely scrutinised in the coming weeks, with moves of questionable legality making their own headlines. Trump has boasted in the past of his ability to take advantage of every loophole in what he says is a corrupt tax system. When he's not denying this report, he may offer a similar defence - and his supporters will probably find that sufficient. The Americans who are outraged that they paid more in taxes than the billionaire US president are probably already against him. The Times story, however, is yet another unwanted distraction for the president. Every day spent on it is one the Trump campaign can't focus on changing the dynamic in a race that appears tilted against him.

Students 'scared and confused',"NHS staff hand out test kits to students at Glasgow University, where there has been a Covid-19 outbreak Students have spoken of their worry and confusion at being locked down in their university halls, in a situation described by unions as ""shambolic"". Up to1,700 students at Manchester Metropolitan Universityand hundreds at other institutions, including in Edinburgh and Glasgow, are self-isolating following Covid-19 outbreaks. In Manchester, students are being prevented from leaving by security. Universities UK said the wellbeing of students was ""the first priority"". Robert Halfon, the conservative chairman of the Education Select Committee, said 3,000 students were in lockdown at universities from Dundee to Exeter. He called for the government and its scientific advisers to reassure students and families by setting out the policy for England - and warned having students in lockdown at Christmas would cause ""huge anguish"". Mr Halfon said universities should also consider discounts to students who were not being taught face-to-face. 'Donât scapegoat students over Covid outbreaks' Scottish students: 'Why have they sent us here?' Manchester Met said it had introduced a 14-day self-isolation period at its accommodation at Birley and Cambridge Halls after 127 students tested positive for the virus. Some students there said they were getting ready to go out on Friday night when they looked outside to see security guards and police, who told them they could not leave. First-year Joe Byrne said: ""We have had no warning, support or advice from the university about how we get food etc, and instead have been left completely in the dark and practically locked up against our will."" Megan Tingey said she was not contacted by the university about the lockdown before police turned up outside her Birley Vine accommodation. ""It was quite scary and confusing,"" she said. ""No one's really told us much and then the police turn up as well with security outside."" This video can not be played Student Joe Gallagher believes the outbreak was ""inevitable"" Another student, Ellie Jackson, told BBC News she had read about the halls lockdown in the local newspaper before receiving an email about it - and stressed the need for ""more guidance"" from the university. For Ellie, it is the second period of self-isolation she and her five housemates have had to undertake. ""My course is all online - I haven't even been into university,"" she said. ""I could have done this at home. I don't think it's worth the money at the moment."" In a statement, Manchester Met said it had communicated with students ""as soon as we could but it was not possible to give significant advanced notice due to the requirement to implement the isolation almost immediately"". ""The communications we sent included details about how to access food and other provisions and we have been working with other partners, including local supermarkets, throughout the day to provide additional support,"" the statement said. ""Our security teams will increase patrols to support the lockdown and we will take disciplinary action against any students found to have breached requirements."" Students in some halls are confined to their flats at Manchester Metropolitan University Meanwhile, students across all of Scotland have been told not togo to pubs, parties or restaurants over the weekendand Universities Scotland has said students who socialise with anyone outside of their householdrisk losing their place at university,external. Hundreds of students are isolating at Glasgow University because of two coronavirus clusters. The university said itwould offer a four-week rent rebateto all students in university residences in recognition of the ""difficult circumstances"" under which they were living. It said those students would also be given Â£50 each to spend on food and it would invite local mobile food outlets to come to residences. A mobile testing unit has been set up at Murano Street Student Village in Glasgow Reese Chamberlain, an international student at the University of Edinburgh, said his entire block at Holland House was ""locked down"" after a student tested positive. ""The situation is dire,"" he said. ""I already self-isolated when I arrived here and even then it was so difficult getting basic supplies."" He said there had been an ""exodus of students"" during the night on Friday, with more than 50 leaving the building. A spokesperson for the university said it was ""not asking for whole halls of student accommodation to self-isolate"" but there were currently ""a small number of positive cases"" and the university was providing care and support to those self-isolating. A sign reading ""students not criminals"" was displayed at Murano Street Student Village in Glasgow University and College Union general secretary Jo Grady described the lockdown at Manchester Met as ""the latest catastrophe in a week where wholly predictable - and predicted - Covid outbreaks have caused havoc"". There was ""no point encouraging students to come to university to self-isolate for a fortnight"", she added. And the National Union of Students (NUS) said students should be able to return to their families because being ""trapped"" in university accommodation would only add to their anxiety at an already difficult time. It called for universities to support students with food deliveries and provide access to mental health services. ""We must remember this is happening because the government and universities told students to return to campus and this shambolic situation now demands flexibility,"" the union said. Students ""must be able to leave rental contracts, access online learning or defer, and do what it takes to prioritise their safety"", the statement added. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? The Department for Education said the government was working closely with universities in England to ensure they were prepared for the return of students. A spokesman said: ""Students should follow the latest health advice, just like the wider public, which means they should stay at university in the event that they have symptoms; have to isolate; there are additional restrictions imposed locally; or there is an outbreak on campus or in their accommodation."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said students were ""not to blame"" for coronavirus outbreaks but backed universities taking disciplinary action as a ""last resort"" against those who broke the rules. Universities UK, which represents 139 institutions, said the health andâ¯wellbeingâ¯ofâ¯students, staff and local communities was the first priority for universities, which would continue to follow government guidance.

Coping at uni in a pandemic,"Exeter student helpline volunteer, Lily, says she and her housemate Eloise take it in turns to read emails for each other, to avoid information overload Starting university is a massive step at the best of times - let alone during a pandemic. Coronavirus restrictions may mean you can't pop home for the weekend to get away from that annoying housemate (you know, the one who always leaves the fridge door open in your student kitchen). And your plans to make loads of friends during a fun-filled freshers' week may have fallen a bit flat, as many events are online only. Meanwhile, with many of your lectures and seminars being done remotely, getting your work done requires heaps of self-motivation and energy. Bearing all of this in mind, we've asked some experts for their tips on how students can look after their mental wellbeing this year. Many of us are fairly weary of Zoom quizzes as a locked-down format of socialising, but it's worth gritting your teeth and showing up, says Lily Margaroli, a co-ordinator of Exeter University's student helpline, Nightline. Lily, a 21-year-old Politics, Philosophy and Economics student, points out that while meeting people on group video calls can feel ""cringe and awkward"", it's a starting point for you to meet people who you can then strike up friendships with in a more personable setting. If you feel you might have clicked with even one person on the Zoom session, why not message them for a socially-distanced walk or coffee, she suggests. ""It's about having those connections that maybe can lead to something in person further down the line."" Students, like everyone else in the UK, cannot meet up in large groups due to coronavirus restrictions. In Scotland, students have specifically been told they cannot socialise outside of their household. It's therefore higher stakes than ever that you get on with the (often randomly-generated) group of people with whom you're bunged in a flat. If you don't immediately connect with one or two people who are sharing your living space, it can become all too easy to cut yourself off from everyone, says clinical psychologist Dr Anna Colton. But rather than retreating to your room, Dr Anna says it's about being ""open-minded enough"" to put yourself in situations that don't always feel comfortable, and to persevere with them, given that it's now harder to go out and find friends elsewhere. ""If you take yourself out of the equation, you don't get the opportunity to reassess that relationship at a later date. Just double-check you're sure you really don't like someone before you write them off."" Dr Fran Longstaff, Head of Psychology at Fika, a student mental fitness platform, says it can be useful to ""take some time to think about what you want from friendships"", and consider the ""characteristics you value in others"". She adds: ""Ask yourself - what is it you need from your friends to help you be the best version of yourself?"" Dr Fran says not to worry if it takes trial and error to find friends who share your values: ""Research shows it takes 50 hours to move from acquaintance to even casual friend - so be patient with yourself."" Many universities across the UK have relied on making lectures and seminars available online, instead of asking their students to gather on campus. Zainab Ali, 19, who is studying psychology at Queen Mary University of London, has noticed many of her course-mates are reluctant to show their faces on video calls - and it's hampering her chances to get to know people. ""It would be so different if it was face-to-face, but online everyone is really shy and anxious,"" she says. ""I think they're just uncomfortable because they don't know how other people are - they might judge."" The webcam reluctance adds to the difficulty Zainab is having forming friendships with any of the 187 other people on her course. As Zainab is living with her grandparents in east London, instead of on campus, the only contact she's had with course-mates outside of a learning environment is on a Whatsapp group. Back down in Exeter, Lily, who is in her third year, says she is ""happy to sit in my dressing gown and go to a [video] seminar"" - but she accepts that many freshers will still be finding that level of self-confidence. ""As a fresher it's a really different situation but if you can just put that camera on, knowing everyone else is in the same situation and feeling a bit self-conscious, you'll feel slightly more connected."" Whether you're doing all your socialising online, like Zainab, or able to enjoy small face-to-face gatherings (at a social distance), it's important to take time for yourself and not worry about FOMO - the fear of missing out - says Dr Anna. She suggests activities - such as exercising, reading a book, or even just painting your nails - can be helpful ways to ""decompress"", especially ""when life is as emotional and turbulent as it is now"". Try not to think about FOMO during that time, she says. ""I know young people might worry that if they're not there with people, that bonds will be formed and they'll be left out. But it's not going to be a disaster, you can't be there 24/7."" This video can not be played Nell Manson and Lucy Owens are self-isolating at the University of Glasgow Lily points out that while the government's simple ""stay at home"" mandate earlier in the pandemic was easy enough to understand, there are now various localised regulations across the UK - as well as universities setting out their own individual rules. This could make students feel bombarded. ""You might have a ton of emails and only one or two of them are really important, but they're mixed in with everything else. It's really difficult to say don't check social media or your emails, but at the same time you don't want to get too obsessed with checking them."" Lily and her housemates have found a way to avoid the information overload. They take it in turns to read emails from university officials that they've all received, and then relay the important bits to each other. If one person feels more anxious about the coronavirus situation on any given day, they can rest assured they can switch off their phone without missing any really important updates. Mark Mon-Williams, a professor of psychology at the University of Leeds and the Bradford Institute of Health Research, makes the point that it's unrealistic to expect young people not to socialise, and that this is a time when it's important for their personal development to meet new people. ""I think we really should think seriously about how we can support young people to have those social interactions, while maintaining the overall safety of the population,"" he says. Will universities be able to avoid spreading the virus? What happens if a university has a coronavirus outbreak? Lily adds that having something social in your diary at least once every couple of days - be it a socially-distanced walk, coffee, or film - is a great way to maintain a positive outlook. ""It is normal to feel worried, stressed, anxious and discombobulated"" as we are all living through the ""most extraordinary times"", says Dr Anna. She explains: ""There's no-one unaffected by Covid-19. We're all in the same storm but we're in very different boats. Some of us dealing with this storm are in luxury super-yachts, and some of us are in tin boats with holes in the bottom."" It is important to remember that your experience is valid, Dr Anna says, adding that - if you're feeling low - ""talk about it early"" rather than waiting for it to build up, because ""mental health difficulties become mental health problems when they're sat on and they grow"". Nicola Sturgeon: Unis must look after students Coronavirus: How to protect your mental health Lily says that while she knows it takes a lot of courage to send a text to let a housemate know you're struggling, chances are they'll be relieved and will tell you they're finding things hard too. Meanwhile, Mark Fudge, chairman of the Universities and Colleges division of the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy, encourages students to access the university student services, many of which are offering remote and online support. He adds: ""Universities have been planning and planning throughout the summer to make sure that this is as good as an experience as it possibly can be."" If you feel overwhelmed or anxious, help is available. Student Minds has set upStudent Space,externalto offer support, online and over the phone. As a student, managing money can be stressful at the best of times, let alone during a pandemic, when part-time jobs can be harder to find. Mark Fudge says: ""Students are the gig-economy workforce - they are often the waiters, the bar staff, the baristas, in most cities. Many have lost jobs or are struggling to get employment because the hospitality and retail jobs just aren't there."" His message to students in this situation? ""It's not a rejection of your skills, your abilities, or your personality, it is a financial situation that is very difficult at the moment. Just know that this is temporary and it will hopefully get better."" He also encourages anyone struggling financially to contact their university. Most have money and welfare teams, he explains, who ""can help with hardship loans if things get really desperate, or with budgeting advice and tips"". Dr Fran says problem-solving is a great way of managing and reducing stress, like financial worries. She suggests mapping out your monthly budget, whilst factoring in some added ""leeway"" for the ""best and worst-case scenarios"" can help you stay on top of financial worries. She says things like meal-planning, sticking to a planned weekly shop and keeping track of how many nights you go out in the week can also help. Whilst A-levels - your ticket into university - looked very different this year due to exam cancellations and then the U-turn over predicted grades, you still deserve your place, says Dr Anna. ""There's been quite a lot of invalidation of results"", she says. ""Students earned their grades through a two-year period of hard work. Yes, they didn't have the normal way of having that assessed, and that's a bummer, but that doesn't mean that they didn't work hard. They earned their places."" She says it's important students know and believe that. If you or someone you know are feeling emotionally distressed,these organisations offer advice and support.

US top court hears cases over Trump's tax returns,"The president's lawyers say he has legal immunity by virtue of the office The US Supreme Court has heard arguments on whether President Donald Trump should be allowed to keep his financial records secret, in a major showdown over presidential powers. Mr Trump has refused to share documents that could shed light on his fortune and the work of his family company. Two congressional committees and New York prosecutors demand the release of his tax returns and other information. Mr Trump's private lawyers argue he enjoys total immunity while in office. A ruling is expected within weeks. Unlike other recent presidents, Mr Trump has refused to release his tax returns and a decision against him could result in his personal financial information becoming public in the campaign season. Experts say the ruling will have far-reaching implications for the ability of Congress to scrutinise the activities of sitting presidents and of prosecutors to investigate them. The judges heard the cases remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Supreme Court has a 5-4 conservative majority and includes two Trump appointees - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. In the three cases, Mr Trump's lawyers tried to block the subpoenas - orders to hand over evidence.Lower courts in Washington and New York ruled against the presidentin all cases, but those decisions have been put on hold pending a final court ruling. Two committees at the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives demanded financial records from two banks that did deals with Mr Trump - Deutsche Bank and Capital One - as well as from Mazars, the president's accountants. Deutsche Bank was one of the few banks willing to lend to Mr Trump after a series of corporate bankruptcies in the 1990s, and the documents sought to include records related to the president, the Trump Organization and his family. Mr Trump's lawyers argued that Congress had no authority to issue the subpoenas, and no valid justification to seek the records. The judges are hearing the cases remotely because of the coronavirus Mazars is also the recipient of a subpoena from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr, a Democrat. The investigation concerns alleged hush money payments made by Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen to two women - adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal - who both say they had affairs with Mr Trump. The president denies the affairs took place. Mr Trump's lawyers said his records could not be handed over because his position gave him immunity from any criminal proceeding while in office. The banks and the accounting firm said they would release the information if ordered. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House correspondent The question for the Supreme Court justices was whether Mr Trump's accountants and bankers will hand over financial records from his past. But the bigger issue, the one that loomed over the justices' teleconference, concerned the balance of power between Congress and the presidency. The discussion on the call was amiable enough, with one of the lawyers referring to the others as his ""friends"". But below the banter, the debate was fierce: conservative justices asked questions that showed their concerns about the harassment of the president and the erosion of the power of the executive branch. In turn, liberal justices asked questions that showed their worries about Mr Trump's time in office and about the presidency itself. The liberal justices clearly want to rein him in and restrict the power of the office. Ultimately, the Supreme Court teleconference sounded much like debates taking place across the US, a deeply divided nation in which people are fighting over fundamental beliefs and principles - with Mr Trump, as always, at the red-hot centre. The congressional cases were heard together, and the justices seemed divided based on their inclinations. The liberals appeared more sympathetic toward the House position although they raised questions about the potential lack of limits on Congress' power to subpoena the president's personal records. The justices asked Douglas Letter, a lawyer for the House, to explain why the subpoenas were not simply harassment of the president, and whether Congress should be limited in issuing them. Mr Letter pointed out that the measures, in these cases, were directed at third parties and had been upheld by lower courts. But Jeffrey Wall, a Justice Department lawyer who argued in favour of Mr Trump, said the subpoenas had a ""profound potential"" to ""harass and undermine the president"". ""It's not much to ask that before the House delves into the president's personal life it explains in some meaningful way what laws it is considering and why it needs the president's documents in particular. The subpoenas here don't even come close."" Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts was sceptical that Congress had no authority to issue a subpoena, as suggested by the Trump defence team, but also raised questions that congressional power was limitless. Justice Roberts also seemed to disagree with Mr Letter, who argued that lawmakers had broad authority to seek information about a president for the purpose of writing laws. ""Your test is not much of a test. It's not a limitation,"" the chief justice said. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan told Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Mr Trump, that a ""fundamental precept of our constitutional order is that the president is not above the law"". But Mr Gorsuch expressed concern that members of Congress were abusing the process to hunt for illegal activity, saying: ""Normally we use law enforcement tools like subpoenas to investigate known crimes and not to pursue individuals to find crimes."" Later, in the case involving the Manhattan district attorney's subpoena, the justices indicated doubt over Mr Sekulow's argument that a president cannot be investigated while in office. The cases being heard resemble earlier disputes over the powers of a sitting president. In 1974, the court unanimously decided that President Richard Nixon must comply with a court's subpoena for tape recordings in the Watergate scandal. And in another unanimous decision, in 1997, it allowed a sexual harassment lawsuit to go forward against President Bill Clinton. Justices appointed by Mr Nixon and Mr Clinton voted against them in the cases.

What do outbreaks mean for students?,"More than 1,000 students across Scotland are self-isolating after cases of Covid-19 were identified in student accommodation in Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen. So what do students need to know about life on campus in the time of coronavirus? We've put together the answers to some key questions. The principals of all of Scotland's universities and the Scottish governmenthave agreed on some tough new rules for students. So for now, students cannot socialise with anyone outside their household. That means no parties, no visits to the pub, restaurants or any other hospitality venues this weekend. Universities will increase the staff presence to enforce rules and give welfare help and advice and they will ask private providers of student accommodation to do the same. Police Scotland are also being asked to keep an eye on student behaviour off-campus and a strict ""yellow card/red card"" system will be brought in to deal with breaches that put students and others at risk. And all students must download the Protect Scotland app. More staff will be deployed to give support and also ensure compliance with the new rules Students who have left their family homesare considered to have formed new households with those they are now living with,external. That means they cannot go back home, as households in Scotland are not allowed to mix inside homes. These measures will be reviewed every three weeks. There was some confusion about this after the Scottish government initially confirmed to BBC Scotland that students who had moved out should not return to their family homes. Then thenational clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said students in halls could return home for the weekend- as long as they are not self-isolating and do not have Covid symptoms. But he has since said they cannot return home because they are now in separate households. He tweeted: ""The law is clear: they can't meet indoors with another household - even mum and dad. Sorry.""

There are exceptions - for example, to provide care for someone who needs it and for extended households. This video can not be played How should students be self-isolating? ""Stay in, stay apart, sleep alone, keep cleaning"" It's essential anyone with Covid-19 symptoms self-isolates immediately and uses the NHS website to book a test. The entire household needs to self-isolate - even if just one person has symptoms. This means staying at home and not attending classes or social gatherings. If the test comes back negative, self-isolation can end for everyone. If the test is positive, Test and Protect will be in touch. Public health officials say it is ""vital"" those self-isolating do so for a full 14 days. You should remain in your accommodation - and not go out for any reason, not to attend classes or even to buy essentials like food. Ask friends who are not self-isolating to get your shopping, or arrange to have it delivered to your door. During this period you should avoid close contact with others you are living with. Stay 2m away from everyone. Keep the number of people in shared areas to an absolute minimum. Do not share towels or clothes. Sleep alone. Clean shared toilets, bathrooms and kitchens after every time you have used them. Keep washing your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. And remember, your college or university can provide you with advice and support. Students with coronavirus symptoms canbook a test through the NHS,external. Those who have their own car can go to a drive-through testing centre. But there are also walk-through test centres being set up in some areas. Walk-in testing centres in Glasgow city centre and St Andrews are already open. A walk-in test site in Aberdeen opened on Thursday and a centre in Edinburgh will open on Friday. Additional sites will open in Glasgow on 2 October and Stirling on 5 October, and new sites are being identified in Dundee. Mobile testing centres have also been used at Abertay University and at Murano St student village in Glasgow. The incident management team managing the outbreak at Parker House in Dundee have decided to test every resident, and will deliver home-testing kits to all students in the accommodation. Some students who live at Cairncross halls in Glasgow have been told they must self-isolate Universities Scotland says allowing student accommodation to open means students can attend the university of their choice. Some students live far away from their university and can't travel back and forth. Almost 49,000 new students gained places at Scottish universities this autumn, according to UCAS. More than half of those are likely be in university-run halls of residence, with at least 27,000 places available across the country. The highest numbers of students in university accommodation are in Edinburgh and Glasgow, with an estimated 10,000 students living in halls in the capital. There are also sizeable student populations in Aberdeen, Dundee, Paisley, Stirling and St Andrews - which alone has 4,000 spaces available in university-run accommodation. In many universities and colleges, a blended approach is being taken - so teaching will happen both online and in person. Universities Scotland said universities ""are offering on-campus experience for students where it is safe and practical to do so and is key to their learning"". This will be limited to small seminar groups, lab and practical work - where this in-person learning can take place within the guidelines. Just like similar facilities off campus, libraries, cafes and gyms are open - but there are public health measures in place to try to stop the spread of the virus. For example, social distancing measures are in place. In many circumstances, capacity has been reduced considerably. Edinburgh Napier University said its campus capacity has been reduced to 30% of normal capacity. Use the form below to send us your questions and we could be in touch.

PM promises to protect 30% of UK's land by 2030,"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson signs a UN pledge, saying UK government ""absolutely committed"" to global problem. An extra 400,000 hectares of English countryside will be protected to support the recovery of nature under plans announced by Boris Johnson. The prime minister made the commitment at a virtual United Nations event. He joined a global pledge from 65 leaders to reverse losses in the natural world by the same date. National parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty and other protected areas make up 26% of land in England. Mr Johnson promised the government would increase the amount of protected land in the UK to 30% by 2030. The environment is a devolved matter but the government has said it will work with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as landowners, to increase the amount of protected land across the UK. What's in Boris Johnson's climate in tray? Where are England's 10 national parks? On Monday, the prime minister signed the Leaders' Pledge for Nature, which includes commitments to prioritise a green recovery following the coronavirus pandemic, deliver ambitious biodiversity targets and increase financing for nature. Mr Johnson said countries must turn ""words into action"" and ""agree ambitious goals and binding targets"". ""We can't afford dither and delay because biodiversity loss is happening today, it is happening at a frightening rate,"" he said. ""If left unchecked, the consequences will be catastrophic for us all."" ""Extinction is forever - so our action must be immediate,"" he added. World leaders have often come together to strike deals over climate change, but a top level commitment on nature is much more rare. Environmentalists are delighted - they say nature is in freefall and urgently needs protection as roads, railways, housing and farmland cover the Earth. But they say Boris Johnson must lead by example. They point out that around half of existing Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the UK are in poor condition, many through lack of funding. What's more, measures to protect wildlife in the Environment Billare becalmed in the Commons for want of parliamentary time. Campaigners say if the UK is really taking nature seriously it must avoid trade deals that damage wildlife. It must also clamp down on imports of food that have caused environmental destruction overseas - such as beef farming in the Amazon. Martin Harper, the RSPB's director of global conservation, said the 30% commitment could be a ""huge step towards addressing the crisis our wildlife is facing"". ""However, targets on paper won't be enough,"" he said. ""Those set a decade ago failed because they weren't backed up by action."" Mr Harper said the pledge must be put into domestic law ""as part of a suite of goals to restore the abundance and diversity of our wildlife, in every country in the UK"". Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said it was a ""good start"" but ""a much greater level of urgent action"" was needed to put nature into recovery, including rescuing wildlife sites currently in decline. He said many National Parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty were ""severely depleted of wildlife because of overgrazing, poor management or intensive agricultural practices"", while around half of sites of special scientific interest were ""in a poor state and suffering wildlife declines"".

Swiss firmly reject end to free movement with EU,"Opponents of the proposal argued it would damage relations with the EU and hurt trade Swiss voters have rejected a proposal to end an accord with the EU allowing the free movement of people. With all referendum votes counted, nearly 62% said they wanted to keep free movement, while 38% were against. Switzerland is not a member of the EU but has a series of interdependent treaties with Brussels which allow it to access to Europe's free trade area. The move to rein in immigration was proposed by the Swiss People's Party (SVP), but opposed by the government. A similar initiative to introduce quotas on immigrants from the EU to Switzerland narrowly passed in a 2014 referendum, damaging Swiss-EU relations. Swiss people are given a direct say in their own affairs under the country's system of direct democracy. They are regularly invited to vote on various issues in national or regional referendums. The Swiss free movement vote explained How the migrant crisis changed Europe Supporters of the anti-free movement plan said it would allow Switzerland to control its borders and select only the immigrants it wants. Opponents argued it would plunge a healthy economy into recession at an uncertain time and deprive hundreds of thousands of Swiss citizens of their freedom to live and work across Europe. The push to scrap the freedom of movement deal comes from the right-wing Swiss People's Party A landlocked country that has observed neutrality for centuries, Switzerland has over time veered between seeking closer engagement with the EU, and preferring a more isolationist course. Sunday's referendum could have forced the Swiss government to unilaterally void its free movement agreement with the EU by invoking a so-called guillotine clause. This clause would have impacted other bilateral deals on transport, research and trade with the EU, disrupting economic activity. The president of the right-wing SVP, Marco Chiesa, conceded that his campaign had struggled to garner enough support for a proposal which was opposed by the government, parliament and tradio unions. Given that opposition, Mr Chiesa framed the campaign as a ""fight between David and Goliath"". ""But we will continue to fight for the country and take back control of immigration,"" he said. SVP President Marco Chiesa admitted the proposal failed to gain traction Opponents of the proposal said the result was an expression of Swiss support for open, bilateral relations with the EU. They said voters were worried about the economic cost of ending free movement during the coronavirus pandemic. ""The bilateral path is the right one for Switzerland and for the EU,"" Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter told reporters. ""The Swiss people have confirmed this path again today"". ""Today is a great day for the relations between the European Union and Switzerland,"" tweeted European Council President Charles Michel. ""The Swiss people have spoken & sent a clear message: together we have a great future ahead of us."" Analysis by Imogen Foulkes,BBC News Geneva correspondent Swiss voters have said a convincing ""no"" to ending free movement of people with the EU. The People's Party argued that immigration from Europe was to blame for a rising population, and placed an unsustainable burden on Switzerland's public services, and environment. In the past, the party has done well with anti-immigration campaigns, but not this time. The economic consequences were clear. Some 60% of Swiss exports go to Europe, for example. Moreover, half a million Swiss live and work in the EU, and 1.4 million EU citizens work in Switzerland, many in the health service. Ending free movement would have put the entire relationship with Europe at risk. Brussels has always told the Swiss they cannot cherry pick: no free trade without free movement. Today, Swiss voters have shown they think that deal is reasonable. A referendum on paternity leave for new fathers was among the other issues on Sunday's ballot. The initiative was backed by a majority of voters, heralding a major change in Switzerland, a country seen as lagging behind its European neighbours on parental leave provision. Under the proposal, fathers will for the first time be granted two weeks of paid leave within six months of the birth of a child. They will also be entitled to receive 80% of their salary, up to a ceiling of 196 Swiss francs (Â£165; $210) per day. In addition, voters narrowly approved a government plan to buy new fighter jets, and blocked a revision of Switzerland's hunting law which would have made it easier to cull protected species such as wolves. The Swiss referendum was already being prepared before the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016. The SVP - the biggest party in Switzerland's parliament - has used similar arguments to Brexiteers about the benefits of having more control over immigration. But net migration into Switzerland is actually falling at the moment, and there is a sense voters are becoming weary of the party's anti-immigration message. The strong vote in favour of free movement could strengthen Brussels' hand with London, and be a signal to the UK of just what kinds of compromises might be needed to agree a free trade deal with the EU. 1992:Swiss vote by 50.3% to 49.7% against joining European Economic Area 1992-2002:Switzerland negotiates, then signs first bilateral agreements with EU - they are interdependent, and include free movement of people - backed by a vote in 2000 2005:Swiss vote to join Europe's Schengen open borders treaty and extend free movement to 10 new EU states 2009:Vote to extend freedom of movement to new EU members Romania and Bulgaria 2014:Swiss narrowly back quotas on EU workers No quotas in Swiss immigration bill Will the Swiss limit EU immigration?

"Three more Welsh counties face local lockdownNeath Port Talbot, Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan will all have extra restrictions imposed on Monday.Wales","Barry Island is one of the major tourist attractions in the Vale of Glamorgan Three more counties are to be placed under local lockdowns on Monday, the Welsh Government has announced. Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan will have tighter Covid-19 restrictions from 18:00 BST on Monday. It means half of Wales' 22 local authority areas will be under local lockdowns, after rules came into force in Cardiff and Swansea on Sunday. Almost two million people in Wales - two-thirds of the population - will be under local lockdowns. Vale of Glamorgan council leader Neil Moore said it had not been an easy decision but pointed to the rate of infection rising to 34.4 people per 100,000 in the county borough. Cardiff and Swansea get ready for lockdown Covid cases increase by 362 in Wales ""We have taken a decision today for early and preventative action,"" he said. ""One of the main reasons for this is that the sooner we stop the increase in transmission, the sooner the restrictions can be lifted. ""We must now all work together to make that possible."" Blaenau Gwent on 202 per 100,000 and Merthyr Tydfil at 169 per 100,000 currently have the highest rates of infection. Neath Port Talbot will go into lockdown, meaning counties along the M4 corridor from Newport to Swansea will be under restrictions Neath Port Talbot council leader Rob Jones said: ""These restrictions are being imposed to protect public health, to protect you and your loved ones, and to stop people dying. ""Rates are much higher in local authority areas which border our county borough but we are now seeing rising rates here in Neath Port Talbot. ""We need the help of everyone across Neath Port Talbot to prevent the increasing spread of coronavirus and to bring the infection rates back down."" Mr Jones also urged people against panic buying, adding: ""There is no need to be concerned about stocks running low."" Torfaen council leader Anthony Hunt said: ""I know the introduction of restrictions is always a difficult decision, but it is a decision I support in order to protect people's health and to try and break the chain of transmission in Torfaen and stop the situation from getting worse. ""We have already seen this strategy work effectively in Caerphilly and Newport where numbers have dropped dramatically due to people adhering to the new rules."" Cwmbran is one of the towns which will be affected by restrictions in Torfaen Welsh local lockdown rules mean extended households must end and people are not allowed to leave or enter the council boundaries without a reasonable excuse. People are allowed to travel outside the area for a limited number of reasons. These include going to work if they are not able to work from home, to go to school, give care, or buy food or medical supplies. Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil, Newport and Rhondda Cynon Taf were already under lockdown, while Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, became the first town to have restrictions imposed which do not apply to the wider county. Cardiff and Swansea both went into lockdown at 18:00 BST on Sunday. Eleven council areas and one town in Wales will be subject to extra restrictions from Monday night From Monday evening, almost 1.9m of Wales' 3.1m people will be subject to local coronavirus rules. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""We are now taking further action and placing three more areas under local restrictions in south Wales - Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen, and the Vale of Glamorgan - because we are seeing rising rates in these three areas. These areas also share borders with local authority areas where rates are much higher. ""Introducing restrictions in any parts of Wales is always an incredibly difficult decision for us to make. But we're acting to protect people's health and to try and break the chain of transmission and stop the situation from getting worse. ""This is not a regional lockdown - this is a series of local restrictions in each local authority area to respond to a specific rise in cases in each area, which have distinct and unique chains of transmission."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said: ""The first minister might not want it to be described as a 'regional lockdown' but with two million people in the south Wales corridor now under some form of restrictions that's unfortunately what it is."" He called for a more targeted approach - ""local not regional"" - and said there needed to be urgent financial support for businesses affected. Meanwhile Mr Drakeford said a meeting would take place next week with leaders of councils in north Wales, where he said the position ""continues to be mixed"". ""If we need to take action, we will, but the position isn't as clear there yet as it has been in the south and I want to make sure that we look at it with the detail it deserves,"" he added.

Armenia and Azerbaijan battle over disputed region,"This video can not be played Tanks ablaze as fighting erupts over disputed region One of the world's oldest conflicts, a territorial dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, has re-erupted with the heaviest clashes in years. At least 23 people were reported to have been killed on Sunday as the two ex-Soviet republics battled over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The region is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but controlled by ethnic Armenians. When it broke away in the early 1990s, tens of thousands died in fighting. Learn more about Nagorno-Karabakh Armenia country profile Azerbaijan country profile Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on Sunday he was confident of regaining control over the region. Martial law has been declared amid the violence in some parts of Azerbaijan, as well as in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia announced full mobilisation The conflict in the Caucasus Mountains has remained unresolved for more than three decades, with periodic bouts of fighting. Border clashes in July killed at least 16 people, promptingthe largest demonstration in yearsin the Azerbaijani capital Baku, where there were calls for the region's recapture. Any upsurge in violence could unsettle markets as the South Caucasus is a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and natural gas from the Caspian Sea to world markets. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged support for Azerbaijan, urging the world to stand with the country in its ""battle against invasion and cruelty"". Azerbaijanis are a predominantly Turkic people with whom Turkey has close ties. Russia, traditionally seen as an ally of Armenia, called for an immediate ceasefire and talks to stabilise the situation. In other reaction: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""extremely concerned"" over and called for both sides to stop fighting France, which has a large Armenian community, called for an immediate ceasefire and dialogue Iran, which borders both Azerbaijan and Armenia, offered to broker peace talks President Donald Trump said the US was seeking to stop the violence By Rayhan Demytrie, BBC Caucasus correspondent Sunday's fighting with the use of heavy weaponry along the line of control is the most serious escalation in recent years. It is common in this decades-long conflict for both sides to accuse the other of firing the first shots and what we are seeing is not just military action but also an information war. It is difficult to independently verify official information. Azerbaijan's claim to have ""liberated"" territory controlled by Armenians has been denied by the Armenian authorities. Similarly, Armenia's claims to have inflicted heavy losses on Azerbaijani forces have been dismissed by Baku. Moreover, the Azerbaijani authorities have restricted internet use inside the country, in particular access to social media. Turkey's emphatic support may embolden Azerbaijan. Back in August, the Azerbaijani defence minister said that with the help of the Turkish military Azerbaijan would fulfil its ""sacred duty"" - in other words, take back its lost territories. Armenia's defence ministry said an attack on civilian settlements in Nagorno-Karabakh, including the regional capital Stepanakert, began on Sunday morning. The separatist authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said 18 people were killed - 16 of their troops, a woman and a child - and 100 wounded. Azerbaijan said five members of the same family were killed by Armenian shelling. Azerbaijan released images of what it said were damaged Armenian armoured vehicles Armenia's governmentdeclared martial law and total military mobilisation,external, shortly after a similar announcement by the authorities inside Nagorno-Karabakh. Martial law is an emergency measure under which the military takes over the authority and functions of the civilian government. ""Get ready to defend our sacred homeland,"" Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said after accusing Azerbaijan of ""planned aggression"". Warning that the region was on the brink of a ""large-scale war"", he urged the international community to unite to prevent any further destabilisation. Armenia said it had shot down two helicopters and three drones, and destroyed three tanks during Sunday's clashes. Azerbaijan's defence ministry confirmed the loss of one helicopter but said the crew had survived, and reported that 12 Armenian air defence systems had been destroyed. It denied other losses reported by Armenia. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev went on TV President Aliyev said he had ordered a large-scale counter-offensive operation in response to Armenian army attacks.

Dowden offers hope for smaller football clubs,"This video can not be played How long can football clubs survive without the return of fans in the stadium? A deal for the Premier League to support lower-league clubs during the coronavirus pandemic ""could be reached this coming week"". Plans for some fans toreturn to stadiums from 1 Octoberwill not go ahead because of the rising number of coronavirus cases, and it is feared the postponement could have a""devastating"" impact on clubs. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told the Andrew Marr Show that England's top flight needs to ""start looking after the football family as a whole"". He added that he was hopeful an agreement could be made over the coming days. ""I've been in touch with the Premier League a lot over the past few days. They are working closely with the EFL (English Football League) to see how they can support them,"" said Dowden. ""The prime minister and I have been clear: the Premier League needs to start looking after the football family as a whole, and indeed they are having productive conversations. ""I am hopeful that they will reach a deal this coming week in relation to that, and then beyond that, look across at all sports."" Premier League awaits EFL Â£250m coronavirus 'bailout' proposals The fan pilot programme, which had already been restricted to 1,000 people per game in September, has been paused. Dowden said there had been no positive cases from pilots that had already taken place but, under advice from the chief scientific adviser and the chief medical officer, ""it would not be wise to undertake any further easements"". ""It's not just in the stadium, it's the journey to and from the stadium as well. At each of those points there are chances for further social interaction and risk of virus spreads, so right now is not the time to do it,"" he added. Dowden added that the Premier League ""appreciates"" its help is needed to support EFL clubs and that he is confident an agreement will soon be reached. In response, Huddersfield Town chief executive Mark Devlin posted on social media: ""But Mr Dowden, irrespective of Premier League support, you need to let us start welcoming back fans and business partners into a safe stadia environment. ""So much work had been done on making our stadia as Covid safe as possible, you now need to let us all get on with it."" It is not yet known when fans will be able to return, with existing government restrictions likely to remain in place for six months. But Dowden said the government was working with clubs and medical advisers to seek ""further innovations"" to decrease risks. ""We are continuing to explore what would be the ideal solution in the absence of a vaccine, which would be if you have large amount of in-day testing to give people a so-called freedom pass to be able to go into those stadiums,"" he said. ""We are exploring that. We are exploring further technological innovations. But we are also looking at how we can support the clubs through this difficult period."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone The BBC was told earlier this month the EFL expected to be given details by the Premier League about what financial assistance it might offer by the end of September. While the Premier League will continue advancing solidarity payments earlier than normal, BBC Sport understands that, while accepting the need for speed and to be flexible in its approach, it is not completely clear what the EFL is asking for beyond a Â£250m 'bailout'. BBC Sport has been told the Premier League needs detailed analysis of what money is needed, for whom and precisely why. Without this, the organisation is reluctant to hand over a cheque at a time when its clubs are feeling huge financial pressure given they are losing the most in terms of fans being absent from stadiums. Respected football finance blogger Swiss Ramble posted on Thursday that the combined losses of Premier League clubs through the absence of matchday income would be at least Â£830m if no fans were allowed into stadiums for the remainder of the 2020-21 season. That figure is regarded as a minimum as it does not take into account sums paid by fans buying merchandise on a matchday because that is calculated in a different revenue stream.

Sharp Covid-19 infections spike in Scottish teensInfections in 15-19 year olds account for more than 40% of new cases as student outbreaks grow.,"More than 1,000 students across Scotland are now believed to be in self-isolation in halls of residence The Covid-19 outbreak in Scotland is now being driven by infections among teenagers, figures show. More than 43% of the positive cases detected on Thursday were in the 15-19 age group, according todata published by Public Health Scotland,external. Infection rates in this age group were stable throughout the summer, but began to rise sharply from mid-September. Public health teams are dealing with several outbreaks among students living in shared accommodation. The largest outbreak is at the University of Glasgow, where172 students have tested positive. There are also clusters of cases among students in Dundee, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. More than 1,000 students across the country are now believed to be self-isolating. The Scottish government reported 344 new positive cases on Sunday, down from a rise of 714 on Saturday. One further death following a positive test was registered and the number of people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19 increased by six. Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? What do campus Covid outbreaks mean for students? Scottish students: 'Why have they sent us here?' On 24 September, 43.3% of infections were in the 15-19 age group, with 18.7% in 25 to 44 year olds and 17.2% in 20 to 24 year olds. Positive cases among the oldest age groups remain very low. Although the 15-19 range will include infections in school-age children as well, it is likely most positive cases are at the upper end of the group - many of whomstarted university two weeks ago. Tessa Mairi Morrison, a Glasgow University fresher student who tested positive, said morale among her flatmates was low. ""Four of us have been tested positive, two people have been tested negative and the rest haven't been tested,"" she told theBBC's Politics Scotland show. ""And we can't social distance in the flat either, it's impossible. We've got a small kitchen and there's 11 of us cooking at the one time. ""So the people who don't have coronavirus are going to get it."" Tessa Mairi Morrison: ""Impossible"" to social distance in a student flat Ms Morrison said she believed it was a ""mistake"" to put people into halls of residence. ""Maybe they should have tested everyone beforehand, before putting us into halls, or strictly containing it in halls without spreading it to the rest of Glasgow - or even putting us in halls in December, because this is a bit of a nightmare,"" she added. Students are banned from returning home under Scottish Covid-19 regulations because they are deemed to have formed a new household with the people they are now living with. Since 1 August, the infection rates in younger age groups have been higher, with rates in the over-65s very low. The highest rate has generally been in the 20-24 age group, but there was a significant change in mid-September. The chart illustrates this by taking the average number of infections from the previous seven days and dividing it by the population of the age group. On 24 September, the rate per 100,000 in the 15-19 age group stood at 48.7. The rate for the next highest group (20-24 year olds) was 18.5. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government's advice to all students was to stay in their halls of residence ""if they are able to do so"". ""That's to ensure that we minimise the spread of the virus around the country,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""It's important that any student who is self-isolating - or students in general who are in halls in the situation that they are facing - are given the full and proper support of the university or the college that is supporting them.

Bank of England policymaker defends negative rates,"A Bank of England (BoE) policymaker has defended the potential use of negative interest rates, which could take the cost of borrowing below zero. Silvana Tenreyro told the Sunday Telegraph that evidence from other countries was ""encouraging"". On Tuesday, the BoE governor played down the prospect of taking rates below zero, insisting it just needed to make sure it could do so if needed. The Bank has so far responded to the pandemic by cutting rates to just 0.1%. If interest rates are negative, the BoE charges for any deposits it holds on behalf of the banks. That encourages banks to lend the money to business rather than deposit it. In an interview with the newspaper, Ms Tenreyro - an external member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee - said that evidence from other European countries and Japan suggested that negative interest rates had succeeded in cutting firms' borrowing costs and that banks would cope with the extra pressure on their finances, despite coronavirus. The term ""interest rates"" is often used interchangeably with the Bank of England base rate. Described as the ""single most important interest rate in the UK"", the base rate determines how much interest the Bank of England pays to financial institutions that hold money with it, and what it charges them to borrow. High Street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers, as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage. The Bank of England usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less. In theory, taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect. But in practice, it's a bit more complicated. Read more about how negative interest rates work here. ""There has been almost full pass-through of negative rates into lending rates in most countries,"" Ms Tenreyro said. She added that ""banks adapted well"" and that their profitability had increased where the policy had been introduced. But earlier this week, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey played down the idea of taking rates below zero in the near future, and described the experience of other countries as a ""mixed bag"". Mr Bailey said on Tuesday: ""It would be a cardinal sin in my view if we said we had a tool in the box which we didn't think could be operationally used. ""Yes it's in the tool bag, but that doesn't mean we're going to use negative rates,"" he added. Rising virus rates threaten economy, warns Bank Speedy return to workplace 'not possible' The Bank said in August that it was taking a closer look at the case for cutting interest rates even further. In September it also said that it would take a detailed look at how negatives interest rates might work in practice during the last three months of the year. It has already cut interest rates to 0.1%, a record low, and pumped billions of pounds into the UK economy in a bid to fight the coronavirus-induced downturn. Ms Tenreyro also said that the potential for more local lockdowns could, however, slow down or ""interrupt"" the UK's economic recovery. She suggested it will be shaped like an ""interrupted, incomplete V"", at odds with other more upbeat forecasts. Speaking on a British Chambers of Commerce web conference on Tuesday, Mr Bailey also urged caution over the ""hard yards ahead"" as the UK faces a rising number of Covid-19 infections. He said: ""The latest news, that we are seeing a very unfortunate, faster return of Covid-19, is extremely difficult news for all of us and the whole country. ""That does reinforce the downside risks we have in our forecasts. ""The Bank of England will do everything we can within our remit and powers to support the businesses and people of this country.""

Cardiff and Swansea get ready for local lockdown,"Restrictions will now apply in Wales' capital city Wales' two biggest cities have gone into lockdown, which started at 18:00. The changed status of Swansea and Cardiff took the number of Welsh local authority areas under heightened Covid restrictions to eight. It follows the first localised lockdown in Wales, in the town of Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, which came into force on Saturday evening. It means 1.5 million people - about half of Wales' population -are now under lockdown. Earlier on Sunday, it was confirmed that three other council areas -Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen and the Vale of Glamorgan- will face the same measures from 18:00 BST on Monday. The restrictions are the same as those affecting people living in Merthyr Tydfil, Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent, Newport, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly, which were already in lockdown. When asked if Wales could see a national lockdown, First Minister Mark Drakeford told the BBC'sPolitics Walesprogramme: ""We couldn't possibly rule it out. ""We're trying to do it in a way that balances both the health and the economic needs of Wales,"" he said. Swansea hit a seven-day rate of 56 new cases of coronavirus per 100,000 on Friday, while Cardiff reached 38 cases per 100,000. Wales' first town-only lockdown takes effect Lockdowns for Cardiff, Swansea and Llanelli But the number in Llanelli was 152 cases per 100,000 - which is why the Welsh Government decided to bring in restrictions there a day earlier. The whole of Carmarthenshire was not put into lockdown because the rate in the rest of the local authority area was 18. Llanelli town is in the top three places with the highest weekly infections rates, alongside Blaenau Gwent on 202 per 100,000 and Merthyr Tydfil at 169 per 100,000. Rhossili and other Gower beauty spots are out of bounds for anyone from outside Swansea Under the rules, nobody is able to enter or leave the affected areas without a ""reasonable excuse"". People are allowed to travel outside their area for a limited number of reasons. These include going to work if they are not able to work from home, to go to school, give care and buy food or medical supplies. How are the rules affecting you?

Swiss 'firmly reject end to free movement with EU',"Opponents of the proposal argued it would damage relations with the EU and hurt trade Swiss voters have rejected a proposal to end an accord with the EU allowing the free movement of people. With all referendum votes counted, nearly 62% said they wanted to keep free movement, while 38% were against. Switzerland is not a member of the EU but has a series of interdependent treaties with Brussels which allow it to access to Europe's free trade area. The move to rein in immigration was proposed by the Swiss People's Party (SVP), but opposed by the government. A similar initiative to introduce quotas on immigrants from the EU to Switzerland narrowly passed in a 2014 referendum, damaging Swiss-EU relations. Swiss people are given a direct say in their own affairs under the country's system of direct democracy. They are regularly invited to vote on various issues in national or regional referendums. The Swiss free movement vote explained How the migrant crisis changed Europe Supporters of the anti-free movement plan said it would allow Switzerland to control its borders and select only the immigrants it wants. Opponents argued it would plunge a healthy economy into recession at an uncertain time and deprive hundreds of thousands of Swiss citizens of their freedom to live and work across Europe. The push to scrap the freedom of movement deal comes from the right-wing Swiss People's Party A landlocked country that has observed neutrality for centuries, Switzerland has over time veered between seeking closer engagement with the EU, and preferring a more isolationist course. Sunday's referendum could have forced the Swiss government to unilaterally void its free movement agreement with the EU by invoking a so-called guillotine clause. This clause would have impacted other bilateral deals on transport, research and trade with the EU, disrupting economic activity. The president of the right-wing SVP, Marco Chiesa, conceded that his campaign had struggled to garner enough support for a proposal which was opposed by the government, parliament and tradio unions. Given that opposition, Mr Chiesa framed the campaign as a ""fight between David and Goliath"". ""But we will continue to fight for the country and take back control of immigration,"" he said. SVP President Marco Chiesa admitted the proposal failed to gain traction Opponents of the proposal said the result was an expression of Swiss support for open, bilateral relations with the EU. They said voters were worried about the economic cost of ending free movement during the coronavirus pandemic. ""The bilateral path is the right one for Switzerland and for the EU,"" Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter told reporters. ""The Swiss people have confirmed this path again today"". ""Today is a great day for the relations between the European Union and Switzerland,"" tweeted European Council President Charles Michel. ""The Swiss people have spoken & sent a clear message: together we have a great future ahead of us."" Analysis by Imogen Foulkes,BBC News Geneva correspondent Swiss voters have said a convincing ""no"" to ending free movement of people with the EU. The People's Party argued that immigration from Europe was to blame for a rising population, and placed an unsustainable burden on Switzerland's public services, and environment. In the past, the party has done well with anti-immigration campaigns, but not this time. The economic consequences were clear. Some 60% of Swiss exports go to Europe, for example. Moreover, half a million Swiss live and work in the EU, and 1.4 million EU citizens work in Switzerland, many in the health service. Ending free movement would have put the entire relationship with Europe at risk. Brussels has always told the Swiss they cannot cherry pick: no free trade without free movement. Today, Swiss voters have shown they think that deal is reasonable. A referendum on paternity leave for new fathers was among the other issues on Sunday's ballot. The initiative was backed by a majority of voters, heralding a major change in Switzerland, a country seen as lagging behind its European neighbours on parental leave provision. Under the proposal, fathers will for the first time be granted two weeks of paid leave within six months of the birth of a child. They will also be entitled to receive 80% of their salary, up to a ceiling of 196 Swiss francs (Â£165; $210) per day. In addition, voters narrowly approved a government plan to buy new fighter jets, and blocked a revision of Switzerland's hunting law which would have made it easier to cull protected species such as wolves. The Swiss referendum was already being prepared before the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016. The SVP - the biggest party in Switzerland's parliament - has used similar arguments to Brexiteers about the benefits of having more control over immigration. But net migration into Switzerland is actually falling at the moment, and there is a sense voters are becoming weary of the party's anti-immigration message. The strong vote in favour of free movement could strengthen Brussels' hand with London, and be a signal to the UK of just what kinds of compromises might be needed to agree a free trade deal with the EU. 1992:Swiss vote by 50.3% to 49.7% against joining European Economic Area 1992-2002:Switzerland negotiates, then signs first bilateral agreements with EU - they are interdependent, and include free movement of people - backed by a vote in 2000 2005:Swiss vote to join Europe's Schengen open borders treaty and extend free movement to 10 new EU states 2009:Vote to extend freedom of movement to new EU members Romania and Bulgaria 2014:Swiss narrowly back quotas on EU workers No quotas in Swiss immigration bill Will the Swiss limit EU immigration?

'Explosion' during fatal police shooting searches,"Matt Ratana moved to the UK in 1989 and joined the Met Police two years later Police investigating the fatal shooting of a police officer in south London say four crime scenes are being searched. Sgt Matiu Ratana, from New Zealand, died in hospital on Friday after being shot in Croydon as a handcuffed suspect was being taken into custody. Residents near one of the search areas reported hearing a loud explosion as a 23-year-old suspect, who is thought to have shot himself, remains in hospital. The Met commissioner said 54-year-old Sgt Ratana would be ""sorely missed"". Speaking at the National Police Memorial in central London, Dame Cressida Dick said she ""hadn't been surprised at all"" by the number of tributes paid to him. London's mayor, the Met Police's commissioner and the home secretary laid wreaths ""Matt was an extraordinary person... He had a wonderful personality and he was very good at his job,"" she said, adding that he was also a ""proud kiwi"". The commissioner also laid a wreath at the National Police Memorial in central London alongside Home Secretary Priti Patel and London's Mayor Sadiq Khan. Sgt Ratana will be remembered at theNational Police Memorial Day,externalService, alongside the six other officers who have died on duty in the past 12 months. The Reverend Cannon David Wilbraham, who is leading the service - taking place online this year - said the event will show their ""sacrifice is not forgotten""  and allow the public ""to recognise the dedication to duty and the courage displayed"". Respects were paid at East Grinstead Rugby Club during two separate minute's silence Silences have also been held at a number of rugby clubs, including at East Grinstead where the 54-year-old was head coach. The West Sussex club's Vice Chairman Matt Marriot said they had to arrange two separate minute's silences because the ""interest has been pretty enormous"", with ""people coming from all over the country"". He said Sgt Ratana ""wasn't just our coach... he was a role model, a mentor and often a father figure"". ""We're going to mourn him as a family member,"" he added. PC Sarah D'Silva, who plays for the club's women's team as well as working at Croydon Police Station, said it felt ""extremely poignant"" joining the minute's silence. She wore her police uniform to pay her respects to the 54-year-old, who she described as ""an absolutely fantastic character, full of life, with the biggest smile you've ever seen"". The 54-year-old was a keen rugby union coach as well as being a fan of performance motorcycles and weight-training Sgt Ratana was shot in the chest at Croydon Custody Centre at about 02:15 BST on Friday. On Saturday evening, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy said the police were focusing on four crime scenes. Residents near one of the search areas, in Banstead, Surrey, reported hearing a loud explosion on Saturday morning. People living near the address in Park Road were woken by noises at about 05:40 BST. Police guarded the entrance to a property on Park Road in Banstead The BBC's Daniel De Simone said the Banstead address is down a long driveway and its land contains a series of concrete bunkers. Multiple police officers, including armed officers, were visible in the area and people had been informed that a controlled explosion had taken place, the BBC was told. A marked police car has been guarding the entrance to the property. Police confirmed the other scenes undergoing searches are Croydon Custody Centre, where the shooting occurred, an area of London Road in Pollards Hill, where the suspect was initially arrested, and an address in Southbrook Road, Norbury. Describing how the investigation was progressing, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cundy said: ""We have recovered the gun from the custody suite where Matt was shot. ""We also have CCTV from that custody suite which shows the events, and we have body-worn video of our police officers who were involved in the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the suspect."" The murder investigation is expected to focus on the motive for the killing. The suspect remains in a critical condition is hospital. A rugby ball and police helmet are among the tributes which have been left outside the custody centre The suspect had initially been arrested for an alleged drugs offence and possession of ammunition. The shots were fired as officers prepared to search the suspect - who was still handcuffed - with a metal detector, according to watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). ""Several crime scenes"" were established on Friday and a cordon also remains in place around the Anderson Heights building in Norbury, south-west London, the Met has said. A concierge in the building told the BBC the 23-year-old suspect did not live in the block but was arrested outside it. An area of London Road in Pollards Hill has been searched by forensic officers The Met previously said the shooting was not terror-related. It is believed the suspect was known to counter-terrorism police and his background may feature prominently in police inquiries, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. The suspect had been referred to the anti-extremism government's Prevent programme, aimed to stop people joining extremist groups and carrying out terrorist activities. As part of the IOPC investigation it is examining CCTV and police bodycam footage to establish how the shootings took place. The watchdog said the suspect was in handcuffs, with his hands behind his back. A key part of that IOPC investigation will be to find out how thoroughly the suspect was searched before he was taken into custody. The Met's chief said Sgt Ratana was ""highly respected"" among her officers Sgt Ratana came to the UK in his early 20s in 1989 and joined the Met Police two years later. He was originally from the Hawke's Bay area of New Zealand and was educated at Palmerston North Boys' High School, north of the capital, Wellington. Sgt Ratana, who had a partner and an adult son from a previous relationship, would have been eligible for retirement in two months. Mourners pay tribute Boris Johnson was among those who paid tribute to the officer, tweeting: ""My deepest condolences go to the family, friends and colleagues of the police officer who was killed in Croydon last night. ""We owe a huge debt to those who risk their own lives to keep us safe."" This video can not be played Dame Cressida Dick paid tribute to Sgt Ratana, saying he was ""big in stature, big in heart"" New Zealand PM Ms Ardern previously released a statement saying: ""To all Matiu's whanau (Maori for extended family) across the world, we share your sorrow and have all our condolences."" New Zealand Police - where Sgt Ratana worked between 2003 and 2008 before returning to the UK - also sent their condolences, adding: ""Policing is a family."" Tributes including a police helmet were laid at East Grinstead Rugby Club When he was not working, Sgt Ratana was heavily involved in rugby coaching. England Rugbypaid tribute,externalto the 54-year-old, saying he ""gave so much for our sport"". Crystal Palace Football Club held a minute's silence before their match against Everton on Saturday, to ""pay our respects to local police officer Sgt Matt Ratana"". A minute's silence was also held before the London derby between Millwall and Brentford. A minute's silence was held before Crystal Palace's match against Everton Neil Donohue, a friend of Sgt Ratana who runs a gym he used to attend, described him as ""inspirational"" and ""the nicest, most generous man you could meet"". He told the BBC the 54-year-old had gone into ""the custody side [of policing] purely because he had had enough out on the streets and he thought it was his safest option, just to see him through to his retirement"". ""It's just absolutely tragic,"" he said.

Azerbaijan and Armenia clash over disputed region,"This video can not be played Tanks ablaze as fighting erupts over disputed region One of the world's oldest conflicts, a territorial dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, has re-erupted with the heaviest clashes in years. At least 23 people were reported to have been killed on Sunday as the two ex-Soviet republics battled over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The region is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but controlled by ethnic Armenians. When it broke away in the early 1990s, tens of thousands died in fighting. Learn more about Nagorno-Karabakh Armenia country profile Azerbaijan country profile Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on Sunday he was confident of regaining control over the region. Martial law has been declared amid the violence in some parts of Azerbaijan, as well as in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia announced full mobilisation The conflict in the Caucasus Mountains has remained unresolved for more than three decades, with periodic bouts of fighting. Border clashes in July killed at least 16 people, promptingthe largest demonstration in yearsin the Azerbaijani capital Baku, where there were calls for the region's recapture. Any upsurge in violence could unsettle markets as the South Caucasus is a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and natural gas from the Caspian Sea to world markets. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged support for Azerbaijan, urging the world to stand with the country in its ""battle against invasion and cruelty"". Azerbaijanis are a predominantly Turkic people with whom Turkey has close ties. Russia, traditionally seen as an ally of Armenia, called for an immediate ceasefire and talks to stabilise the situation. In other reaction: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""extremely concerned"" over and called for both sides to stop fighting France, which has a large Armenian community, called for an immediate ceasefire and dialogue Iran, which borders both Azerbaijan and Armenia, offered to broker peace talks President Donald Trump said the US was seeking to stop the violence By Rayhan Demytrie, BBC Caucasus correspondent Sunday's fighting with the use of heavy weaponry along the line of control is the most serious escalation in recent years. It is common in this decades-long conflict for both sides to accuse the other of firing the first shots and what we are seeing is not just military action but also an information war. It is difficult to independently verify official information. Azerbaijan's claim to have ""liberated"" territory controlled by Armenians has been denied by the Armenian authorities. Similarly, Armenia's claims to have inflicted heavy losses on Azerbaijani forces have been dismissed by Baku. Moreover, the Azerbaijani authorities have restricted internet use inside the country, in particular access to social media. Turkey's emphatic support may embolden Azerbaijan. Back in August, the Azerbaijani defence minister said that with the help of the Turkish military Azerbaijan would fulfil its ""sacred duty"" - in other words, take back its lost territories. Armenia's defence ministry said an attack on civilian settlements in Nagorno-Karabakh, including the regional capital Stepanakert, began on Sunday morning. The separatist authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said 18 people were killed - 16 of their troops, a woman and a child - and 100 wounded. Azerbaijan said five members of the same family were killed by Armenian shelling. Azerbaijan released images of what it said were damaged Armenian armoured vehicles Armenia's governmentdeclared martial law and total military mobilisation,external, shortly after a similar announcement by the authorities inside Nagorno-Karabakh. Martial law is an emergency measure under which the military takes over the authority and functions of the civilian government. ""Get ready to defend our sacred homeland,"" Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said after accusing Azerbaijan of ""planned aggression"". Warning that the region was on the brink of a ""large-scale war"", he urged the international community to unite to prevent any further destabilisation. Armenia said it had shot down two helicopters and three drones, and destroyed three tanks during Sunday's clashes. Azerbaijan's defence ministry confirmed the loss of one helicopter but said the crew had survived, and reported that 12 Armenian air defence systems had been destroyed. It denied other losses reported by Armenia. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev went on TV President Aliyev said he had ordered a large-scale counter-offensive operation in response to Armenian army attacks. ""I am confident that our successful counter-offensive operation will put an end to the occupation, to the injustice, to the 30-year-long occupation,"" he said. After initial denials by the Armenian military, Nagorno-Karabakh's unrecognised president, Arayik Harutyunyan, confirmed some positions had been lost to Azerbaijani forces. A mountainous region of about 4,400 sq km (1,700 sq miles) Traditionally inhabited by Christian Armenians and Muslim Turks In Soviet times, it became an autonomous region within the republic of Azerbaijan Internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but majority of population is ethnic Armenian An estimated one million people displaced by 1990s war, and about 30,000 killed Separatist forces captured some extra territory around the enclave in Azerbaijan in the 1990s war Stalemate has largely prevailed since a 1994 ceasefire Russia has traditionally been seen as an ally of the Armenians Nagorno-Karabakh: BBC visits Azerbaijan's side of frontline Nagorno-Karabakh: Fighting mood grips Armenians Azerbaijan protests demand war after Armenia clash Nagorno-Karabakh: BBC visits Azerbaijan's side of frontline Nagorno-Karabakh: Fighting mood grips Armenians Toddler killed in shelling in Azerbaijan 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

Students 'scared and confused' as halls lock down,"NHS staff hand out test kits to students at Glasgow University, where there has been a Covid-19 outbreak Students have spoken of their worry and confusion at being locked down in their university halls, in a situation described by unions as ""shambolic"". Up to1,700 students at Manchester Metropolitan Universityand hundreds at other institutions, including in Edinburgh and Glasgow, are self-isolating following Covid-19 outbreaks. In Manchester, students are being prevented from leaving by security. Universities UK said the wellbeing of students was ""the first priority"". Robert Halfon, the conservative chairman of the Education Select Committee, said 3,000 students were in lockdown at universities from Dundee to Exeter. He called for the government and its scientific advisers to reassure students and families by setting out the policy for England - and warned having students in lockdown at Christmas would cause ""huge anguish"". Mr Halfon said universities should also consider discounts to students who were not being taught face-to-face. 'Donât scapegoat students over Covid outbreaks' Scottish students: 'Why have they sent us here?' Manchester Met said it had introduced a 14-day self-isolation period at its accommodation at Birley and Cambridge Halls after 127 students tested positive for the virus. Some students there said they were getting ready to go out on Friday night when they looked outside to see security guards and police, who told them they could not leave. First-year Joe Byrne said: ""We have had no warning, support or advice from the university about how we get food etc, and instead have been left completely in the dark and practically locked up against our will."" Megan Tingey said she was not contacted by the university about the lockdown before police turned up outside her Birley Vine accommodation. ""It was quite scary and confusing,"" she said. ""No one's really told us much and then the police turn up as well with security outside."" This video can not be played Student Joe Gallagher believes the outbreak was ""inevitable"" Another student, Ellie Jackson, told BBC News she had read about the halls lockdown in the local newspaper before receiving an email about it - and stressed the need for ""more guidance"" from the university. For Ellie, it is the second period of self-isolation she and her five housemates have had to undertake. ""My course is all online - I haven't even been into university,"" she said. ""I could have done this at home. I don't think it's worth the money at the moment."" In a statement, Manchester Met said it had communicated with students ""as soon as we could but it was not possible to give significant advanced notice due to the requirement to implement the isolation almost immediately"". ""The communications we sent included details about how to access food and other provisions and we have been working with other partners, including local supermarkets, throughout the day to provide additional support,"" the statement said. ""Our security teams will increase patrols to support the lockdown and we will take disciplinary action against any students found to have breached requirements."" Students in some halls are confined to their flats at Manchester Metropolitan University Meanwhile, students across all of Scotland have been told not togo to pubs, parties or restaurants over the weekendand Universities Scotland has said students who socialise with anyone outside of their householdrisk losing their place at university,external. Hundreds of students are isolating at Glasgow University because of two coronavirus clusters. The university said itwould offer a four-week rent rebateto all students in university residences in recognition of the ""difficult circumstances"" under which they were living. It said those students would also be given Â£50 each to spend on food and it would invite local mobile food outlets to come to residences. A mobile testing unit has been set up at Murano Street Student Village in Glasgow Reese Chamberlain, an international student at the University of Edinburgh, said his entire block at Holland House was ""locked down"" after a student tested positive. ""The situation is dire,"" he said. ""I already self-isolated when I arrived here and even then it was so difficult getting basic supplies."" He said there had been an ""exodus of students"" during the night on Friday, with more than 50 leaving the building. A spokesperson for the university said it was ""not asking for whole halls of student accommodation to self-isolate"" but there were currently ""a small number of positive cases"" and the university was providing care and support to those self-isolating. A sign reading ""students not criminals"" was displayed at Murano Street Student Village in Glasgow University and College Union general secretary Jo Grady described the lockdown at Manchester Met as ""the latest catastrophe in a week where wholly predictable - and predicted - Covid outbreaks have caused havoc"". There was ""no point encouraging students to come to university to self-isolate for a fortnight"", she added. And the National Union of Students (NUS) said students should be able to return to their families because being ""trapped"" in university accommodation would only add to their anxiety at an already difficult time. It called for universities to support students with food deliveries and provide access to mental health services. ""We must remember this is happening because the government and universities told students to return to campus and this shambolic situation now demands flexibility,"" the union said. Students ""must be able to leave rental contracts, access online learning or defer, and do what it takes to prioritise their safety"", the statement added. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? The Department for Education said the government was working closely with universities in England to ensure they were prepared for the return of students. A spokesman said: ""Students should follow the latest health advice, just like the wider public, which means they should stay at university in the event that they have symptoms; have to isolate; there are additional restrictions imposed locally; or there is an outbreak on campus or in their accommodation."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said students were ""not to blame"" for coronavirus outbreaks but backed universities taking disciplinary action as a ""last resort"" against those who broke the rules. Universities UK, which represents 139 institutions, said the health andâ¯wellbeingâ¯ofâ¯students, staff and local communities was the first priority for universities, which would continue to follow government guidance.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged support for Azerbaijan, urging the world to stand with the country in its ""battle against invasion and cruelty"". Azerbaijanis are a predominantly Turkic people with whom Turkey has close ties. Russia, traditionally seen as an ally of Armenia, called for an immediate ceasefire and talks to stabilise the situation. In other reaction: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""extremely concerned"" over and called for both sides to stop fighting France, which has a large Armenian community, called for an immediate ceasefire and dialogue Iran, which borders both Azerbaijan and Armenia, offered to broker peace talks President Donald Trump said the US was seeking to stop the violence By Rayhan Demytrie, BBC Caucasus correspondent Sunday's fighting with the use of heavy weaponry along the line of control is the most serious escalation in recent years. It is common in this decades-long conflict for both sides to accuse the other of firing the first shots and what we are seeing is not just military action but also an information war. It is difficult to independently verify official information. Azerbaijan's claim to have ""liberated"" territory controlled by Armenians has been denied by the Armenian authorities. Similarly, Armenia's claims to have inflicted heavy losses on Azerbaijani forces have been dismissed by Baku. Moreover, the Azerbaijani authorities have restricted internet use inside the country, in particular access to social media. Turkey's emphatic support may embolden Azerbaijan. Back in August, the Azerbaijani defence minister said that with the help of the Turkish military Azerbaijan would fulfil its ""sacred duty"" - in other words, take back its lost territories. Armenia's defence ministry said an attack on civilian settlements in Nagorno-Karabakh, including the regional capital Stepanakert, began on Sunday morning. The separatist authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh said 18 people were killed - 16 of their troops, a woman and a child - and 100 wounded. Azerbaijan said five members of the same family were killed by Armenian shelling. Azerbaijan released images of what it said were damaged Armenian armoured vehicles Armenia's governmentdeclared martial law and total military mobilisation,external, shortly after a similar announcement by the authorities inside Nagorno-Karabakh. Martial law is an emergency measure under which the military takes over the authority and functions of the civilian government. ""Get ready to defend our sacred homeland,"" Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said after accusing Azerbaijan of ""planned aggression"". Warning that the region was on the brink of a ""large-scale war"", he urged the international community to unite to prevent any further destabilisation. Armenia said it had shot down two helicopters and three drones, and destroyed three tanks during Sunday's clashes. Azerbaijan's defence ministry confirmed the loss of one helicopter but said the crew had survived, and reported that 12 Armenian air defence systems had been destroyed. It denied other losses reported by Armenia. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev went on TV President Aliyev said he had ordered a large-scale counter-offensive operation in response to Armenian army attacks. ""I am confident that our successful counter-offensive operation will put an end to the occupation, to the injustice, to the 30-year-long occupation,"" he said. After initial denials by the Armenian military, Nagorno-Karabakh's unrecognised president, Arayik Harutyunyan, confirmed some positions had been lost to Azerbaijani forces. A mountainous region of about 4,400 sq km (1,700 sq miles) Traditionally inhabited by Christian Armenians and Muslim Turks In Soviet times, it became an autonomous region within the republic of Azerbaijan Internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but majority of population is ethnic Armenian An estimated one million people displaced by 1990s war, and about 30,000 killed Separatist forces captured some extra territory around the enclave in Azerbaijan in the 1990s war Stalemate has largely prevailed since a 1994 ceasefire Russia has traditionally been seen as an ally of the Armenians Nagorno-Karabakh: BBC visits Azerbaijan's side of frontline Nagorno-Karabakh: Fighting mood grips Armenians Azerbaijan protests demand war after Armenia clash Nagorno-Karabakh: BBC visits Azerbaijan's side of frontline Nagorno-Karabakh: Fighting mood grips Armenians Toddler killed in shelling in Azerbaijan 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

John, Leicester I find it utterly bizarre that Pep and Rodri are questioning Leicester's 'sit-back' tactics when they managed to score FIVE goals against them.

He would rather have been here but he is pleased. It is hard to find negatives."" On the cleansheet:""We have done a lot of work in the last few weeks on our defence, I think that showed today. The line was fantastic today and gave us the platform to play forward."" On transfers:""I don't know the details. I give my opinion about players but don't know the ins and outs of transfers.

It's not VAR that is a joke, it is the law of handball. That is what is a joke - it is completely and utterly wrong. VAR officials are seeing the motion of handball. They are saying whatever they are saying into the referee's ear, telling him to look at it and the referee is making a decision on the field. So it's not VAR, it's the law (that needs changing).

"Consider pausing university return, says Labour","Students in some halls at Manchester Metropolitan University are locked down in halls The government should consider pausing the return of university students with thousands of students already isolating amid Covid outbreaks, Labour has said. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said the start of term should be delayed while an ""effective, efficient testing system"" is put in place. Students have returned to many UK universities, with most having already started term or due to begin on Monday. The Department for Education said it was working closely with universities. Ms Green said Labour was concerned about the mental health impacts of students being isolated away from home and said all students should be given the option of remote learning. She told BBC Breakfast: ""We do think it is important that students have a choice. If they feel they are going to be safer at home then they should be able to stay at home and conduct their learning remotely."" Ms Green also asked the government to promise students would be allowed home for Christmas as it would be ""unthinkable"" that they could be locked in their halls and unable to see families, although she said ""public health considerations"" should always come first. But Amanda Milling, Co-Chairman of the Conservative Party said there were ""no plans"" to keep students at university over Christmas. ""Labour is deliberately creating unnecessary stress for young people to score political points,"" she said. Earlier this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancockrefused to rule outbanning students from returning home at Christmas, andscientific adviser Sir Mark Walport also warnedsome might have to stay on campus. Tips for coping at uni in a pandemic About 3,000 students are currently in lockdown at universities from Dundee to Exeter, the Conservative chairman of the Commons education select committee Robert Halfon said. This video can not be played Student Joe Gallagher believes the outbreak was ""inevitable"" They include up to 1,700 studentsat Manchester Metropolitan University- where students say they are being prevented from leaving by security guards and police. Many students have expressed worry and confusion about the situation, with one saying they had ""been left completely in the dark"". Prof Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said the situation was ""entirely predictable"". ""Students didn't start this current phase of the epidemic, this began way back in August, and the students just got caught up in it,"" he said. In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, Ms Green accused the government of failing to prepare for the likelihood that the virus could spread among students and said it was ""deeply distressing"" students would not get ""the university experience they deserve"". The government had ""let young people down with the exam fiasco over the summer, and now many of those same students are being let down again"", she said. This video can not be played David Lammy MP: ""The government is now threatening to lock them up at university"" 'Donât scapegoat students over Covid outbreaks' Scottish students: 'Why have they sent us here?' Manchester Met said it had introduced a 14-day self-isolation period at its accommodation at Birley and Cambridge Halls after 127 students tested positive for the virus. Joe Byrne, a first-year student there, said students had been ""left completely in the dark"" and ""practically locked up against our will"". Hundreds of students are also isolating at Glasgow University University campuses have put in social distancing measures Another student, Megan Tingey said she was not contacted by the university about the lockdown before police turned up outside her accommodation. Thousands more students in England are turning up for the new university term this weekend - but the big question is whether they should be heading in the opposite direction and studying from home. Is it wise or fair for universities to bring students back if they're at increasing risk of being in a Covid outbreak and having to self-isolate? Accommodation blocks, with shared facilities and filled with young people wanting to socialise, have already seen a wave of outbreaks. So should the brakes be applied to stop this pattern repeating itself? But after recruiting record numbers of students and promising them a mix of online and face-to-face teaching, it is going to be a very awkward U-turn for universities to switch back to the academic equivalent of working from home. And would that mean refunds on accommodation and tuition fees? There are likely to be some chaotic days ahead - and some big decisions to be made about whether to cut numbers on campus. And students must wonder how they've gone from being cooped up at home all summer to now being cooped up in university. In a statement, to give significant advanced notice due to the requirement to implement the isolation almost immediately"". It said details of how to access food and other provisions had been sent to students. Hundreds of students are also isolating at Glasgow University because of two coronavirus clusters. This video can not be played Nell Manson and Lucy Owens are self-isolating at the University of Glasgow The university said itwould offer a four-week rent rebateto all students in university residences in recognition of the ""difficult circumstances"" under which they were living. It said those students would also be given Â£50 each to spend on food and it would invite local mobile food outlets to come to residences. Across all of Scotland, students have been told not togo to pubs, parties or restaurants over the weekend. Dr David Duncan, chief operating officer at the University of Glasgow, rejected calls for tuition fees to be refunded and said the university's blended learning courses would be of high quality. ""Most students do want to go to their universities even under the present difficult circumstances, partly for social reasons but also for academic reasons,"" he said. ""It is easier to sustain a difficult academic programme when you have the company of other learners with you."" The government said it was working closely with universities in England to ensure they were well prepared for students to return and would continue to monitor the situation, and public health advice. Jamie Greene, Scottish Conservatives shadow cabinet secretary for education,called for clarity,externalfor students from the Scottish government and said they should be treated ""with respect and as adults"".

What do campus outbreaks mean for students?,"More than 1,000 students across Scotland are self-isolating after cases of Covid-19 were identified in student accommodation in Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen. So what do students need to know about life on campus in the time of coronavirus? We've put together the answers to some key questions. The principals of all of Scotland's universities and the Scottish governmenthave agreed on some tough new rules for students. So for now, students cannot socialise with anyone outside their household. That means no parties, no visits to the pub, restaurants or any other hospitality venues this weekend. Universities will increase the staff presence to enforce rules and give welfare help and advice and they will ask private providers of student accommodation to do the same. Police Scotland are also being asked to keep an eye on student behaviour off-campus and a strict ""yellow card/red card"" system will be brought in to deal with breaches that put students and others at risk. And all students must download the Protect Scotland app. More staff will be deployed to give support and also ensure compliance with the new rules Students who have left their family homesare considered to have formed new households with those they are now living with,external. That means they cannot go back home, as households in Scotland are not allowed to mix inside homes. These measures will be reviewed every three weeks. There was some confusion about this after the Scottish government initially confirmed to BBC Scotland that students who had moved out should not return to their family homes. Then thenational clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said students in halls could return home for the weekend- as long as they are not self-isolating and do not have Covid symptoms. But he has since said they cannot return home because they are now in separate households. He tweeted: ""The law is clear: they can't meet indoors with another household - even mum and dad. Sorry.""

There are exceptions - for example, to provide care for someone who needs it and for extended households. This video can not be played How should students be self-isolating? ""Stay in, stay apart, sleep alone, keep cleaning"" It's essential anyone with Covid-19 symptoms self-isolates immediately and uses the NHS website to book a test. The entire household needs to self-isolate - even if just one person has symptoms. This means staying at home and not attending classes or social gatherings. If the test comes back negative, self-isolation can end for everyone. If the test is positive, Test and Protect will be in touch. Public health officials say it is ""vital"" those self-isolating do so for a full 14 days. You should remain in your accommodation - and not go out for any reason, not to attend classes or even to buy essentials like food. Ask friends who are not self-isolating to get your shopping, or arrange to have it delivered to your door. During this period you should avoid close contact with others you are living with. Stay 2m away from everyone. Keep the number of people in shared areas to an absolute minimum. Do not share towels or clothes. Sleep alone. Clean shared toilets, bathrooms and kitchens after every time you have used them. Keep washing your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. And remember, your college or university can provide you with advice and support. Students with coronavirus symptoms canbook a test through the NHS,external. Those who have their own car can go to a drive-through testing centre. But there are also walk-through test centres being set up in some areas. Walk-in testing centres in Glasgow city centre and St Andrews are already open. A walk-in test site in Aberdeen opened on Thursday and a centre in Edinburgh will open on Friday. Additional sites will open in Glasgow on 2 October and Stirling on 5 October, and new sites are being identified in Dundee. Mobile testing centres have also been used at Abertay University and at Murano St student village in Glasgow. The incident management team managing the outbreak at Parker House in Dundee have decided to test every resident, and will deliver home-testing kits to all students in the accommodation. Some students who live at Cairncross halls in Glasgow have been told they must self-isolate Universities Scotland says allowing student accommodation to open means students can attend the university of their choice. Some students live far away from their university and can't travel back and forth. Almost 49,000 new students gained places at Scottish universities this autumn, according to UCAS. More than half of those are likely be in university-run halls of residence, with at least 27,000 places available across the country. The highest numbers of students in university accommodation are in Edinburgh and Glasgow, with an estimated 10,000 students living in halls in the capital. There are also sizeable student populations in Aberdeen, Dundee, Paisley, Stirling and St Andrews - which alone has 4,000 spaces available in university-run accommodation. In many universities and colleges, a blended approach is being taken - so teaching will happen both online and in person. Universities Scotland said universities ""are offering on-campus experience for students where it is safe and practical to do so and is key to their learning"". This will be limited to small seminar groups, lab and practical work - where this in-person learning can take place within the guidelines. Just like similar facilities off campus, libraries, cafes and gyms are open - but there are public health measures in place to try to stop the spread of the virus. For example, social distancing measures are in place. In many circumstances, capacity has been reduced considerably. Edinburgh Napier University said its campus capacity has been reduced to 30% of normal capacity. Use the form below to send us your questions and we could be in touch.

""It is easier to sustain a difficult academic programme when you have the company of other learners with you.""

Outbreak forces student lockdown,"This video can not be played Student Joe Gallagher believes the outbreak was ""inevitable"" About 1,700 university students have been told to self-isolate after 127 tested positive for Covid-19. Students at two Manchester Metropolitan University accommodation blocks have been told to stay in their rooms for 14 days, even if they have no symptoms. Students said ""police and security were outside"" and self-isolation had ""left morale really low"". A university spokesman said disciplinary action will be taken against any breaches. The restrictions affect students in accommodation blocks at Birley campus and Cambridge Halls after  ""127 students have tested positive with a number of others symptomatic or self-isolating"", Manchester City Council said. Students across the cityhave been urgedto attend virtual freshers' events and avoid big parties. But some said they had no warning of a lockdown and are now trapped in halls of residence. Students at two accommodation blocks are self-isolating for a fortnight Megan Tingy, who studies at Manchester Metropolitan, said on Friday ""We were getting ready to go out and looked out to security and police outside the halls. They say we can't leave. ""We haven't received any emails from university about this and they seem to be holding us in against our will."" Student Trisha Kakooza, who is from London, said: ""We had eight hours to go get food to last us for two weeks. ""We have to get any other food delivered, which is expensive. ""I have a job and it helps me make extra money since student finance isn't enough but now I can't go out to work. ""We can study remotely but I won't get paid by the agency I work for."" Police break up parties at student halls Students told to isolate after 124 test positive Covid 'cluster' linked to university sports teams 'Critical moment' as students return to university Chip Wilson, 19, said: ""We have been told we are not allowed to leave and, if we do, we cannot come back, so now we are all stuck inside. ""On top of all this, many of us here have Covid symptoms but we cannot get tests. We can only get drive-through tests and none of us have cars, and even if we did we can't leave now."" Most parts of Greater Manchester have beensubject to stricter restrictions,externalsince July after a spike in coronavirus cases. The rate has also doubled in the city of Manchester to 1,026 positive tests in the week up to 22 September, compared to 515 cases in the previous week. The lockdown comes asstudents in Scotlandwere told not to go to pubs, parties or restaurants this weekend in to stem the spread of the virus. NHS staff hand out test kits to Glasgow University students, who are also subject to restrictions Joe Barnes, who recently started at Manchester Metropolitan University, told BBC Breakfast that self-isolation had ""left the morale of my flat really low"". He said lessons were being conducted online ""so theoretically I could go and study from home but that defeats the point - I've not just come for my studies but to meet new people and enjoy the experience."" He added: ""I've heard horror stories of massive parties in some of the halls around hereâ¦ it is just frustrating that no one else could have foreseen that."" The National Union of Students said affected students should be able ""to return to their families if they wish, as being trapped in university accommodation will only add anxiety at an already difficult time"". ""All students affected must be supported by their universities with food deliveries, shopping and access to mental health services if needed,"" a spokesperson said. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said the Manchester incident was ""the latest catastrophe in a week where wholly predictable - and predicted - Covid outbreaks have caused havoc on campuses across the UK"". ""We warned last month of the problems with moving thousands of students across the country and the time has come for urgent action from ministers and universities to protect staff and students."" She urged university leaders to drop face-to-face classes until the government improves the test-and-trace system. A university spokesman said: ""We are fully supportive of the [lockdown] decision. ""Services such as wellbeing support and the library will remain available to our students online. ""Our security teams will increase patrols to support the lockdown and we will take disciplinary action against any students found to have breached requirements."" Councillor Bev Craig, executive member for adult health and wellbeing for the city council, said: ""We understand that local residents may be concerned about this situation. ""We want to reassure them that the evidence so far suggests that transmission has been within the student community only and has not been more widespread.""
