Salesman smuggled Â£53m worth of live eels,"Gilbert Khoo was arrested on 23 February 2017 when he disembarked a flight from Singapore at Heathrow Airport. A seafood salesman has been given a two-year suspended jail sentence for smuggling an estimated Â£53m worth of endangered live eels out of the UK. Gilbert Khoo, 67, transported the eels from London to Hong Kong, hidden underneath chilled fish, between 2015 and 2017, a court heard. He was caught after Border Force officers found 200kg of the ""glass eels"" at Heathrow Airport. It was the first seizure of its kind in the UK, Southwark Crown Court heard. Eels are threatened with extinction, the court was told Khoo, of Chessington, Surrey, was sentenced to 24 months imprisonment on each of three counts of evasion of a prohibition on the export of goods. Each sentence was suspended for two years. He was also found guilty of three counts of failure to notify movement of animals. The prosecution said the crimes involved 16 consignments with an estimated retail value of Â£53,265,000 in the illegal market for them in Asia. Glass eels refers to an intermediary stage in the eel's life history, between the leptocephalus stage and the juvenile (elver) stage The adult European eel can grow up more than 1m long They are nocturnal creatures Glass eels are often illegally smuggled to Asia, where they are farmed and sold as a delicacy In the UK, glass eels can only be caught by licensed fishermen The current price for eels bought and sold legitimately within the EU is about Â£150 per kilogram Border Force officers found 200kg of the European ""glass eels"" at Heathrow Airport Khoo kept the live eels, imported from countries within the European Union, in a barn in Gloucestershire, before repackaging them to be exported. Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC, who also ordered Khoo to do 240 hours of unpaid work for the community, said: ""In my view you played a leading role in this country in what was a large commercial operation driven by others, the purchasers abroad, where the desire for the glass eels was abundant."" The judge said he had ""no doubt at all"" that Khoo's criminal operation had ""a significant environmental impact upon the European glass eel"", which has a 30-year life cycle. Eels are threatened with extinction unless the threat against them is closely controlled, the court heard.

GP closes surgery to patients over virus fears,"Strachur Surgery's patients will only be able to contact doctors via telephone A Scottish GP has told all patients to stay away from his surgery over coronavirus fears. Dr Robert Coull said appointments at Strachur Medical Practice in Argyll would now be telephone-only to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. The doctor said prescriptions dispensed by the remote surgery would be handed over via a window. He also advised that medication should be left in the car for several hours before opening. Patients were informed via social media that the surgery was closed to all patients on Friday afternoon. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

When asked to explain the decision, Dr Coull posted: ""Strachur has very specific circumstances.  We are the only health care providers in a remote area servicing a very elderly population, so we are at the extreme end of the scale of risk to patients if we have a patient turn up in the practice with Covid-19 as they would have nowhere else to go."" He said that by telephone triaging all patients before allowing them into the building, the medical team could minimise the risk to patients, keep the waiting room mostly empty and be able to clean the areas between patients. Dr Coull said there were ""very specific circumstances"" at his Argyll surgery Dr Coull told BBC news: ""We have a very high age population, we are in the 96th percentile for age and we also have a very high level of chronic diseases. ""It's quite an older village and we are the only practice in the village so if anything happened to us there would be no other services. The nearest people would be half an hour away."" Dr Coull said that the biggest threat to the practice would be if a suspected case walked into the surgery and led to its closure while it was investigated. He added: ""We have decided to increase telephone and video consultations. We are going to have the doors locked initially and only bring people in by invitation, spread out the appointments over a period of time and clean the room between patients. Explaining his advice on dispensing, he said medical staff were at high risk of infection themselves and could inadvertently spread the disease when handing out medication. He went on to suggest patients leave the medicines for several hours  before handling them. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The currentCovid-19 primary care guidelines,externalissued by the Scottish government include instructions for how to deal with cases which present at a GP surgery and over the telephone, but do not as yet recommend closing GP surgeries. A spokeswoman for Argyll and Bute health and social care partnership said: ""We work very closely with our GP colleagues across Argyll and Bute. GPs are independent practitioners and this particular practice has taken a clinical decision to see the majority of their patients by telephone consultation rather than face to face. ""We do not expect any GP or primary care staff member to assess and test patients with suspected Covid-19 therefore there is no requirement for the full personal protection equipment that our secondary care clinical staff require for testing. ""Surgical face masks have however been distributed to GPs for use in the event that contact with a patient is unavoidable."" On Friday,the number of cases of the virus in Scotland rose to 11. The Scottish government said two of the new Covid-19 cases were in Fife, with one each in the Grampian, Forth Valley and Lothian health board areas. The first Scottish case of the virus was confirmed in Tayside on Sunday. No cases have been confirmed in the NHS Highland area, where Strachur Medical Practice is located. Similar announcements have been made by surgeries in London and Cumbria but it appears to be the first Scottish practice to go telephone-only. The country's chief medical officer has warned there could be a ""rapid rise"" in the number of cases in the coming days. Dr Catherine Calderwood said Scotland remained ""very much"" in the containment phase of its response to the outbreak, and urged people to continue to follow basic hygiene advice and - crucially - wash their hands for 20 seconds.

Officials said 49 people had died in 24 hours, while more than 4,600 cases have been reported in total. The country has now reported the most deaths outside of China, where the virus emerged in December. The World Health Organization says more than 101,000 people worldwide have contracted the coronavirus. More than 3,000 people have died - the majority in China. Follow live updates from around the world WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the spread of the virus ""deeply concerning"" and urged all countries to make containment ""their highest priority"". EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Officials announced the record daily death toll in a statement on Friday. They said the number could not be officially confirmed until health officials had ""established the actual cause of death"". The national health institute said the average age of those who have died was 81, with the majority suffering from underlying health problems. An estimated 72% of all those who have died were men. According to government data, 4.25% of individuals confirmed to have the coronavirus in Italy have died, the highest rate in the world. The country has one of the world's oldest populations.

All professional sport, including Serie A football matches, will also be played behind closed doors for a month. The BBC's Rome correspondent Mark Lowen tweeted that a resident in the quarantined Italian town of Codogno told him the most upsetting thing for many people there was that funerals were not being permitted for coronavirus victims because of the need to limit gatherings. ""Priests are saying a couple of prayers - and that's it,"" he wrote. Meanwhile, the Vatican - which reported its first case of the virus on Friday - says the Pope will deliver his Angelus address on Sunday via video, rather than from a window at the Vatican, to avoid drawing a large crowd. The Pope, who has been suffering from a cold, recently tested negative for the coronavirus, Italian media reported. Only China, South Korea and Iran have reported more coronavirus cases than Italy. As of Saturday, South Korea has had 7,041 cases and 46 deaths. Iran has had about 4,740 cases and 145 deaths though these figures are believed to be underestimated. Florida reported two deaths on Friday, taking the US death toll to 16 with more than 200 confirmed cases. The other fatalities have been in the west-coast states of California and Washington State. It came as US President Donald Trumpsigned an $8.3bn (Â£6.4bn) emergency billto try to combat the outbreak. In California, 21 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed on the Grand Princess cruise ship that is being held off the coast near San Francisco. The cruise liner is a sister ship of the Diamond Princess, which was the scene of a major coronavirus outbreak while moored in Japan.

Corbyn's team wanted faction fight - Nandy,"This video can not be played Lisa Nandy on Labour's ""factional war"" under Corbyn Labour leadership contender Lisa Nandy has spoken out against ""faction fighting"" under Jeremy Corbyn. Ms Nandy said she raised her concerns with the Labour leader before she quit his shadow cabinet in 2016. She said some members of his team ""made it very, very clear they were going to continue to wage that factional war until the other side had been crushed"". Allies of Mr Corbyn say it is ""nonsense"" to suggest he wanted to wage ""war"" on another part of the party. Ms Nandy was speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg. The Wigan MP joined amass walkout of so-called ""moderate""shadow ministers in 2016, triggered by Labour's poor European election performance and Mr Corbyn's decision to sack Hilary Benn. Labour candidates challenged over electability Who will be Labour's next leader? She insisted that she had tried, with a group of ""soft left"" MPs, to hold the team together at a meeting with Mr Corbyn and other senior figures. But the attitude of those around Mr Corbyn made her decide to quit as shadow energy secretary, she told the BBC's political editor. ""Some senior politicians in his own team, they made it very, very clear that they were going to continue to wage that factional war until the other side had been crushed,"" she said. She said it was ""one thing"" to have backbenchers waging factional wars with colleagues but ""quite another thing to hear the leadership of the Labour Party state a commitment to doing that"". She added: ""It wasn't Jeremy but there was no point at all at which he contradicted that."" Allies of Mr Corbyn have acknowledged that the meeting did take place just after the referendum in 2016. But they dispute Ms Nandy's version of events, citing the fact that Mr Corbyn later invited some of those who opposed his leadership back into the shadow Cabinet. Sources say it is ""nonsense"" to suggest that Mr Corbyn wanted to wage a ""war"" on another part of the party, the BBC's political editor says. Laura Kuenssberg has previously interviewed Ms Nandy's leadership rivalsRebecca Long-BaileyandSir Keir Starmer. The winner of the contest will be announced on 4 April. Long known in Labour circles as a straightforward politician and an interesting thinker, she has been the most willing to speak out about the mistakes the party made in recent years. That's been easier for her as she quit the party's leadership team. The others have tiptoed around what went wrong, in part because they, as members of the shadow cabinet, were part of the group (at least in theory), that made the errors that led to the defeat and also because they have been afraid to trash Jeremy Corbyn's reputation when many members still believe in him and only a couple of months ago were standing on doorsteps, trying to pitch his message. In our interview with Lisa Nandy she didn't hold back, not just her analysis of how Labour has drifted away from many communities it used to represent, but also on how both sides of the party went into what she describes as a ""factional war"" Ms Nandy co-chaired Owen Smith's unsuccessful attempt to unseat Mr Corbyn as leader, after quitting the shadow cabinet. But she insisted she was a ""non-factional"" and ""collegiate"" politician who had worked with both Blairite and left-wing MPs before being elected to Parliament in 2010. And she said the internal wars between the party's left and right wings had contributed to Labour's heavy defeat in December's general election. ""We've had four years, not just of infighting within the Labour Party and a factional war, waged from the frontbenches and the backbenches that showed the public we were more interested in ourselves, than we were in them, but we'd also had Brexit which was really, really devastating."" She said most voters had no idea what Labour was proposing at the election because ""I don't think people were even listening when we launched the manifesto"". But she said she would ""ditch anything where we didn't know how we're going to pay for it"", from the party's next manifesto, if she is elected leader. One example of this would be the party's plan to ""scrap tuition fees without a plan to pay for it"". Lisa Nandy (centre): I feel like my only friends in the world at the moment are Becky and Keir She said she was opposed to tuition fees and had worked with trade unions on a plan to introduce a tax on business to ""fund free tuition fees for everybody in England and Wales"". ""But you can't just go into an election saying that you're going to spend money, because it's their money. And, as one woman said to me in Wigan in 2017: 'It's our money, love, and we haven't got a lot of it'."" She also expressed doubts about Labour's commitment to nationalising six major industries. ""I'd bring them into public ownership but I wouldn't nationalise them all,"" she told the BBC's political editor. ""I don't see why we would give huge subsidies to the major big six energy companies in order to buy them back into public control. That's simply taking taxpayers' money and handing it over to shareholders."" Instead, Labour should be ""much more radical"" and ""invest in local councils and local communities being able to set up their own energy companies"" to disrupt the market and bring down bills. ""That seems to me a sort of 21st Century socialism that people are really receptive to. But we've got to go out and win the argument,"" she said. Asked - like the other contenders interviewed by Laura Kuenssberg - if she had any ""Tory friends"", she said she ""had friends who vote Tory"". She added: ""I feel like my only friends in the world at the moment are Becky and Keir. We just go round and round conference centres shouting slogans at each other. ""Occasionally, when I'm not doing this I do get out and go for a pint and have a chat to my actual mates, Tory or otherwise.""

Minister reassures public over food supplies,"Supermarkets have taken ""the necessary steps"" to ensure shelves remain stocked following the coronavirus outbreak, the environment secretary has said. George Eustice, who held talks with supermarket and trade bosses on Friday, said he was ""reassured"" they had ""robust plans"" to minimise disruption. It follows concerns the virus could lead to shortages of food and supplies. Earlier,supermarkets cast doubts on an assurance from the health secretary that supplies would not be affected. On Thursday, Matt Hancock said: ""We are working with the supermarkets to make sure that, if people are self-isolating, then we will be able to get the food and supplies that they need."" But supermarket sources said they had not discussed getting food to homes, with one executive saying he was ""baffled"" by the suggestions. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Mr Eustice said he had spoken to chief executives from leading supermarkets on Friday about their response to the outbreak. He said they had reassured him they had ""well-established contingency plans"". ""Retailers are continuing to monitor their supply chains and have robust plans in place to minimise disruption,"" Mr Eustice said. The environment secretary also said he would be holding a further meeting with industry figures and public sector organisations to discuss support for vulnerable groups who may be in isolation. The government and retailers would be working closely together over the coming days and weeks, he added. Andrew Opie, a director of food for the British Retail Consortium, which represents shops across the UK and was involved in talks with ministers this afternoon, said people did not need to panic buy. He said retailers working with their suppliers had ""very sophisticated systems"" that they would be using should the outbreak worsen to ""really make sure everybody has availability and access to food"". BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson said demand for products had ""significantly increased"", with one industry source saying sales volumes had reached levels usually seen at Christmas. She added that the overall message was that the current situation was ""manageable"" but supply chains were working very hard to keep up. Andrex sought to reassure customers it had plans in place to ensure a steady supply of toilet paper. One retailer said there had been a 500% increase in demand for hand wash in the last week, with food cupboard items also among those seeing much higher demand. It comes as the number of coronavirus cases in the UK jumped by 48 cases since Thursday - the biggest increase in one day - bringing the total to 163. More than 20,000 people have been tested. Elsewhere, samples taken from an elderly man who died at Milton Keynes Hospital are currently being investigated for coronavirus. The BBC understands the man, in his 80s, had underlying health issues but more tests for the virus are ongoing. TheUK's first death linked to the viruscame on Thursday, after a woman with underlying health conditions in her 70s died in hospital in Reading.

How prepared is the UK?,"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

What are the rules around refunds?,"Sir Paul McCartney was due to headline Saturday night at Glastonbury this year The government has advised against mass gatherings in the UK for the foreseeable future - effectively cancelling all large-scale events, such as concerts, sports fixtures and theatre productions. The 2020 Glastonbury Festival is the latest in a long list of eventsthat have been cancelled because of coronavirus. Professional football in England and Scotland has already been suspended and all horse racing in Great Britain will stop from Wednesday. Many events around the world, including the Euro 2020 finals, have also been postponed or cancelled. So, what are your rights if you have a ticket to something that gets called off? The Euro 2020 football finals were due to take place in 12 cities around Europe, including London and Glasgow Generally, if you bought your ticket for a cancelled event from an official seller, you should be entitled to a refund, often automatically. However, additional costs, such as postage and booking fees, are unlikely to be reimbursed. For anyone who purchased a ticket through a ticket-reselling website, refunds will depend on the site's terms and conditions. Some sites, like Viagogo, have already said customers will get a full refund in the event of a cancellation. If an event is moved and you cannot make the rearranged date, you should be entitled to your money back. For example, European football's governing body, Uefa, says it will refund all Euro 2020 ticket holders who can't make any rearranged dates in 2021. The football leagues in England and Scotland have not yet announced what will happen about tickets for cancelled matches. Season ticket holders should check their individual club's terms and conditions. Organisers of the Glastonbury Festival say that anyone that has paid a Â£50 deposit can roll it over to next year in order to buy a ticket for the 2021 event. Otherwise, people can ask for their Â£50 to be refunded. If you are taking part in something, the same refund rules may apply to entry fees if it is cancelled. But you need to check the event organiser's terms and conditions. HOW IS THE UK PLANNING FOR AN OUTBREAK:What is the UK's 'delay' stage? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide HOW TO SELF-ISOLATE:What you need to know WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts If you have heard nothing about a refund after a couple of weeks, follow it up, says consumer rights journalist Helen Dewdney. She advises: ""Where possible, do everything in writing so you have a record."" If you're not getting anywhere you can approach your credit card company, says Ms Dewdney. Using a credit card to buy something costing between Â£100 and Â£30,000 means you are legally entitled to a refund if you do not get what you were promised. Even if the ticket is worth less than Â£100, or a debit card was used instead, there is still the chance of getting a refund under the chargeback scheme. This is used to reverse the transaction. Coronavirus: What are your travel rights? Timeline: Which sport events have been affected? Many events are put on to raise money for good causes. Many art, music and theatre groups are charities and rely heavily on ticket sales for income. They say there could be serious financial implications if they have to refund all tickets. Some, including the BFI (British Film Institute), have asked ticket holders to consider not asking for a refund so that the money can be used as a charitable donation instead. If you are unable to attend an event because facilities such as hotels or travel are unavailable, the situation is not so clear-cut. ""You've got to hope for a goodwill gesture,"" says Ms Dewdney. ""From the organisers' point of view, they'll say the event is still going ahead."" If you've booked a package (with hotel, flight and event entry all included), you may be able to claim under your travel insurance - depending on the small print. It depends, according to Adam French, from consumer group Which?. ""If you've bought a ticket for a Taylor Swift gig to headline, but she didn't perform, you should get your money back"", he says. ""But if it's a festival with multiple acts, that means you have a ticket for the festival and not the individual performer. In that instance, you can't expect a refund."" If you decide against going to a music event or sports match because you're worried about coronavirus, there's little chance of getting your money back. The only possible exception is if you have some form of insurance with your ticket. How can I tell if I've got Covid? Is the NHS ready for the surge in coronavirus cases?

GP closes surgery to patients over virus fearsA rural practice moves to telephone-only appointments to try to curb the spread of Covid 19.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Strachur Surgery's patients will only be able to contact doctors via telephone A Scottish GP has told all patients to stay away from his surgery over coronavirus fears. Dr Robert Coull said appointments at Strachur Medical Practice in Argyll would now be telephone-only to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. The doctor said prescriptions dispensed by the remote surgery would be handed over via a window. He also advised that medication should be left in the car for several hours before opening. Patients were informed via social media that the surgery was closed to all patients on Friday afternoon. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. When asked to explain the decision, Dr Coull posted: ""Strachur has very specific circumstances.  We are the only health care providers in a remote area servicing a very elderly population, so we are at the extreme end of the scale of risk to patients if we have a patient turn up in the practice with Covid-19 as they would have nowhere else to go."" He said that by telephone triaging all patients before allowing them into the building, the medical team could minimise the risk to patients, keep the waiting room mostly empty and be able to clean the areas between patients. Dr Coull said there were ""very specific circumstances"" at his Argyll surgery Dr Coull told BBC news: ""We have a very high age population, we are in the 96th percentile for age and we also have a very high level of chronic diseases. ""It's quite an older village and we are the only practice in the village so if anything happened to us there would be no other services. The nearest people would be half an hour away."" Dr Coull said that the biggest threat to the practice would be if a suspected case walked into the surgery and led to its closure while it was investigated. He added: ""We have decided to increase telephone and video consultations. We are going to have the doors locked initially and only bring people in by invitation, spread out the appointments over a period of time and clean the room between patients. Explaining his advice on dispensing, he said medical staff were at high risk of infection themselves and could inadvertently spread the disease when handing out medication. He went on to suggest patients leave the medicines for several hours  before handling them. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The currentCovid-19 primary care guidelines,externalissued by the Scottish government include instructions for how to deal with cases which present at a GP surgery and over the telephone, but do not as yet recommend closing GP surgeries. A spokeswoman for Argyll and Bute health and social care partnership said: ""We work very closely with our GP colleagues across Argyll and Bute. GPs are independent practitioners and this particular practice has taken a clinical decision to see the majority of their patients by telephone consultation rather than face to face. ""We do not expect any GP or primary care staff member to assess and test patients with suspected Covid-19 therefore there is no requirement for the full personal protection equipment that our secondary care clinical staff require for testing. ""Surgical face masks have however been distributed to GPs for use in the event that contact with a patient is unavoidable."" On Friday,the number of cases of the virus in Scotland rose to 11. The Scottish government said two of the new Covid-19 cases were in Fife, with one each in the Grampian, Forth Valley and Lothian health board areas. The first Scottish case of the virus was confirmed in Tayside on Sunday. No cases have been confirmed in the NHS Highland area, where Strachur Medical Practice is located. Similar announcements have been made by surgeries in London and Cumbria but it appears to be the first Scottish practice to go telephone-only. The country's chief medical officer has warned there could be a ""rapid rise"" in the number of cases in the coming days. Dr Catherine Calderwood said Scotland remained ""very much"" in the containment phase of its response to the outbreak, and urged people to continue to follow basic hygiene advice and - crucially - wash their hands for 20 seconds.

Supermarkets doubt minister's food supply claim,"Supermarkets have cast doubts on an assurance from the health secretary that food supplies would not be disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak. On Thursday, Matt Hancock said: ""We are working with the supermarkets to make sure that, if people are self-isolating, then we will be able to get the food and supplies that they need."" But supermarket sources said they had not discussed getting food to homes. One executive said he was ""baffled"" by the suggestions. An executive told BBC business editor Simon Jack: ""Matt Hancock has totally made up what he said about working with supermarkets. We haven't heard anything from government directly."" He added that sales of cupboard basics such as pasta and tinned goods have ""gone through the roof"". This video can not be played The health secretary Matt Hancock appeared on Question Time to answer queries about coronavirus While the supermarket was largely keeping up with demand, teams were working ""round the clock"" to keep shelves stocked, he said. ""We are using processes and staffing levels we set up in case of a no-deal Brexit."" The executive added: ""While I think people don't need to panic buy and should just shop normally, I'm not sure the government can guarantee all food supply in all instances."" There was no suggestion that there were food shortages, but people bringing forward some purchases was creating logistical challenges, he said. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Mr Hancock, who was answering a question from a member of the BBC Question Time audience, also said the government was ""confident"" food supplies would not run out and there was ""absolutely no need"" to panic-buy. Coronavirus: Are people panic-buying? Starbucks bans reusable cups in response to virus But a source at another supermarket said while it had had some overarching discussion with government departments about overall readiness, it had not a conversation about ensuring uninterrupted food supplies. When asked specifically about Mr Hancock's comments, the supermarket said it did not recognise them. A source at a rival supermarket also raised concerns over whether online deliveries could meet the demands of large numbers of people in self-isolation, with online delivery usually making up only 6-7% of the overall market. ""We can't switch a whole load of new vans on overnight,"" the source said. Downing Street said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had regular meetings with the food industry to discuss risks to the supply chain, with a working group due to meet on Friday. ""Defra will continue to work on this issue. We have resilient supply chains,"" a No 10 spokesman said. Woman in 70s becomes first virus fatality in UK Thousands stranded on cruise ship amid virus fears Starbucks bans reusable cups in response to virus The British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, said there had been only limited disruption to supply chains so far and availability of products on shelves remained good. For self-isolating customers, it said, most retailers would be more than happy to deliver online orders to doorsteps. There have been 163 cases of the virus in the UK anda woman in her 70s with underlying health conditionshas died.

Coronavirus: Are people panic-buying?,"People have been stockpiling food, supermarket online delivery slots are full, items are restricted in stores and vulnerable people are being sent food parcels by the government. So what is being done to make sure people can get food? A total of one-and-a-half million people in England have been identified as being extremely medically vulnerable. The government has contacted 900,000 of these and has started distributing free weekly food parcels to those who have no family or friends to help them. This could eventually total more than 50,000 people. The identical parcels contain essential supplies including pasta, cereal, fruit, tea bags, and toilet paper. There have been concerns about healthy over-70s or people with other medical conditions not finding themselves eligible for these parcels. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are working quickly to support people who do not fall into the category of being clinically vulnerable, but still need help getting essential food supplies."" In Wales, people who are extremely vulnerable will receive a letter from the country's chief medical officer. If nobody can help them get food,then from this week they can request a free weekly food box.,external Detail on schemes being set up in Scotland and Northern Ireland are set to be announced in the coming days. Branches of the main supermarkets have introduced policies to keep customers at a safe distance from one other. These include having somebody on the door controlling customer numbers, and spacing out those queuing outside. Inside, many supermarkets are providing hand sanitiser for customers and floor markers for till queues. In addition, some are putting up screens between the cashiers and the public. Other initiatives includeTescointroducing floor markings showing which direction to walk down the aisles in some of its larger stores.Morrisonshas a queuing zone if there are too many customers to be separated by the floor markings, whileAsdais bringing in directional barriers. Empty shelves caused by panic buying led to the supermarkets imposing restrictions on how many of individual items customers could buy. However, with stock levels improving, on Tuesday, Aldi, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda lifted some of the limits. Sainsbury's will start to remove restrictions on some of its items from Sunday, while Tesco and Co-op are not changing their current restriction policies. EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What's the UK's plan and what could happen next? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The supermarkets have introduced allotted times of the day when only the elderly, vulnerable and disabled, or NHS staff and other key workers, can shop. Several food retailers are""drastically cutting"" the range of products they sell.They are also telling manufacturers to stop making some products to focus on those for which there is greatest demand. Meanwhile, Morrisons is launching a pre-order food box collection service for NHS staff. This has been a sticking point for many people who, despite following Prime Minister Boris Johnson's request tostay at home and use online deliveries, find themselves unable to book slots. Tesco,which last weeklimited online orders to 80 items only,has now expanded its home delivery and click-and-collect services to about 780,000 slots this week - up from 660,000 two weeks ago. It has plans to add another 100,000 slots in the coming weeks. It has also recruited more than 7,500 staff and added more than 200 new vans to its fleet. The supermarket has also suspended all fees on its Delivery Saver scheme until it can offer its full service again. Asdais also recruiting more delivery drivers, whileSainsbury'shas offered priority booking slots to more than 450,000 elderly and vulnerable customers. Morrisonsis creating 3,500 new jobs to help expand its online delivery service, whileWaitrosesays it will set aside at least a quarter of its delivery slots to elderly or vulnerable people and is working to identify eligible customers. Rules have been relaxed by the government to allow supermarkets to work together. They can now share resources like distribution depots, delivery vans and staff, and co-ordinate stock levels across the country. Rules around drivers' hours have been eased and the 5p plastic bag charge is being waived for online orders, to speed up deliveries. Why are people stockpiling toilet paper?

"Corbyn's team wanted faction fight - NandyLabour leadership contender Lisa Nandy tells the BBC senior figures wanted to ""crush"" internal opposition.UK Politics","This video can not be played Lisa Nandy on Labour's ""factional war"" under Corbyn Labour leadership contender Lisa Nandy has spoken out against ""faction fighting"" under Jeremy Corbyn. Ms Nandy said she raised her concerns with the Labour leader before she quit his shadow cabinet in 2016. She said some members of his team ""made it very, very clear they were going to continue to wage that factional war until the other side had been crushed"". Allies of Mr Corbyn say it is ""nonsense"" to suggest he wanted to wage ""war"" on another part of the party. Ms Nandy was speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg. The Wigan MP joined amass walkout of so-called ""moderate""shadow ministers in 2016, triggered by Labour's poor European election performance and Mr Corbyn's decision to sack Hilary Benn. Labour candidates challenged over electability Who will be Labour's next leader? She insisted that she had tried, with a group of ""soft left"" MPs, to hold the team together at a meeting with Mr Corbyn and other senior figures. But the attitude of those around Mr Corbyn made her decide to quit as shadow energy secretary, she told the BBC's political editor. ""Some senior politicians in his own team, they made it very, very clear that they were going to continue to wage that factional war until the other side had been crushed,"" she said. She said it was ""one thing"" to have backbenchers waging factional wars with colleagues but ""quite another thing to hear the leadership of the Labour Party state a commitment to doing that"". She added: ""It wasn't Jeremy but there was no point at all at which he contradicted that."" Allies of Mr Corbyn have acknowledged that the meeting did take place just after the referendum in 2016. But they dispute Ms Nandy's version of events, citing the fact that Mr Corbyn later invited some of those who opposed his leadership back into the shadow Cabinet. Sources say it is ""nonsense"" to suggest that Mr Corbyn wanted to wage a ""war"" on another part of the party, the BBC's political editor says. Laura Kuenssberg has previously interviewed Ms Nandy's leadership rivalsRebecca Long-BaileyandSir Keir Starmer. The winner of the contest will be announced on 4 April. Long known in Labour circles as a straightforward politician and an interesting thinker, she has been the most willing to speak out about the mistakes the party made in recent years. That's been easier for her as she quit the party's leadership team. The others have tiptoed around what went wrong, in part because they, as members of the shadow cabinet, were part of the group (at least in theory), that made the errors that led to the defeat and also because they have been afraid to trash Jeremy Corbyn's reputation when many members still believe in him and only a couple of months ago were standing on doorsteps, trying to pitch his message. In our interview with Lisa Nandy she didn't hold back, not just her analysis of how Labour has drifted away from many communities it used to represent, but also on how both sides of the party went into what she describes as a ""factional war"" Ms Nandy co-chaired Owen Smith's unsuccessful attempt to unseat Mr Corbyn as leader, after quitting the shadow cabinet. But she insisted she was a ""non-factional"" and ""collegiate"" politician who had worked with both Blairite and left-wing MPs before being elected to Parliament in 2010. And she said the internal wars between the party's left and right wings had contributed to Labour's heavy defeat in December's general election. ""We've had four years, not just of infighting within the Labour Party and a factional war, waged from the frontbenches and the backbenches that showed the public we were more interested in ourselves, than we were in them, but we'd also had Brexit which was really, really devastating."" She said most voters had no idea what Labour was proposing at the election because ""I don't think people were even listening when we launched the manifesto"". But she said she would ""ditch anything where we didn't know how we're going to pay for it"", from the party's next manifesto, if she is elected leader. One example of this would be the party's plan to ""scrap tuition fees without a plan to pay for it"". Lisa Nandy (centre): I feel like my only friends in the world at the moment are Becky and Keir She said she was opposed to tuition fees and had worked with trade unions on a plan to introduce a tax on business to ""fund free tuition fees for everybody in England and Wales"". ""But you can't just go into an election saying that you're going to spend money, because it's their money. And, as one woman said to me in Wigan in 2017: 'It's our money, love, and we haven't got a lot of it'."" She also expressed doubts about Labour's commitment to nationalising six major industries. ""I'd bring them into public ownership but I wouldn't nationalise them all,"" she told the BBC's political editor. ""I don't see why we would give huge subsidies to the major big six energy companies in order to buy them back into public control. That's simply taking taxpayers' money and handing it over to shareholders."" Instead, Labour should be ""much more radical"" and ""invest in local councils and local communities being able to set up their own energy companies"" to disrupt the market and bring down bills. ""That seems to me a sort of 21st Century socialism that people are really receptive to. But we've got to go out and win the argument,"" she said. Asked - like the other contenders interviewed by Laura Kuenssberg - if she had any ""Tory friends"", she said she ""had friends who vote Tory"". She added: ""I feel like my only friends in the world at the moment are Becky and Keir. We just go round and round conference centres shouting slogans at each other. ""Occasionally, when I'm not doing this I do get out and go for a pint and have a chat to my actual mates, Tory or otherwise.""

Coronavirus blamed for hospital hand gel theftsVisitors to Northampton General Hospital have even ripped hand sanitiser dispensers from walls.Northampton,"The bottles of foaming sanitising gel are being stolen from the ends of beds ""every day"" Visitors to a hospital are stealing hand sanitising gel daily - as demand for the product surges amid fears over coronavirus. Bottles have been taken from patients' beds and dispensers ripped off walls at Northampton General Hospital. Bosses said the gel was ""disappearing every day"" and they have had to limit the supply on wards. ""Nothing like this has ever happened in all the years we've had the gel,"" said a hospital spokeswoman. An email to ward managers at the hospital, seen by theNorthampton Chronicle,,externalwarned them of the risk posed to patients.

The NHS says that washing your hands is a key part of preventing the spread of viruses, but hand sanitiser gel can be used when soap and water are not available. However, since the hospital's supplies have been going missing, Mrs Watts said, bottles were no longer being put at the end of all beds.

Parents stressed by Italy's coronavirus shutdown,"A cleaner sanitises an empty classroom in Turin At the San Cosimato playground in Rome, parents have that unmistakeable look of ""how on Earth am I going to entertain them?"" The perennial problem has struck early this year: with schools and universities now closed across Italy until at least 15 March, in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, some 8.4 million children are out of class well before the Easter break. It's an unprecedented response by Europe's worst-hit country. Malvina Diletti watches her eight-year-old, Edoardo, play on the climbing frame. ""We think 10 days off is totally useless, it's not even enough to discover if you're sick,"" she says. ""So they'll probably extend it, which is bad as it's tiring to have them home all the time. They may be happy today - it's the first day - but they'll get bored eventually."" They are heading home for lunch with six other children, as parents are taking it in turn to host, sharing the babysitting load during this difficult period. ""It's so we avoid grandparents having to stay with us,"" Malvina tells me, ""because if more elderly got sick, hospitals would just crash."" On Thursday the Italian authorities reported 41 deaths from the virus in the past 24 hours, raising the total death toll to 148 in Italy. Currently 3,296 people are infected in the country. This was the first country in Europe to ban all flights to China; the first to cordon off entire towns; and now it's the first to close all schools and universities, a dramatic effort to limit a worsening outbreak. ""Maybe they've done it to protect the older teachers,"" says Malvina, ""since the children are still mixing out of school. ""It doesn't really make sense - but we accept it and will do it for the community."" Edoardo says he's enjoying being off school, ""but it's strange because it's the first time"". I ask if he understands why it's happening. ""Yes,"" he replies, ""it's to stop us getting sick."" LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 Some families and teachers are adapting to the huge disruption with the help of technology. In the northern town of Busto Arsizio, part of the region worst hit by the virus, the Tosi High School is using web-learning to stream classes. ""Our lessons continue uninterrupted,"" says Amanda Ferrario, the headteacher. ""The teacher enters a virtual classroom, does the roll call and can see students connected on their devices. They can work in groups, make presentations and show videos."" The school is part of a network, Ashoka Changemakers, whose investment in the resource is paying off. ""This could be a turning point in Italian education,"" she says, ""and a chance to create innovative methods. ""Other schools may struggle because perhaps their teachers aren't trained. We're supporting those that ask for our help, as there are very few like us."" Some schools are recording entire lessons on WhatsApp, while others are incorporating the news into their lessons, one teacher telling an Italian newspaper that she'd asked pupils to come up with stories about ""the monster of coronavirus"". She added that ""facing coronavirus helps overcome fear"". Rome in crisis: A pedestrian area near St Peter's Square is almost deserted Italians are adjusting to the crisis - but the reality is hitting hard. And while there doesn't appear to be panic about the spread of cases itself, there is deepening concern about the economic impact. At the Royal Santina Hotel beside Rome's Termini Station, just 20 of the 120 rooms are occupied, and 90% of bookings for March have been cancelled. The corridors feel eerily quiet. ""This is the worst I've seen in my 35 years here,"" says owner Giuseppe Roscioli. ""It's the first time that we've lost almost all the international market - from the US, Asia and the Middle East - as well as the domestic market from Italian tourists and group bookings."" What will happen if the situation continues? ""I have the key - I can lock the door,"" he says. Empty shelves in a Milan shop: The scare has triggered some panic-buying Italy's tourism sector is now predicted to lose â¬7.4bn (Â£6.4bn; $8.3bn) as a result of the outbreak. From the Colosseum to the Trevi Fountain, Rome's must-see sights are being seen by so few. ""I thought it would be fuller than it is,"" says Jill Saunderson from the UK, while enjoying St Peter's Square. ""All the waiters we've spoken to are petrified for their livelihoods. We wanted to come - we're quite healthy and we think there's a lot of scaremongering going on."" Health, the economy, even Italians' way of life: all are now facing an unparalleled challenge. There is shock here at seeing how vulnerable this economy is to events beyond Italy's control. And for many the most damaging thing is not knowing when this uncertainty will pass.

Starbucks bans reusable cups in response to virus,"Starbucks branches have temporarily banned reusable cups in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The coffee chain said customers would still receive a 25p discount for bringing reusable cups with them, but drinks would be served in paper cups. Great Western Railway and LNER have banned reusable cups on trains - but GWR scrapped the policy after days. A hygiene expert said containing the virus should be a ""greater priority"" than environmental concerns. It is understood Starbucks made the decision internally, rather than on the advice of health officials. LATEST:Live coverage of developments A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The coffee chain's Europe spokesman, Robert Lynch, said: ""Out of an abundance of caution, we are pausing the use of personal cups or tumblers in our stores across the UK. ""However, we will continue to honour our 25p discount for anyone who brings in a personal cup."" He said Starbucks was suspending its 5p charge for customers asking to use a paper cup. Mr Lynch added the coffee chain - which, in 1998, was the first to offer users a discount for customers with reusable cups - was also introducing ""increased cleaning measures"" for all in-store crockery such as ceramic mugs and plates. Starbucks stores in the US have already brought in similar measures. The coffee chainclosed half of its almost 4,300 outlets in Chinain January to support efforts to contain the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19. UK train operator LNER said it had stopped accepting refillable cups on its trains ""to help prevent possible contamination from handling cups and lids"". While Great Western Railway (GWR) said it banned the use of reusable cups on its trains for ""three or four days"" as part of ""sensible precautions"" to protect customers and staff. But the train company ""reverted"" to its normal policy on Tuesday, a spokesman said. He said GWR had received ""a couple of comments"" from people asking for an explanation of the ban. One GWR passenger said,externalthe move was ""absolutely absurd"" as trains were a ""germ hot spot"". Amy Slack said train staff were not sure why the reusable cup ban had been brought in Amy Slack, from Falmouth, Cornwall, said she decided against buying a coffee on a GWR train when her reusable coffee cup was declined on Monday. ""I couldn't understand what the difference was between a standard cup and a reusable cup,"" she told the BBC. ""We were told it's because of [coronavirus] being passed from hand to mouthâ¦ but that's the same regardless of the receptacle you're holding."" Ms Slack, 35, who works for an environmental charity, said when she asked for the reasons behind the change, staff members said they had ""questioned it themselves"". ""If it was government guidance I would be totally for it,"" she said. ""But coronavirus is going to be passed through very many more forms than reusable cups."" When asked if people should stop using reusable cups, Public Health England said its ""message is clear"" - that ""simple hand-washing with soap for 20 seconds"" was the most effective way to stop the spread of the virus. At least 2.5 billion coffee cups are thrown away each year in the UK,according to a government report,externalpublished in 2018. But Prof Sally Bloomfield, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said hygiene should take a ""greater priority"" than environmental concerns while it was still possible for the coronavirus to be contained. ""We don't know how serious [the virus] is, we are in a completely unknown phase of this, and I think in terms of preventing the spread, for the next three or four weeks then it should take a greater priority than an environmental concerns,"" she said. She added the reusable cup ban was ""not being paranoid"". ""Handing someone a reusable cup is just the same as shaking hands with somebody. If there's anything we can do at the moment to slow down the spread, we should be doing it."" Reusable cups trial at Gatwick Airport Experts recommend 'latte levy' of 25p per cup Watch: Avoiding shaking hands with 'Wuhan shake' and elbow bump But Prof Bloomfield's colleague, epidemiologist Dr Kalpana Sabapathy, said ""while things may evolve"",advice to avoid the virusdid not include avoiding reusable cups. She added ""one has to ask what Starbuck's objective is"" since regular hand-washing ""should be protocol"" for workers at the coffee chain. The Food Standards Agency's guidance,externalfor anyone working with food is to wash hands ""after touching items such as phones, light switches, door handles, cash registers and money"". Greggs said there would be no changes to its reusable cup policy, where customers bringing their own cups received a 20p discount on drinks. A spokesperson for Costa Coffee said: ""We have no plans to stop allowing the use of reusable cups in our stores, but like all retailers we are monitoring the situation closely and are following government advice and guidance.""

She resigned as home secretary in April 2018after people living legally in the UK were detained and deported and she inadvertently misled a Commons committee about the number of people who had been involved. The UN Women Oxford UK societywrote on Facebook,externalon Thursday: ""Following a majority vote in committee, tonight's event with speaker Amber Rudd has been cancelled. It added it was ""deeply sorry for all and any hurt caused"" over the event. Earlier in the week, it said the conversation with Ms Rudd would have been ""an honest and frank conversation"" about how her policies had impacted women of all races. It had urged students to attend the event ""to help campaign for a truly frank feminism which is not afraid of taking opportunities to discuss issues with high profile figures"". Later charity UN Women UK distanced itself from the row, and announced the student group involved had changed its name to United Women Oxford Student Society. The charity added it would no longer be associated with the student society.

UK to spend Â£46m on coronavirus research,"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson warned of a ""substantial period of disruption"" The UK government has promised an extra Â£46m in the fight against coronavirus. The money will include funds towards the development of a vaccine and a new a rapid test for the disease. There is currently no vaccine available to protect people against Covid-19, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped one would be ready in about a year. Support will also be offered to some of the countries most vulnerable to a coronavirus outbreak. It comes as the number of cases in the UK rose by 48- the biggest increase in a single day - taking the total number to 163. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The new funds were announced as Mr Johnson visited a laboratory in Bedfordshire where the new rapid test, which could provide results within 20 minutes, is being developed. Similar to a pregnancy test, it would use a swab of saliva or a pinprick of blood. The lab already has experience of creating similar tests for Ebola, yellow fever and measles. Existing tests can take a couple of days to provide results, as they rely on samples being sent away to a lab for analysis. But the test could still be six months away. Funding will also go towards work on eight possible vaccines in development as well as further research. Government scientific advisers have already warned a working vaccine is unlikely to be ready in time for this current outbreak. Boris Johnson visited the lab where scientists are developing a new test Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who visited Mologic lab, said in a statement: ""Keeping the British people safe is my number one priority, and that's why I've set out our four-part plan to contain, delay, mitigate and research coronavirus. ""We are ensuring the country is prepared for the current outbreak, guided by the science at every stage. But we also need to invest now in researching the vaccines that could help prevent future outbreaks. ""I'm very proud that UK experts - backed by government funding - are on the front line of global efforts to do just that."" The government's chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, said: ""Rapid testing is going to be key to managing this outbreak, but ultimately vaccines are going to provide the long-term protection we need. ""The UK has some of the world's leading scientists and this money will help in our fight to tackle this new disease."" The announcement takes the total amount of money committed by the government to spending on coronavirus to Â£91m. The new Â£46m comes from the UK's aid budget and includes up to Â£16m to help some of the most vulnerable countries prepare for the coronavirus. The UK's contribution to vaccine research now stands at Â£65m. Global human trials of the eight possible vaccines could start later this year but firms would still face the task of mass-producing and distributing them.

Flybe's collapse could be 'first of many' airlines,"Flybe collapsed on Thursday after it failed to secure fresh funding The failure of Europe's biggest regional airline Flybe could be the start of more casualties, analysts predict. On Thursday, a global airline industry body warned the financial hit from coronavirus could reach $113bn (Â£87bn) this year. The bleak prediction came on the same day UK-based Flybe went into administration. Airline experts are forecasting more failures as passengers cancel flights. Flybe's collapse ""will likely be the first of many in 2020,"" said James Goodall, transport analyst at Redburn. ""We expect that the demand destruction caused by Covid-19 accelerated its demise and we believe further airline bankruptcies should be expected in the coming months."" Airlines could lose $63bn to $113bn in revenue from the slump in passenger traffic globally this year, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Thursday.  Last month, it had predicted losses of $29bn. Coronavirus: What are your travel rights? Future of Flybe routes hangs in the balance Demand has plummeted, not just from holidaymakers, but from corporate travel as firms restrict business trips for employees and conferences are postponed. ""There will be a significant increase in airline casualties in this scenario,"" said Michael Duff, managing director at The Airline Analyst. Cathay Pacific asked staff to take three weeks of unpaid leave Mr Duff singled out a handful of airlines based in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Norway and Mexico that rate very low on his firm's financial strength index. ""This is a very difficult time for the airline industry and it will be about conserving cash,"" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of Flightglobal magazine. ""It will be a very challenging time for those airlines who don't have a lot of cash, especially those that have been involved in a price war."" Analysts said regional airlines in Asia were more vulnerable as they rely heavily on passengers from China, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. ""They also have some of the largest aircraft order backlogs so we can expect some pressure on Airbus and Boeing to delay deliveries and to refund aircraft deposits,"" added Mr Duff. Many airlines have introduced cost-cutting measures such as asking staff to take unpaid leave and pay cuts as planes are grounded. Emirates has asked workers to take unpaid leave for up to one month, whileCathay Pacific asked staff to take three weeks of unpaid leave. Demand has plummeted from both holidaymakers and business travellers Regional airline Flybe went into administration on Thursday after a bid for fresh funding failed. Paul Charles, a former director of Virgin Atlantic, told the BBC's Today programme that he expected ""other casualties"" due to pressures such as the coronavirus. ""You're going to see massive consolidation within six months' time,"" he said. ""Management teams at airlines at the moment are entirely stretched because of coronavirus. You're not going to see anyone else come in and try and replenish the network or fill the void left by Flybe."" Scottish airline Loganair has said it will take on 16 former Flybe routes. But Mr Charles said: ""What Loganair is doing is cherry-picking the best routes, which does make sense, but I wonder how long it's going to last - I do think some of those 16 won't survive for several months."" However, Loganair chief executive Jonathan Hinkles said he disagreed, and that other airlines would buy some of the routes. ""I'm aware from friends and former colleagues in the Channel Islands that they'll be stepping up today to announce some former Flybe routes as well. ""I think airlines will be stepping up where it makes sense."" BBC Business reporter Tom Espiner contributed to this article.

Supermarket 'hasn't heard from ministers',"Supermarkets have cast doubts on an assurance from the health secretary that food supplies would not be disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak. On Thursday, Matt Hancock said: ""We are working with the supermarkets to make sure that, if people are self-isolating, then we will be able to get the food and supplies that they need."" But supermarket sources said they had not discussed getting food to homes. One executive said he was ""baffled"" by the suggestions. An executive told BBC business editor Simon Jack: ""Matt Hancock has totally made up what he said about working with supermarkets. We haven't heard anything from government directly."" He added that sales of cupboard basics such as pasta and tinned goods have ""gone through the roof"". This video can not be played The health secretary Matt Hancock appeared on Question Time to answer queries about coronavirus While the supermarket was largely keeping up with demand, teams were working ""round the clock"" to keep shelves stocked, he said. ""We are using processes and staffing levels we set up in case of a no-deal Brexit."" The executive added: ""While I think people don't need to panic buy and should just shop normally, I'm not sure the government can guarantee all food supply in all instances."" There was no suggestion that there were food shortages, but people bringing forward some purchases was creating logistical challenges, he said.

Coronavirus: Are people panic-buying? Starbucks bans reusable cups in response to virus But a source at another supermarket said while it had had some overarching discussion with government departments about overall readiness, it had not a conversation about ensuring uninterrupted food supplies. When asked specifically about Mr Hancock's comments, the supermarket said it did not recognise them. A source at a rival supermarket also raised concerns over whether online deliveries could meet the demands of large numbers of people in self-isolation, with online delivery usually making up only 6-7% of the overall market. ""We can't switch a whole load of new vans on overnight,"" the source said. Downing Street said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had regular meetings with the food industry to discuss risks to the supply chain, with a working group due to meet on Friday.

Are people panic-buying?,"People have been stockpiling food, supermarket online delivery slots are full, items are restricted in stores and vulnerable people are being sent food parcels by the government. So what is being done to make sure people can get food? A total of one-and-a-half million people in England have been identified as being extremely medically vulnerable. The government has contacted 900,000 of these and has started distributing free weekly food parcels to those who have no family or friends to help them. This could eventually total more than 50,000 people. The identical parcels contain essential supplies including pasta, cereal, fruit, tea bags, and toilet paper. There have been concerns about healthy over-70s or people with other medical conditions not finding themselves eligible for these parcels. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are working quickly to support people who do not fall into the category of being clinically vulnerable, but still need help getting essential food supplies."" In Wales, people who are extremely vulnerable will receive a letter from the country's chief medical officer. If nobody can help them get food,then from this week they can request a free weekly food box.,external Detail on schemes being set up in Scotland and Northern Ireland are set to be announced in the coming days. Branches of the main supermarkets have introduced policies to keep customers at a safe distance from one other. These include having somebody on the door controlling customer numbers, and spacing out those queuing outside. Inside, many supermarkets are providing hand sanitiser for customers and floor markers for till queues. In addition, some are putting up screens between the cashiers and the public. Other initiatives includeTescointroducing floor markings showing which direction to walk down the aisles in some of its larger stores.Morrisonshas a queuing zone if there are too many customers to be separated by the floor markings, whileAsdais bringing in directional barriers. Empty shelves caused by panic buying led to the supermarkets imposing restrictions on how many of individual items customers could buy. However, with stock levels improving, on Tuesday, Aldi, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda lifted some of the limits. Sainsbury's will start to remove restrictions on some of its items from Sunday, while Tesco and Co-op are not changing their current restriction policies. EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What's the UK's plan and what could happen next? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The supermarkets have introduced allotted times of the day when only the elderly, vulnerable and disabled, or NHS staff and other key workers, can shop. Several food retailers are""drastically cutting"" the range of products they sell.They are also telling manufacturers to stop making some products to focus on those for which there is greatest demand. Meanwhile, Morrisons is launching a pre-order food box collection service for NHS staff. This has been a sticking point for many people who, despite following Prime Minister Boris Johnson's request tostay at home and use online deliveries, find themselves unable to book slots. Tesco,which last weeklimited online orders to 80 items only,has now expanded its home delivery and click-and-collect services to about 780,000 slots this week - up from 660,000 two weeks ago. It has plans to add another 100,000 slots in the coming weeks. It has also recruited more than 7,500 staff and added more than 200 new vans to its fleet. The supermarket has also suspended all fees on its Delivery Saver scheme until it can offer its full service again. Asdais also recruiting more delivery drivers, whileSainsbury'shas offered priority booking slots to more than 450,000 elderly and vulnerable customers. Morrisonsis creating 3,500 new jobs to help expand its online delivery service, whileWaitrosesays it will set aside at least a quarter of its delivery slots to elderly or vulnerable people and is working to identify eligible customers. Rules have been relaxed by the government to allow supermarkets to work together. They can now share resources like distribution depots, delivery vans and staff, and co-ordinate stock levels across the country. Rules around drivers' hours have been eased and the 5p plastic bag charge is being waived for online orders, to speed up deliveries. Why are people stockpiling toilet paper?

Fear returns to stock markets over virus impact,"Global stock markets have fallen sharply as investors continue to worry about the broader economic effects of the coronavirus. London's FTSE 100 share index fell more than 3% and there were similar declines in other European markets. In the US, upbeat data on hiring and unemployment failed to buoy investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed almost 1% lower, while the Nasdaq slumped 1.8% and S&P 500 ended down 1.7%. The monthly report from the US Labor Department found US employers added 273,000 jobs in February - significantly beating expectations - while the jobless rate fell back to near a 50-year low of 3.5%. The report also revised up estimates of job gains in January and December, finding 85,000 more than previously understood. The surveys, however, reflect data collected before the outbreak intensified. In recent weeks, global travel has plunged, while work, school and shopping has been disrupted in many countries. Despite the strong data, markets were focused on the impact of the virus. ""Today's jobs report is old news,"" said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. The economic strength signalled in the report is a ""little like the saying, the car was in fine condition before being involved in a collision"", said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com. ""The new reality, amid tremendous uncertainty, is the world has experienced a seismic shift,"" he said. Earlier on Friday, markets in Asia had seen big falls, with Japan's Nikkei share index dropping by 2.7%. The 3.6% drop in the FTSE 100 wiped out the gains seen earlier this week on the index. Shares in travel companies again saw some of the steepest falls. Banks also took a hit, as investors anticipate that interest rates might be cut in order to make borrowing cheaper for companies and consumers to keep the economy buoyant. Energy firms were under pressure as well, after the collapse of a proposal by major oil producers to keep oil supply in check sent oil prices tumbling more than 8%. ""The markets didn't even bother with the pretence of a calm start on Friday, bringing another rough week to a close,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst at financial spread better Spreadex. ""The week's various central bank rate cuts only served to reinforce the seriousness of the situation."" Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve, the US's central bank,cut its benchmark interest rateby 0.5 percentage points to a range of 1% to 1.25% in an attempt to ease investor concerns. Many analysts predict it will cut rates again - perhaps as soon as its meeting this month. As traders seek less risky investments, they are turning to government bonds, sending prices higher. The bond market - which is many times larger than the stock market - includes tradable loans to governments and businesses. Yields - how much investors will recoup in interest from the loans - drop as the price of the loan rises. Benchmark 10-year UK government debt now only offers a 0.24% return - a record low. In the US, the yield on a 10-year Treasury also fell to a record low, falling below 0.7%. ""With the 10-year Treasury yield slumping to a new record low and stock markets under pressure again today, it is questionable whether the Fed can wait until its scheduled meeting mid-month to deliver the next rate cut,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.

Baby deaths NHS trust to return 'good care' money,"More than 900 families have contacted a review looking at poor maternity care at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust An NHS trust at the centre of an inquiry into preventable baby deaths will repay money it received for providing good maternity care. In 2018, Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust received almost Â£1m, weeks before its services were rated inadequate. The BBC revealed in Decemberthe trust had qualified for the payment under the NHS's Maternity Incentive Scheme. The trust said an ""incorrect submission"" had been made and it had ordered an independent review. Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust (SaTH) is at the centre of England's largest inquiry into poor maternity care, withmore than 900 families contacting a reviewlooking into concerns over preventable deaths and long-term harm. Rhiannon Davies, pictured with daughter Isabella and husband Richard, campaigned for an independent inquiry after her baby, Kate, died in 2009 Rhiannon Davies, whose daughter Kate died due to errors at the trust, said she was incredulous SaTH ever received the money. ""They have deceived, lied and through so doing, denied those deserving of the money from obtaining it. ""We know they haven't learned lessons from avoidable deaths. When will enough be enough?"" In February, Jeremy Hunt called for an inquiry into the safety of NHS maternity services Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt wrote to ministers questioning if improvements to the Maternity Incentive Scheme were needed in light of payments made to both Shrewsbury and Telford and East Kent Hospitals, despiteboth facing serious questions over the safety of maternity services. The trust in Shropshire was paid Â£963,391 after certifying it had met the 10 safety standards demanded by the scheme, which is run by NHS Resolution. In the letter, seen by the BBC, Mr Hunt suggested one improvement would be to link payments to CQC maternity and safety ratings. ""The whole approach is likely to be discredited if trusts can meet all 10 actions and yet still be delivering poor standards of care,"" the letter said. In 2018, NHS Resolution, the legal arm of NHS trusts in England, launched a scheme aimed at improving maternity care and reducing the cost of errors. To qualify for payment, trusts had to certify they met 10 maternity safety standards. NHS Resolution did not ensure each trust met its requirements. Of the 132 trusts that participated, 75 certified they had scored 10 out of 10 and became eligible to receive funding. The money was paid to SaTH while Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspectors were assessing it. The CQC report rated the trust, including its maternity services, as inadequate. Scale of Shropshire maternity scandal 'shocking' 'She knows it makes Mummy sad' Latest news from the West Midlands Louise Barnett, chief executive of SaTH, said the trust had reassessed its submission to NHS Resolution and would be repaying the money. ""Although some good progress had been made, we did not have sufficient evidence to support the required 100% compliance in all of the standards,"" she said, adding that internal auditors ""have been commissioned to undertake an independent review"". ""We acknowledge that our systems need to be more robust. We are continuing to review and strengthen our governance processes, to provide additional rigour and scrutiny at all levels, which I welcome."" Currently, the CQC is carrying out a review at The Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and The Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, both of which are rated as inadequate - a rating the trust also shares. A surprise inspectioncarried out in February,externalfound there was no children's nurse on duty at the Princess Royal Hospital's A&E department and sepsis screening and the use of antibiotics ""required improvement"". There are currently 21 conditions imposed upon the trust by the CQC and the above issues are classed as breaches.

Dead baby boy found in woodlandOfficers are trying to trace the mother after the newborn was discovered near Southampton.Hampshire & Isle of Wight,"Police remained at the scene on Shore Road in Hythe on Friday morning A baby boy has been found dead in an area of woodland in Hampshire. Police are trying to trace the mother of the newborn, who was discovered close to Shore Road in Hythe, near Southampton, just after 14:00 GMT. The death is being treated as unexplained and anyone with dash-cam footage of the area at the time is asked to contact officers. Det Ch Insp Ross Toms said their priority now was to find the mother of the child. ""I have no doubt this will have been a very distressing experience for the mother of this baby,"" he said. ""Our priority right now is to ensure she receives the care and assistance she requires. ""I want to make a direct appeal to her. ""You may be very frightened right now and it is vitally important that you make contact with us or someone else."" Three police vehicles and a van are parked next to the woods being searched on Shore Road. A small generator is running by the road, powering floodlights that have been used to assist police as they combed the area overnight. Officers are very concerned for the mother's wellbeing and have asked for anyone who may have recently seen a heavily-pregnant woman in the area to get in touch.

Mr Johnson said the UK was still in the first phase of its four-part plan to tackle the virus outbreak, which is made up of: contain, delay, research and mitigate. The government is still deciding what measures will be taken in the delay phase, but has previously said this could include banning big events, closing schools, encouraging people to work from home and discouraging the use of public transport. Last week,a British man in Japan becamethe first UK citizen to die from the virus after being infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Meanwhile, a 33-year-old British woman who works for the United Nations is one of four peoplewho have been diagnosedwith the virus in Senegal, after travelling there from London. And in California, more than 140 British nationals are stranded on board a Princess Cruises ship as officials test passengers for Covid-19. The government has now updated its guidance to travellers arriving in the UK from Italy - the country in Europe that has been hit worst by the virus, with more than 3,000 cases. On Thursday, the government said,externalthe whole of Italy - not just the north of the country - is now classed as a recognised area of concern, meaning if people develop symptoms after returning from the country they should self-isolate. For those returning from the quarantined towns in Italy, people should self-isolate even if they do not show symptoms. Health workers wear protective suits and masks inside the isolation area of a Turin hospital In other developments: Bank HSBC says an employee at its Canary Wharf offices in London has been diagnosed and it is ""deep-cleaning the floor where our colleague worked and shared areas of the building"" UK airlineFlybe has gone into administrationand says coronavirus is partly to blame Starbucks says it is ""pausing the use of personal cups"" and washable ceramic cups in their UK, US and Canadian stores because of fears of the virus Pupils at a school in south Devonare receiving lessonsonline, after the school shut when a pupil was diagnosed with the virus The competition watchdog has warned retailers and traders they could be prosecuted for trying to ""exploit"" the coronavirus outbreak by selling protective products at inflated prices ITV say travel companies are deferring their TV advertising, with advertising revenue due to drop 10% in April England's Six Nations gamesagainst Italy in Rome on 14 and 15 March have been postponed -rather than taking place behind closed doors- as a response to the outbreak Ireland records another seven cases, bringing its total up to 13 Iran will close schools and universities until 20 March in an attempt to curb the spread Worldwide, authorities have confirmed more than 92,000 cases of coronavirus - of which more than 80,000 are in China, where the virus began. More than 3,000 people have died globally, with the vast majority in China. This video can not be played Chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty: ""Community transmission highly likely"" Earlier, Prof Whitty told MPs on the health and social care committee that half of all coronavirus cases in the UK are most likely to occur in just a three-week period, with 95% of them over a nine-week period. He said the health service would be stretched by people needing oxygen and some ""things may be considerably less well done"" during the peak of an epidemic. But he said neither elderly people nor people with asthma should self-isolate yet, adding there was no evidence of ""deep harm"" in children with asthma. Have you been affected by coronavirus?

Iran limits travel,"The authorities say people driving are spreading the virus Iran is limiting travel between its major cities as it tries to halt the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed at least 107 people there. The country has already shut schools until April, and Health Minister Saeed Namaki said people should not use the break as an opportunity to travel. He also urged Iranians to reduce the use of paper banknotes. The measures come as the World Health Organization warned some countries were not doing enough to stop the virus. But WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted containment was still possible, adding: ""This is not a time to give up."" As it happened: Italy and Iran close schools How worried should US be over coronavirus? Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Iran is one of the worst-hit countries outside China, where the Covid-19 virus - which causes the coronavirus disease - originated. Worldwide, authorities have confirmed more than 92,000 cases of the virus, of which more than 80,000 are in China. More than 3,000 people have died globally, the vast majority of them in China. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide WAYS TO PREVENT CATCHING IT:How to wash your hands WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts The country's official death toll on Thursday rose by 15 to 107, and the number of confirmed cases increased by 591 to 3,513. But state news agency Irna said the number of dead could be higher, citing data from medical universities. The data did not include statistics from the capital Tehran and Gilan province - two of the hardest-hit areas. The toll there was listed as ""unknown"", Irna said. Last month sources in the country's health system told BBC Persianthe death toll was at least 210, with most victims in Tehran and the holy city of Qom. Mr Namaki said checkpoints would go up to limit travel between major cities. Iran is a hotspot in the global outbreak Streets and public transport hubs are now being regularly disinfected in Iranian cities In a televised press conference, he said travel was ""very dangerous"" and reports showed ""many cars on the roads are taking the virus with them"" to uninfected areas. He added that schools and universities would remain closed until Nowruz, the Persian new year, on 20 March, which marks the beginning of a national holiday. ""People should not consider this as an opportunity to go travelling. They should stay home and take our warnings seriously,"" he said. ""This virus is highly contagious. It is a serious matter, do not joke about it."" Ladan, an asthma sufferer in Tehran, told the BBC increased stress was the worst aspect of the outbreak for her so far. ""It feels so unsafe now. I quarantined myself without having any sanitizer. I am starting to see everything like a virus. I feel like I am becoming paranoid about whatever I buy and bring into my house,"" she said. In the western city of Hamedan Mohammedreza said the crisis had provoked an ""epidemic of fear"". The Grand Princess, one of the world's largest cruise ships, is being held off the Californian coast A doctor in western Iran who gave his name as Mehrzad told the BBC his hospital had done nothing to prepare for the outbreak as late as a week ago. He said he had ended up buying extra masks and gloves out of his own pocket. By contrast, in the central city of Isfahan, Mohammad said very few people were taking the outbreak seriously. ""Many believe it is happening anywhere else but Isfahan. You barely see anyone wearing masks or gloves,"" he said. ""But what is striking is the food prices, which are rising on a daily basis - and everyone buys more than their needs as if a famine is on its way."" Iraq has announced its first two confirmed deaths - one of them in the capital Baghdad - from the virus Israel and the Palestinian Authority have put the city of Bethlehem under quarantine after seven people were diagnosed with the coronavirus there New York state has 22 confirmed coronavirus cases, Governor Andrew Cuomo says. Eighteen US states now have cases California, Washington and Florida states have all declared states of emergency. Ten of the 11 US deaths were in Washington state A cruise ship, the Grand Princess, with 21 people who have symptoms is being held off the coast of San Francisco. Thousands of people are aboard the vessel, which is where California's first victim is thought to have caught the virus The UK has recorded its first death- an older patient with underlying health conditions. The number of UK people diagnosed with the virus has reached 116, a rise of more than 30 since Wednesday Italy reported 41 new deaths, the highest single-day toll so far, bringing its total to 148. The country has closed all schools and universities for at least 10 days The Paris Marathon has been postponed to a later date, French media report. About 65,000 runners were registered to take part, Le Parisien said South Africa's PresidentCyril Ramaphosa warned of a ""national crisis""after the country confirmed its first case The International Monetary Fund has announced $50bn in funding for affected countries How have you been affected by the spread of Covid-19?

He told BBC Question Time individuals should not buy more than they needed. A supermarket executive told the BBC sales of cupboard basics had ""gone through the roof"" and he was not sure the government could guarantee food supply in all instances. The number of confirmed cases in the UK has hit 116 andone person has died.

""Crucially, we are working with the supermarkets to make sure that, if people are self-isolating, then we will be able to get the food and supplies that they need.""

""While I think people don't need to panic buy and should just shop normally, I'm not sure the government can guarantee all food supply in all instances,"" the executive added. A source at a rival supermarket also raised concerns over whether online deliveries could meet the demands of large number of people in self-isolation, with online delivery usually making up only 6-7% of the overall market. ""We can't switch a whole load of new vans on overnight,"" the source said. Downing Street said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had regular meetings with the food industry to discuss risks to the supply chain, with a working group due to meet on Friday.

Prof Whitty said of those confirmed to have the virus in the UK, 18 had recovered and around 45 had been self-isolating at home. ""[If] people have very minimal symptoms and we think they are clinically safe and they are able to self-isolate, we think it is actually safer for them as well as more pleasant if they can self-isolate in their own homes,"" he said, adding that those who need to go to hospital would be treated there.

For those returning from the quarantined towns in Italy, people should self-isolate even if they did not show symptoms. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he did not think a working vaccine to protect people from coronavirus would be produced in time for the current outbreak.

It is the second time that Britons have been stranded on a Princess Cruises vessel because of the outbreak. Japanese authorities said last week thata British tourist who had been on board the Diamond Princess - which was quarantined in Japan - had diedafter contracting the virus. Medical staff prepare to test people on the Grand Princess cruise ship Globally, authorities have confirmed more than 92,000 cases of the virus and more than 3,000 people have died. The vast majority of cases - more than 80,000 - are in China, where the virus originated in December. As passengers cancelled holiday plans, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps criticised rules that led to airlines flying empty planes in order to avoid losing take-off and landing slots at airports. The Airport Coordination Limited (ACL), which coordinates the slots, stipulates that airlines must use 80% of their slots or risk them being taken away in the following year. In a letter to the ACL,external, Mr Shapps called for the rule to be relaxed in order to avoid ""ghost flights"", which he said were ""not in the industry's, the passengers' or the environment's interest"".

Fear returns to stock markets as virus spreads,"Global stock markets have fallen sharply as investors continue to worry about the broader economic effects of the coronavirus. London's FTSE 100 share index fell more than 3% and there were similar declines in other European markets. In the US, upbeat data on hiring and unemployment failed to buoy investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed almost 1% lower, while the Nasdaq slumped 1.8% and S&P 500 ended down 1.7%. The monthly report from the US Labor Department found US employers added 273,000 jobs in February - significantly beating expectations - while the jobless rate fell back to near a 50-year low of 3.5%. The report also revised up estimates of job gains in January and December, finding 85,000 more than previously understood. The surveys, however, reflect data collected before the outbreak intensified. In recent weeks, global travel has plunged, while work, school and shopping has been disrupted in many countries. Despite the strong data, markets were focused on the impact of the virus. ""Today's jobs report is old news,"" said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. The economic strength signalled in the report is a ""little like the saying, the car was in fine condition before being involved in a collision"", said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com. ""The new reality, amid tremendous uncertainty, is the world has experienced a seismic shift,"" he said. Earlier on Friday, markets in Asia had seen big falls, with Japan's Nikkei share index dropping by 2.7%. The 3.6% drop in the FTSE 100 wiped out the gains seen earlier this week on the index. Shares in travel companies again saw some of the steepest falls. Banks also took a hit, as investors anticipate that interest rates might be cut in order to make borrowing cheaper for companies and consumers to keep the economy buoyant. Energy firms were under pressure as well, after the collapse of a proposal by major oil producers to keep oil supply in check sent oil prices tumbling more than 8%. ""The markets didn't even bother with the pretence of a calm start on Friday, bringing another rough week to a close,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst at financial spread better Spreadex. ""The week's various central bank rate cuts only served to reinforce the seriousness of the situation."" Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve, the US's central bank,cut its benchmark interest rateby 0.5 percentage points to a range of 1% to 1.25% in an attempt to ease investor concerns. Many analysts predict it will cut rates again - perhaps as soon as its meeting this month. As traders seek less risky investments, they are turning to government bonds, sending prices higher. The bond market - which is many times larger than the stock market - includes tradable loans to governments and businesses. Yields - how much investors will recoup in interest from the loans - drop as the price of the loan rises. Benchmark 10-year UK government debt now only offers a 0.24% return - a record low. In the US, the yield on a 10-year Treasury also fell to a record low, falling below 0.7%. ""With the 10-year Treasury yield slumping to a new record low and stock markets under pressure again today, it is questionable whether the Fed can wait until its scheduled meeting mid-month to deliver the next rate cut,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.

Test kit shortage in US,"A Coronavirus laboratory test kit used by the CDC The White House has acknowledged the nation does not have enough coronavirus test kits as cases of the disease ticked upwards on both US coasts. Vice-President Mike Pence said the Trump administration would not be able to meet its objective of delivering one million testing kits this week. Congress meanwhile moved with unusual speed to approve a bumper emergency aid package to combat the outbreak. Globally, authorities have confirmed more than 92,000 cases of the virus. Some travellers at Grand Central station in New York wore medical masks The vast majority - 80,552 - are in China, where the virus originated. To date, 3,042 people have died in the country. The US death toll from the coronavirus climbed to 12 on Thursday, with all but one of the victims in the north-western US state of Washington. There are now more than 200 cases of Covid-19 in 20 states. A cruise ship, the Grand Princess, remains off the California coast while passengers are tested for the virus. LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash In Washington, officials in the Seattle area announced 20 new cases of the virus, bringing the total in that state to 70, according to its health department. Nine of the US dead so far were from the same nursing home in suburban Seattle, which is now being investigated by authorities to see if it followed infection-prevention guidelines. Some major Seattle-area businesses, including Microsoft and Amazon, have shut down some operations or urged employees to work from home. New York saw its caseload double overnight to 22, all of them in or near the city. The city's mayor called on the federal government to send more test kits urgently. About 200 people have been quarantined in the US state of Rhode Island because of their links to a school trip to Italy that has resulted in three cases of the coronavirus. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? San Francisco reported its first two cases of the coronavirus on Thursday. And the US state of Maryland confirmed its first three cases, in the Washington DC suburbs. At a press briefing on Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephan Hahn said close to a million tests would be ready by the end of this week. But Vice-President Pence - who is co-ordinating the US response to the outbreak - conceded on Thursday that that target would not be met. ""We don't have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward,"" Mr Pence said during a visit to a factory in Minnesota. Speaking in Washington state in the evening, Mr Pence said: ""We still have a ways to go to ensure that tests are available."" But he said that by the end of next week the US government's diagnostic supplier would distribute kits across the country that would enable 1.2 million Americans to be tested for coronavirus. Stations in Boston have been disinfected President Donald Trump says the US has had relatively few confirmed cases of the virus because of his administration's decision to prohibit US entry to foreign nationals who have visited China - the epicentre of the outbreak - and Iran during the previous 14 days. But health experts fear the virus may be spreading undetected in US communities because of a lack of testing kits. The president is expected to sign an $8.3bn (Â£6.4bn) funding bill passed 96-1 by the US Senate on Thursday. It is intended to help state and local governments combat the coronavirus. Officials ordered a cruise ship with about 3,500 people on board - including 142 Britons - to lie at anchor off the California coast until passengers and crew can be tested, after a previous voyager on the vessel died of the virus. On Thursday, a Coast Guard helicopter lowered test kits on to the 951ft (290m) Grand Princess vessel by rope. The Grand Princess, one of the world's largest cruise ships, is being held off the Californian coast Princess Cruise Lines said fewer than 100 people aboard had been identified for testing. Results are expected by Friday. ""The ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said. A man who sailed on the Grand Princess last month died of the coronavirus on Wednesday. The 71-year-old from the Sacramento area had underlying health conditions, said officials. Two other passengers from that voyage are in hospital with the virus in northern California, officials said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Travel companies were again some of the hardest hit, with shares in Royal Caribbean Cruises sinking more than 16% and Carnival Corp dropping 14%. Airlines also suffered double-digit declines, after the International Air Transport Association warned the industry could lose as much as $113bn this year. In Iran, at least 107 people have died from the virus and authorities have limited travel between major cities to curb the outbreak. Schools are also closed in the country until April Iraq has announced its first two confirmed deaths, one of them in the capital Baghdad Israel and the Palestinian Authority have put the city of Bethlehem under quarantine after seven people were diagnosed with the coronavirus there Canada has announced nine new cases, eight of them in its westernmost province, British Columbia - this brings the national total to 45 The UK recorded its first death on Thursday- an older patient with underlying health conditions. The number of UK people diagnosed with the virus has reached 116, a rise of more than 30 since Wednesday Italy reported 41 new deaths on Thursday, the highest single-day toll so far, bringing its total to 148.

Thousands stranded on cruise ship amid virus fearsPassengers and crew are being tested aboard a cruise ship being held off Californiaâs coast.,"This video can not be played Cruise ship passenger: 'I received death threats for having coronavirus' US President Donald Trump has signed an $8.3bn (Â£6.4bn) emergency bill to combat the coronavirus outbreak. With confirmed US cases reaching 233 - in addition to 14 deaths - Mr Trump urged calm, adding: ""It'll go away."" The White House has faced criticism for its response, and has acknowledged the US does not have enough test kits to meet rising demand. Results are being awaited of tests on passengers on board a cruise ship being held off San Francisco, California. Dozens of passengers were tested on Thursday after a passenger died and at least four others became infected on a previous voyage by the ship, the Grand Princess. More than 100,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide and over 3,400 deaths, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. The majority of cases and deaths are in China, where the virus first emerged in December. Stocks in Asia and the UK fell sharplyon Friday as investors continued to worry about the broader economic effects of the virus. Infections have been reported in 22 states throughout the country. Thirteen of the 14 US fatalities were from the same nursing home in Seattle, Washington State. City officials have recommended that Seattle residents aged 60 or older remain in their homes and cancel events with more than 10 people. On Friday, the University of Washington said it would cancel classes for its 50,000 students - moving teaching online, instead - for the remainder of the winter term, which ends on 20 March. The majority of US patients remain concentrated on the West Coast - combined, Washington state and California account for 141 of the 233 cases - but infections are now spreading across the country. In New York, the number of confirmed cases jumped from 22 to 33 in just one day. Governor Andrew Cuomo said that there were 4,000 people under ""precautionary quarantines"". They were people who have recently returned from places where the outbreak is most severe, including China, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan, but do not have any symptoms.

Dead baby boy found in woodland,"Police remained at the scene on Shore Road in Hythe on Friday morning A baby boy has been found dead in an area of woodland in Hampshire. Police are trying to trace the mother of the newborn, who was discovered close to Shore Road in Hythe, near Southampton, just after 14:00 GMT. The death is being treated as unexplained and anyone with dash-cam footage of the area at the time is asked to contact officers. Det Ch Insp Ross Toms said their priority now was to find the mother of the child. ""I have no doubt this will have been a very distressing experience for the mother of this baby,"" he said. ""Our priority right now is to ensure she receives the care and assistance she requires. ""I want to make a direct appeal to her. ""You may be very frightened right now and it is vitally important that you make contact with us or someone else."" Three police vehicles and a van are parked next to the woods being searched on Shore Road. A small generator is running by the road, powering floodlights that have been used to assist police as they combed the area overnight. Officers are very concerned for the mother's wellbeing and have asked for anyone who may have recently seen a heavily-pregnant woman in the area to get in touch.

Man jailed for licking ice cream in Texas shop,"D'Adrien Anderson was then seen buying the tainted ice cream A man in Texas who filmed himself licking ice cream and putting it back in the freezer of a Walmart supermarket has been jailed for 30 days. The video of D'Adrien Anderson, 24, was shared on social media last August. Surveillance cameras in the shop showed he later took the ice cream back out of the freezer and bought it. He was also given a six-month suspended sentence, 100 hours of unpaid work, a $1,000 (Â£770) fine, and was ordered to pay $1,565 to the ice cream company. The ice-cream-licking happened on 26 August in Port Arthur, about 90 miles (145km) east of Houston. Anderson and his father later returned to the shop to show officers a receipt as proof that he had bought the tainted ice cream, US broadcaster ABC reported. Despite this, the ice cream manufacturer Blue Bell Creameries replaced all of the ice cream in the freezer as a precaution, which cost them $1,565. Anderson pleaded guilty earlier this year to misdemeanour criminal mischief. Outrage over another Texas ice cream licker In a statement released at the time of his arrest, Walmart said: ""If food is tampered with, or a customer wants to leave the impression that they left behind adulterated product, we will move quickly with law enforcement to identify, apprehend and prosecute those who think this is a joke - it is not."" Anderson's ice cream stunt came a month after a very similar video, in whicha teenage girl licked a tub of ice cream and put it back in the freezerat a Walmart in Lufkin, Texas. In that case the girl, who was under 18 at the time, did not buy the ice cream afterwards. The video of her licking the ice cream was viewed more than 13m times.

A second person in the UK has died after contracting coronavirus, the NHS has confirmed. The man, in his early 80s and with underlying health conditions, tested positive for the virus and died at Milton Keynes Hospital on Thursday. The UK's first death linked to the virus was confirmed on Thursday when a woman in her 70s - also with underlying health issues - died in hospital. It comes as the number of confirmed cases in the UK rose to 164. For more details, read the full story. All schools in Italy have been shuttered because of the virus We told you earlier that schools were being closed in some of France's worst-hit areas, but it is not the first country to take such action.

This was as a precautionary measure to stop the spread of coronavirus, reports said. The Austrian government says it will carry out ""spot health checks"" on its border crossings with Italy. The aim is both to identify people who might be infected with coronavirus, as well as to raise awareness and lead to a reduction in cross-border traffic, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said, according to ORF. Direct flights between Austria and Bologna, Milan, Iran and South Korea will be banned for the next two weeks. Austria has 63 confirmed infections, the government said on Friday evening. The UN's climate body has announced that it's cancelling ""physical meetings"" planned to take place in the German city of Bonn and elsewhere amid concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. The UNFCCC described the cancellation of meetings from today until the end of April as an ""exceptional measure"" taken to ""safeguard the health and safety of participants"". It said it was looking into whether the meetings needed to be postponed or could be held via videoconference. The decision comes as the UNFCC prepares for a major UN climate summit, set to be held in the Scottish city of Glasgow in November.

Then messages on social media platforms started circulating warning people not to eat chicken - falsely claims the birds carry the new coronavirus and could pass it on to humans. Since then sales have plummeted. Indian authorities have repeatedly said there is no scientific evidence to the claims. In fact, ministers have even eaten roast chicken during public events to show that the birds are virus free. Traders say small and medium-sized farmers have been hardest hit as the $14bn (Â£10.7bn) industry struggles to correct the misinformation online. All schools and nurseries in two French departments to shut A municipal sign in Crepy-en-Valois announces the closure of facilities for children French Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe has announced that all schools and nurseries in the departments of lâOise, in the north, and le Haut-Rhin, in the north-east, will be closed for two weeks from Monday. They are the worst hit areas in the country, he said at a news briefing. The number of confirmed cases now stands at 613 in France, while nine people have died. At the same briefing, Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said pharmacies would be able to produce and sell their own hand sanitiser - but the price would be regulated. Some surgical face masks would be allowed to be sold in pharmacies, but they would not to be sold to the wider population and just to those in need, Mr VÃ©ran stressed. We've been reporting that the World Health Organization says the total number of cases of coronavirus globally is ""nearing"" 100,000. This is what the WHO's director general told a daily briefing in Geneva on Friday afternoon: We are now on the verge of reaching 100,000 confirmed cases Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, World Health Organization But other organisations - including news agencies such as Reuters and AFP, are keeping their own tallies by adding up figures given by various national and state health officials. Both these news agencies are now reporting that the total number of infections has passed 100,000. At Johns Hopkins University in the US, researchers are maintainingan interactive web-based dashboard,externalto track the outbreak in real time. They also calculate that more than 100,000 people have been infected, and more than 3,400 have died across the world. But as countries including Italy, France and Iran continue to report significant daily increases, the WHO stressed the importance of containment measures to try to slow down the outbreak. We've reported earlier on toilet paper shortages in Australia and some quite original media coverage of the issue(see our 17:00 entry). This panic buying seems to have spread, reaching the UK.

Ontario and British Columbia. Most
cases have been linked to travellers, or their close contacts, returning from

health officials confirmed the first ""community"" case of a person who
had not recently left Canada and had no known contact with someone infected
late this week. On

The MSC Opera's operator said it agreed not to enter the country's port on Friday to ""avoid unnecessary public unrest"".

"Supermarkets won't run of food, vows minister","This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock appeared on Question Time to answer queries about coronavirus The government is ""confident"" food supplies will not run out, amid concerns over coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told BBC Question Time individuals should not buy more than they needed. A supermarket executive told the BBC sales of cupboard basics had ""gone through the roof"" and he was not sure the government could guarantee food supply in all instances. The number of confirmed cases in the UK has hit 116 andone person has died. The first fatality in the UK linked to the virus, which was announced on Thursday, was a woman in her 70s with underlying health conditions. She was admitted to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading and died after testing positive for the virus. LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Responding to a question about panic-buyingfrom a Question Time audience member, Mr Hancock said there was ""absolutely no need"" for people to buy in excess. ""The government has supplies of the key things that are needed. And within the food supply, we are absolutely confident that there won't be a problem there,"" he said. ""Crucially, we are working with the supermarkets to make sure that, if people are self-isolating, then we will be able to get the food and supplies that they need."" But a leading supermarket executivetold BBC business editor Simon Jackhe was baffled by Mr Hancock's claim to be working with supermarkets on this issue, saying: ""We haven't heard anything from government directly."" Two of Crufts' major sponsors have asked staff not to attend the dog show in Birmingham He said sales of cupboard basics such as pasta and tinned goods had ""gone through the roof"" and teams were working ""round the clock"" to keep shelves stocked, using processes and staffing levels set up in case of a no-deal Brexit. ""While I think people don't need to panic buy and should just shop normally, I'm not sure the government can guarantee all food supply in all instances,"" the executive added. A source at a rival supermarket also raised concerns over whether online deliveries could meet the demands of large number of people in self-isolation, with online delivery usually making up only 6-7% of the overall market. ""We can't switch a whole load of new vans on overnight,"" the source said. Downing Street said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had regular meetings with the food industry to discuss risks to the supply chain, with a working group due to meet on Friday. ""Defra will continue to work on this issue. We have resilient supply chains,"" a No 10 spokesman said. Woman in 70s becomes first virus fatality in UK Thousands stranded on cruise ship amid virus fears Starbucks bans reusable cups in response to virus The British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, said there had been only limited disruption to supply chains so far and availability of products on shelves remained good. For self-isolating customers, it said most retailers would be more than happy for online deliveries to delivered to doorsteps. Some customers have reported shop shelves running low on products like toilet roll Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, also said there was ""no need"" for the public to stockpile food or medicine, adding that the outbreak would be a ""marathon not a sprint"". The government has said it has a stockpile of important medicines and protective equipment, to counter any impact to global supply chains. Sponsors not attending Crufts over coronavirus Coronavirus: Are people panic-buying? Prof Whitty said of those confirmed to have the virus in the UK, 18 had recovered and around 45 had been self-isolating at home. ""[If] people have very minimal symptoms and we think they are clinically safe and they are able to self-isolate, we think it is actually safer for them as well as more pleasant if they can self-isolate in their own homes,"" he said, adding that those who need to go to hospital would be treated there. The number of people self-isolating is likely to rise further afterthe government said people who developed symptoms,externalafter returning from anywhere in Italy - not just the north of the country - should stay at home. For those returning from the quarantined towns in Italy, people should self-isolate even if they did not show symptoms. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he did not think a working vaccine to protect people from coronavirus would be produced in time for the current outbreak. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""not unreasonable to assume"" there would be a vaccine in a year or 18 months. What are the refund rules around cancelled events?

White House acknowledges coronavirus test shortage,"A Coronavirus laboratory test kit used by the CDC The White House has acknowledged the nation does not have enough coronavirus test kits as cases of the disease ticked upwards on both US coasts. Vice-President Mike Pence said the Trump administration would not be able to meet its objective of delivering one million testing kits this week. Congress meanwhile moved with unusual speed to approve a bumper emergency aid package to combat the outbreak. Globally, authorities have confirmed more than 92,000 cases of the virus. Some travellers at Grand Central station in New York wore medical masks The vast majority - 80,552 - are in China, where the virus originated. To date, 3,042 people have died in the country. The US death toll from the coronavirus climbed to 12 on Thursday, with all but one of the victims in the north-western US state of Washington. There are now more than 200 cases of Covid-19 in 20 states. A cruise ship, the Grand Princess, remains off the California coast while passengers are tested for the virus.

Nine of the US dead so far were from the same nursing home in suburban Seattle, which is now being investigated by authorities to see if it followed infection-prevention guidelines. Some major Seattle-area businesses, including Microsoft and Amazon, have shut down some operations or urged employees to work from home. New York saw its caseload double overnight to 22, all of them in or near the city. The city's mayor called on the federal government to send more test kits urgently. About 200 people have been quarantined in the US state of Rhode Island because of their links to a school trip to Italy that has resulted in three cases of the coronavirus.

And the US state of Maryland confirmed its first three cases, in the Washington DC suburbs. At a press briefing on Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephan Hahn said close to a million tests would be ready by the end of this week. But Vice-President Pence - who is co-ordinating the US response to the outbreak - conceded on Thursday that that target would not be met. ""We don't have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward,"" Mr Pence said during a visit to a factory in Minnesota. Speaking in Washington state in the evening, Mr Pence said: ""We still have a ways to go to ensure that tests are available."" But he said that by the end of next week the US government's diagnostic supplier would distribute kits across the country that would enable 1.2 million Americans to be tested for coronavirus. Stations in Boston have been disinfected President Donald Trump says the US has had relatively few confirmed cases of the virus because of his administration's decision to prohibit US entry to foreign nationals who have visited China - the epicentre of the outbreak - and Iran during the previous 14 days. But health experts fear the virus may be spreading undetected in US communities because of a lack of testing kits. The president is expected to sign an $8.3bn (Â£6.4bn) funding bill passed 96-1 by the US Senate on Thursday. It is intended to help state and local governments combat the coronavirus. Officials ordered a cruise ship with about 3,500 people on board - including 142 Britons - to lie at anchor off the California coast until passengers and crew can be tested, after a previous voyager on the vessel died of the virus. On Thursday, a Coast Guard helicopter lowered test kits on to the 951ft (290m) Grand Princess vessel by rope. The Grand Princess, one of the world's largest cruise ships, is being held off the Californian coast Princess Cruise Lines said fewer than 100 people aboard had been identified for testing. Results are expected by Friday. ""The ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said. A man who sailed on the Grand Princess last month died of the coronavirus on Wednesday. The 71-year-old from the Sacramento area had underlying health conditions, said officials. Two other passengers from that voyage are in hospital with the virus in northern California, officials said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It looked like it could have been four or five. ""I don't think Phil Neville got the best out of the players tonight. We look scrappy and there are players on that team who  I know can do better than they are. ""I don't want to sound too negative but that just wasn't good enough."" Allow Twitter content?

USA 2-0 Engand Alex ScottEx-England international on BBC Two I am trying to find positives from today's game. We are not in the same bracket as the USA, we are below. We have a huge 16 months to raise the level. We need to go into the home Euros next year better than we are showing. We need to find a winning mentality. Carli Lloyd dominated us today. If we're seriously talking about wanting to win gold medals we need to up our levels in all areas. USA 2-0 England All over! USA start the SheBelieves Cup with a deserved win. USA 2-0 England Nice skill from Kelley O'Hara following a corner as she knocks the ball past a defender but her cross is headed over. USA 2-0 England Another change for England as young Everton forward Chloe Kelly comes on for Nikita Parris. The USA also make a change as Carli Loyd is replaced by Jess McDonald. USA 2-0 England Sue SmithFormer England forward on BBC Two The fact England went in at 0-0 was positive and they created a couple of opportunities. But when you're playing against a team of this quality you have to take your chances. You can't give them the time and space England did for the goals. If you do, they punish you and that's what happened. USA 2-0 England Strong finish by the USA with England struggling to get out of their own half now. Did Phil Neville select the right team for this game? Beth England may have done better with a couple of the chances that came England's way but we can never know for sure. USA 2-0 England Feels like both teams are just winding down the clock now. There's a little less desire from England to chase loose balls and instead it is USA who are looking most likely to score again. USA 2-0 England Sue SmithFormer England forward on BBC Two I'm a big fan of Beth England. She's been excellent this season and I just think if you give her an opportunity she will take it. USA 2-0 England Beth England - a player many felt should have started this game - is on now for Ellen White. She is on just in time to see Julie Ertz thump a superb strike into the back of the net, but the USA midfielder is denied the goal by the offside flag. USA 2-0 England Emma SandersBBC Sport at Exploria Stadium, Orlando The world champions are completely dominating now. England have been trying, and failing, to play out from the back all game. Phil Neville was about to burst into flames after that last passage of play. USA 2-0 England There's 16,531 at the Exploria Stadium today. Good crowd and they've certainly been entertained by an impressive USA display. USA 2-0 England The USA are gifted a free-kick 25 yards from goal following a handball. Megan Rapinoe fancies her chances but blasts well over. Julie Ertz then flicks over the bar after powering through England's static defence. USA 2-0 England Carly Telford pushes away a low Megan Rapinoe cross but the flag is up for offside with Rapinoe having just strayed behind the England defence when she received the ball. All USA in these latter stages, though. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Study finds 90% of people are biased against womenThe UN Development Programme analysed biases against gender in 75 countries around the world.,"The report analysed areas of bias such as politics, education, reproductive rights and integrity A new UN report has found almost 90% of men and women hold some sort of bias against females. The ""Gender Social Norms"" index analysed biases in areas such as politics and education in 75 countries. Globally, close to 50% of men said they had more right to a job than women. Almost a third of respondents thought it was acceptable for men to hit their partners. There are no countries in the world with gender equality,external, the study found. Zimbabwe had the highest amount of bias with only 0.27% of people reporting no gender bias at all. At the other end of the scale was Andorra where 72% of people reported no bias. In Zimbabwe, 96% of people expressed a bias against women's physical integrity - a measure covering support for violence against women and opposition to reproductive rights. In the Philippines, 91% of people held views that were detrimental to women's physical integrity. Reform and repression go hand in hand in Saudi Arabia The women who dream of power-sharing According to the report, about half of the world's men and women feel that men make better political leaders. In China, 55% of people thought men were better suited to be political leaders. Around 39% of people in the US, which is yet to have a female president, thought men made better leaders. However in New Zealand, a country that currently has a female leader, only 27% of people thought that. In New Zealand, a country which has a female leader, 27% of people think men would be better leaders than women The number of female heads of government is lower today than five years ago with only 10 women in such positions in 193 countries, down from 15 in 2014. However when it comes to seats in parliament, there is a slightly higher percentage of women in these roles. Latin America and the Caribbean had the highest share of seats in parliament held by women with 31%. South Asian countries had the lowest percentage at just 17%. Pedro ConceiÃ§Ã£o, head of UNDP's Human Development Report Office said: ""We have come a long way in recent decades to ensure that women have the same access to life's basic needs as men. ""But gender gaps are still all too obvious in other areas, particularly those that challenge power relations and are most influential in actually achieving true equality. Today. the fight about gender equality is a story of bias and prejudices."" Women are paid less than men and are much less likely to be in senior positions. Globally, 40% of people thought men made better business executives. In the UK, 25% of people thought men should have more right to a job than women and said men made better business executives than women did. In India that figure was 69%. Raquel Lagunas, UNDP gender team acting director said: ""We must act now to break through the barrier of bias and prejudices if we want to see progress at the speed and scale needed to achieve gender equality.""

Man jailed for licking ice cream in Texas shopA social media video showed D'Adrien Anderson licking ice cream and putting it back.US & Canada,"D'Adrien Anderson was then seen buying the tainted ice cream A man in Texas who filmed himself licking ice cream and putting it back in the freezer of a Walmart supermarket has been jailed for 30 days. The video of D'Adrien Anderson, 24, was shared on social media last August. Surveillance cameras in the shop showed he later took the ice cream back out of the freezer and bought it. He was also given a six-month suspended sentence, 100 hours of unpaid work, a $1,000 (Â£770) fine, and was ordered to pay $1,565 to the ice cream company. The ice-cream-licking happened on 26 August in Port Arthur, about 90 miles (145km) east of Houston. Anderson and his father later returned to the shop to show officers a receipt as proof that he had bought the tainted ice cream, US broadcaster ABC reported. Despite this, the ice cream manufacturer Blue Bell Creameries replaced all of the ice cream in the freezer as a precaution, which cost them $1,565. Anderson pleaded guilty earlier this year to misdemeanour criminal mischief. Outrage over another Texas ice cream licker In a statement released at the time of his arrest, Walmart said: ""If food is tampered with, or a customer wants to leave the impression that they left behind adulterated product, we will move quickly with law enforcement to identify, apprehend and prosecute those who think this is a joke - it is not."" Anderson's ice cream stunt came a month after a very similar video, in whicha teenage girl licked a tub of ice cream and put it back in the freezerat a Walmart in Lufkin, Texas. In that case the girl, who was under 18 at the time, did not buy the ice cream afterwards. The video of her licking the ice cream was viewed more than 13m times.
