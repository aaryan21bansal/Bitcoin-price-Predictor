Global shares plunge in worst day since financial crisis,"Shares around the world had their worst day since the financial crisis with the dramatic falls leading to the day being dubbed ""Black Monday"". The main financial indexes in the US closed down by more than 7%, while London's index of top shares ended the day nearly 8% lower. Similar drops took place across Europe and Asia as a row between Russia and Saudi Arabia saw oil prices plunge. Shares were already reeling from fears of the impact of coronavirus. Analysts described the market reaction as ""utter carnage"". In the US, the major stock indexes fell so sharply at the start of trading, that the buying and selling of shares was halted for 15 minutes, as a so-called ""circuit breaker"" aimed at curbing panicky selling came into effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank by 7.8% or more than 2,000 points - the biggest points-drop in history and the largest decline in percentage terms since the financial crisis. The S&P 500 fell 7.6%, while the Nasdaq dropped about 7.3%. The declines in London wiped some Â£125bn off the value of major UK firms. The UK and US falls were mirrored by similar declines in Europe, with the main stock market indexes in France, Germany and Spain all closing over 7% lower. ""There is panic setting into the market right now,"" said Andrew Lo, professor of finance at MIT's Sloan School of Management. ""Things are going to get worse before they get better."" The dramatic drops were triggered by a row between Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil output. Saudi Arabia said it would slash prices and pump more oil, sparking fears of a price war. This came after Russia rejected a proposal by oil exporters to cut supply to cope with lower demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. Analysts said Saudi Arabia was ""flexing its muscles"" to protect its position in the oil market. On Monday, the price of international oil benchmark Brent fell almost a third in its biggest drop since the Gulf War in 1991 before recovering slightly to trade 20% lower. The price of oil had already fallen sharply this year as the coronavirus began to spread internationally, with demand for fuel expected to decline. Those conditions make Saudi Arabia's decision to increase output ""extremely surprising"", said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""This is not the first time that we've had a shock to the oil market, but it is the first time that I can recall that you've had a supply shock and a demand shock at the same time,"" he said. ""The craziness that you're seeing in the oil prices today, and companies related to oil and gas, is a reflection of this being pretty unprecedented."" In the US and UK, oil firms led the market declines, with shares in Shell, BP and Chevron down about 15% or more. Premier Oil saw its shares more than halve in value. In Frankfurt and Paris, banks were hit hardest, while the Russian rouble tumbled about 8% to its weakest level since 2016. In Brazil, steep falls in morning trade also triggered a temporary pause with shares ending the day down 12%. Earlier, Asian markets had also fallen sharply, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index down 5% while Australia's ASX 200 slumped 7.3% - its biggest daily drop since 2008. In China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite fell 3%, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index sank 4.2%. Elsewhere on the markets, the price of gold hitting a seven-year high at one point, trading at $1,700 per ounce. Gold is often seen as a desirable asset to hold in times of uncertainty. And in a historic moment, demand for benchmark UK government bonds for two-, three-, four-, six- and seven-year maturities pushed prices so high that yields - or the rate of return on the bond - briefly turned negative for the first time. A negative yield means investors will lose money from holding the bond. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. While people have in the past responded to lower oil prices with making travel plans and other spending, the coronavirus is likely to curb that response, said Beth Ann Bovino, chief US economist at S&P Global Ratings. And economists have said that if the decline in oil prices continue, they are likely to have far-reaching economic effects. This could potentially raise risk in debt markets or hurt investment in the energy sector, which plays an important economic role in many parts of the US. With uncertainty about the economy driven by questions about the coronavirus outbreak, leaders have a ""limited window of opportunity to contain the panic"", Prof Lo added. ""We can ask the public to be as confident as we want, but that's not going to restore confidence unless they see real progress,"" he said.

Wales' first cases involvedone person from Swanseaandone from Cardiff, who had also returned from northern Italy. Public Health Wales said the latest patients were being treated in ""clinically appropriate settings"". ""We've said for a long time we expect there to be more cases - and we expect more in the coming days and weeks as well,"" said Health Minister Vaughan Gething. Along with First Minister Mark Drakeford, he was involved with other ministers from across the UK at Monday's Cobra meeting and reiterated that the current scientific advice was for no schools to close and not to end mass gatherings at events. Mr Gething said Wales was still at an early stage and he urged the public to take hygiene advice and get on with their normal business. ""We are still in the contain phase. It is still effective in keeping the public safe,"" he said. He added there was currently no justification for closing schools or cancelling big events, with the Wales v Scotland Six Nations game set to go ahead this weekend.

These could include banning of big events, closing schools and encouraging home working. It comes after a man in his 60s became the UK's third death linked to the Covid-19 virus.

Pixar's Onward 'banned by four countries',"Pixar's latest animation Onward has been banned by several Middle Eastern countries because of a reference to lesbian parents,according to reports,external. The family film will not be shown in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, Hollywood media have reported. Police officer Specter, voiced by Lena Waithe, has been heralded as Disney-Pixar's first openly gay character. Her lines include: ""It's not easy being a parent... my girlfriend's daughter got me pulling my hair out, OK?"" Other Middle East countries like Bahrain, Lebanon and Egypt are showing the film. And according to Deadline, Russia censored the scene in question by changing the word ""girlfriend"" to ""partner"" and avoiding mentioning the gender of Specter, who is a supporting character. Tom Holland (left) and Chris Pratt voice the brothers at the centre of Onward's story Speaking to Variety,external, Waithe explained that the line about ""my girlfriend"" was her idea. ""I said, 'Can I say the word girlfriend, is that cool?' ""I was just like, 'It sounds weird.' I even have a gay voice, I think. I don't think I sound right saying 'Husband.' They were like, 'Oh yeah, do that.' They were so cool and chilled. And it ended up being something special."" Waithe has also starred in Ready Player One and Westworld, and recently wrote and produced Queen & Slim. Set in a suburban fantasy world, Onward is about two teenage elf brothers (voiced by Chris Pratt and Tom Holland) who go on an adventure after their mum gives them special gifts from their deceased father, including a letter that can resurrect him for just one day. Onward topped the North American box office chart on its opening weekend, with takings of $40m (Â£30.5m), which was in line with predictions. Overall box office receipts were significantly down this weekend, but experts don't believe the fear of coronavirus was to blame. ""I think there was zero impact,"" Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst with Comscore, said. ""With $40m for Onward, a small drop off for The Invisible Man ($15.5m/Â£11.8m) and The Way Back ($8.5m/Â£6.5m) getting solid scores from audiences, it looks like people are in the habit of going to the movies."" The virus has forced the release of the next James Bond film to be postponed, with Hollywood waiting to see what impact the outbreak will have on ticket sales for other films. Coronavirus: After James Bond delay, what next for Hollywood's new releases? Meanwhile, more major Hollywood films have encountered problems with censors in conservative countries as more gay characters have been portrayed. Last year,Russia censored scenes in the Sir Elton John biopic Rocketmanand Avengers: Endgame as a result of LGBT references. In 2017,Disney's Beauty and the Beast was banned in markets including Kuwait and Malaysiaover a reference to Josh Gad's character LeFou being gay. Russia gave it an over-16 rating.

British Steel sold to Chinese firm Jingye,"A Chinese firm completed its takeover of British Steel on Monday. Jingye Group said that the move would save more than 3,000 jobs in Scunthorpe and Teesside and it would modernise the towns' steelworks. The firm reportedly offered Â£50m to buy the companyafter it collapsed and was placed under the control of the UK Insolvency Service last year. Unions have said that although the deal ""must be celebrated"", about 450 workers still face losing their jobs. British Steel employed about 5,000 people at the time of its collapse, and is the second-largest steelmaker in the country. The sale includes the steelworks at Scunthorpe, mills in Teesside and Skinningrove, as well as the TSP Engineering business based in Cumbria. Jingye Group, which also makes steel, has promised to invest about Â£1.2bn over the next 10 years on upgrading its plants and machinery. Jingye's chief executive, Li Hiuming, said: ""It has not been an easy journey since we first announced our intentions in November. ""But the longer I have spent in Scunthorpe, the more I have come to believe in the successful future of these steelworks and the employees that have made them famous throughout the world."" He added that the deal marks the ""beginning of a new illustrious chapter"" in the history of British steelmaking. Charlotte Childs, an organiser for the GMB union, described the deal as ""a big win for the industry"", but expressed disappointment at job cuts. She said: ""It is heartbreaking that long-serving members of high-skilled staff, many of whom have given their entire career to British steel, are seen as surplus to requirements."" Tony Watson worked on and off for British Steel from the age of 16. Tony Watson, a British Steel worker and GMB union convenor, is one of those who has been made redundant. Mr Watson, who worked for British Steel on and off since the age of 16, told the BBC he received an email from HR with the news. ""The way the process has been done has been a bit brutal,"" he said. But Mr Watson added that he was ""feeling optimistic"" about the prospect of hunting for a new job at age 59. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he wanted ""to reassure British Steel employees who may be facing redundancy that we are mobilising all available resources to give immediate on the ground support and advice to those affected"". Confirmation of the takeover follows months of uncertainty for workers. The government has kept British Steel running since last May, as it looked for a buyer for the business.Jingye signed an agreement to purchase British Steel in Novemberafter talks between the Official Receiver, which handled the insolvency process, and a Turkish bidder fell apart. The Official Receiver said that it was ""grateful"" to British Steel employees for their professionalism during a difficult time. Unions have said that nearly 500 British Steel workers could still face losing their jobs In January, the French government said it might veto the dealbecause it considered British Steel's plant in Hayange a strategic national asset. Located in north-east France, the plant is seen as important because it supplies track for the country's railways. Jingye's boss said earlier this year that he remained ""interested"" in purchasing the plant, but has pressed on with purchasing assets in the UK and the Netherlands. British Steel was formed in 2016 after being sold by India's Tata for Â£1 to the private equity firm Greybull Capital. It entered insolvency less than three years later.It had sought financial support from the governmentbefore it was placed in liquidation. They've been making iron and steel in Scunthorpe for more than 150 years. This is very much a one-industry town and when the steelworks struggles the whole community feels it. The plant directly employs almost 3,000 people but supports another 20,000 jobs in the wider supply chain. From hairdressers to market traders, businesses say they've noticed people reining in their spending amid the ongoing uncertainty. The bulk of British Steel's staff work at the Scunthorpe plant The loss-making steel plant has had a string of owners over the decades from Corus to Tata Steel to Greybull Capital - all tried and failed to turn the business around. A fourth-generation steelworker told me back in May that it felt as though they were ""staring over the edge of the abyss"" as the plant was on the brink of closure with mass redundancies ahead. But - again - Scunthorpe steelworks has been rescued by a new owner at the eleventh hour promising huge investment. There is some scepticism about how much influence China will soon have in the UK steel industry. While steelworkers are deeply relieved that the takeover is going ahead, they are asking what Jingye can and will do differently amid tough global trading conditions where many before have struggled.

UK prepares to ask even mildly sick to stay home,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our scientists think containment is extremely unlikely to work on its own"" People who show ""even minor"" signs of respiratory tract infections or a fever will soon be told to self-isolate in an effort to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. The UK government's chief medical adviser said the change in advice could happen within the next 10 to 14 days. Five people have now died from coronavirus in the UK. It comes as the Foreign Office warned British residents against all but essential travel to Italy. Italian authorities are extending strict coronavirus quarantine measures- which include a ban on public gatherings - to the entire country from Tuesday. A spokesman for the UK Foreign Office said anyone who arrives from Italy from Tuesday should self-isolate for 14 days. Italy has more than 9,100 confirmed infections, and more than 460 people have died. In the UK, there were319 confirmed cases of coronavirus as of 09:00 GMT,externalon Monday, a rise of 46 since the same time on Sunday. Coronavirus: UK supermarket delivery hours extended Black Monday: Shares face biggest fall since crisis UK to remain in coronavirus 'containment' phase Unit set up to counter false coronavirus claims People will be asked to self-isolate for seven days after showing mild symptoms under the new approach, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said. All intensive care patients will now be tested for the virus, he said - as well as anyone in hospital with a respiratory infection. It comes as two more deaths in the UK were announced. Both patients - who were in hospital in Wolverhampton and Carshalton, south London, respectively - were in their 70s and had underlying health conditions. In a joint press conference with Prof Whitty in Downing Street, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also suggested the elderly and vulnerable could be asked to stay home in the near future, with further steps set out ""in the days and weeks ahead"". He said that the more the peak of the spread could be delayed to summer, ""the better the NHS will be able to manage"". EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Meanwhile,global shares have suffered their worst day since the financial crisis. Dramatic falls led to it being called Black Monday, with a nearly 8% drop in London's FTSE 100 wiping some Â£125bn off the value of major UK firms. In the US the major stock indexes fell so sharply as the market opened that trading was halted for 15 minutes to curb panicky selling. Can you stop people stockpiling? Coronavirus symptoms 'take five days to show' All of Italy facing coronavirus lockdown Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to urgently ""reassure the public and markets"". Mr McDonnell said Mr Sunak must use Wednesday's Budget to make clear the government would do ""everything necessary"" to support the economy as the virus spreads. ""In these circumstances you need to be fast in demonstrating that there is a clear plan,"" he said. Tesco is one of the retailers restricting sales of items such as toilet roll The government has announced it is to extend shop delivery hoursto ensure that supermarkets have basic items, amid stockpiling concerns. A European Union expert said the UK had only a ""few days"" to implement measures to prevent an outbreak like the one in Italy.

London mayoral candidate Rory Stewart has called the UK government's measures ""half-hearted"". Mr Stewart, a former Conservative minister, said the UK should act ""much more aggressively"", adding: ""The government has made a serious mistake today... schools should be shut now."" But the prime minister said the government must ""take the right decisions at the right time"". Meanwhile, universal credit claimants who have to self-isolate will not be sanctioned, a work and pensions minister has confirmed. Dublin has cancelled its annual St Patrick's Day parade (file photo) in a bid to contain the virus A number of public and sporting events have been cancelled or postponed due to fears large gatherings could further spread the virus. Dublin's annual St Patrick's Day parade, the largest on the island of Ireland, was cancelled on Monday, as the total number of positive cases in the Republic rose to 21 The France v Ireland Six Nations rugby game - which was set to be held in Paris on Saturday - has been postponed England's Six Nations games against Italy on 14 and 15 March have been postponed - affecting the men's, women's and under-20s contests. It came after the Italian government ordered all sporting fixtures to be played behind closed doors until 3 April in a bid to contain the outbreak Ireland's Six Nations fixtures at home against Italy on 7 and 8 March were postponed last week The Indian Wells tennis tournament, one of the most prestigious outside of the Grand Slams, has been cancelled, with some players having already arrived in California for the event The London Book Fair, one of the UK's largest book events, was called off after a number of publishers and agencies pulled out of the event The UK is currently in the first phase - ""containment"" - ofthe government's four-part plan,external. Mr Johnson said the government is preparing to move to the second phase - ""delay"" - which will seek to push back the peak of the epidemic to the summer, when there will be less pressure on the NHS. Prof Whitty said introducing measures ""too early"" could become problematic as ""anything we do, we have got to be able to sustain"". This is very much the first step in a gradual and phased approach to reducing the impact coronavirus will have in the UK. A significant outbreak is on its way but the government and its advisers believe they can limit its impact by taking the right steps at the right time. We know the first step is to get people with even relatively moderate flu-like symptoms to self-isolate. To date only those who have been to an affected country or who had had close contact with an infected person had been asked to do this. This will be followed by further advice later this week that is likely to be focused on protecting the most vulnerable groups - the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions. Reducing social contact will form part of that. But drastic steps like closing schools and banning public gatherings are not going to happen in the immediate future. Prof Whitty said that the balance would tip so that more people would suffer from coronavirus rather than regular seasonal flu, or other respiratory infections. ""We are expecting the numbers to increase initially quite slowly but really quite fast after a while and we have to catch it before the upswing begins,"" he said. The government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) is due to meet on Tuesday, followed by another meeting of the emergency committee, Cobra, on Wednesday. US authorities are planning to fly home Britons who were on board the virus-hit Grand Princess cruise ship on Tuesday, the Foreign Office said.

""We know when we dock, that the Americans will be getting off first and that is going to take, they reckon, two to three days, and I think we are after that, hopefully.""

All of Italy to be placed on coronavirus lockdown,"This video can not be played Italians queued at supermarkets after the nationwide lockdown was announced Italy has extended its emergency coronavirus measures, which include travel restrictions and a ban on public gatherings, to the entire country. On Monday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte ordered people to stay home and seek permission for essential travel. He said the measures were designed to protect the most vulnerable. ""There is no more time,"" he said in a TV address. Italy's coronavirus death toll jumped from 366 to 463 on Monday. It is the worst-hit country after China. The number of confirmed infection also increased by 24% from Sunday, official figures showed. Cases of the virus have been confirmed in all 20 Italian regions. Latest updates here Mr Conte said the best thing was for people to stay at home. ""We're having an important growth in infection... and of deaths,"" he said in an evening address.

Italians have been ordered to stay at home in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus Mr Conte described the measures as ""I stay home"" - with people forbidden to gather in public. ""No more nightlife; we can't allow this anymore since they are occasions for contagion,"" he said. All sporting events - including football matches - are suspended nationwide. Schools and universities will remain closed until 3 April. Coronavirus symptoms 'take five days to show' The government said only those with a valid work or family reason that cannot be postponed will be allowed to travel.

'Italy lockdown cut me off from my husband',"Kaila, centre right, and her husband Raffaele with their family Kaila Haines is a US citizen married to an Italian man and has been living in Italy for 30 years. She lives in Monfalcone, east of Venice, where her husband is undergoing self-imposed quarantine after exhibiting flu-like symptoms, but is currently stuck in Milan, where she was working when the quarantine came into force. Here she describes the situation: I work in Milan Monday to Friday and go back on the weekend. My husband is a university professor in Venice. In recent months we've been hearing about these cases but it's been pretty much business as usual. About one in 10 people have been in masks, but it's been very laid-back despite all the hype and doom and gloom on the news. But then at the beginning of last week, my husband came down with the fever. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? IMMUNITY:Are women and children less affected? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The health ministry has asked anybody who has a fever or flu-like symptoms just to isolate themselves. Let's not take any chances, stay home for 20 days. So that's what he did. I was supposed to be going home this past weekend and did not because he was sick and in isolation. Then I got stuck here in Milan because over the weekend they imposed this shutdown in the Lombardy region. So I'm here until 3 April but he'll come out of isolation on 20 March. It's very surreal. I went out yesterday morning to the grocery store because I was kind of curious to see if everyone was making a run on pasta and things like that. You read the newspapers and that's what everyone is saying. The situation was quite tense because there was a person on the loudspeaker who was reminding everyone in the store every 30 seconds that they had to keep their one-metre distance from each other. Quarantined inside Italy's red zone Northern Italy quarantines 16 million people Britons urged not to visit Italy quarantine areas They were quite aggressively inviting everyone to keep their distance. That was quite an unusual feeling. But overall there was no run on the supermarket. Everyone was just like me, running out of milk and getting a few things they needed for the weekend. From that respect it was pretty relaxed. Then I walked down one of the main shopping roads and about 70% of the stores were closed. The bars were open. It was a gorgeous day so everyone was out on their bicycles. Most of the bars have tables outside and I could see they had distanced the tables, so there are less tables than there used to be. There were people having their coffee on the sidewalk at their little cafe, so it was very relaxed. Kaila Haines with her family in Milan in happier times There wasn't a sense of panic or urgency. I think it might take a while for people to realise they need to be a little more careful in keeping their distance and things like that. This week I'm on vacation but I will have to work from home. I'm taking it in my stride. My husband only had a fever for a few days. He has a little bit of a cough and he's going a little stir crazy. We have neighbours who are doing the grocery shopping and leaving it at the door for him. He said he's going to have to learn how to cook -  he doesn't know how to cook. We celebrated our 30th anniversary in September. It's not been easy. It's been a challenging year for us in general because I got a promotion and now we see each other on the weekends, but now it's tough. Thank goodness for WhatsApp. How can you keep yourself and your family safe?

Parents stressed by Italy shutdown,"A cleaner sanitises an empty classroom in Turin At the San Cosimato playground in Rome, parents have that unmistakeable look of ""how on Earth am I going to entertain them?"" The perennial problem has struck early this year: with schools and universities now closed across Italy until at least 15 March, in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, some 8.4 million children are out of class well before the Easter break. It's an unprecedented response by Europe's worst-hit country. Malvina Diletti watches her eight-year-old, Edoardo, play on the climbing frame. ""We think 10 days off is totally useless, it's not even enough to discover if you're sick,"" she says. ""So they'll probably extend it, which is bad as it's tiring to have them home all the time. They may be happy today - it's the first day - but they'll get bored eventually."" They are heading home for lunch with six other children, as parents are taking it in turn to host, sharing the babysitting load during this difficult period. ""It's so we avoid grandparents having to stay with us,"" Malvina tells me, ""because if more elderly got sick, hospitals would just crash."" On Thursday the Italian authorities reported 41 deaths from the virus in the past 24 hours, raising the total death toll to 148 in Italy. Currently 3,296 people are infected in the country. This was the first country in Europe to ban all flights to China; the first to cordon off entire towns; and now it's the first to close all schools and universities, a dramatic effort to limit a worsening outbreak. ""Maybe they've done it to protect the older teachers,"" says Malvina, ""since the children are still mixing out of school. ""It doesn't really make sense - but we accept it and will do it for the community."" Edoardo says he's enjoying being off school, ""but it's strange because it's the first time"". I ask if he understands why it's happening. ""Yes,"" he replies, ""it's to stop us getting sick."" LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 Some families and teachers are adapting to the huge disruption with the help of technology. In the northern town of Busto Arsizio, part of the region worst hit by the virus, the Tosi High School is using web-learning to stream classes. ""Our lessons continue uninterrupted,"" says Amanda Ferrario, the headteacher. ""The teacher enters a virtual classroom, does the roll call and can see students connected on their devices. They can work in groups, make presentations and show videos."" The school is part of a network, Ashoka Changemakers, whose investment in the resource is paying off. ""This could be a turning point in Italian education,"" she says, ""and a chance to create innovative methods. ""Other schools may struggle because perhaps their teachers aren't trained. We're supporting those that ask for our help, as there are very few like us."" Some schools are recording entire lessons on WhatsApp, while others are incorporating the news into their lessons, one teacher telling an Italian newspaper that she'd asked pupils to come up with stories about ""the monster of coronavirus"". She added that ""facing coronavirus helps overcome fear"". Rome in crisis: A pedestrian area near St Peter's Square is almost deserted Italians are adjusting to the crisis - but the reality is hitting hard. And while there doesn't appear to be panic about the spread of cases itself, there is deepening concern about the economic impact. At the Royal Santina Hotel beside Rome's Termini Station, just 20 of the 120 rooms are occupied, and 90% of bookings for March have been cancelled. The corridors feel eerily quiet. ""This is the worst I've seen in my 35 years here,"" says owner Giuseppe Roscioli. ""It's the first time that we've lost almost all the international market - from the US, Asia and the Middle East - as well as the domestic market from Italian tourists and group bookings."" What will happen if the situation continues? ""I have the key - I can lock the door,"" he says. Empty shelves in a Milan shop: The scare has triggered some panic-buying Italy's tourism sector is now predicted to lose â¬7.4bn (Â£6.4bn; $8.3bn) as a result of the outbreak. From the Colosseum to the Trevi Fountain, Rome's must-see sights are being seen by so few. ""I thought it would be fuller than it is,"" says Jill Saunderson from the UK, while enjoying St Peter's Square. ""All the waiters we've spoken to are petrified for their livelihoods. We wanted to come - we're quite healthy and we think there's a lot of scaremongering going on."" Health, the economy, even Italians' way of life: all are now facing an unparalleled challenge. There is shock here at seeing how vulnerable this economy is to events beyond Italy's control. And for many the most damaging thing is not knowing when this uncertainty will pass.

Coronavirus deaths jump in Italy's 'darkest hour',"Detainees protest on the roof of the San Vittore prison in Milan Italy's coronavirus death toll has jumped by 97 to 463, as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte described the outbreak as the country's ""darkest hour"". The number of confirmed infections in Italy also increased to 9,172, up from 7,375 on Sunday, official figures show. Italy is the worst-hit country after China, with cases of the virus confirmed in all 20 Italian regions. Earlier on Monday, six inmates died amid riots at prisons across Italy after authorities suspended all visits. Italy's government has pledged to further increase spending to offset the economic impact of the outbreak as the country struggles to adapt to the most restrictive limits on movement since World War Two. Up to 16 million people in northern Italy now need permission to travel under quarantine rules. In an interview with La Repubblica newspaper on Monday, Mr Conte said: ""These days, I have been thinking about the old speeches of [Winston] Churchill - it is our darkest hour but we will make it"". EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? IMMUNITY:Are women and children less affected? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The coronavirus causes the Covid-19 disease. In severe cases, patients have pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and multiple organ failure that can lead to death. The trouble began in the northern city of Modena after inmates at the Sant'Anna prison were told that all visits had been suspended. Three people were reported to have died at the prison, while a further three died after being transferred from there. It is thought that at least two of the dead lost their lives to drug overdoses after they raided a prison hospital for the heroin substitute methadone. Relatives of inmates at the Rebibbia prison in Rome protest at being denied entry At San Vittore prison in Milan, detainees set fire to a cell block on one of the facility's six wings, then climbed onto the roof through windows and started waving banners, officials said. At a prison in the southern city of Foggia, about 20 inmates managed to break out of the building during protests. Many were quickly recaptured, Italy's Ansa news agency reported. There were also riots at several other prisons in northern Italy and at facilities in Naples and the capital, Rome. Officers guard the entrance of the Sant'Anna prison in Modena as prisoners' relatives protest On Monday, Mr Conte said the government would pump in more money to mitigate the impact of the outbreak. He also said Italy would overcome the virus if people followed the rules, adding that the sacrifices required were for the good of all. This video can not be played Milan quarantine resident: ""It's really important to be responsible in this moment"" Italy is also seeking measures at EU level. On Monday morning, the main share index in Milan, the industrial powerhouse at the heart of the worst-affected area, opened down more than 8%. The strict new quarantine measures will last until 3 April, the government says. They affect a quarter of the Italian population, and centre on the rich northern part of the country that powers the economy. The restrictions apply to Lombardy and 14 other provinces: Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano Cusio Ossola, Vercelli, Padua, Treviso and Venice. The UK Foreign Office advisesagainst all but essential travel to these areas. All schools and universities in the area are shut, as well as museums, cinemas and swimming pools. The government says only those with a serious work or family reason that cannot be postponed will be allowed in or out of the quarantine zone. Passengers departing on flights, except temporary visitors, will have to justify themselves, as will all those arriving by plane. There are controls at train stations to check temperatures. Cruise ships are forbidden to dock in Venice. The health system is under immense strain in Lombardy, a northern region of 10 million people where Milan is the main city. Regional hospitals are running short of beds and treating patients in corridors. The health ministry says the average age of deaths from the coronavirus is 81.4 years. Italy has one of the world's oldest populations.The virus is particularly dangerous for the elderlyand those with underlying health conditions. World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has praised Italy for making ""genuine sacrifices"". Until Sunday only about 50,000 people in northern Italy had been affected by quarantines. On Sunday, we drove up to the edge of the exclusion zone. We were expecting to see roadblocks or controls in place and we didn't see anything at all. Cars were going in both directions. It seemed as though the control of this restricted zone was quite loose, and that was a bit difficult to understand. Is this simply too big an area to control and close off in the heart of Europe, or are the restrictions gradually coming into place? We've seen pictures from inside the restricted cities, and the streets are very deserted, but we're not seeing police checkpoints as such. But perhaps this is going to be stepped up in the coming days because there are even penalties of three months in prison or a fine of â¬206 (Â£179; $235) for breaking the rules. The real fear is that, in the hours between the quarantine being announced and it coming into effect, people have gone from more infected areas in the north down south. There are healthcare facilities in southern Italy, far less developed than those here in the north, that are going to seriously struggle. The number of infections worldwide is now more than 111,000, with about 3,890 deaths.

Italy prison riots over coronavirus restrictionsSix inmates are reportedly killed amid protests at 27 prisons over the suspension of all visits.,"Detainees protest on the roof of the San Vittore prison in Milan Italy's coronavirus death toll has jumped by 97 to 463, as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte described the outbreak as the country's ""darkest hour"". The number of confirmed infections in Italy also increased to 9,172, up from 7,375 on Sunday, official figures show. Italy is the worst-hit country after China, with cases of the virus confirmed in all 20 Italian regions. Earlier on Monday, six inmates died amid riots at prisons across Italy after authorities suspended all visits. Italy's government has pledged to further increase spending to offset the economic impact of the outbreak as the country struggles to adapt to the most restrictive limits on movement since World War Two. Up to 16 million people in northern Italy now need permission to travel under quarantine rules. In an interview with La Repubblica newspaper on Monday, Mr Conte said: ""These days, I have been thinking about the old speeches of [Winston] Churchill - it is our darkest hour but we will make it"". EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? IMMUNITY:Are women and children less affected? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The coronavirus causes the Covid-19 disease. In severe cases, patients have pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and multiple organ failure that can lead to death. The trouble began in the northern city of Modena after inmates at the Sant'Anna prison were told that all visits had been suspended. Three people were reported to have died at the prison, while a further three died after being transferred from there. It is thought that at least two of the dead lost their lives to drug overdoses after they raided a prison hospital for the heroin substitute methadone. Relatives of inmates at the Rebibbia prison in Rome protest at being denied entry At San Vittore prison in Milan, detainees set fire to a cell block on one of the facility's six wings, then climbed onto the roof through windows and started waving banners, officials said. At a prison in the southern city of Foggia, about 20 inmates managed to break out of the building during protests. Many were quickly recaptured, Italy's Ansa news agency reported. There were also riots at several other prisons in northern Italy and at facilities in Naples and the capital, Rome. Officers guard the entrance of the Sant'Anna prison in Modena as prisoners' relatives protest On Monday, Mr Conte said the government would pump in more money to mitigate the impact of the outbreak. He also said Italy would overcome the virus if people followed the rules, adding that the sacrifices required were for the good of all. This video can not be played Milan quarantine resident: ""It's really important to be responsible in this moment"" Italy is also seeking measures at EU level. On Monday morning, the main share index in Milan, the industrial powerhouse at the heart of the worst-affected area, opened down more than 8%. The strict new quarantine measures will last until 3 April, the government says. They affect a quarter of the Italian population, and centre on the rich northern part of the country that powers the economy. The restrictions apply to Lombardy and 14 other provinces: Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano Cusio Ossola, Vercelli, Padua, Treviso and Venice. The UK Foreign Office advisesagainst all but essential travel to these areas. All schools and universities in the area are shut, as well as museums, cinemas and swimming pools. The government says only those with a serious work or family reason that cannot be postponed will be allowed in or out of the quarantine zone. Passengers departing on flights, except temporary visitors, will have to justify themselves, as will all those arriving by plane. There are controls at train stations to check temperatures. Cruise ships are forbidden to dock in Venice. The health system is under immense strain in Lombardy, a northern region of 10 million people where Milan is the main city. Regional hospitals are running short of beds and treating patients in corridors. The health ministry says the average age of deaths from the coronavirus is 81.4 years. Italy has one of the world's oldest populations.The virus is particularly dangerous for the elderlyand those with underlying health conditions. World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has praised Italy for making ""genuine sacrifices"". Until Sunday only about 50,000 people in northern Italy had been affected by quarantines. On Sunday, we drove up to the edge of the exclusion zone. We were expecting to see roadblocks or controls in place and we didn't see anything at all. Cars were going in both directions. It seemed as though the control of this restricted zone was quite loose, and that was a bit difficult to understand. Is this simply too big an area to control and close off in the heart of Europe, or are the restrictions gradually coming into place? We've seen pictures from inside the restricted cities, and the streets are very deserted, but we're not seeing police checkpoints as such. But perhaps this is going to be stepped up in the coming days because there are even penalties of three months in prison or a fine of â¬206 (Â£179; $235) for breaking the rules.

When asked about her plans to travel to the United States, along with Deputy First Minister Ms O'Neill, this week, she said: ""The reason we go is because we have very good access to the leader of the US and businesses, but we have to balance that with the needs here in the UK so we will be looking at that in the coming hours.""

moment, they are only allowed 10 minutes every week.â Inmates protesting on the roof of the San Vittore prison in Milan called for a pardon Italian media reported two policemen had been kidnapped â but Mario Venditti, the local prosecutor who was on the ground to negotiate with the detainees, said no actual kidnapping took place. He said one policeman had been injured in the attacks and others suffered from smoke inhalation. The activist said now the unrest has been contained, prison authorities ""should be looking at measures to cope with the situation"". ""The damages to the prison building are enormous, and some of the detainees have been transferred to other prisons, which are already overcrowded,"" the activist added. ""It will put pressure on the system as a whole. I think they should start thinking about releasing some of the long serving detainees, especially those who are serving the last leg of their sentence and could be place under house arrest.â Violent protests broke out at 27 Italian prisons against coronavirus restrictions in the country Israel is to require all people arriving in the country from abroad to self-quarantine for 14 days
as a precaution against the spread of coronavirus, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said.  An Iranian official registers people to take Covid-19 tests in the capital, Tehran In Iran, the authorities have also reported an increase in the country's death toll,saying they saw 43 new deaths related to the virus in the past 24 hours. So far, at least 237 people have died and 7,161 more have been infected across the country since mid-February, although the real figures are thought to be far higher.  Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News A company in east London is
looking for 24 volunteers to be injected with a strain of the new coronavirus
in a bid to find a vaccine against the virus. It is reported they will be
offered up to Â£3,500 to be infected and then quarantined for two weeks. But the UK regulator â the
Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency â still has to agree to the
companyâs plans before the research can take place. Research into at least eight
vaccines is ongoing in the UK, and scientists in many other parts of the world
are also working hard on developing a jab. Itâs unlikely any vaccine will
be ready before the end of the year. Trials to test any potential
vaccines must be tested on humans before they can be manufactured and given to
the wider public. Want to know more about efforts to develop a vaccine? Read our coverage: It has been confirmed that the death toll from the virus in Italy has increased from 366 to 463. The total number of coronavirus cases in Italy has hit
9,172, rising from the 7,375 recorded on the previous day,the countryâs Civil Protection agency has reported on its website,external. It is the worst-affected country after China, where the
virus originated. The country has introduced a range of sweeping measure to
contain the outbreak, with up to 16 million people quarantined in the north. On Monday, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the
coronavirus outbreak was the country's ""darkest hour"". Canadian
public health officials are advising against all cruise ship travel as the government prepares to repatriate more than 200 Canadian nationals on the Grand Princess cruise ship
following an outbreak of coronavirus on the vessel. The ship is scheduled to dock in California on Monday. All
asymptomatic Canadians passengers will be flown home and placed under a 14-day
quarantine at a Canadian Forces base in the province of Ontario. If
a person shows any symptoms of illness, they will not be allowed to board the
plane and will be further screened and treated if necessary in the United
States, government officials said. Just
last week, Canadian passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship were
released from quarantine. They
had been evacuated, along with hundreds of other passengers, from a quarantined
cruise ship off the coast of Japan in late February. As
of Monday morning, there were 71 confirmed or presumptive cases of people with coronavirus in Canada. Most
of the cases are in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia, though some have also been discovered in Quebec and Alberta. The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Italy has increased from 366 to 463, Reuters news agency reports. Prof Whitty said hospital patients with pneumonia and other respiratory infections would now be tested for coronavirus. He said: ""At the moment we are screening everybody who is in intensive care for coronavirus if they have symptoms that are compatible with coronavirus - so if they have a very bad pneumonia. ""We will be extending that out now, as from tomorrow, to everybody who has a significant enough pneumonia or other respiratory tract infection to get into hospital at all."" Professor Chris Whitty, the UK governmentâs chief medical officer, has also been speaking at the press conference alongside Mr Johnson. Mr Whitty said coronavirus could spread ""really quite fast"". He said within the next 10 to 14 days, even people with a minor fever or respiratory tract infection would be advised to self-isolate. ""We are going to be
reaching that step in the near future,"" he said. Here is some more from Mr Johnson's opening statement at press conference in Downing Street. Mr Johnson said: ""I want to stress the following things. First, we are
doing everything we can to combat this outbreak based on the latest scientific
and medical advice. ""Second, we have a truly brilliant NHS where staff have
responded with all the determination, compassion and skill that makes their
service so revered across the world and they will continue to have this government's full support, my support, in tackling this virus on the front
line. ""Third, we will set out further steps in the days and
weeks ahead to help people protect themselves, their family and in particularly
the elderly and vulnerable."" The virus has begun to tell on that most confined space of all, prison. In Italy,riots were reported at 27 jailsand six people died at a penitentiary in Modena after inmates were told friends and family would not be allowed
to visit. Meanwhile, Iran released 70,000 prisoners in its bid to try to tackle the virus. Amid global concerns over coronavirus and falling oil prices,the financial market took a big hit. Shares in London plummeted with the FTSE plunging 8% to its lowest level in three years. In New York, trading was halted for 15 minutes after stocks fell. Airlines have already felt the brunt of the outbreak and now
they have been forced to cancel more flights. British Airways and Easyjet will
stop running their routes to northern Italy until at least 3 April. And one of Europe's great pageants,the St Patrick's day parade in Dublin on 17 March, has been cancelledas a precaution.  Here's more from Dr Tedros' coronavirus briefing at the WHO in Geneva. He said the spread of the virus could be stopped through the twin strategy of containment and mitigation, and added he was encouraged by the aggressive measures Italy was taking to combat the outbreak. He also noted that in China, 70% of those infected had recovered, showing the country was beginning to bring its epidemic under control. Allow Twitter content?

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is speaking at a news conference at Downing Street. He said the UK government is making ""extensive preparations"" for a move to the delay phase of its response to the coronavirus outbreak. The UK will remain in the ""containment"" stage of its response for now, Mr Johnson said. There were319 confirmed cases in the UK,externalon Monday, a rise of 46 in 24 hours. Germany has confirmed its first two deaths from the coronavirus outbreak. The deaths were in the city of Essen and district of Heinsberg, both in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, health authorities said on Monday. In Essen, the person who died was an 89-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with the virus on 3 March. Germany has so far reported more than 1,000 cases of the coronavirus nationwide. Around half of those have been reported in North Rhine-Westphalia. The first death of a German national from the coronavirus was reported on Sunday evening. The 60-year-old man had tested positive for the virus after he was hospitalised in Egypt. According to Governor Andrew Cuomo, New York State now has a total of 142 confirmed cases of Covid-19. Many are the result of large public gatherings, he said on Monday. Eight of these cases - 6% - have required hospital care. The western state of Washington previously had the most cases in the US, with 136 confirmed according to its health department, but New York saw a rise in new patients over the weekend. Mr Cuomo also said he would be proposing a bill on Monday regarding paid sick leave. World Health Organization (WHO) boss Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been trying to be reassuring in his daily briefing. ""Now that the#coronavirus,externalhas a foothold in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic has become very real.

But it would be the first pandemic in history that could be controlled.

The bottom line is: we are not at the mercy of this virus. ""We need to remember that with decisive, early action, we can slow down the#coronavirus,externaland prevent infections. Among those who are infected, most will recover."" He also reminded people that most cases were concentrated in a handful of countries:  Allow Twitter content?

US trading halted as shares plunge around the world,"Shares around the world had their worst day since the financial crisis with the dramatic falls leading to the day being dubbed ""Black Monday"". The main financial indexes in the US closed down by more than 7%, while London's index of top shares ended the day nearly 8% lower. Similar drops took place across Europe and Asia as a row between Russia and Saudi Arabia saw oil prices plunge. Shares were already reeling from fears of the impact of coronavirus. Analysts described the market reaction as ""utter carnage"". In the US, the major stock indexes fell so sharply at the start of trading, that the buying and selling of shares was halted for 15 minutes, as a so-called ""circuit breaker"" aimed at curbing panicky selling came into effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank by 7.8% or more than 2,000 points - the biggest points-drop in history and the largest decline in percentage terms since the financial crisis. The S&P 500 fell 7.6%, while the Nasdaq dropped about 7.3%. The declines in London wiped some Â£125bn off the value of major UK firms. The UK and US falls were mirrored by similar declines in Europe, with the main stock market indexes in France, Germany and Spain all closing over 7% lower. ""There is panic setting into the market right now,"" said Andrew Lo, professor of finance at MIT's Sloan School of Management. ""Things are going to get worse before they get better."" The dramatic drops were triggered by a row between Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil output. Saudi Arabia said it would slash prices and pump more oil, sparking fears of a price war. This came after Russia rejected a proposal by oil exporters to cut supply to cope with lower demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. Analysts said Saudi Arabia was ""flexing its muscles"" to protect its position in the oil market. On Monday, the price of international oil benchmark Brent fell almost a third in its biggest drop since the Gulf War in 1991 before recovering slightly to trade 20% lower. The price of oil had already fallen sharply this year as the coronavirus began to spread internationally, with demand for fuel expected to decline. Those conditions make Saudi Arabia's decision to increase output ""extremely surprising"", said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""This is not the first time that we've had a shock to the oil market, but it is the first time that I can recall that you've had a supply shock and a demand shock at the same time,"" he said. ""The craziness that you're seeing in the oil prices today, and companies related to oil and gas, is a reflection of this being pretty unprecedented."" In the US and UK, oil firms led the market declines, with shares in Shell, BP and Chevron down about 15% or more. Premier Oil saw its shares more than halve in value. In Frankfurt and Paris, banks were hit hardest, while the Russian rouble tumbled about 8% to its weakest level since 2016. In Brazil, steep falls in morning trade also triggered a temporary pause with shares ending the day down 12%. Earlier, Asian markets had also fallen sharply, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index down 5% while Australia's ASX 200 slumped 7.3% - its biggest daily drop since 2008. In China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite fell 3%, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index sank 4.2%. Elsewhere on the markets, the price of gold hitting a seven-year high at one point, trading at $1,700 per ounce. Gold is often seen as a desirable asset to hold in times of uncertainty. And in a historic moment, demand for benchmark UK government bonds for two-, three-, four-, six- and seven-year maturities pushed prices so high that yields - or the rate of return on the bond - briefly turned negative for the first time. A negative yield means investors will lose money from holding the bond. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. While people have in the past responded to lower oil prices with making travel plans and other spending, the coronavirus is likely to curb that response, said Beth Ann Bovino, chief US economist at S&P Global Ratings. And economists have said that if the decline in oil prices continue, they are likely to have far-reaching economic effects. This could potentially raise risk in debt markets or hurt investment in the energy sector, which plays an important economic role in many parts of the US. With uncertainty about the economy driven by questions about the coronavirus outbreak, leaders have a ""limited window of opportunity to contain the panic"", Prof Lo added. ""We can ask the public to be as confident as we want, but that's not going to restore confidence unless they see real progress,"" he said.

Why should I care if share prices fall?,"Traders are affected by stock market falls, but so are you Big shifts in the stock market are often in the news, whether they are booms or falls owing to coronavirus or the financial crisis. As companies grow, they issue shares. The largest companies in the UK have shares which are bought and sold on the London Stock Exchange. Their collective performance is often quoted amid a blizzard of numbers that may feel confusing and irrelevant. Rarely does anyone mention during a coffee with friends that the FTSE 100 has dropped well below 7,000 points. But there are good reasons why this performance affects your life and finances. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest this money to help it grow. Widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for pension savers. As much as Â£600bn is held in defined contribution pensions at the moment. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. ""There's a huge difference between knowing you're connected to the stock market and panicking about it,"" says Sarah Coles, from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Stock markets always go up and down over the short term... it's important to bear in mind that investors have lived through major ups and downs in the past and come out the other side."" No, some people have a pension which promises a specific value, depending on their salary. Others have no pension at all. About 10 million people have been automatically enrolled into a pension and may have not really noticed. This scheme sees employers divert wages into a pension and contribute some money themselves. The government adds a little in tax relief. In every case, the value of these pension savings is affected by investment performance. So ""the markets"" matter - maybe not as much as everyday wages, but for future pensions. Timing is more critical for those at retirement age, as this may be when a retiree uses their pension pot to buy a retirement income, or annuity. The bigger the pot, the more income they will get in retirement. As you approach retirement age, pension pots are moved to less risky investments, such as government bonds. When stock markets fall, these bonds can do better. Anyone who has a pension pot invested and is taking an income from it will again see their investment go up and down with the stock markets. That could mean getting less than you expected if you cash in too much after stock markets have fallen, making it important to plan how to make up any of this shortfall, experts say. Dozens of big companies have warned, for example, that the coronavirus will hit their share price. Trouble over an extended period could have an effect on the amount of work available, says Moira O'Neill from Interactive Investor. ""Stock market falls also affect business confidence and the ability of companies to raise money,"" she says. ""There could be an impact for the wider economy and maybe your job."" There is no direct link between the stock market and your mortgage or rent. In normal times, if panic on the stock market spreads to the wider economy, one reaction might be for the Bank of England to cut interest rates, which could make some kinds of mortgages cheaper, although cash savers would probably get less return on cash savings. Conversely, if the economy - and the cost of living - are considered to be growing too fast, the Bank would think about raising interest rates, so people do not borrow too much. However, rates are currently at a historic low of 0.1% and are not expected to rise any time soon. It can be hard to find positives when people's jobs are affected, or - as in the case of the coronavirus - stock market performance has been affected because lives are being lost. Yet, in purely investment terms, lower share prices can offer an opportunity to buy, in the hope that over the long term, they recover and rise. Many people will do this initially through a stocks and shares Individual Savings Account (Isa). Ms O'Neill points out that anyone tempted to do so must consider how prepared they are for their investment to keep falling and make sure they do not put all their money in one type of investment. Some people invest money in what are known as tracker funds. These go up and down in line with the performance of a certain index, such as the FTSE 100. So if the index falls, so does the value of their investments and vice versa. One advantage of these funds is that they often cost relatively little to sign up to. Among the markets that hit the news reports are the currency markets. In other words, the value of various currencies compared to each other. That affects the exchange rates you get when you change holiday money. This can be affected by a range of factors, some of which are different from the issues affecting companies' share prices.

Oil plunges in Asia as producers start price war,"An oil production and storage vessel in the Atlantic Ocean Oil prices crashed in Asia on Monday by around 30% in what analysts are calling the start of a price war. Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia slashed its oil prices at the weekend after it failed to convince Russia on Friday to back sharp production cuts. Oil cartel Opec and its ally Russia had previously worked together on production curbs. The benchmark Brent oil futures plunged to a low of $31.02 a barrel on Monday, in volatile energy markets. Oil prices have tumbled since Friday, when Opec's 14 members led by Saudi Arabia met with its allies Russia and other non-Opec members. They met to discuss how to respond to falling demand caused by the growing spread of the coronavirus. But the two sides failed to agree on measures to cut production by as much as 1.5 million barrels a day. That initially saw Brent drop below $50 a barrel on Friday with the downward trend carrying over to Asia on Monday after Saudi Arabia at the weekend sharply cut the prices it charges customers. The region is home to some major importers including China, Japan, South Korea and India. Oil plunges 10% after Opec deal collapses What will happen to oil if there is another war? Coronavirus and oil: Why crude has been hit hard With global oil production now far outpacing demand, oil analyst Martjin Rats of Morgan Stanley said Opec members are now expected to pump more oil to capture market share. ""Given Opec countries now have very little incentive to restrain production, oil markets look sharply oversupplied,"" Mr Rats said in a research note. Overall, oil prices were last at these levels in January 2016, and are near a 16-year low. Energy analyst Vandana Hari, of research firm Vanda Insights, said the markets were shocked by the disagreement on production cuts between Opec and Russia, which was surpassed last year by the US as the world's top producer. ""The collapse of the Opec/non-Opec alliance is a major shock to the oil market, and it comes with the added challenge that we don't have the full picture of what lies ahead,"" Ms Hari told the BBC.

UK to remain in coronavirus 'containment' phase,"The UK will remain in the ""containment"" stage of its response to the coronavirus following an emergency Cobra meeting. It comes as the country's chief medical adviser confirmed a fourth person had died from the virus in the UK. There were319 confirmed cases in the UK as of 09:00 GMT,externalon Monday, a rise of 46 since the same time on Sunday. However, measures to delay the virus' spread with ""social distancing"" will not be introduced yet, ministers said. Number 10 said it accepted that the virus ""is going to spread in a significant way"", however. The latest person to die from the virus was in their 70s and had underlying health conditions, according to the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty. He said the patient, who was being treated at a hospital in Wolverhampton, appeared to have contracted the virus in the UK and that officials were tracing people they had been in contact with. Following the Cobra meeting, Downing Street said the prime minister ""will be guided by the best scientific advice"" but there was no need to cancel sporting events at this stage. Ministers have also been meeting with sports bodies to discuss their response to the outbreak, which could include staging matches behind closed doors. It comes asIreland's Six Nations rugby match in France on Saturday has been postponed,following an earlier decision to postpone England's match in Italy. However, Wales's game against Scotland in Cardiff is to go ahead as scheduled. Another two cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus were confirmed in Walesandanother five in Scotlandon Monday. LIVE:Follow the latest updates EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the government has enlisted an extra 700 people to support a growing number of enquiries to NHS 111, which he added is now dealing with more online enquiries than telephone calls. Mr Hancock added that a bill to help tackle the outbreak would be ""temporary and proportionate"". The UK's top share index,the FTSE 100, is facing its worst day since the financial crisisafter it fell by more than 8%, wiping billions off the value of major firms. The Bank of England has said it will take all necessary steps to protect financial and monetary stability, according to a spokesman for the prime minister. The UK is currently in the first phase - ""containment"" - ofthe government's four-part plan,externalto tackle the spread of coronavirus. The government has previously said ""social distancing"" measures to slow the spread of the virus could include a ban on sporting events and other large gatherings, and encouraging people to work from home rather than use crowded trains and buses. Such a step would require agreement from Prof Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Universal credit claimants who have to self-isolate will not be sanctioned, a work and pensions minister has confirmed. There is no reason to cancel large events at the moment, ministers say A European Union expert said the UK had only a ""few days"" to implement measures to prevent an outbreak like Italy's, which isthe worst outside China with 7,375 confirmed cases and 366 deaths. Environment Secretary George Eustice will also discuss contingency plans with supermarket chief executives, including proposals on how to support vulnerable groups who may have to self-isolate. As supermarkets restrict sales of some products to halt panic-buying, a survey suggested one in 10 shoppers are stockpiling. Boththe government and retailers say stockpiling is unnecessary, and Mr Hancock said food supplies would continue even in the ""reasonable worst-case"" scenario. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell accused the government of offering only ""vague statements"" in response to the outbreak, saying it needed to guarantee sick pay for all workers and address issues such as a shortage of 100,000 NHS staff. TheForeign Office has warned Britons to avoid large parts of northern Italyunder a coronavirus quarantine, unless their journey is essential. Those travelling from locked-down areas have also been advised to self-isolate if they returned to the UK in the last 14 days - even if they have shown no symptoms. Travellers from the rest of Italy are only told to self-isolate and call 111 if they have a cough, fever or shortness of breath. British nationals are still able to depart Italy without restriction, but some airlines - including easyJet and British Airways - have cancelled several flights to and from affected areas. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, told BBC Radio 5 Live ""enhanced measures"" were in place to screen passengers from Italy - but the only one he identified was training airline staff to spot the symptoms of Covid-19.

Public Health England said passengers on flights from northern Italy are also issued with information about symptoms and necessary actions to take, which will be extended to all flights from Italy by Wednesday. However, the Unite union, which represents many cabin crew, said ""there has been no training"" for its members working on flights from northern Italy. The Foreign Office said it was ""working intensively"" to arrange a flight home for 142 Britons on board the Grand Princess cruise ship,which is due to dock in California on Monday after spending five daysstranded off the coast because of 21 cases among crew and passengers. Neil Hanlon, from Bridgwater in Somerset, told BBC Breakfast thatfood on board has become ""very limited""and he was ""gutted"" that it may take until later in the week until he and his wife Victoria can fly home. Amid concerns that fake news about the coronavirus is causing confusion,a specialist unit to combat disinformation has been set up.

Amazon offers till-free shop technology to rivals,"Amazon opened its largest Go Grocery shop, last month, in Seattle Amazon is offering its till-less technology to other High Street shops, just over two years after launching it via its own Go Grocery chain. Go Grocery shoppers scan a smartphone app as they arrive, allowing them to pay via their main Amazon accounts. It has now adapted its Just Walk Out system for other retailers so shoppers register a payment card on entry and are automatically billed as they leave. But, unlike at Go Grocery, users' Amazon accounts will not be involved. And the firm has said that information collected about consumers will only be used to support the retailers it has partnered with. ""We only collect the data needed to provide shoppers with an accurate receipt,""Amazon's website says,external. ""Shoppers can think of this as similar to typical security camera footage."" The system involves fitting a shop with hundreds of cameras and depth-sensors, whose data is then remotely analysed on Amazon's computer servers. The software can distinguish whether a shopper has picked up and kept a product for purchase or if they have only examined an item before replacing it back on a shelf. Amazon says it can install the required equipment in ""as little as a few weeks"". Cameras and other sensors in ceilings monitor shoppers below NBK Retail consultancy founder Natalie Berg said the move had been long-expected. ""It's far more lucrative for Amazon to license the technology to other retailers than to just use it in its own grocery stores,"" she said. ""What Amazon does very well is cut out friction and of course the biggest source or friction in the grocery stores and supermarkets is the checkout. ""But there will still be opportunities for other vendors [with rival solutions] because you're never going to see Walmart implement Amazon's checkout-free tech."" The announcement comes two weeks after Amazon opened its largest Go Grocery shop. Amazon tracks each customer as they move around the shop The Seattle-based shop stocks about 5,000 items and covers more than 10,000 sq ft (929 sq m), making it about five times bigger than the average Go outlet. But UK supermarkets can be up to 185,500 sq ft and questions remain about how long it will take before Amazon or any of its rivals' technologies can be reliably deployed at such scale. Simpler technologies to reduce the need for staffed checkouts include portable barcode scanners and tills that allow shoppers to ring up their own items. Amazon opens a supermarket with no checkouts Tesco trials shopping without tills Amazon: How Bezos built his data machine Advocates of such tech suggest it frees up workers to perform more interesting tasks. Amazon's own site says: ""Retailers will still employ store associates to greet and answer shoppers' questions, stock the shelves, check IDs for the purchasing of certain goods, and more - their roles have simply shifted to focus on more valuable activities."" Amazon Go shops encourage visitors to bag their goods as they go Ms Berg said: ""Ultimately, there will be fewer jobs as automation comes in. ""But [those that remain] will focus on more customer-facing tasks and should provide a better experience to customers. ""And from that point of view, the skills required across the retail sector are going to evolve massively over the next decade.""

Victims of police domestic abusers 'are powerless',"A number of women have shared their experiences with the Centre for Women's Justice Women domestically abused by police officers feel ""doubly powerless"" as their abusers are too often protected from facing justice, campaigners say. The Centre For Women's Justice (CWJ) has submitted a super-complaint claiming failures among police forces. They cite the cases of 19 women, including police officers, from 15 force areas who have been victims of abuse, violence, stalking and rape. It has been submitted to HM Chief Inspector of Constabularies. The CWJ said that while ""without doubt there are cases that are dealt with properly"", a central concern was ""police abusers are being protected and not brought to justice"" because of their positions. The super-complaint, which is supported by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, said victims ""feel doubly powerless"". ""They experienced the powerlessness that most domestic abuse victims experience, but in addition their abuser is part of the system intended to protect them,"" the report said. It calls for changes including: Victims being able to report their claims to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) rather than a police force Neighbouring police forces investigating such claims ""should be the norm"" Officers guilty of abuse also being subject to misconduct procedures Restrict officers facing allegations from working with victims of domestic or sexual abuse The domestic abuse conviction rate among police officers is lower than in the general population, the CWJ said One of the women who gave her story to the CWJ told the BBC her ex-husband physically and sexually abused her as well using coercive and financial control. She said she reported him to his force, Northumbria Police, but no action was taken against him either criminally or by professional standards. ""He used to say to me 'I'm a police officer no-one is going to believe you',"" she said. The woman, who is from Tyneside, said police lost evidence she provided and her husband was given her witness statement, which later went missing from the system. She also said her husband accessed her medical records and ""got access to a lot of things"" civilians would not be able to get. ""There's nowhere to go. When it's a police officer they can find you anywhere, they can trace your car,"" she said ""If you try and prosecute someone who is a police officer, they know the court system and what questions they are going to be asked."" Northumbria Police said the BBC's refusal to share details of the case meant it was ""unable to search our records to trace any report or potential subsequent investigation"". But a spokesperson said all complaints of domestic abuse were ""subject to a thorough and unbiased investigation"" irrespective of who the suspect is. The BBC did not reveal the officer's name to the force out of a duty of care to the woman. Calls about children witnessing abuse 'increase' Free rail travel for domestic abuse victims Lie-detector tests for domestic abuse offenders The super-complaint cites a number of examples of no criminal charges being brought despite victims making reports and claiming to supply evidence. It also refers to cases where no misconduct proceedings took place, with one woman who claimed she was raped being told superiors would have a ""quiet word"" with the suspect. Since 2018,certain organisations approved by the Home Office,externalhave been able to make a super-complaint to address what they see ascultural or thematic failures,externalin the country's police. ""The super-complaints system is designed to identify systemic issues which are not otherwise dealt with by the existing complaints systems,"" the Home Office said. The complaint will be investigated by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, the IOPC and College of Policing who will then decide what action, if any, needs to be taken. Previous super-complaints have covered thepolice response to victims of modern slavery,externaland theuse of protective measures in cases of violence,externalagainst women and girls. Victims who are police officers said they faced ""bullying and open hostility"" from other officers. One said she had her application to join the firearms department ""blocked"" by her senior officer ex while another said colleagues accused her of being a liar. Forces included in the complaint are: Cambridgeshire Devon and Cornwall Greater Manchester Police Gwent Hampshire Hertfordshire Leicestershire Merseyside Met Police Northumbria Police Scotland Surrey Sussex West Midlands Wiltshire The CWJ said there were difficulties for victims reporting the abuse amid fears they would not be believed. One claimed her partner said: ""Who's going to believe you? There are lots of us."" There were multiple cases featuring ""failures in investigation"", the CWJ said, with statements not being taken including from children who claimed they had been abused, investigators not listening to recorded evidence of the discussion of a rape, and one victim being told ""you know how it works, it's your word against his"". The CWJ cited ""improper responses"" to reports, including one woman being told she should ""sit down together and sort it out"" with the husband she claimed raped her. It also complained of accused officers knowing those investigating them, with ""police culture"" including a ""sense of family"" with ""strong loyalty"" within a force. ""The criss-cross of personal connections undermines the trust of victims,"" the super complaint said. One woman said she saw a photograph on social media of her partner and the officer investigating him for domestic abuse. The CWJ said police officers were less likely to be convicted of domestic abuse offences than non police workers. A Freedom of Information request showed there were 19 convictions for 493 reports against police officers, a rate of 3.9%, while the general population rate is 6.2%, the report said. The complaint will be investigated,externalby HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, the IOPC and College of Policing who will then decide what action, if any, needs to be taken.

Shares plunge in worst day since financial crisis,"Shares around the world had their worst day since the financial crisis with the dramatic falls leading to the day being dubbed ""Black Monday"". The main financial indexes in the US closed down by more than 7%, while London's index of top shares ended the day nearly 8% lower. Similar drops took place across Europe and Asia as a row between Russia and Saudi Arabia saw oil prices plunge. Shares were already reeling from fears of the impact of coronavirus. Analysts described the market reaction as ""utter carnage"". In the US, the major stock indexes fell so sharply at the start of trading, that the buying and selling of shares was halted for 15 minutes, as a so-called ""circuit breaker"" aimed at curbing panicky selling came into effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank by 7.8% or more than 2,000 points - the biggest points-drop in history and the largest decline in percentage terms since the financial crisis. The S&P 500 fell 7.6%, while the Nasdaq dropped about 7.3%. The declines in London wiped some Â£125bn off the value of major UK firms. The UK and US falls were mirrored by similar declines in Europe, with the main stock market indexes in France, Germany and Spain all closing over 7% lower. ""There is panic setting into the market right now,"" said Andrew Lo, professor of finance at MIT's Sloan School of Management. ""Things are going to get worse before they get better."" The dramatic drops were triggered by a row between Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil output. Saudi Arabia said it would slash prices and pump more oil, sparking fears of a price war. This came after Russia rejected a proposal by oil exporters to cut supply to cope with lower demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. Analysts said Saudi Arabia was ""flexing its muscles"" to protect its position in the oil market. On Monday, the price of international oil benchmark Brent fell almost a third in its biggest drop since the Gulf War in 1991 before recovering slightly to trade 20% lower. The price of oil had already fallen sharply this year as the coronavirus began to spread internationally, with demand for fuel expected to decline. Those conditions make Saudi Arabia's decision to increase output ""extremely surprising"", said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""This is not the first time that we've had a shock to the oil market, but it is the first time that I can recall that you've had a supply shock and a demand shock at the same time,"" he said. ""The craziness that you're seeing in the oil prices today, and companies related to oil and gas, is a reflection of this being pretty unprecedented."" In the US and UK, oil firms led the market declines, with shares in Shell, BP and Chevron down about 15% or more. Premier Oil saw its shares more than halve in value. In Frankfurt and Paris, banks were hit hardest, while the Russian rouble tumbled about 8% to its weakest level since 2016. In Brazil, steep falls in morning trade also triggered a temporary pause with shares ending the day down 12%. Earlier, Asian markets had also fallen sharply, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index down 5% while Australia's ASX 200 slumped 7.3% - its biggest daily drop since 2008. In China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite fell 3%, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index sank 4.2%. Elsewhere on the markets, the price of gold hitting a seven-year high at one point, trading at $1,700 per ounce. Gold is often seen as a desirable asset to hold in times of uncertainty. And in a historic moment, demand for benchmark UK government bonds for two-, three-, four-, six- and seven-year maturities pushed prices so high that yields - or the rate of return on the bond - briefly turned negative for the first time. A negative yield means investors will lose money from holding the bond. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. While people have in the past responded to lower oil prices with making travel plans and other spending, the coronavirus is likely to curb that response, said Beth Ann Bovino, chief US economist at S&P Global Ratings. And economists have said that if the decline in oil prices continue, they are likely to have far-reaching economic effects. This could potentially raise risk in debt markets or hurt investment in the energy sector, which plays an important economic role in many parts of the US. With uncertainty about the economy driven by questions about the coronavirus outbreak, leaders have a ""limited window of opportunity to contain the panic"", Prof Lo added. ""We can ask the public to be as confident as we want, but that's not going to restore confidence unless they see real progress,"" he said.

PM holds emergency coronavirus meetingMinisters were considering measures such as school closures and home working to delay the virus's spread.,"The UK will remain in the ""containment"" stage of its response to the coronavirus following an emergency Cobra meeting. It comes as the country's chief medical adviser confirmed a fourth person had died from the virus in the UK. There were319 confirmed cases in the UK as of 09:00 GMT,externalon Monday, a rise of 46 since the same time on Sunday. However, measures to delay the virus' spread with ""social distancing"" will not be introduced yet, ministers said. Number 10 said it accepted that the virus ""is going to spread in a significant way"", however. The latest person to die from the virus was in their 70s and had underlying health conditions, according to the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty. He said the patient, who was being treated at a hospital in Wolverhampton, appeared to have contracted the virus in the UK and that officials were tracing people they had been in contact with. Following the Cobra meeting, Downing Street said the prime minister ""will be guided by the best scientific advice"" but there was no need to cancel sporting events at this stage. Ministers have also been meeting with sports bodies to discuss their response to the outbreak, which could include staging matches behind closed doors. It comes asIreland's Six Nations rugby match in France on Saturday has been postponed,following an earlier decision to postpone England's match in Italy. However, Wales's game against Scotland in Cardiff is to go ahead as scheduled. Another two cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus were confirmed in Walesandanother five in Scotlandon Monday. LIVE:Follow the latest updates EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the government has enlisted an extra 700 people to support a growing number of enquiries to NHS 111, which he added is now dealing with more online enquiries than telephone calls. Mr Hancock added that a bill to help tackle the outbreak would be ""temporary and proportionate"". The UK's top share index,the FTSE 100, is facing its worst day since the financial crisisafter it fell by more than 8%, wiping billions off the value of major firms. The Bank of England has said it will take all necessary steps to protect financial and monetary stability, according to a spokesman for the prime minister. The UK is currently in the first phase - ""containment"" - ofthe government's four-part plan,externalto tackle the spread of coronavirus. The government has previously said ""social distancing"" measures to slow the spread of the virus could include a ban on sporting events and other large gatherings, and encouraging people to work from home rather than use crowded trains and buses. Such a step would require agreement from Prof Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Universal credit claimants who have to self-isolate will not be sanctioned, a work and pensions minister has confirmed. There is no reason to cancel large events at the moment, ministers say A European Union expert said the UK had only a ""few days"" to implement measures to prevent an outbreak like Italy's, which isthe worst outside China with 7,375 confirmed cases and 366 deaths. Environment Secretary George Eustice will also discuss contingency plans with supermarket chief executives, including proposals on how to support vulnerable groups who may have to self-isolate. As supermarkets restrict sales of some products to halt panic-buying, a survey suggested one in 10 shoppers are stockpiling. Boththe government and retailers say stockpiling is unnecessary, and Mr Hancock said food supplies would continue even in the ""reasonable worst-case"" scenario. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell accused the government of offering only ""vague statements"" in response to the outbreak, saying it needed to guarantee sick pay for all workers and address issues such as a shortage of 100,000 NHS staff. TheForeign Office has warned Britons to avoid large parts of northern Italyunder a coronavirus quarantine, unless their journey is essential. Those travelling from locked-down areas have also been advised to self-isolate if they returned to the UK in the last 14 days - even if they have shown no symptoms. Travellers from the rest of Italy are only told to self-isolate and call 111 if they have a cough, fever or shortness of breath. British nationals are still able to depart Italy without restriction, but some airlines - including easyJet and British Airways - have cancelled several flights to and from affected areas. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, told BBC Radio 5 Live ""enhanced measures"" were in place to screen passengers from Italy - but the only one he identified was training airline staff to spot the symptoms of Covid-19.

Public Health England said passengers on flights from northern Italy are also issued with information about symptoms and necessary actions to take, which will be extended to all flights from Italy by Wednesday. However, the Unite union, which represents many cabin crew, said ""there has been no training"" for its members working on flights from northern Italy. The Foreign Office said it was ""working intensively"" to arrange a flight home for 142 Britons on board the Grand Princess cruise ship,which is due to dock in California on Monday after spending five daysstranded off the coast because of 21 cases among crew and passengers. Neil Hanlon, from Bridgwater in Somerset, told BBC Breakfast thatfood on board has become ""very limited""and he was ""gutted"" that it may take until later in the week until he and his wife Victoria can fly home. Amid concerns that fake news about the coronavirus is causing confusion,a specialist unit to combat disinformation has been set up. Teams from across Whitehall have been brought together to identify and respond to disinformation in a bid to limit its spread.

HSBC's gender pay gap hits 47% as City split widensMany financial companies that have reported so far are still posting gender pay gaps of 30% or more.Business,"Dame Helena Morrissey says more needs to be done Many financial firms are paying the average man almost 25% more than the average woman, with HSBC posting an overall pay gap of 47.8%. It is the third year UK organisations with more than 250 employees have been legally required topublish a snapshot of their gender pay gap,external. Of the financial and insurance firms reporting so far, the gap has risen to 23.1%, from 22.2% two years ago. Across all employees and sectors,the ONS estimates the gap is 17.3%.,external The gender pay gap is the difference between average hourly earnings for men and women across an organisation. So far, only a quarter of financial firms have reported their figures, less than one month before the deadline. The BBC looked at a company's median pay gap - that is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. HSBC says its pay gap - averaged out across its eight divisions and 40,000 strong workforce - was 47.8% in 2019, almost identical to a year earlier. The main driver was fewer women in high paid senior leadership roles and more women working in junior positions, it said. ""It will take time to redress the imbalance and the results of our work today may not fully be realised until today's pipeline of new joiners becomes tomorrow's business leaders,"" the bank said in its supporting statement. Between 2017 and 2019: Lloyds Bank and Santander's UK retail operations have closed their gap by more than 2% , but are still above the sector average at 40.5% and 26.6% respectively Co-op Bank's gap remained at 22.6% and Barclay's retail operation had a small increase to 14.5% Both the investment firm Aberdeen Asset Management (which has since merged with Standard Life) and HBOS reported 1.6% increases. Reporting for the first time, NatWest posted a gender pay gap of 34.1% while the gap at HSBC's UK retail arm was 18.7% Dame Helena Morrissey, one of the City's most high profile women, and founder of the Diversity Project, says some firms are merely complying with the law, with ""woolly or non-existent"" plans to improve. ""I think the initial year of naming and shaming has become a blunted instrument because so many have such a bad [gender pay gap] number,"" she said. ""Personally I feel it is very hard to engineer the closing of the gap, because even if you attract women in, if they are not happy in the industry they will leave."" Average pay gaps at city firms have grown to 23.1% since compulsory reporting was brought in two years ago Analysis of financial firms shows the average gender pay gap for bonuses is 37.7%. This is an increase from 35.3% two years ago. Aberdeen Asset Manager, Barclays' commercial arm, NatWest and Standard Life Investments were all paying out bonuses that are over 50% higher for men, on average. Bonus payments are recorded separately, but can form a substantial part of employee salaries at financial institutions. Ann Cairns, executive vice-chair of MasterCard, is global co-chair of the 30% Club, which aims to boost the number of women in senior leadership. She says that on the ground, she sees companies are starting to take their pay gaps seriously. MasterCard's Ann Cairns (third from left) says corporate culture can't be changed overnight ""It's more transparent out there at the moment and it affects whether people want to work for you - it affects your perception in the market, and investors are starting to pay a lot more attention to it,"" she says. ""There are probably firms out there who think 'I really care, but I don't know how to change and it takes a lot of time and effort'. You are not going to change the corporate culture or mix of people overnight. ""We are not pro quota, because you can make people do something, but if you haven't changed the underlying culture I don't think anybody feels good about that."" But she adds ""if you can't change the trajectory in 3-5 years then you have to start asking yourself questions. This whole thing that you can't find qualified women - I don't think that's true"". Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. If you line up all the men and women working at a company in two separate lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his. Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend-per-woman and its total spend-per-man. The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation. Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay. Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work. That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things, for example fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs.

Domestic abuser police officers 'protected',"A number of women have shared their experiences with the Centre for Women's Justice Women domestically abused by police officers feel ""doubly powerless"" as their abusers are too often protected from facing justice, campaigners say. The Centre For Women's Justice (CWJ) has submitted a super-complaint claiming failures among police forces. They cite the cases of 19 women, including police officers, from 15 force areas who have been victims of abuse, violence, stalking and rape. It has been submitted to HM Chief Inspector of Constabularies. The CWJ said that while ""without doubt there are cases that are dealt with properly"", a central concern was ""police abusers are being protected and not brought to justice"" because of their positions. The super-complaint, which is supported by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, said victims ""feel doubly powerless"". ""They experienced the powerlessness that most domestic abuse victims experience, but in addition their abuser is part of the system intended to protect them,"" the report said. It calls for changes including: Victims being able to report their claims to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) rather than a police force Neighbouring police forces investigating such claims ""should be the norm"" Officers guilty of abuse also being subject to misconduct procedures Restrict officers facing allegations from working with victims of domestic or sexual abuse The domestic abuse conviction rate among police officers is lower than in the general population, the CWJ said One of the women who gave her story to the CWJ told the BBC her ex-husband physically and sexually abused her as well using coercive and financial control. She said she reported him to his force, Northumbria Police, but no action was taken against him either criminally or by professional standards. ""He used to say to me 'I'm a police officer no-one is going to believe you',"" she said. The woman, who is from Tyneside, said police lost evidence she provided and her husband was given her witness statement, which later went missing from the system. She also said her husband accessed her medical records and ""got access to a lot of things"" civilians would not be able to get. ""There's nowhere to go. When it's a police officer they can find you anywhere, they can trace your car,"" she said ""If you try and prosecute someone who is a police officer, they know the court system and what questions they are going to be asked."" Northumbria Police said the BBC's refusal to share details of the case meant it was ""unable to search our records to trace any report or potential subsequent investigation"". But a spokesperson said all complaints of domestic abuse were ""subject to a thorough and unbiased investigation"" irrespective of who the suspect is. The BBC did not reveal the officer's name to the force out of a duty of care to the woman. Calls about children witnessing abuse 'increase' Free rail travel for domestic abuse victims Lie-detector tests for domestic abuse offenders The super-complaint cites a number of examples of no criminal charges being brought despite victims making reports and claiming to supply evidence. It also refers to cases where no misconduct proceedings took place, with one woman who claimed she was raped being told superiors would have a ""quiet word"" with the suspect. Since 2018,certain organisations approved by the Home Office,externalhave been able to make a super-complaint to address what they see ascultural or thematic failures,externalin the country's police. ""The super-complaints system is designed to identify systemic issues which are not otherwise dealt with by the existing complaints systems,"" the Home Office said. The complaint will be investigated by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, the IOPC and College of Policing who will then decide what action, if any, needs to be taken. Previous super-complaints have covered thepolice response to victims of modern slavery,externaland theuse of protective measures in cases of violence,externalagainst women and girls. Victims who are police officers said they faced ""bullying and open hostility"" from other officers. One said she had her application to join the firearms department ""blocked"" by her senior officer ex while another said colleagues accused her of being a liar. Forces included in the complaint are: Cambridgeshire Devon and Cornwall Greater Manchester Police Gwent Hampshire Hertfordshire Leicestershire Merseyside Met Police Northumbria Police Scotland Surrey Sussex West Midlands Wiltshire The CWJ said there were difficulties for victims reporting the abuse amid fears they would not be believed. One claimed her partner said: ""Who's going to believe you? There are lots of us."" There were multiple cases featuring ""failures in investigation"", the CWJ said, with statements not being taken including from children who claimed they had been abused, investigators not listening to recorded evidence of the discussion of a rape, and one victim being told ""you know how it works, it's your word against his"". The CWJ cited ""improper responses"" to reports, including one woman being told she should ""sit down together and sort it out"" with the husband she claimed raped her. It also complained of accused officers knowing those investigating them, with ""police culture"" including a ""sense of family"" with ""strong loyalty"" within a force. ""The criss-cross of personal connections undermines the trust of victims,"" the super complaint said. One woman said she saw a photograph on social media of her partner and the officer investigating him for domestic abuse. The CWJ said police officers were less likely to be convicted of domestic abuse offences than non police workers. A Freedom of Information request showed there were 19 convictions for 493 reports against police officers, a rate of 3.9%, while the general population rate is 6.2%, the report said. The complaint will be investigated,externalby HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, the IOPC and College of Policing who will then decide what action, if any, needs to be taken.

Italy virus death toll soars,"This video can not be played Milan quarantine resident: ""It's really important to be responsible in this moment"" The number of people to have died from the coronavirus in Italy has shot up by 133 in a day to 366, officials say. The total number of infections leapt 25% to 7,375 from 5,883, according to the Civil Protection agency. The jump in figures comes as millions adapt to radical measures introduced on Sunday in an attempt to contain the outbreak. Up to 16 million people in Lombardy and 14 provinces need special permission to travel under new quarantine rules. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also announced the closure of schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues across the whole country. The restrictions will last until 3 April. Latest updates here The latest figures mean Italy now has the highest number of confirmed infections outside China, where the outbreak originated in December. It has overtaken South Korea, where the total number of cases is nearing 7,400. Italy has one of the world's oldest populations.The virus is particularly dangerous for the elderlyand those with underlying health conditions. Among the latest people to test positive in Italy is the army's chief of staff. Salvatore Farina said he felt well and was self-isolating. The strict new quarantine measures affect a quarter of the Italian population and centre on the rich northern part of the country that powers its economy. The health system is under immense strain in Lombardy, a northern region of 10 million people, where people are being treated in hospital corridors. ""We want to guarantee the health of our citizens. We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices, sometimes small and sometimes very big,"" Prime Minister Conte said as he announced the measures in the middle of Saturday night.

MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Under the new measures, people are not supposed to be able to enter or leave Lombardy, where Milan is the main city. The same restrictions apply to 14 provinces: Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano Cusio Ossola, Vercelli, Padua, Treviso and Venice. The UK Foreign Office advisesagainst all but essential travel to these areas. Some transport in and out of the regions affected continued on Sunday. Flights still arrived at Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, though some scheduled flights were cancelled. However, Italy's national carrier Alitalia said it would suspend all operations from Malpensa from Monday and Linate would only serve domestic routes. International flights would continue to and from Rome. The World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Italy for making ""genuine sacrifices"" with the restrictions. Until Sunday only about 50,000 people in northern Italy had been affected by quarantines. Last week the government announced the closure of all schools and universities across the country for 10 days. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But the country on Monday reported no new locally transmitted infection outside of Hubei province, where the outbreak began, for the second consecutive day. Although this indicates that the spread there is slowing, senior officials warned against reducing vigilance. In South Korea officials reported the lowest number of new cases in two weeks. Iran, one of the worst hotspots outside China, has now confirmed 6,566 infections and 194 deaths. However, the real figure is feared to be much higher. One report on Sunday, quoting a government envoy, said there had been 200 deaths in the northern Gilan province alone - but the figures were later removed. In France, the virus is spreading among MPs. Two more members of the National Assembly have tested positive, officials said late on Sunday. In total four deputies have been infected. Also on Sunday France reported 1,126 cases, a 19% increase in a day and the second largest number of infections in Europe after Italy.

Italy vows more funds to offset impact,"Controls are in place at railway stations in the quarantine zone Italy's government has pledged to further increase spending in a ""massive shock therapy"" to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The country is struggling to adapt to the most restrictive measures since World War Two, introduced on Sunday. Up to 16 million people in northern Italy now need permission to travel under quarantine rules. With 366 deaths now confirmed, Italy is the worst-hit country in the world after China. Latest updates here In a separate development, six people died in a prison riot in the city of Modena amid protests at the introduction of new restrictions, local media report. Prisoners set fire to a cell block after they were told that visits would be suspended, officials said. It is thought that at least two of the dead lost their lives to drug overdoses after they raided the prison hospital for the heroin substitute methadone. On Monday, there were scuffles outside a prison in Modena, one of the areas in quarantine There were also riots at several other prisons in northern Italy. Detainees protest on the roof of the San Vittore prison in Milan Cases of the virus have been confirmed in all 20 Italian regions, with the total number of infections now at 6,387. The coronavirus causes the Covid-19 disease. In severe cases, patients have pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and multiple organ failure that can lead to death. On Monday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the government would pump in more money to mitigate the impact of the outbreak. He also said Italy would overcome the virus if people followed the rules, adding that the sacrifices required were for the good of all. This video can not be played Milan quarantine resident: ""It's really important to be responsible in this moment"" Italy is also seeking measures at EU level. On Monday morning, the main share index in Milan, the industrial powerhouse at the heart of the worst-affected area, opened down more than 8%. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? IMMUNITY:Are women and children less affected? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The strict new quarantine measures will last until 3 April, the government says. They affect a quarter of the Italian population, and centre on the rich northern part of the country that powers the economy. The restrictions apply to Lombardy and 14 other provinces: Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano Cusio Ossola, Vercelli, Padua, Treviso and Venice. The UK Foreign Office advisesagainst all but essential travel to these areas. All schools and universities in the area are shut, as well as museums, cinemas and swimming pools. The government says only those with a serious work or family reason that cannot be postponed will be allowed in or out of the quarantine zone. Passengers departing on flights, except temporary visitors, will have to justify themselves, as will all those arriving by plane. There are controls at train stations to check temperatures. Cruise ships are forbidden to dock in Venice. The health system is under immense strain in Lombardy, a northern region of 10 million people where Milan is the main city. Regional hospitals are running short of beds and treating patients in corridors. The health ministry says the average age of deaths from the coronavirus is 81.4 years. Italy has one of the world's oldest populations.The virus is particularly dangerous for the elderlyand those with underlying health conditions. World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has praised Italy for making ""genuine sacrifices"". Until Sunday only about 50,000 people in northern Italy had been affected by quarantines. On Sunday, we drove up to the edge of the exclusion zone. We were expecting to see roadblocks or controls in place and we didn't see anything at all. Cars were going in both directions. It seemed as though the control of this restricted zone was quite loose, and that was a bit difficult to understand. Is this simply too big an area to control and close off in the heart of Europe, or are the restrictions gradually coming into place? We've seen pictures from inside the restricted cities, and the streets are very deserted, but we're not seeing police checkpoints as such. But perhaps this is going to be stepped up in the coming days because there are even penalties of three months in prison or a fine of â¬206 (Â£179; $235) for breaking the rules. The real fear is that, in the hours between the quarantine being announced and it coming into effect, people have gone from more infected areas in the north down south. There are healthcare facilities in southern Italy, far less developed than those here in the north, that are going to seriously struggle. The number of infections worldwide is now more than 107,000, with about 3,600 deaths. China, which has recorded the highest number of fatalities, reported no new locally transmitted infection outside of Hubei province, where the outbreak began, for the second consecutive day. Although this indicates that the spread there is slowing, senior officials warned against reducing vigilance. In other developments: South Koreaofficials reported the lowest number of new cases in two weeks Iranconfirmed 6,566 infections and 194 deaths, however the real figures is feared to be much higher InFrance, two more lawmakers tested positive, officials said on Sunday In theUS, the number of confirmed cases exceeds 500 In Britain, UK PM Boris Johnson will hold an emergency Cobra meeting A cruise ship that was barred by Malaysia and Thailand over coronavirus fears will be allowed to dock inSingapore This video can not be played Pope Francis on videolink address: ""The Pope is caged in the library"" Have you or someone you know been affected by coronavirus?

Asian stock markets tumble after oil prices crashStock markets remain on edge from oil price war and weak economic data due to the coronavirus spread.,"Shares around the world had their worst day since the financial crisis with the dramatic falls leading to the day being dubbed ""Black Monday"". The main financial indexes in the US closed down by more than 7%, while London's index of top shares ended the day nearly 8% lower. Similar drops took place across Europe and Asia as a row between Russia and Saudi Arabia saw oil prices plunge. Shares were already reeling from fears of the impact of coronavirus. Analysts described the market reaction as ""utter carnage"". In the US, the major stock indexes fell so sharply at the start of trading, that the buying and selling of shares was halted for 15 minutes, as a so-called ""circuit breaker"" aimed at curbing panicky selling came into effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank by 7.8% or more than 2,000 points - the biggest points-drop in history and the largest decline in percentage terms since the financial crisis. The S&P 500 fell 7.6%, while the Nasdaq dropped about 7.3%. The declines in London wiped some Â£125bn off the value of major UK firms. The UK and US falls were mirrored by similar declines in Europe, with the main stock market indexes in France, Germany and Spain all closing over 7% lower. ""There is panic setting into the market right now,"" said Andrew Lo, professor of finance at MIT's Sloan School of Management. ""Things are going to get worse before they get better."" The dramatic drops were triggered by a row between Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil output. Saudi Arabia said it would slash prices and pump more oil, sparking fears of a price war. This came after Russia rejected a proposal by oil exporters to cut supply to cope with lower demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. Analysts said Saudi Arabia was ""flexing its muscles"" to protect its position in the oil market. On Monday, the price of international oil benchmark Brent fell almost a third in its biggest drop since the Gulf War in 1991 before recovering slightly to trade 20% lower. The price of oil had already fallen sharply this year as the coronavirus began to spread internationally, with demand for fuel expected to decline. Those conditions make Saudi Arabia's decision to increase output ""extremely surprising"", said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""This is not the first time that we've had a shock to the oil market, but it is the first time that I can recall that you've had a supply shock and a demand shock at the same time,"" he said. ""The craziness that you're seeing in the oil prices today, and companies related to oil and gas, is a reflection of this being pretty unprecedented."" In the US and UK, oil firms led the market declines, with shares in Shell, BP and Chevron down about 15% or more. Premier Oil saw its shares more than halve in value. In Frankfurt and Paris, banks were hit hardest, while the Russian rouble tumbled about 8% to its weakest level since 2016. In Brazil, steep falls in morning trade also triggered a temporary pause with shares ending the day down 12%. Earlier, Asian markets had also fallen sharply, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index down 5% while Australia's ASX 200 slumped 7.3% - its biggest daily drop since 2008. In China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite fell 3%, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index sank 4.2%. Elsewhere on the markets, the price of gold hitting a seven-year high at one point, trading at $1,700 per ounce. Gold is often seen as a desirable asset to hold in times of uncertainty. And in a historic moment, demand for benchmark UK government bonds for two-, three-, four-, six- and seven-year maturities pushed prices so high that yields - or the rate of return on the bond - briefly turned negative for the first time. A negative yield means investors will lose money from holding the bond. Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. While people have in the past responded to lower oil prices with making travel plans and other spending, the coronavirus is likely to curb that response, said Beth Ann Bovino, chief US economist at S&P Global Ratings. And economists have said that if the decline in oil prices continue, they are likely to have far-reaching economic effects. This could potentially raise risk in debt markets or hurt investment in the energy sector, which plays an important economic role in many parts of the US. With uncertainty about the economy driven by questions about the coronavirus outbreak, leaders have a ""limited window of opportunity to contain the panic"", Prof Lo added. ""We can ask the public to be as confident as we want, but that's not going to restore confidence unless they see real progress,"" he said.

PM to hold emergency coronavirus meeting,"The UK will remain in the ""containment"" stage of its response to the coronavirus following an emergency Cobra meeting. It comes as the country's chief medical adviser confirmed a fourth person had died from the virus in the UK. There were319 confirmed cases in the UK as of 09:00 GMT,externalon Monday, a rise of 46 since the same time on Sunday. However, measures to delay the virus' spread with ""social distancing"" will not be introduced yet, ministers said. Number 10 said it accepted that the virus ""is going to spread in a significant way"", however. The latest person to die from the virus was in their 70s and had underlying health conditions, according to the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty. He said the patient, who was being treated at a hospital in Wolverhampton, appeared to have contracted the virus in the UK and that officials were tracing people they had been in contact with. Following the Cobra meeting, Downing Street said the prime minister ""will be guided by the best scientific advice"" but there was no need to cancel sporting events at this stage. Ministers have also been meeting with sports bodies to discuss their response to the outbreak, which could include staging matches behind closed doors. It comes asIreland's Six Nations rugby match in France on Saturday has been postponed,following an earlier decision to postpone England's match in Italy. However, Wales's game against Scotland in Cardiff is to go ahead as scheduled. Another two cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus were confirmed in Walesandanother five in Scotlandon Monday. LIVE:Follow the latest updates EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the government has enlisted an extra 700 people to support a growing number of enquiries to NHS 111, which he added is now dealing with more online enquiries than telephone calls. Mr Hancock added that a bill to help tackle the outbreak would be ""temporary and proportionate"". The UK's top share index,the FTSE 100, is facing its worst day since the financial crisisafter it fell by more than 8%, wiping billions off the value of major firms. The Bank of England has said it will take all necessary steps to protect financial and monetary stability, according to a spokesman for the prime minister. The UK is currently in the first phase - ""containment"" - ofthe government's four-part plan,externalto tackle the spread of coronavirus. The government has previously said ""social distancing"" measures to slow the spread of the virus could include a ban on sporting events and other large gatherings, and encouraging people to work from home rather than use crowded trains and buses. Such a step would require agreement from Prof Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Universal credit claimants who have to self-isolate will not be sanctioned, a work and pensions minister has confirmed. There is no reason to cancel large events at the moment, ministers say A European Union expert said the UK had only a ""few days"" to implement measures to prevent an outbreak like Italy's, which isthe worst outside China with 7,375 confirmed cases and 366 deaths. Environment Secretary George Eustice will also discuss contingency plans with supermarket chief executives, including proposals on how to support vulnerable groups who may have to self-isolate. As supermarkets restrict sales of some products to halt panic-buying, a survey suggested one in 10 shoppers are stockpiling. Boththe government and retailers say stockpiling is unnecessary, and Mr Hancock said food supplies would continue even in the ""reasonable worst-case"" scenario. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell accused the government of offering only ""vague statements"" in response to the outbreak, saying it needed to guarantee sick pay for all workers and address issues such as a shortage of 100,000 NHS staff. TheForeign Office has warned Britons to avoid large parts of northern Italyunder a coronavirus quarantine, unless their journey is essential. Those travelling from locked-down areas have also been advised to self-isolate if they returned to the UK in the last 14 days - even if they have shown no symptoms. Travellers from the rest of Italy are only told to self-isolate and call 111 if they have a cough, fever or shortness of breath. British nationals are still able to depart Italy without restriction, but some airlines - including easyJet and British Airways - have cancelled several flights to and from affected areas. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, told BBC Radio 5 Live ""enhanced measures"" were in place to screen passengers from Italy - but the only one he identified was training airline staff to spot the symptoms of Covid-19.

Public Health England said passengers on flights from northern Italy are also issued with information about symptoms and necessary actions to take, which will be extended to all flights from Italy by Wednesday. However, the Unite union, which represents many cabin crew, said ""there has been no training"" for its members working on flights from northern Italy. The Foreign Office said it was ""working intensively"" to arrange a flight home for 142 Britons on board the Grand Princess cruise ship,which is due to dock in California on Monday after spending five daysstranded off the coast because of 21 cases among crew and passengers. Neil Hanlon, from Bridgwater in Somerset, told BBC Breakfast thatfood on board has become ""very limited""and he was ""gutted"" that it may take until later in the week until he and his wife Victoria can fly home. Amid concerns that fake news about the coronavirus is causing confusion,a specialist unit to combat disinformation has been set up. Teams from across Whitehall have been brought together to identify and respond to disinformation in a bid to limit its spread.

Gender pay gaps widen at financial firms,"Dame Helena Morrissey says more needs to be done Many financial firms are paying the average man almost 25% more than the average woman, with HSBC posting an overall pay gap of 47.8%. It is the third year UK organisations with more than 250 employees have been legally required topublish a snapshot of their gender pay gap,external. Of the financial and insurance firms reporting so far, the gap has risen to 23.1%, from 22.2% two years ago. Across all employees and sectors,the ONS estimates the gap is 17.3%.,external The gender pay gap is the difference between average hourly earnings for men and women across an organisation. So far, only a quarter of financial firms have reported their figures, less than one month before the deadline. The BBC looked at a company's median pay gap - that is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. HSBC says its pay gap - averaged out across its eight divisions and 40,000 strong workforce - was 47.8% in 2019, almost identical to a year earlier. The main driver was fewer women in high paid senior leadership roles and more women working in junior positions, it said. ""It will take time to redress the imbalance and the results of our work today may not fully be realised until today's pipeline of new joiners becomes tomorrow's business leaders,"" the bank said in its supporting statement. Between 2017 and 2019: Lloyds Bank and Santander's UK retail operations have closed their gap by more than 2% , but are still above the sector average at 40.5% and 26.6% respectively Co-op Bank's gap remained at 22.6% and Barclay's retail operation had a small increase to 14.5% Both the investment firm Aberdeen Asset Management (which has since merged with Standard Life) and HBOS reported 1.6% increases. Reporting for the first time, NatWest posted a gender pay gap of 34.1% while the gap at HSBC's UK retail arm was 18.7% Dame Helena Morrissey, one of the City's most high profile women, and founder of the Diversity Project, says some firms are merely complying with the law, with ""woolly or non-existent"" plans to improve. ""I think the initial year of naming and shaming has become a blunted instrument because so many have such a bad [gender pay gap] number,"" she said. ""Personally I feel it is very hard to engineer the closing of the gap, because even if you attract women in, if they are not happy in the industry they will leave."" Average pay gaps at city firms have grown to 23.1% since compulsory reporting was brought in two years ago Analysis of financial firms shows the average gender pay gap for bonuses is 37.7%. This is an increase from 35.3% two years ago. Aberdeen Asset Manager, Barclays' commercial arm, NatWest and Standard Life Investments were all paying out bonuses that are over 50% higher for men, on average. Bonus payments are recorded separately, but can form a substantial part of employee salaries at financial institutions. Ann Cairns, executive vice-chair of MasterCard, is global co-chair of the 30% Club, which aims to boost the number of women in senior leadership. She says that on the ground, she sees companies are starting to take their pay gaps seriously. MasterCard's Ann Cairns (third from left) says corporate culture can't be changed overnight ""It's more transparent out there at the moment and it affects whether people want to work for you - it affects your perception in the market, and investors are starting to pay a lot more attention to it,"" she says. ""There are probably firms out there who think 'I really care, but I don't know how to change and it takes a lot of time and effort'. You are not going to change the corporate culture or mix of people overnight. ""We are not pro quota, because you can make people do something, but if you haven't changed the underlying culture I don't think anybody feels good about that."" But she adds ""if you can't change the trajectory in 3-5 years then you have to start asking yourself questions. This whole thing that you can't find qualified women - I don't think that's true"". Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. If you line up all the men and women working at a company in two separate lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his. Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend-per-woman and its total spend-per-man. The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation. Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay. Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work. That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things, for example fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs.

'Shaming' of Australia GP with virus angers doctors,"Dr Chris Higgins tested positive for Covid-19 last week Doctors in Australia have demanded an apology from a state health minister who sharply criticised a GP for working while unaware he had coronavirus. Dr Chris Higgins treated about 70 patients in Melbourne while sick with what he thought was a cold. On Saturday, Victoria's Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said she was ""flabbergasted that a doctor that has flu-like symptoms presented to work"". Dr Higgins defended himself, saying he had followed official advice. ""I believe you have taken a cheap opportunity for political grandstanding and would appreciate an apology,"" he said in a statement to Ms Mikakos. Dr Higgins, the father of well-known Australian singer Missy Higgins, said he had returned from a trip to the US on 29 February. It's believed he contracted the virus overseas. In a press briefing, Ms Mikakos acknowledged that doctors were ""dedicated"" but added: ""It is irresponsible for people to be going to work if they are unwell."" She didn't name Dr Higgins, but identified his clinic and other details. She also suggested his conduct could be referred to regulators. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Responding on social media, Dr Higgins identified himself as the ""doctor concerned"". He said: ""I have been upset about the inaccuracies and unfairness of your comments. ""I hesitated to do a swab because I did not fulfil your criteria for testing but did one anyway on Thursday evening for sake of completeness, not imagining for one moment it would turn out to be positive,"" he added. Dr Higgins has received much support from others, including the Australian Medical Association (AMA) - the peak representative body for doctors. A former AMA president, Dr Kerryn Phelps, said the row had""unleashed a rare mood of fury amongst Australia's GPs"".,external Doctors have criticised Ms Mikakos' comments More than 15,000 people have signed a petition calling for an apology, while #IStandWithChrisHiggins and #Flabbergaslighting trended online.

Ms Mikakos declined to apologise on Monday, reiterating warnings to health care workers to stay home if they were unwell. She said she had contacted Dr Higgins directly and wished him well for his recovery. The saga has highlighted some confusion about Australia's public health advice about coronavirus. Critics say politicians have sometimes contradicted or overstepped the guidance from health officials.

'We use an egg timer to remind staff to wash hands',"Shai Aharony's company is taking hand washing very seriously The government has said thatup to a fifth of the UK workforce could be off sickin a major coronavirus outbreak. So how are businesses around the world coping as the deadly virus spreads? The main advice for people to try to avoid catching coronavirus has been to wash their hands frequently and thoroughly. Shai Aharony, chief executive of digital marketing agency Reboot, has taken things one step further for his 25 or so staff. Employees must wash their hands every 30 minutes and, in case they forget, Mr Aharony told the BBC: ""We have an egg timer on one of the tables and it just goes off every half an hour."" Keyboard and mouse sharing is strictly forbidden at Reboot. ""My wife goes around wiping all the surfaces, door handles, phones,"" he added. ""And anyone who has been to a high-risk location since the outbreak has been asked to stay at home for two weeks, fully paid. ""Where possible, we ask them to work from home and video call for any meetings. We have also banned table tennis in the office."" This video can not be played Watch how germs spread and how you can prevent it Staff at software firm Quantiq are regularly allowed to work from home one or two days a week. However, the coronavirus outbreak means all staff are being encouraged to work remotely on a regular basis. ""We have about 20 people in today, a third of what we have [in London],"" Lisa Lancaster, a business manager at the firm, told the BBC. Lisa Lancaster, a business manager at software firm Quantiq Lisa is one of the senior managers and at least one of them has to be in the office every day. But the company is advising staff who do commute into the office to avoid travelling in the rush hour, and has also ordered them face masks. Lisa added: ""We might be overreacting with these measures, but we'd rather be safe than sorry.  It is critical we put our employees and clients first and reduce the risk by travelling less.  Our team based in our Manila office is also working from home."" Paul Cosford, Emeritus Medical Director at Public Health England, told the BBC it made sense for employers to try and facilitate remote working when possible as the virus spread. Some businesses, such as airline Emirates, are also offering employees the chance to take unpaid leave until everything blows over. Large investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Citibank which already have back-up office locations outside of London in case of natural disasters have been sending some staff there to test they work. But for firms such as pub, factory and bakery staff which can't work from home they are, for now, still expected to show up. Large food retail and hospitality companies such as Gregg's and JD Wetherspoon said there was even more emphasis on hygiene and cleanliness than usual. Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said staff shouldn't come to work if they thought they were sick and could be infectious. ""They would be paid, but they would also be expected to get it checked out,"" Mr Gershon added. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Interior Minister Horst Seehofer he was right to refuse to shake her hand at a summit in Berlin Handshake greetings could be off the agenda in the near future for business people, as they try to avoid catching coronavirus. In fact, a German minister recently refused to shake Chancellor Angela Merkel's hand at a meeting. Laura Foll, from asset management firm Janus Henderson, told the BBC: ""I've decided that company meetings will be a non-shaking hand event. ""I think companies will be quite happy with that. If you think you're doing a corporate roadshow around all of Europe, think how many investors' hands you're going to have to shake."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Business people want to feel part of a community of their peers, and meeting in person still counts... Without the trusty handshake to fall back on, we may have to start getting creative."" The World Health Organization's director of pandemic disease,Sylvie Brand, retweeted suggestions,externalfor other ways of greeting people, including elbow bumping, waving and ""foot shaking"", whereby people greet each other by tapping heels. Up to fifth of UK workers 'could be off sick at same time' Twitter tells staff to work from home How is the UK planning for an outbreak? What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? Some businesses are telling staff not to travel unless it's absolutely essential. Twitter has suspended all non-critical business travel and events for its staff. Amazon and Goldman Sachs have also banned all non-essential staff travel, particularly to badly hit regions such as Hubei province in China, Northern Italy and Iran. Magic circle law firm, Linklaters, has said that for the month of March, it will cancel any large meetings with more than 30 people in attendance. Big business conferences such as Mobile World Conference in Barcelona have also been cancelled at great cost to organisers. However, other big events such as the home decor exhibition KBB - due to be held at the Birmingham NEC arena in March - are still going ahead for now. HR expert Tracey Hudson The coronavirus outbreak is giving some firms the chance to catch up with some of those jobs that usually get put off - albeit reluctantly Tracey Hudson, of the HR Dept, works with small and medium-sized businesses and has many clients in the events industry. ""A lot of events are being cancelled so the companies are getting their staff to work in a different way. They are working from home on all those projects that have been sitting there,"" she told the BBC. ""One firm is reviewing its accounts system and another is writing social media marketing posts for the next three months to have content lined up. ""Another one, which was planning on moving offices next year, has pulled the project forward and is working on it now."" Unfortunately, other firms have not been so lucky. ""One firm has already laid off staff this week as they can't bankroll it after all the cancellations,"" said Tracey.

British Steel takeover set to be completed,"A Chinese firm completed its takeover of British Steel on Monday. Jingye Group said that the move would save more than 3,000 jobs in Scunthorpe and Teesside and it would modernise the towns' steelworks. The firm reportedly offered Â£50m to buy the companyafter it collapsed and was placed under the control of the UK Insolvency Service last year. Unions have said that although the deal ""must be celebrated"", about 450 workers still face losing their jobs. British Steel employed about 5,000 people at the time of its collapse, and is the second-largest steelmaker in the country. The sale includes the steelworks at Scunthorpe, mills in Teesside and Skinningrove, as well as the TSP Engineering business based in Cumbria. Jingye Group, which also makes steel, has promised to invest about Â£1.2bn over the next 10 years on upgrading its plants and machinery. Jingye's chief executive, Li Hiuming, said: ""It has not been an easy journey since we first announced our intentions in November. ""But the longer I have spent in Scunthorpe, the more I have come to believe in the successful future of these steelworks and the employees that have made them famous throughout the world."" He added that the deal marks the ""beginning of a new illustrious chapter"" in the history of British steelmaking. Charlotte Childs, an organiser for the GMB union, described the deal as ""a big win for the industry"", but expressed disappointment at job cuts. She said: ""It is heartbreaking that long-serving members of high-skilled staff, many of whom have given their entire career to British steel, are seen as surplus to requirements."" Tony Watson worked on and off for British Steel from the age of 16. Tony Watson, a British Steel worker and GMB union convenor, is one of those who has been made redundant. Mr Watson, who worked for British Steel on and off since the age of 16, told the BBC he received an email from HR with the news. ""The way the process has been done has been a bit brutal,"" he said. But Mr Watson added that he was ""feeling optimistic"" about the prospect of hunting for a new job at age 59. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he wanted ""to reassure British Steel employees who may be facing redundancy that we are mobilising all available resources to give immediate on the ground support and advice to those affected"". Confirmation of the takeover follows months of uncertainty for workers. The government has kept British Steel running since last May, as it looked for a buyer for the business.Jingye signed an agreement to purchase British Steel in Novemberafter talks between the Official Receiver, which handled the insolvency process, and a Turkish bidder fell apart. The Official Receiver said that it was ""grateful"" to British Steel employees for their professionalism during a difficult time. Unions have said that nearly 500 British Steel workers could still face losing their jobs In January, the French government said it might veto the dealbecause it considered British Steel's plant in Hayange a strategic national asset. Located in north-east France, the plant is seen as important because it supplies track for the country's railways. Jingye's boss said earlier this year that he remained ""interested"" in purchasing the plant, but has pressed on with purchasing assets in the UK and the Netherlands. British Steel was formed in 2016 after being sold by India's Tata for Â£1 to the private equity firm Greybull Capital. It entered insolvency less than three years later.It had sought financial support from the governmentbefore it was placed in liquidation. They've been making iron and steel in Scunthorpe for more than 150 years. This is very much a one-industry town and when the steelworks struggles the whole community feels it. The plant directly employs almost 3,000 people but supports another 20,000 jobs in the wider supply chain. From hairdressers to market traders, businesses say they've noticed people reining in their spending amid the ongoing uncertainty. The bulk of British Steel's staff work at the Scunthorpe plant The loss-making steel plant has had a string of owners over the decades from Corus to Tata Steel to Greybull Capital - all tried and failed to turn the business around. A fourth-generation steelworker told me back in May that it felt as though they were ""staring over the edge of the abyss"" as the plant was on the brink of closure with mass redundancies ahead. But - again - Scunthorpe steelworks has been rescued by a new owner at the eleventh hour promising huge investment. There is some scepticism about how much influence China will soon have in the UK steel industry. While steelworkers are deeply relieved that the takeover is going ahead, they are asking what Jingye can and will do differently amid tough global trading conditions where many before have struggled.

""That advice may change as the science changes but at the moment, that's where we are,"" she said.

When asked about her plans to travel to the United States, along with Deputy First Minister Ms O'Neill, this week, she said: ""The reason we go is because we have very good access to the leader of the US and businesses, but we have to balance that with the needs here in the UK so we will be looking at that in the coming hours.""

Stockpiled protective equipment will also be released for front-line NHS and social services staff, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said on Monday. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Walesrose to six on Monday. Mr Gething said the packs were part of robust ""infection-control measures"". The safety packs, which were prepared over the weekend, will be sent to the 640 surgeries in Wales this week.

""It is important that front-line medical and social care staff have the equipment they need to keep them safe while they help people with suspected coronavirus,"" he added. ""The face masks, gloves and aprons are part of a stockpile that we have in place as part of our contingency planning, should they be needed to support our NHS and social services."" Dr David Bailey, chairman of the British Medical Association's Welsh council, said the commitment would ""go a considerable way"" to making sure that GPs and other frontline staff could care for patients through this difficult time. ""We understand that many doctors will be concerned about the current control measures and the possibility of spreading the virus between patients,"" he said.

"Italy virus death toll soars amid travel banItaly's coronavirus death toll jumps by 133 in a day to 366, as millions adapt to new restrictions.","This video can not be played Milan quarantine resident: ""It's really important to be responsible in this moment"" The number of people to have died from the coronavirus in Italy has shot up by 133 in a day to 366, officials say. The total number of infections leapt 25% to 7,375 from 5,883, according to the Civil Protection agency. The jump in figures comes as millions adapt to radical measures introduced on Sunday in an attempt to contain the outbreak. Up to 16 million people in Lombardy and 14 provinces need special permission to travel under new quarantine rules. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also announced the closure of schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues across the whole country. The restrictions will last until 3 April. Latest updates here The latest figures mean Italy now has the highest number of confirmed infections outside China, where the outbreak originated in December. It has overtaken South Korea, where the total number of cases is nearing 7,400. Italy has one of the world's oldest populations.The virus is particularly dangerous for the elderlyand those with underlying health conditions. Among the latest people to test positive in Italy is the army's chief of staff. Salvatore Farina said he felt well and was self-isolating. The strict new quarantine measures affect a quarter of the Italian population and centre on the rich northern part of the country that powers its economy. The health system is under immense strain in Lombardy, a northern region of 10 million people, where people are being treated in hospital corridors. ""We want to guarantee the health of our citizens. We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices, sometimes small and sometimes very big,"" Prime Minister Conte said as he announced the measures in the middle of Saturday night. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? IMMUNITY:Are women and children less affected? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Under the new measures, people are not supposed to be able to enter or leave Lombardy, where Milan is the main city. The same restrictions apply to 14 provinces: Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano Cusio Ossola, Vercelli, Padua, Treviso and Venice. The UK Foreign Office advisesagainst all but essential travel to these areas. Some transport in and out of the regions affected continued on Sunday. Flights still arrived at Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, though some scheduled flights were cancelled. However, Italy's national carrier Alitalia said it would suspend all operations from Malpensa from Monday and Linate would only serve domestic routes. International flights would continue to and from Rome. The World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Italy for making ""genuine sacrifices"" with the restrictions. Until Sunday only about 50,000 people in northern Italy had been affected by quarantines. Last week the government announced the closure of all schools and universities across the country for 10 days. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The number of infections worldwide is more than 107,000, with about 3,600 deaths. Most of the fatalities have been in China. But the country on Monday reported no new locally transmitted infection outside of Hubei province, where the outbreak began, for the second consecutive day. Although this indicates that the spread there is slowing, senior officials warned against reducing vigilance. In South Korea officials reported the lowest number of new cases in two weeks. Iran, one of the worst hotspots outside China, has now confirmed 6,566 infections and 194 deaths. However, the real figure is feared to be much higher. One report on Sunday, quoting a government envoy, said there had been 200 deaths in the northern Gilan province alone - but the figures were later removed. In France, the virus is spreading among MPs. Two more members of the National Assembly have tested positive, officials said late on Sunday. In total four deputies have been infected. Also on Sunday France reported 1,126 cases, a 19% increase in a day and the second largest number of infections in Europe after Italy. The French government has banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people.

Solskjaer feels 'privileged' after derby win,"Anthony Martial is the first United player to score in both derbies in a Premier League season since Cristiano Ronaldo in 2006-07 Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said it is a ""privilege"" to manage his players as they completed the Premier League double over derby rivals Manchester City for the first time in a decade. This thunderous encounter was a personal nightmare for Manchester City's normally reliable Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson, who gifted Solskjaer's side both goals in sharply contrasting fashion. He allowed Anthony Martial's routine shot to squirm under his body from a quick Bruno Fernandes free-kick on the half-hour and then, with seconds left, threw a clearance straight to Scott McTominay, who showed great technique to send a long-range finish, struck first time, into the net in front of a delirious Stretford End. This video can not be played Solskjaer and Fernandes have 'turned Man Utd around' It is a win that leaves Liverpool - who now have a 25-point lead at the top of the table - requiring only two more wins to secure their first league title for 30 years and Manchester United only three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, after their first derby league double since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. City hotly contested the free-kick, given by referee Mike Dean for a foul by Ilkay Gundogan on Fernandes, that led to Martial's goal - although United also felt they were denied a penalty when Fred was booked for diving after tangling with Nicolas Otamendi. Sergio Aguero had a goal ruled out for offside by VAR and even though City enjoyed the greater share of possession, United sealed a crucial win with McTominay's strike to take their unbeaten run to 10 games in all competitions. ""It's a privilege to be their manager,"" Solskjaer told BBC Sport. ""They give absolutely everything. They know they are all good players but they want to learn as well. ""We feel we are improving as a squad and a team. We feel the fans want us to do well and they see what we are doing, so it is getting better and better. ""But we are still fifth. We need points to catch Chelsea and Leicester, so need to keep plugging away."" This video can not be played Man Utd 2-0 Man City: 'It's a privilege to be manager of this young squad' - Solskjaer The jubilant scenes and the sound of his name echoing around Old Trafford at the final whistle will have been music to the ears of Manchester United manager Solskjaer. The Norwegian, still to convince many of his suitability for the giant task of turning Manchester United's fortunes around, has now enjoyed three wins over Pep Guardiola and Manchester City this season - and this was surely the most satisfying day of the season at 'The Theatre Of Dreams'. United may still be light years away from the glory days of old but victories such as this sustain hope, and the atmosphere inside Old Trafford as Solskjaer's side first held on to their advantage and then sealed the win was reminiscent of days gone by. Manchester City may have enjoyed the greater share of possession but United showed great resilience and always carried a threat on the break. Fernandes once again confirmed what a shrewd piece of business his signing was from Sporting Lisbon - although why wait so late in the window to sign him? - and why he is already a hero to United's fans. The Portuguese has that touch of class and creativity while United had another outstanding performer in defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who won his battle with Raheem Sterling as he hounded the England star for 90 minutes and beyond. Manchester United, who have looked off the top four for so much of the time this season, are now right in the fight and credit must be given to the manager who has helped fashion this impressive run. ""We feel we are improving all the time. We know we lack one, two, three players to be considered a title contender and some experience,"" said Solskjaer. ""We are just going to start talking about going up the table, getting more points. ""Chelsea and Leicester are too far ahead for my liking."" This video can not be played Man Utd 2-0 Man City: Pep Guardiola says his side put in a good performance against rivals Manchester City's defeat is hardly damaging in the context of their Premier League title defence - that was lost to Liverpool a long time ago. Guardiola's concern, and admittedly he was without his star player Kevin de Bruyne, will be that once again his side had plenty of possession but did not create enough, not showing enough urgency until it was too late. And he will be concerned by the performance of goalkeeper Ederson, who was over-confident throughout and paid a heavy price. Ederson was not only badly at fault for both goals but almost gave away another when he allowed a routine pass to roll under his foot at the Stretford End, resulting in a desperate tackle on Martial almost on the goalline to spare his embarrassment. Guardiola will be additionally unhappy about this defeat, not least because it was City's seventh of the Premier League campaign, making 2019-20 the season in which he has lost the most league games in his managerial career. City now face home games against Arsenal and Burnley to get themselves in shape for the Champions League last-16 second leg meeting with Real Madrid, in which they hold a precious 2-1 advantage from the first leg in the Bernabeu. Guardiola will hope Ederson has got this carelessness and over-confidence out of his system. Aaron Wan-Bissaka won his battle with Raheem Sterling. He had more touches than any other United player and his eight tackles were twice as many as anyone else on the pitch Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola to BBC Match of the Day:""We played good, we missed a little in the final third but the second half was better and it was a good performance. ""We play the same way, tried the press and defend well and we did well. ""Our game is there, we played really good in terms of coming here. They wait and did long balls on the counter-attack for Daniel James and Anthony Martial. ""We did our game but unfortunately we conceded a goal. They waited for our mistakes."" United are unbeaten in their last 10 games (W7 D3); their longest run without defeat since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first 11 games in charge. This is the second time in Pep Guardiola's managerial career that he has suffered three defeats against a specific opponent in a single season (also versus Liverpool in 2017-18). Anthony Martial is only the second United player to score in three consecutive Premier League starts in Manchester derbies, and the first since Eric Cantona netted in five in a row between March 1993 and April 1996. Since making his debut in the competition on 1 February, United's Bruno Fernandes has been directly involved in more goals in the Premier League than any other player (five - two goals and three assists). Manchester City's Raheem Sterling became the fourth youngest player to reach 250 appearances in the Premier League, after Wayne Rooney, James Milner and Gareth Barry. City host Arsenal on Wednesday at 19:30 GMT in a rearranged Premier League fixture, with United going to LASK in Austria in the Europa League the following day (17:55 GMT).

British Steel takeover set to be completedThe Chinese Jingye Group has said that the Â£50m takeover is due to be completed on Monday.Business,"A Chinese firm completed its takeover of British Steel on Monday. Jingye Group said that the move would save more than 3,000 jobs in Scunthorpe and Teesside and it would modernise the towns' steelworks. The firm reportedly offered Â£50m to buy the companyafter it collapsed and was placed under the control of the UK Insolvency Service last year. Unions have said that although the deal ""must be celebrated"", about 450 workers still face losing their jobs. British Steel employed about 5,000 people at the time of its collapse, and is the second-largest steelmaker in the country. The sale includes the steelworks at Scunthorpe, mills in Teesside and Skinningrove, as well as the TSP Engineering business based in Cumbria. Jingye Group, which also makes steel, has promised to invest about Â£1.2bn over the next 10 years on upgrading its plants and machinery. Jingye's chief executive, Li Hiuming, said: ""It has not been an easy journey since we first announced our intentions in November. ""But the longer I have spent in Scunthorpe, the more I have come to believe in the successful future of these steelworks and the employees that have made them famous throughout the world."" He added that the deal marks the ""beginning of a new illustrious chapter"" in the history of British steelmaking. Charlotte Childs, an organiser for the GMB union, described the deal as ""a big win for the industry"", but expressed disappointment at job cuts. She said: ""It is heartbreaking that long-serving members of high-skilled staff, many of whom have given their entire career to British steel, are seen as surplus to requirements."" Tony Watson worked on and off for British Steel from the age of 16. Tony Watson, a British Steel worker and GMB union convenor, is one of those who has been made redundant. Mr Watson, who worked for British Steel on and off since the age of 16, told the BBC he received an email from HR with the news. ""The way the process has been done has been a bit brutal,"" he said. But Mr Watson added that he was ""feeling optimistic"" about the prospect of hunting for a new job at age 59. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he wanted ""to reassure British Steel employees who may be facing redundancy that we are mobilising all available resources to give immediate on the ground support and advice to those affected"". Confirmation of the takeover follows months of uncertainty for workers. The government has kept British Steel running since last May, as it looked for a buyer for the business.Jingye signed an agreement to purchase British Steel in Novemberafter talks between the Official Receiver, which handled the insolvency process, and a Turkish bidder fell apart. The Official Receiver said that it was ""grateful"" to British Steel employees for their professionalism during a difficult time. Unions have said that nearly 500 British Steel workers could still face losing their jobs In January, the French government said it might veto the dealbecause it considered British Steel's plant in Hayange a strategic national asset. Located in north-east France, the plant is seen as important because it supplies track for the country's railways. Jingye's boss said earlier this year that he remained ""interested"" in purchasing the plant, but has pressed on with purchasing assets in the UK and the Netherlands. British Steel was formed in 2016 after being sold by India's Tata for Â£1 to the private equity firm Greybull Capital. It entered insolvency less than three years later.It had sought financial support from the governmentbefore it was placed in liquidation. They've been making iron and steel in Scunthorpe for more than 150 years. This is very much a one-industry town and when the steelworks struggles the whole community feels it. The plant directly employs almost 3,000 people but supports another 20,000 jobs in the wider supply chain. From hairdressers to market traders, businesses say they've noticed people reining in their spending amid the ongoing uncertainty. The bulk of British Steel's staff work at the Scunthorpe plant The loss-making steel plant has had a string of owners over the decades from Corus to Tata Steel to Greybull Capital - all tried and failed to turn the business around. A fourth-generation steelworker told me back in May that it felt as though they were ""staring over the edge of the abyss"" as the plant was on the brink of closure with mass redundancies ahead. But - again - Scunthorpe steelworks has been rescued by a new owner at the eleventh hour promising huge investment. There is some scepticism about how much influence China will soon have in the UK steel industry. While steelworkers are deeply relieved that the takeover is going ahead, they are asking what Jingye can and will do differently amid tough global trading conditions where many before have struggled.
