Hopes fade in search for Beirut blast survivor,"This video can not be played Rescuers remove rubble in the hope of finding someone alive Hopes are fading in Beirut that anyone will be found beneath the rubble of a building destroyed in last month's explosion. Rescue workers are searching for the third day after sensor equipment detected possible signs of life. But the rescuers, including Chilean specialists, have not yet found the source of the signal. Beirut held a minute's silence on Friday to mark a month since the explosion, which killed almost 200. Thousands more were injured by the blast, which happened when 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate detonated. How long can survivors last under rubble? There has been outrage that so much hazardous material was stored unsafely in a warehouse in the city's port, close to many residential areas. This video can not be played A candle vigil was among the events held to mark one month since the explosion in Beirut The Lebanese government's resignation shortly afterwards failed to pacify protesters, who clashed with police in the city for several nights. One month on, seven people are still missing, according to Lebanese officials. Search efforts got under way after a rescue team from Chile said it had detected possible signs of life under a destroyed building located between the residential districts of Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael. The rescuers were walking through the area on Wednesday night when their sniffer dog - trained to find bodies - gave a sign that there was a person inside. When they returned on Thursday, the dog went to the same place and gave the same sign. Specialist sensor equipment then detected a pulsing signal in the area. The head of the Chilean rescue team, Francisco Lermanda, told reporters on Friday that slow breathing had been detected under the rubble at a depth of 3m (9.8ft). Rescuers dug three tunnels to try to reach the spot where the pulse was detected, he said. But, he added, it was too soon to know if anyone was ""alive or dead"" beneath the debris. Earlier on Friday, rescue co-ordinator Nicholas Saade told the AFP news agency that the pulse had slowed significantly since the previous day. Reporters at the scene said the most recent test detected no signals at all. Crowds have been gathering to watch the search efforts, hoping for a miracle. ""Search operations have been going on since the day before yesterday but the chances are very low,"" the civil defence agency's operations director, George Abou Moussa, told AFP. People at the scene have been hoping for a miraculous story of survival The Chilean rescuers are from the renowned Los Topos aid organisation, which took part in the2010 rescue of 33 Chilean miners trapped 700m (2,300ft) underground for more than two months. In the same year, the Chilean team also rescued a survivor after 27 days following a devastating earthquake in Haiti, the Washington Post reported.

Schools 'no greater risk' for children and staff,"Attending primary school puts children and staff at no greater risk of contracting coronavirus than staying at home, a study of 131 schools suggests. Tests to find out who had already had the virus found similar levels of antibodies in pupils and teachers. But the study, of 12,000 adults and children in England, was carried out in June and early July, when there were very few cases around. Experts say more studies are needed, when all children are attending school. This video can not be played BBC Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what schools are doing to keep pupils safe For the study, pupils and staff were tested during the last six weeks of the summer term when Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children could return to school. Since then, millions of children across the UKhave returned to the classroom,with lessons resuming in England and Wales in the past few days. Schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland reopened last month. Schools now look very different to what students were once used to, with pupils being told to stay in their ""bubble"" groups, follow one-way systems and social distance when necessary. Staggered start times have also been introduced, and hand-washing stations and screens installed. Bubbles vary widely between schools. Some primary schools treat each class as a separate bubble, while secondary schools often have bubbles composed of entire year groups - sometimes of up to 300 children. Children with a new classroom lay-out at a school in Southwark, south London Scientists from Public Health England, who ledthe study,external, found just three people (one child and two staff) tested positive for the virus - 0.02% of those swabbed. There was no evidence that any of these three people passed the virus on to others they lived with or worked with. This reflectsprevious research by PHE showing low numbers of cases and outbreaks in schools,external. A separate sample of 2,100 staff and children, who were tested for antibodies, found 10.6% of pupils and 12.7% of staff had previously had coronavirus. This could suggest that children are as likely as adults to be infected, rather than being less susceptible to the disease. But because so few positive cases in children are detected, it confirms previous research that they are likely to experience mild symptoms, or none at all. The study found children and staff who attended school more frequently were no more likely to test positive for antibodies than those who did not attend school, or went less often. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? This could indicate that infection levels in schools are simply reflecting virus levels in the communities where people live. However, some groups were more likely to have antibodies - they were non-white, lived in the same house as a healthcare worker and had experienced symptoms. Secondary schools were not included in the study, so no conclusions can be drawn about older children. Dr Shamez Ladhani, consultant epidemiologist, from Public Health England said: ""This is the largest study of its kind in the country and suggests attending preschool and primary school brings no additional risk to either staff or students. ""Although these results are preliminary, they should be very reassuring to parents who may be anxious about their children returning to school."" Dr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer and consultant paediatrician, from Imperial College London, said it was a ""good quality study"" but ""limited by timing"" as there was very low transmission of coronavirus during the period studied. ""It is essential that studies such as these continue over the next few months, and importantly, are also performed in secondary school and college settings,"" she added. Williamson says A-levels and GCSEs likely to be later next summer Labour calls for delays to next summer's exams Next year's exams will need to be slimmed down, say head teachers Prof Ravindra Gupta, professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, cautioned that schools would now be coping with two to six times more children, which could alter the results. ""There is less ability to socially distance than schools were able to in June. We must not be complacent and falsely reassured. We must ensure adequate monitoring and testing strategies to pick up infections in schools before they spread,"" he said. Regarding the finding that children were often asymptomatic, Prof Gupta said that meant ""children may still continue to attend school if we do not regularly test for the virus in schools"".

Abbott appointed to UK trade adviser role,"This video can not be played The prime minister says he ""can't be expected"" to agree with everyone who works with the government. Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been appointed as an unpaid trade adviser to the UK government. Boris Johnson rejected claims Mr Abbott was not suitable for the role, despite criticism over past comments on women, LGBT people and climate change. The UK prime minister said he did ""not agree with those sentiments"". Mr Abbott, who negotiated trade deals for Australia when in power, will not take part in post-Brexit talks between the UK and other countries. Instead, he will advise the new Board of Trade, set up to help ministers and encourage firms to do more business internationally. Who is Tony Abbott? UK 'sleepwalking into disaster' over border plans New Zealand 'frustrated' over UK trade talks Mr Abbott was a prominent opponent of same-sex marriage in Australia's 2017 referendum on the issue and has been accused of making homophobic and misogynist comments in the past. He has also described the idea of climate change as ""faddish"" and, last year, claimed the world was ""in the grip of a climate cult"". Asked about the new appointee's past comments, Mr Johnson said he could not be expected to agree with all the views of everyone who worked with the government. He said Mr Abbott had been elected by the ""great, liberal democratic nation of Australia,"" adding: ""I think that speaks for itself."" This government has recently had the word ""U-turn"" lobbed at it, a lot. But there's been no change of heart here. While the appointment of Tony Abbott has sparked serious concern in some quarters, the government has on this occasion decided it doesn't want to back down. Perhaps it doesn't want to hand critics more ""U-turn"" ammunition. And ministers have argued that Mr Abbott will bring real trade expertise. But there may also be a calculation in Downing Street, rightly or wrongly, that this is a ""Westminster bubble"" issue - a story that, in the end, won't do the government significant political damage. Other advisers to the Board of Trade will include former Labour health secretary Patricia Hewitt, ex-Conservative Member of the European Parliament Daniel Hannan and economist and broadcaster Linda Yueh. Mr Abbott, who was prime minister of Australia from 2013 to 2015, negotiated free-trade deals with Japan, China and South Korea. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he had ""real concerns"" and ""wouldn't appoint"" Mr Abbott if he were prime minister. Tony Abbott at the launch of sister Christine Forster's book in June Shadow international development secretary Emily Thornberry said Mr Abbott was ""the wrong"" choice ""on every level"" and had ""no experience of detailed trade negotiations, no understanding of Brexit, no belief in climate change, no concern for workers' rights"". A group of equality activists - including actor Sir Ian McKellen and Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies - haswritten an open letter against Mr Abbott's appointment,external. It says: ""This is a man who described abortion as 'the easy way out' and suggested that men may be 'by physiology or temperament more adapted to exercise authority or to issue command'."" ""For all these reasons and more besides, this man is not fit to be representing the UK as our trade envoy,"" the letter adds. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Abbott had ""no place in any British government"". And the SNP's deputy Westminster leader, Kirsten Oswald, called the appointment ""beyond indefensible"". But Mr Abbott's sister, Christine Forster, defended him against claims of misogyny and homophobia. ""As a woman who has always been part of his life and who came out to him as gay in my early 40s, I know incontrovertibly that Tony is neither of those things,""she wrote on Twitter.,external ""In reality he is a man of great conviction and intellect; an unabashed conservative but with great compassion, respect for others, and an indelible sense of doing what is right."" This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake breaks down the next round of Brexit negotiations The Board of Trade will meet four times a year. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, who will chair the body, said: ""At a time of increased protectionism and global insecurity, it's vital that the UK is a strong voice for open markets and that we play a meaningful role in reshaping global trading rules alongside like-minded countries."" She said she was bringing together ""a diverse group of people who share Britain's belief in free enterprise, democracy, and high standards and rules-based trade"".

UK pressed over probe into NI solicitor's murderA Council of Europe committee also wants to know how the UK intends to deal with other NI legacy cases.Northern Ireland,"Pat Finucane, a 39-year-old Belfast solicitor, was shot dead in front of his wife and children The UK government has been asked how it intends to comply with a Supreme Court ruling on the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has demanded ""concrete information"" by 22 October. Mr Finucane was shot by loyalist paramilitaries in front of his young family at their home in February 1989. In 2019, the Supreme Court ruledthere had not been a human rights-compliant inquiry into his death. But the justices ruled out a public inquiry of the type demanded by the family and said it was for the state to decide ""what form of investigation, if indeed any is now feasible, is required"". A UK government spokesperson says it is committed to ""taking forward these important issues as soon as possible"". The Committee of Ministers is a decision-making body made up of the ministers for foreign affairs of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe. The committee issued an eight-point document, which included a call for the authorities take a decision ""without delay"" on how to proceed. A general measure further expressed concern at the ""lack of detail"" in the government's approach to mechanisms to deal with the past. Mr Finucane's widow Geraldine welcomed the statement, saying it was ""disappointing the UK government must be compelled in this way"". ""It would appear that the Committee of Ministers has now run out of patience and, like me, is demanding clear answers,"" she added. Geraldine Finucane has been involved in a long-running legal battle over her husband's murder Dublin's Minister of Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has welcomed the decision in relation to both the Pat Finucane murder and the wider issue of legacy cases. The Irish government said it was a ""matter of significant and increasing concern"" that the legislation to implement theStormont House Agreement frameworkto deal with Troubles-related cases has not been progressed. ""Victims and survivors have had to wait for far too long for a suitable and effective system in Northern Ireland to deal with the legacy of the Troubles,"" the government said. Mr Finucane was a high-profile solicitor and convicted members of the IRA were among his clients. In February 2019, the Supreme Court judges said none of the inquiries into Mr Finucane's death, including the review carried out by Sir Desmond de Silva, had the capability ""of establishing all the salient facts"" about his killing or the liability of those who were responsible for his death. In his 2012 review, Sir Desmond de Silva QC said the state had facilitated Mr Finucane's killing and made relentless efforts to stop the killers being caught. However, his reportconcluded there had been ""no overarching state conspiracy"". Update 9 October 2020:  This article was amended to clarify the ruling of the Supreme Court with regard to a new investigation into the murder of Mr Finucane.

PM: Airport tests 'give false sense of security',"This video can not be played The PM says the quarantine system is ""an important part of our repertoire"" Coronavirus testing at airports may give a ""false sense of security"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, after suggestions it could be used to cut quarantine times for travellers. Mr Johnson said testing on arrival would only identify 7% of virus cases. It comes after a senior Tory MP backed calls from the struggling aviation sector to introduce airport testing. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis saidtesting could cut quarantine times to ""less than five days"". But speaking during a visit to Solihull, the prime minister rejected Mr Davis's comments, saying: ""The quarantine system that we have has got to be an important part of our repertoire, of our toolbox, in fighting Covid."" The BBC has been told a cabinet decision on whether to introduce airport testing has been repeatedly postponed and now may never happen. Why isn't the UK testing travellers on arrival? Airport tests will cut quarantine - senior Tory Differences in UK quarantine rules 'confusing' Mr Johnson said while he understood ""the difficulties"" the airline industry was facing, ""93% of the time you could have a real false sense of security, a false sense of confidence when you arrive and take a test"". The government said that percentage was based onmodelling by Public Health England,external. People entering the UK face 14 days of self-isolation unless they are travelling from countries that are exempt - a decision determined by the four nations' separate authorities. Mr Johnson also insisted the UK was ""overwhelmingly... proceeding as one"" with regards to quarantine rules,after his transport secretary admittedthat different rules across the four nations were ""confusing"". Earlier, Grant Shapps defended the decision not to impose restrictions on people entering England from Greece and Portugal - despite Scotland and Wales deciding to do so. He described Portugal as being on a ""borderline"", adding that ""the opinion of England and Northern Ireland is that it did not justify quarantine this week"". Mr Shapps said the four nations ""quite often come to slightly different outcomes, which I appreciate is confusing for people."" In Wales, people must now quarantine for two weeks if they arrive from Portugal, Gibraltar or six Greek islands: Crete, Mykonos, Zakynthos (also known as Zante), Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos. Arrivals to Scotland from Portugal and French Polynesia will have to self-isolate from 04:00 on Saturday. Scotland has already reintroduced quarantine for arrivals from Greece. What are the quarantine rules for my holiday? The rules apply to where passengers live, not where they fly back to - so a traveller flying to England who lives in Wales must abide by Welsh quarantine rules. Portugal, Greece and French Polynesia are still on England and Northern Ireland's lists of travel corridors. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries Heathrow's chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, has been urging the government to introduce airport testing since May, arguing it will help save the economy. Speaking before the prime minister's comments, Mr Holland-Kaye told the BBC that on-site testing facilities had already been set up and they were ""waiting for the government to give us the go-ahead"". ""It is frustrating that the government just has not made a decision to get on with this, when governments in other countries in Europe are getting on and making it happen,"" he said. Some countries, such as Iceland, offer travellers a choice on arrival if they have stayed in areas with high virus levels - anyone entering must either self-quarantine for 14 days or get tested for Covid-19. It comes as a further 10 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK,according to the latest figures,external. Another 1,940 people have tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 342,351.

Portugal quarantine rules come into force,"Portugal had previously been removed from the UK's quarantine list on 20 August Travellers arriving in Scotland from Portugal will have to self-isolate for 14 days under new quarantine rules that came into force on Saturday morning. Scotland and Wales haveadded the country to their ""quarantine list"",external- while England and Northern Ireland have not. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was a confusing position but the Scottish government insisted it was acting on scientific advice. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? The rules became effective from 04:00. French Polynesia is also now on Scotland's list of countries requiring quarantine, while self-isolation rules for Greece have been operating since Thursday. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the decision to add Portugal came after coronavirus cases there rose above 20 per 100,000 of the population. Mr Yousaf said: ""We are in the midst of a global pandemic and the situation in many countries can change suddenly. ""Therefore, people should think very hard before committing to non-essential travel abroad. ""With Scotland's relatively low infection rate, importation of new cases is a significant risk to public health."" The Scottish government was also closely monitoring the situation in Gibraltar, he added. But the move was questioned by UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps who told the BBC the Scottish government had decided to ""jump  the gun"" earlier in the week by adding Greece to its quarantine list without using data from the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC). On Portugal, he said the decision had failed to take into account the increased level of testing. He said the positivity rate - the proportion of positive tests - was  lower than it was when Portugal was added to the travel corridor list. A spokesman for the Scottish government, however, said Mr Shapps made his decision to keep Portugal on the travel corridor list before studying the latest JBC data. Travellers returning to Scotland will be required to self-isolate even if they have flown back to an airport in England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson later downplayed the difference between UK nations when questioned during a visit to the West Midlands. While conceding the devolved administrations sometimes have different approaches, he insisted the UK was ""proceeding as one"". ""I think you will find if you dig below the surface of some of the surface differentiations you will find overwhelmingly the UK takes the same approach,"" he said.

Earth's 'lost species' only the tip of the iceberg,"An endangered white-handed gibbon: The right conservation strategies can save the day Scientists have calculated how many mammals might be lost this century, based on fossil evidence of past extinctions. Their predictions suggest at least 550 species will follow in the footsteps of the mammoth and sabre-toothed cat. With every ""lost species"" we lose part of the Earth's natural history, they say. Yet, despite these ""grim"" projections, we can save hundreds of species by stepping up conservation efforts. Thenew research,external, published in the journal Science Advances, suggests that humans are almost entirely responsible for extinctions of mammals in past decades. And rates will escalate in the future if we don't take action now. Despite this ""alarming"" scenario, we could save hundreds if not thousands of species with more targeted and efficient conservation strategies, said Tobias Andermann of the Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre and the University of Gothenburg. In order to achieve this, we must increase our collective awareness about the ""looming escalation of the biodiversity crisis, and take action in combatting this global emergency"". ""Time is pressing,"" he said. ""With every lost species, we irreversibly lose a unique portion of Earth's natural history."" A mammoth skull at auction in New York City: Many more could follow this extinct species' path The scientists compiled a large dataset of fossils, which provided evidence for the timing and scale of recent extinctions. Their computer-based simulations predict large increases in extinction rates by the year 2100, based on the current threat status of species. Conservation: Glimmer of hope for world's rarest primate 'Billions of years of evolutionary history' under threat Nature crisis: Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' According to these models, the extinctions that have occurred in past centuries only represent the tip of the iceberg, compared with the looming extinctions of the next decades. ""Reconstructing our past impacts on biodiversity is essential to understand why some species and ecosystems have been particularly vulnerable to human activities - which can hopefully allow us to develop more effective conservation actions to combat extinction,"" said Prof Samuel Turvey of ZSL (Zoological Society of London). Last year an intergovernmental panel of scientists saidone million animal and plant species were now threatened with extinction.

Analysts say the comments could prove damaging with the president needing support from military voters as he bids for re-election. According to The Atlantic, Mr Trump cancelled a visit to a US cemetery outside Paris in 2018 because he said it was ""filled with losers"". Four sources told the magazine he rejected the idea of visiting because the rain would dishevel his hair, and he did not believe it important to honour America's war dead. Trump loves the military. Do they love him back? Trump says famed military newspaper will not close During the same trip, the president also allegedly referred to 1,800 US soldiers who died at Belleau Wood as ""suckers"". The battle helped to prevent a German advance on Paris during World War One and is venerated by the US Marine Corps. The Atlantic's reporting was based on anonymous sources but theAssociated Press said it had independently confirmed many of the remarks,external. A Fox News correspondent said she had corroborated some of the remarks. In 2018the White House said the visit was cancelled because bad weather had grounded the president's helicopter.This account was backed up in a recent book by President Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump. The US Navy also said it cancelled the trip to the cemeterybecause of rain,externalin response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act from Buzzfeed reporter Jason Leopold. On top of the comments from veterans, President Trump's challenger in November's presidential election, Joe Biden, responded by saying his rival was ""unfit"" to lead.

Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, a veteran who lost both legs while serving in Iraq, said President Trump ""liked to use the US military for his own ego"". Khizr Khan, the father of a US soldier killed in Iraqwho criticised Mr Trump during the 2016 Democratic convention, joined Ms Duckworth on the call. He said: ""When Donald Trump calls anyone who places their lives in service of others a loser, we understand Trump's soul."" President Trump has pushed back hard against the reports, calling them ""fake news"". ""To think that I would make statements negative to our military and our fallen heroes when nobody's done what I've done with the budgets, with the military budgets, with getting pay raises for our military,"" he said. ""It is a disgraceful situation by a magazine that's a terrible magazine."" Speaking to reporters on Friday, he suggested the source of the story was his former White House chief of staff, John Kelly. Mr Trump said the former US Marine general ""was unable to handle the pressure of this job"". Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Friday morning he was with the president for a good part of the trip to France and never heard him use the words described in the article. Defense Secretary Mark Esper was quoted by Politico as saying Mr Trump had ""the highest respect and admiration for our nation's military members, veterans and families"", though the Pentagon chief did not explicitly deny the story. Another former White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were among those in Mr Trump's orbit who rejected the story as false. The US president has often staked claim to strong support among the military, and Pew Research Center last year found that veterans were generally supportive of him as commander-in-chief,with 57% in favour.,externalThree-fifths of the veterans identified as Republican, the research found. But there have been previous spats and controversies. He caused outrage by saying the late Senator John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam, was not a ""war hero"" saying: ""I like people who weren't captured."" President Trump has never served in uniform. He received five deferments from a military draft during the Vietnam War - four for academic reasons and one for bone spurs, a calcium build-up in the heels.

Voyeur sentenced after woman's five-year campaign,"This video can not be played Emily Hunt: ""This isn't about vengeance, it's about justice"" A man has been sentenced for filming a naked woman in a hotel room while she was unconscious, following her five-year campaign for justice. Christopher Killick, 40, recorded a 62-second clip of Emily Hunt in an east London hotel in 2015. Prosecutors told Ms Hunt what he did was not illegal,until the law was clarified by the Court of Appeal. Killick, who previously pleaded guilty to voyeurism, was given a 30-month community order and fined Â£2,000. At a Stratford Magistrates' Court hearing, he was also ordered to pay Ms Hunt Â£5,000 in compensation and put on the sexual offenders register for five years. Christopher Killick was given a 30-month community order and fined Â£2,000 Ms Hunt, a New York-born former PR executive, said she had no recollection of how she ended up in the Town Hall Hotel in Bethnal Green in May 2015. She maintains she was drugged and raped. Killick, from Brent, north-west London, was initially arrested on suspicion of rape, but police dropped the case due to a lack of evidence. The 40-year-old had always claimed the encounter was consensual and no prosecution for rape was ever brought against him. This video can not be played Ms Hunt spoke about what happened in an interview in 2017 During the course of their investigation, officers discovered the video of Ms Hunt, which Killick told police he had filmed for his own sexual gratification. On six separate occasions the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) told Ms Hunt what had happened was not illegal. But in January, judges considering a separate case at the Court of Appeal ruled that filming a partner during sex without their consent is voyeurism and Killick was subsequently charged. In her victim impact statement, Ms Hunt told the court his actions ""ruined my life"" and the case had been ""profoundly disturbing, debilitating and ultimately devastating"". By BBC Reality Check In law in England and Wales, a person has committed an act of voyeurism if they: â¢ Observe for their own sexual gratification someone else ""doing a private act"" â¢ Know the other person does not consent to being observed The law also says you have committed a voyeurism offence if you film someone ""doing a private act"" without consent. Because Emily Hunt's encounter with the man who filmed her was deemed consensual, the CPS said she had consented to being observed naked and this extended to filming. In other words, you don't have a reasonable expectation to privacy when with a consensual partner. But Ms Hunt maintains she didn't ever give consent and was raped, but the police dropped the case due to lack of evidence. In January, during a different case, the Court of Appeal clarified that someone should not be filmed doing ""a private act"" without consent, even if the person filming was the consensual partner. Effectively, even if you are having consensual sex with someone, it does not entirely remove the expectation of privacy from that person when it comes to filming them. This decision meant that Ms Hunt had the legal grounds to pursue her case against Killick. Speaking about her five-year battle for justice, Ms Hunt - who has waived her right to anonymity - told the BBC that the CPS had ""behaved in an appalling manner"". ""It's just inexcusable. We deserve better, we deserve a criminal justice system and a prosecution service that believes that violent criminals belong in jail."" She said that since January's ruling she had been contacted about similar cases to hers, adding that now ""somebody was taking this seriously from the beginning and treating the victim like a victim"" that this was ""the biggest win"". A CPS spokesperson said: ""We recognise the delays in bringing this case to court have had a lasting impact on the victim. ""This is a complex area of law, which was clarified for the first time in the Court of Appeal this year... the CPS does not make or decide the law; that is the remit of Parliament and the courts respectively.""

Covid tests 'could be picking up dead virus',"The main test used to diagnose coronavirus is so sensitive it could be picking up fragments of dead virus from old infections, scientists say. Most people are infectious only for about a week, but could test positive weeks afterwards. Researchers say this could be leading to an over-estimate of the current scale of the pandemic. But some experts say it is uncertain how a reliable test can be produced that doesn't risk missing cases. Prof Carl Heneghan, one of the study's authors, said instead of giving a ""yes/no"" result based on whether any virus is detected, tests should have a cut-off point so that very small amounts of virus do not trigger a positive result. He believes the detection of traces of old virus could partly explain why the number of cases is rising while hospital admissions remain stable. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine reviewed the evidence from 25 studies where virus specimens from positive tests were put in a petri dish to see whether they would grow. This method of ""viral culturing"" can indicate whether the positive test has picked up active virus which can reproduce and spread, or just dead virus fragments which won't grow in the lab, or in a person. This is a problem we have known about since the start - and once again illustrates why data on Covid is far from perfect. But what difference does it make? When the virus first emerged probably very little, but the longer the pandemic goes on the bigger the effect. The flurry of information about testing and the R number creates confusion. But however we cut it, the fact remains there are very low levels of infection in the UK overall, lower than a number of other European countries. Where there are local outbreaks the system - by and large - seems to be having success in curbing them. And this comes after the opening up of society over the summer. Of course, the big question is what happens next, with schools back and winter around the corner. There is a growing sense within the public health community that the UK is in a strong position - and certainly a return to the high levels of infection seen in the spring should be avoided. But there is also extreme caution and an understandable desire for complacency not to creep in. The PCR swab test - the standard diagnostic method - uses chemicals to amplify the virus's genetic material so that it can be studied. Your test sample has to go through a number of ""cycles"" in the lab before enough virus is recovered. Just how many can indicate how much of the virus is there - whether it's tiny fragments or lots of whole virus. This in turn appears to be linked to how likely the virus is to be infectious - tests that have to go through more cycles are less likely to reproduce when cultured in the lab. But when you take a coronavirus test, you get a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. There is no indication of how much virus was in the sample, or how likely it is to be an active infection. A person shedding a large amount of active virus, and a person with leftover fragments from an infection that's already been cleared, would receive the same - positive - test result. But Prof Heneghan, the academic who spotted aquirk in how deaths were being recorded,which led Public Health England to reform its system, says evidence suggests coronavirus ""infectivity appears to decline after about a week"". He added that while it would not be possible to check every test to see whether there was active virus, the likelihood of false positive results could be reduced if scientists could work out where the cut-off point should be. This could prevent people being given a positive result based on an old infection. TESTING:What tests are available? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? And Prof Heneghan said that would stop people quarantining or being contact-traced unnecessarily, and give a better understanding of the current scale of the pandemic. Public Health England agreed viral cultures were a useful way of assessing the results of coronavirus tests and said it had recently undertaken analysis along these lines. It said it was working with labs to reduce the risk of false positives, including looking at where the ""cycle threshold"", or cut-off point, should be set. But it said there were many different test kits in use, with different thresholds and ways of being read, which made providing a range of cut-off points difficult. But Prof Ben Neuman, at the University of Reading, said culturing virus from a patient sample was ""not trivial"". ""This review runs the risk of falsely correlating the difficulty of culturing Sars-CoV-2 from a patient sample, with likelihood that it will spread,"" he said. Prof Francesco Venturelli, an epidemiologist in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, which was hit hard by the virus in March, said there was ""not enough certainty"" about how long virus remains infectious during the recovering period. Some studies based on viral cultures reported about 10% of patients still had viable virus after eight days, he said. In Italy, which had its peak earlier than the UK, ""for several weeks we were over-estimating cases"" because of people who acquired the infection several weeks before they were identified as positive. But, as you move away from the peak, this phenomenon diminishes. THE NAKED SCIENTISTS:Where did COVID-19 come from? ""WE'RE ALL STRONGER THAN WE THINK"":What are the positives of 2020? Prof Peter Openshaw at Imperial College London said PCR was a highly sensitive ""method of detecting residual viral genetic material"". ""This is not evidence of infectivity,"" he said. But the clinical consensus was that patients were ""very unlikely to be infectious beyond day 10 of disease"".

Sex-filming ruling 'clarifies' law,"Tony Richards failed to overturn his voyeurism conviction Filming a partner during sex without consent is voyeurism, Appeal Court judges have ruled. Tony Richards, from Cardiff, was jailed for filming two sex workers, but argued his conviction should be quashed as the filming happened in a private setting. Rejecting his appeal, judges ruled that the women he recorded had had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Wednesday's ruling ""clarified this point of law"". Richards, 40, of Heritage Drive, Caerau, was jailed in August for 15 months for two counts of voyeurism and three counts of possessing indecent images of children. The Appeal Court's rejection of his appeal is likely to have consequences for other cases, according to the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ). Emily Hunt launched a legal challenge against a decision not to bring a prosecution against a man she said filmed her without consent One such case is that of a naked, sleeping woman who says she was filmed by a man without her consent, the CWJ says. Emily Hunt launched a legal challenge last year against the CPS's decision not to bring a prosecution against the man, who she said filmed her without consent in May 2015. The CWJ, which represented Ms Hunt, said the CPS would no longer oppose her challenge and would review its earlier decision, following the latest ruling. Upskirting now a crime after campaign Voyeurism 'under-researched' subject Ms Hunt said: ""This decision was the clear, obvious and commonsense answer to a question no-one else was asking: is it illegal to video someone naked without their consent? ""Because the answer is obvious: yes it is. And the court agreed."" Ms Hunt was given permission by the court to intervene in the case after the CWJ learned the CPS would be opposing Richards's appeal. The ruling at the Court of Appeal will have ramifications for other cases CWJ director Harriet Wistrich said: ""We would like to know why the CPS chose to argue opposite points in two separate cases."" A CPS spokesman said: ""What constitutes a 'private act' for the purposes of the offence of voyeurism had never been conclusively defined by a higher court. ""Now this new judgment has clarified this point of law, the CPS will review its position in the judicial review brought by Emily Hunt.""

Civil servants 'must get back to offices quickly',"The government has urged Whitehall bosses to ""move quickly"" to get more staff back into the office. In a letter seen by the BBC, it says it is ""strongly encouraging"" attendance through rota systems, arguing this would be ""hugely beneficial"". The government says it wants 80% of civil servants to be able to attend their usual workplace at least once a week by the end of the month. But unions have described the government's attitude as outdated. They said most civil servants should expect to keep working from home until the end of the year, and they would consider strike action if staff were forced to return when it was unsafe. The letter applies to staff in England, with those elsewhere in the UK expected to follow local guidance and continue working from home. It follows criticism that too few civil servants working from home because of coronavirus have returned to their desks, despite the easing of lockdown. At-home civil servants 'showing Blitz spirit' Virus crisis 'has paused Whitehall backbiting' UK's top civil servant announces exit According to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there has been an increase in people travelling to work in the last two months, with fewer working exclusively from home. They said 57% of working adults - out of 1,644 surveyed - reported that they had travelled to work at some point in the past seven days, while 20% had worked solely from home. This video can not be played What does a 'Covid-secure' workplace look like? Thousands of businesses that rely on passing trade are suffering while offices stand empty, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn from the CBI has said. But Alex Brazier, the Bank of England's executive director for financial stability, has warned that the governmentshould not expect a ""sharp return"" to ""dense office environments"". TESTING:What tests are available? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? In the letter, sent to permanent secretaries - the highest officials in government departments - Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill and Alex Chisholm, chief operating officer of the Civil Service, say that ""getting more people back into work in a Covid-secure way will improve the public services we deliver"". They add: ""We have seen a reduced level of social interaction among our colleagues, with the loss of some of the spontaneous interaction and cross-fertilisation between teams that drives innovation and sustained common purpose."" But they say staff safety ""remains our paramount concern"", and that workplace returns will be discussed with unions and staff groups. Workplace guidance includes introducing one-way systems, staggered shift times and limiting the number of colleagues that staff members are exposed to in order to prevent the spread of the virus, such as only allowing a small number in lifts at any one time. The letter goes on: ""Departments which are still below their departmental constraints should now move quickly to seek to bring more staff back into the office in a Covid-secure way, and take advantage of the return to schools this month and increased public transport availability."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has asked officials for a weekly update on progress. Boris Johnson is clearly worried about the impact of empty office districts in major cities - and has been urging people to discuss going back to the office, where it's safe to do so. Some Tory MPs want it to be the government's main priority now that schools are open again. They fear without movement soon, there could be extensive and lasting economic damage. Encouraging civil servants back into the office could be seen as leading by example, perhaps showing how a system might work for other employers. But unions warn the workplace has changed forever and ministers would be better focussing on how to adapt to a new working world. The FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said this week that it estimated30% to 40% would be able to return,externalto the office by the end of the year. Leader Dave Penman accused ministers of ""sounding like Luddites"" in an era when technology made home working easier. Mr Penman told BBC Radio 4's Today that one ""fundamental problem"" with the approach was that, on a practical level, government offices have a maximum capacity of around 50% because of coronavirus restrictions. He said the civil service was working ""very effectively"" from home. He added it was ""quite clear"" that ""this is really about virtue signalling to the private sector that has already moved on"". And Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, said he was prepared to consider industrial action ""as a last resort"" if workers' health and safety were ""put at risk"".

"Bowling, casinos and soft play can reopen in North","Casinos are among the businesses that can reopen from Tuesday A host of businesses including soft play centres, bowling alleys and casinos can finally reopen across the north of England from Tuesday. Extra Covid-19 restrictions imposed on Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire are being eased. It means skating rinks, conference centres and exhibition halls can also resume, with the exception of Bolton - where the infection rate remains high. The easing brings the north in line with changes in the rest of England. The relaxation of measures also applies to socially-distanced indoor shows and close-contact services such as facials. However, a ban on people from different households meeting indoors remains in all areas of Greater Manchester except in Stockport and Wigan. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he welcomed the easing of restrictions for businesses in the county but added it was ""understandable that this won't apply in Bolton for the time being"". ""We will be working hard with Bolton Council and partners to move to a position where the restrictions on business opening can be eased as soon as possible,"" he added. Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, director of public health for Lancashire, said the ""further easing of the restrictions is due to the hard work of local people, businesses and local organisations"". ""It's still really important to follow the guidance and keep the cases down. This way you can avoid further restrictions coming back again in the future,"" he added. Beauty treatments such as facials can resume, the government as confirmed Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was glad to make the changes ""because local lockdowns are working to control the virus"". ""We are seeing improvements in the rates of infection thanks to the huge efforts made by local communities and authorities working alongside our effective test and trace system,"" he added. Stricter lockdown ruleswere imposedon Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire in July amid a rise in coronavirus cases. But these tightened measures are under constant review and certain areashave seen restrictions easedin recent weeks, while others have seen stricter rules introduced. Leeds was designated ""an area of concern""earlier after its seven-day infection rate rose to 32.5 cases per 100,000 people. By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit The boroughs of Greater Manchester were put into a tightened lockdown in July together, but they're coming out of it at a different pace. Bolton, Trafford and Stockport had been singled out for rules to be relaxed on Wednesday, but councils in Trafford and Bolton sounded the alarm over a recent rise in cases andthe decision for those two areas was reversed. Now Bolton has recorded the highest rate of new coronavirus cases in England for the week to 1 September, with 265 cases, equivalent to 92 per 100,000 residents. Over in Lancashire, when people in the eastern part of county were told they should not meet indoors, Rossendale looked to have been pulled in simply because it was surrounded by areas with high rates of infection. For two weeks at the end of June and beginning of July it didn't have any new cases at all and until recently it would only see a few a day. That changed last week with a big spike on Friday 28 August as 16 positive tests were recorded in one day. Under the latest changes to the restrictions, every pool, gym and sports facility will now be able to open across the country from Tuesday. Indoor swimming pools, including water parks, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports courts and facilities will also be able to open in Leicester and the remaining parts of Blackburn with Darwen and Bradford. The current coronavirus restrictions include: Greater Manchester A ban on two households mixing indoors will continue in the city of Manchester, Salford, Rochdale, Trafford, Bury, Bolton, and Tameside In Oldham, in addition to a household mixing ban indoors, residents will continue to be advised to avoid mixing with anyone from another household In Bolton, casinos, skating rinks, bowling alleys, exhibition halls, conference centres, and indoor play areas including soft play areas, will remain closed. Socially distanced indoor performances will remain closed, and restrictions on certain close contact services will remain Lancashire In Blackburn and parts of Pendle residents will continue to be advised to avoid mixing with anyone from another household A ban on two households mixing indoors will continue in Preston and the rest of Pendle West Yorkshire Urban areas of Bradford, where the ban on indoor household gatherings, remains in place In Kirklees, the ban on indoor household gatherings will continue in Dewsbury and Batley The ban will also continue in parts of Calderdale Leicester Indoor gatherings restrictions remain andthe next review of these measures will take place by 11 September Indoor swimming pools, including water parks, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports courts and facilities will be able to lawfully reopen from Tuesday, but casinos, skating rinks, bowling alleys, exhibition halls, conference centres, and indoor play areas including soft play areas, will remain closed Socially distanced indoor performances will remain closed, and restrictions on certain close contact services will remain Newark and Sherwood, Slough and Wakefield will be removed from the Public Health England ""watchlist"" while Leeds, South Tyneside, Middlesbrough,Corby and Kettering have been added ""as areas of concern"".

"Virgin Atlantic to cut 1,150 more jobs","Virgin Atlantic is to cut 1,150 more jobs after completing a Â£1.2bn rescue plan that will secure its future for at least 18 months. The airline had already cut more than 3,500 jobs out of the 10,000 employees it had at the beginning of the year. The airline said it had to cut costs in order to survive. ""Until travel returns in greater numbers, survival is predicated on reducing costs further and continuing to preserve cash,"" it said. ""The outlook for transatlantic flying, which is core to Virgin Atlantic's business, remains uncertain with US-UK travel curtailed,"" the airline said. It said the past six months had been ""the most challenging in Virgin Atlantic's history"", and that ""regrettably the airline must go further one last time with changes at scale, to ensure it emerges from this crisis"". The carrier added that a 45-day consultation period would begin on Friday with unions. To try to cut down on crew redundancies, it said it would introduce a voluntary, company-financed furlough scheme for 600 crew members when the government-backed scheme ends in October. Pilots union Balpa said that it hoped to avoid pilot redundancies. ""Every single job lost to this crisis is a tragedy and we are doing everything we can to mitigate job losses across the board,"" said Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton. ""Despite no help from government, their financing is now secure,"" he added. The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a dreadful toll on employment in the aviation industry. Airlines around the world have been haemorrhaging jobs, as they face a future in which fewer people travel, and fewer planes are able to fly. And it isn't just airlines. Aerospace firms, airports and groundhandling companies are also being forced to cut back. Virgin finds itself more exposed than many of its rivals, because it relies heavily on transatlantic traffic - and restrictions on travel to the US remain in force. The company is hoping its Â£1.2bn rescue plan will enable it to ride out the storm. But to succeed, it still needs to turn itself into a much smaller business than it was just a few months ago. US carrier Delta Air Lines, which owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic, said the rescue plan was ""an important part of protecting Delta's position in the UK, particularly in the critical London Heathrow market,"" as it vies against American Airlines and British Airways. The pandemic has had a severe impact on the aviation industry as lockdowns and quarantines hit air travel. Airlines, airports and tour firms have collectively shed thousands of jobs. Virgin gained approval for its rescue plan from UK and US courts this week. The Â£1.2bn deal involves Â£400m in new cash, half of which will come from its main shareholder, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss said: ""Together, we have achieved what many thought impossible and that is down to the efforts and sacrifices of so many across the company."" He called for ""urgent government action"" to introduce passenger testing to help remove travel restrictions. Since the 16 March it hasnot been possible,externalfor many travellers from the UK to get into the US if they do not have US citizenship and if they have been in the UK, Ireland, the Schengen zone, Iran, Brazil, or China within the past two weeks.

UK pressed over NI solicitor's murder,"Pat Finucane, a 39-year-old Belfast solicitor, was shot dead in front of his wife and children The UK government has been asked how it intends to comply with a Supreme Court ruling on the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has demanded ""concrete information"" by 22 October. Mr Finucane was shot by loyalist paramilitaries in front of his young family at their home in February 1989. In 2019, the Supreme Court ruledthere had not been a human rights-compliant inquiry into his death. But the justices ruled out a public inquiry of the type demanded by the family and said it was for the state to decide ""what form of investigation, if indeed any is now feasible, is required"". A UK government spokesperson says it is committed to ""taking forward these important issues as soon as possible"". The Committee of Ministers is a decision-making body made up of the ministers for foreign affairs of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe. The committee issued an eight-point document, which included a call for the authorities take a decision ""without delay"" on how to proceed. A general measure further expressed concern at the ""lack of detail"" in the government's approach to mechanisms to deal with the past. Mr Finucane's widow Geraldine welcomed the statement, saying it was ""disappointing the UK government must be compelled in this way"". ""It would appear that the Committee of Ministers has now run out of patience and, like me, is demanding clear answers,"" she added. Geraldine Finucane has been involved in a long-running legal battle over her husband's murder Dublin's Minister of Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has welcomed the decision in relation to both the Pat Finucane murder and the wider issue of legacy cases. The Irish government said it was a ""matter of significant and increasing concern"" that the legislation to implement theStormont House Agreement frameworkto deal with Troubles-related cases has not been progressed. ""Victims and survivors have had to wait for far too long for a suitable and effective system in Northern Ireland to deal with the legacy of the Troubles,"" the government said. Mr Finucane was a high-profile solicitor and convicted members of the IRA were among his clients. In February 2019, the Supreme Court judges said none of the inquiries into Mr Finucane's death, including the review carried out by Sir Desmond de Silva, had the capability ""of establishing all the salient facts"" about his killing or the liability of those who were responsible for his death. In his 2012 review, Sir Desmond de Silva QC said the state had facilitated Mr Finucane's killing and made relentless efforts to stop the killers being caught. However, his reportconcluded there had been ""no overarching state conspiracy"". Update 9 October 2020:  This article was amended to clarify the ruling of the Supreme Court with regard to a new investigation into the murder of Mr Finucane.

"Trump panned over reports he mocked US militaryA magazine claims he called US soldiers killed in action ""losers"", something the president denies.US & Canada","The US president has dismissed the reports as ""fake news"" US President Donald Trump is facing a backlash over reports he mocked American soldiers killed in action as ""losers"" and ""suckers"". The alleged remarks were first reported in the Atlantic magazine,external, and some details were corroborated by the Associated Press and Fox News. But the president and his allies have denied he made the remarks. Veterans' groups were among those who attacked the president over the reports. Progressive group VoteVetsposted a video of families whose children were killed in action.,external""You don't know what it is to sacrifice,"" says one. Paul Rieckhoff of the Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America,tweeted,external: ""Who is really surprised by this?"" Analysts say the comments could prove damaging with the president needing support from military voters as he bids for re-election. According to The Atlantic, Mr Trump cancelled a visit to a US cemetery outside Paris in 2018 because he said it was ""filled with losers"". Four sources told the magazine he rejected the idea of visiting because the rain would dishevel his hair, and he did not believe it important to honour America's war dead. Trump loves the military. Do they love him back? Trump says famed military newspaper will not close During the same trip, the president also allegedly referred to 1,800 US soldiers who died at Belleau Wood as ""suckers"". The battle helped to prevent a German advance on Paris during World War One and is venerated by the US Marine Corps. The Atlantic's reporting was based on anonymous sources but theAssociated Press said it had independently confirmed many of the remarks,external. A Fox News correspondent said she had corroborated some of the remarks. In 2018the White House said the visit was cancelled because bad weather had grounded the president's helicopter.This account was backed up in a recent book by President Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump. The US Navy also said it cancelled the trip to the cemeterybecause of rain,externalin response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act from Buzzfeed reporter Jason Leopold. On top of the comments from veterans, President Trump's challenger in November's presidential election, Joe Biden, responded by saying his rival was ""unfit"" to lead. ""If the article is true - and it appears to be, based on other things he's said - it is absolutely damning. It is a disgrace."" This video can not be played Trump and the US military: Friends or foe? Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, a veteran who lost both legs while serving in Iraq, said President Trump ""liked to use the US military for his own ego"". Khizr Khan, the father of a US soldier killed in Iraqwho criticised Mr Trump during the 2016 Democratic convention, joined Ms Duckworth on the call. He said: ""When Donald Trump calls anyone who places their lives in service of others a loser, we understand Trump's soul."" President Trump has pushed back hard against the reports, calling them ""fake news"". ""To think that I would make statements negative to our military and our fallen heroes when nobody's done what I've done with the budgets, with the military budgets, with getting pay raises for our military,"" he said. ""It is a disgraceful situation by a magazine that's a terrible magazine."" Speaking to reporters on Friday, he suggested the source of the story was his former White House chief of staff, John Kelly. Mr Trump said the former US Marine general ""was unable to handle the pressure of this job"". Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Friday morning he was with the president for a good part of the trip to France and never heard him use the words described in the article. Defense Secretary Mark Esper was quoted by Politico as saying Mr Trump had ""the highest respect and admiration for our nation's military members, veterans and families"", though the Pentagon chief did not explicitly deny the story. Another former White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were among those in Mr Trump's orbit who rejected the story as false. The US president has often staked claim to strong support among the military, and Pew Research Center last year found that veterans were generally supportive of him as commander-in-chief,with 57% in favour.,externalThree-fifths of the veterans identified as Republican, the research found. But there have been previous spats and controversies. He caused outrage by saying the late Senator John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam, was not a ""war hero"" saying: ""I like people who weren't captured."" President Trump has never served in uniform. He received five deferments from a military draft during the Vietnam War - four for academic reasons and one for bone spurs, a calcium build-up in the heels.

Care home visits ban after rise in Covid-19 cases,"Caerphilly county has seen the most infections per 100,000 people in Wales over the past week Visits to care homes in Caerphilly are to be stopped to protect residents from a rise in Covid-19 cases in the county. The council said visits would cease with immediate effect. Earlier, a Public Health Wales official warned house parties and people failing to social distance has led to a worrying rise in cases. In Caerphilly, 56 cases have been reported by Public Health Wales (PHW) over the past week, the highest number in Wales. Residents are being warned other coronavirus restrictions may return if the number of confirmed cases continue to rise across the area. The council said the ""difficult"" but ""prudent"" decision to stop care home visits was ""not taken lightly"". Councillor Carl Cuss, cabinet member for social services, said: ""We must put the health and wellbeing of our elderly and vulnerable residents first and I'm sure families will understand the pressing need to take this action. ""I fully appreciate that care home residents and their families will be very disappointed with this decision, but I would like to assure all concerned that the decision was taken in the best interest of protecting their health."" The council said care home visits would cease with immediate effect The council said there would also be a temporary return to weekly testing at each care setting. Earlier on Friday, PHW's incident director for the virus Dr Robin Howe told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales the rise in the county should be a ""warning for the rest of Wales"". He said: ""We've seen this uptick in cases getting to quite a worrying level in Caerphilly town, in Blackwood and other areas in the county so it's actually fairly widespread... ""People have not been following social distancing rules and having house parties and the like... it is a warning for the rest of Wales."" He said clusters had been seen elsewhere in the country: ""It's really how quickly we can identify these and bring them under control that will mark the success and whether we end up getting more such wider outbreaks."" Tourist 'seething' after quarantine changes Coronavirus testing service set up by university Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales The infection rate in Caerphilly over the past seven days has been recorded as 30.9 people per 100,000 population, the highest in Wales and far above the Welsh average of 7.4 per 100,000 people.

Coronavirus cases 'remain unchanged' in England,"The level of coronavirus among the community in England remains ""unchanged"" for the week to 25 August, the Office for National Statistics suggests. Its latest survey of people in households estimates there were around 2,000 new cases of coronavirus per day. This suggests that, despite outbreaks in some local areas, overall case numbers remain stable. The ONS figures,externalgive one of the most accurate pictures of infections levels. They are based on more than 151,000 swab tests collected from people at home, whether they have symptoms or not. But there is always a margin for error in the figures because over the past six weeks of the study very few people have tested positive - just 71 from 68 households. The figures also do not cover what is going on in hospitals or care homes, where infection rates are likely to be different. However, they continue to paint a picture of a stable level of infections among private households in England. How do I get a coronavirus test? Covid testing boss 'very sorry' for shortages As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again 'Upset stomach' in children may be coronavirus The ONS estimates that 27,100 people in the community had the virus during that week from 19 to 25 August. This is similar to the estimate for the previous week and several weeks before that. In Wales, during the week to 25 August, 1,400 people are estimated to have had Covid-19 - also unchanged from previous weeks. A different kind of test - an antibody test, using blood samples - which looks for evidence of people having previously had the infection, has been carried out on 7,000 people as part of the ONS study. Results suggest that around 6% of the population - or one in 17 people - have been infected with the coronavirus in the past. This equates to 2.7 million people in England. The R number for the UK is between 0.9 and 1.1, say the government's scientific advisors, which means the number of people with the virus is staying at a constant level. The reproduction number or R is the average number of people that one infected person passes the virus onto. An R number of 1 means that on average every person who is infected will infect one other person, meaning the total number of infections is stable. This estimate of R is a guide to the general trend rather than a description of what is happening today. The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, said the ONS data showed that the government's approach, using contact tracing and local restrictions, was working and was helping the country ""to safely return to normal"". ""This reassuring news is testament to the hard work of everybody in following social distancing guidelines to protect themselves, their loved ones and the NHS."" Mr Hancock added: ""I would urge everybody to continue to be vigilant - wash your hands, wear a face covering and keep social distance from those outside your household - so we can keep the virus at bay.""

Jacob Blake pleads not guilty to sexual assault,"This video can not be played Jacob Blake makes court appearance from hospital bed Jacob Blake, the black man whose shooting by police triggered protests, has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges filed prior to the incident. Mr Blake, who is in hospital paralysed, is accused of criminal trespass, sexual assault and disorderly conduct based on statements by his former girlfriend. The criminal complaint was filed in July, and is unrelated to the shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on 23 August. A trial over the complaint is set to begin later this year. According to the criminal complaint, Mr Blake is accused ofsexually assaulting a woman in May,external. The woman told officers that Mr Blake, 29, took her car keys and a debit card before fleeing the scene. According to Kenosha County District Attorney's Office, these were the charges Mr Blake was wanted for at the time of the 23 August shooting. What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting Two incidents, two different police responses On Friday Mr Blake, was in his hospital bed as he appeared via Zoom to plead not guilty. But a local commissioner decided that there was enough evidence to send the matter to trial. The criminal complaint did not identify Mr Blake's former girlfriend by name. A police officer shot Mr Blake seven times in the back during an arrest as he tried to get into a car where his three children were seated. The Kenosha police union says Mr Blake was carrying a knife; investigators said a knife was later found on the floor of his car. According to ABC News, police were called to the area torespond to a domestic violence report,external. Wisconsin's Attorney-General Josh Kaul said officers had been called to an address after a woman reported that ""her boyfriend was present and was not supposed to be on the premises"". While there, they tried to arrest Mr Blake, initially using a Taser. Two people protesting against the shooting of Mr Blake were killed in Kenosha amid widespread looting and vandalism.A 17-year-old has been charged over the deaths.

Police union backs officers in Daniel Prude death,"Daniel Prude died a week after he was restrained by police The US police officers involved in the suffocation death of a black man were following their training ""step by step"", the officers' union chief said. Daniel Prude - who suffered from mental health issues - died after being put in a ""spit hood"", designed to protect officers from detainees' saliva. The mayor suspended the seven Rochester Police officers involved on Thursday. Mr Prude, 41, died in March but his death has just recently been reported after body camera video was released. His death came two months before that of George Floyd, whose killing while in police custody sparked widespread outrage and incited national and international demonstrations against police brutality and racism. US police suspended over man's 'spit hood' death 'They push black people out and replace us with BLM signs' In pictures: Thousands gather for March on Washington The officers' suspension this week is the first disciplinary action taken in the wake of Mr Prude's death. Contract rules mean that the officers will still be paid while on leave, according to city officials. ""To me, it looks like they were watching the training in front of them,"" said Michael Mazzaeo, president of the Rochester Police Locust Club on Friday. ""If there's a problem with that, let's change it."" Mr Mazzaeo further defended the officers, saying they were in a difficult position trying to help someone who appeared to have a mental illness, and they did not intend to harm Mr Prude. The spit hood is standard equipment for officers, he said. Mr Prude's brother, Joe, has said he called police on 23 March as Daniel was showing acute mental health problems. When officers arrived, he had been running naked through the streets in a light snow. Mr Prude died in March, but his death has only just been reported Police body camera video obtained by the family shows Mr Prude lying on the ground as officers restrain him. Mr Prude, who was not carrying a weapon, can be seen complying with officers immediately. While sitting on the road, he becomes agitated, alternately asking for money or a gun. He spits repeatedly on the ground, but does not appear to offer any physical resistance, according to the footage. An officer says that Mr Prude told them he has Covid-19, and they place the spit hood on him. One officer can be seen pressing down on Mr Prude's head with both hands, saying ""stop spitting"". Mr Prude stops moving and goes quiet, and officers note he feels cold. Paramedics are called and Mr Prude is taken to hospital in an ambulance. His family took him off life support days later on 30 March. The Monroe County medical examiner ruled Mr Prude's death a homicide caused by ""complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint"", according to a post-mortem examination.

'Scotland jumped the gun on Greece quarantine',"This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has admitted differences in UK quarantine rules are ""confusing"" for travellers UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has claimed Scotland ""jumped the gun"" by adding Greece to the quarantine list. On Wednesday, the Scottish governmentmoved Greece to the list of countries from where returning travellers have to self isolate for 14 days. The Scottish government said its decisions on quarantine measures for travellers were based on the scientific evidence available. It said judgements were made on how best to keep people in Scotland safe. Mr Shapps also said that adding Portugal to the list had caused ""confusion"" and that Scotland and Wales had not taken the latest data into consideration. Quarantine for travellers coming from Portugal begins at 04:00 on Saturday. French Polynesia was also added to the list from 04:00 the same day. Speaking on theBBC's Today programme, Mr Shapps said: ""On Wednesday the Scots - without using the joint bio-security centre data for this particular decision - decided that people from Greece would be excluded, and jumped the gun on that. ""It is their right to do it but it doesn't make the overall message any clearer."" The quarantine rule for travellers coming to Scotland from Greece came into force at 04:00 on Thursday. The ruling also affects those coming in to English airports from those countries on the list, before travelling to Scotland. Mr Shapps said ""ideally"" the UK government would try to co-ordinate with the other administrations on travel announcements but that this week ""it didn't work out"". The UK is now split on its rules for Portugal. Quarantine for Welsh travellers began at 04:00 on Friday, Scots have to self-isolate from 04:00 on Saturday and English returners are not subject to any requirements to self isolate. Portugal, Greece and French Polynesia are still on England and Northern Ireland's lists of travel corridors. Mr Shapps also claimed that the Scottish and Welsh governments may have made decisions on Portugal without seeing all the data. He said: ""The Welsh administration had not noticed or not seen a second figure which is the percentage number of cases which test positive. That is really important because what we don't want to do is exclude countries for doing the right thing in carrying out lots of tests. ""When we brought Portugal into the travel corridor they had a test positivity rate of 1.8% but this week it was 1.6%, so the number had fallen."" He described Portugal as being on a ""borderline"", adding that ""the opinion of England and Northern Ireland is that it did not justify quarantine this week"". The seven-day infection rate in Portugal has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. 'My mother wanted one last holiday to Portugal' Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? A seven-day rate of 20 per 100,000 is the threshold above which the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Holidaymakers have only been able to travel from Scotland to Portugal without quarantine restrictions since 22 August, when it was added to thegovernment ""exemptions"" list.,external The Scottish government said that sometimes its decisions differed from those made by the other three governments. A spokeswoman said: ""In the case of Greece, we had a worrying number of people in Scotland who tested positive for Covid-19 and who had returned from Greece within seven days of the onset of symptoms. We could not afford to ignore that growing threat to public health. ""In the case of Portugal, it was unfortunate that the UK government announced their decision yesterday before ministers from England, Scotland and Northern Ireland met and before considering the latest Joint Biosecurity Centre data. This indicated a significant rise in both the prevalence of the virus in Portugal and in test positivity."" The quarantine developments have been criticised by leading figures in the aviation industry, who have comparedjob losses in the industry to the demise of the coal industry in the 1980s. Mike Tibbert, vice president of Scottish Passenger Agents' Association (SPAA) accused the Scottish government of playing games, with its ""half announcements and teasers"" He said: ""The entire travel sector and the travelling public need consistency and clear, well timed messaging. ""But the toing and froing on the safe list versus quarantine is actually distracting from the main issue which is the total lack of immediate support for the travel sector and the complete absence of a strategic plan to save future travel. ""Once lost, our connectivity to the rest of the world - and consequently theirs to us - will disappear."" IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

"Bowling, casinos and soft play can reopen in NorthSome Covid-19 restrictions will ease next week in Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire.","Casinos are among the businesses that can reopen from Tuesday A host of businesses including soft play centres, bowling alleys and casinos can finally reopen across the north of England from Tuesday. Extra Covid-19 restrictions imposed on Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire are being eased. It means skating rinks, conference centres and exhibition halls can also resume, with the exception of Bolton - where the infection rate remains high. The easing brings the north in line with changes in the rest of England. The relaxation of measures also applies to socially-distanced indoor shows and close-contact services such as facials. However, a ban on people from different households meeting indoors remains in all areas of Greater Manchester except in Stockport and Wigan. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he welcomed the easing of restrictions for businesses in the county but added it was ""understandable that this won't apply in Bolton for the time being"". ""We will be working hard with Bolton Council and partners to move to a position where the restrictions on business opening can be eased as soon as possible,"" he added. Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, director of public health for Lancashire, said the ""further easing of the restrictions is due to the hard work of local people, businesses and local organisations"". ""It's still really important to follow the guidance and keep the cases down. This way you can avoid further restrictions coming back again in the future,"" he added. Beauty treatments such as facials can resume, the government as confirmed Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was glad to make the changes ""because local lockdowns are working to control the virus"". ""We are seeing improvements in the rates of infection thanks to the huge efforts made by local communities and authorities working alongside our effective test and trace system,"" he added. Stricter lockdown ruleswere imposedon Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire in July amid a rise in coronavirus cases. But these tightened measures are under constant review and certain areashave seen restrictions easedin recent weeks, while others have seen stricter rules introduced. Leeds was designated ""an area of concern""earlier after its seven-day infection rate rose to 32.5 cases per 100,000 people. By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit The boroughs of Greater Manchester were put into a tightened lockdown in July together, but they're coming out of it at a different pace. Bolton, Trafford and Stockport had been singled out for rules to be relaxed on Wednesday, but councils in Trafford and Bolton sounded the alarm over a recent rise in cases andthe decision for those two areas was reversed. Now Bolton has recorded the highest rate of new coronavirus cases in England for the week to 1 September, with 265 cases, equivalent to 92 per 100,000 residents. Over in Lancashire, when people in the eastern part of county were told they should not meet indoors, Rossendale looked to have been pulled in simply because it was surrounded by areas with high rates of infection. For two weeks at the end of June and beginning of July it didn't have any new cases at all and until recently it would only see a few a day. That changed last week with a big spike on Friday 28 August as 16 positive tests were recorded in one day. Under the latest changes to the restrictions, every pool, gym and sports facility will now be able to open across the country from Tuesday. Indoor swimming pools, including water parks, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports courts and facilities will also be able to open in Leicester and the remaining parts of Blackburn with Darwen and Bradford. The current coronavirus restrictions include: Greater Manchester A ban on two households mixing indoors will continue in the city of Manchester, Salford, Rochdale, Trafford, Bury, Bolton, and Tameside In Oldham, in addition to a household mixing ban indoors, residents will continue to be advised to avoid mixing with anyone from another household In Bolton, casinos, skating rinks, bowling alleys, exhibition halls, conference centres, and indoor play areas including soft play areas, will remain closed. Socially distanced indoor performances will remain closed, and restrictions on certain close contact services will remain Lancashire In Blackburn and parts of Pendle residents will continue to be advised to avoid mixing with anyone from another household A ban on two households mixing indoors will continue in Preston and the rest of Pendle West Yorkshire Urban areas of Bradford, where the ban on indoor household gatherings, remains in place In Kirklees, the ban on indoor household gatherings will continue in Dewsbury and Batley The ban will also continue in parts of Calderdale Leicester Indoor gatherings restrictions remain andthe next review of these measures will take place by 11 September Indoor swimming pools, including water parks, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports courts and facilities will be able to lawfully reopen from Tuesday, but casinos, skating rinks, bowling alleys, exhibition halls, conference centres, and indoor play areas including soft play areas, will remain closed Socially distanced indoor performances will remain closed, and restrictions on certain close contact services will remain Newark and Sherwood, Slough and Wakefield will be removed from the Public Health England ""watchlist"" while Leeds, South Tyneside, Middlesbrough,Corby and Kettering have been added ""as areas of concern"". Norfolk, Rossendale and Northampton will be added as ""areas of enhanced support"", which means the government will work with local authorities to provide additional resources - such as testing or contact tracing - to help bring the numbers of infections down.

Late-night rescue for stranded Waverley passengers,"The paddle steamer was badly damaged in Thursday's crash More than 130 people were returned to the mainland on a late-night ferry after the Waverley's collision with Brodick Pier in Arran. More than 200 passengers and 26 crew were onboard the paddle steamer when it crashed into the pier as it arrived at Brodick on Thursday evening. The coastguard said 24 passengers were injured in the crash, with some airlifted to hospital on the mainland. The boat's operators confirmed its sailing season is now over. The Waverley set sail for thefirst time in two years less than a fortnight ago, an event which was itself delayed due to an ""unexpected technical and administration issue"". The boat, described as the world's last seagoing paddle steamer, had been due to continue sailing until 12 September. Twenty four injured as Waverley crashes into pier Waverley Excursion, the company that owns and operates the paddle steamer, said on its website: ""[The] Waverley made heavy contact while berthing at Brodick Pier on Thursday 3rd September and will be unable to undertake any further sailings this season. ""An investigation into the incident is ongoing."" This was the scene on the boat moments after it struck the pier Police, paramedics, coastguard and rescue helicopters were called to the pier when the alarm was raised at 17.15. Eyewitnesses reported seeing people falling over when the boat struck the pier earlier in the day. Rita McLeod, who was waiting to board the Waverley, said she saw people with head injuries, and heard of one who required an air ambulance. ""We were actually queued up waiting to get in when it crashed,"" she said. ""It came in bow first. It came in far too fast. We saw a lot of people falling and there were people taken away in ambulances. ""We saw a lot of people, pretty badly shaken, coming off."" The Caledonian Isles ferry was sent to pick up stranded passengers Passengers who had been waiting to board the paddle steamer had feared that they might have to spend the night at the terminal. But Calmac's Caledonian Isles ferry was sent to pick them up late on Thursday night following discussions between Transport Scotland and the Marine and Coastguard Agency Robbie Drummond, managing director of CalMac, said: ""We were more than happy to help return passengers to the mainland and worked closely with agencies including Waverley Excursions, who transported everyone onwards once they landed in Ardrossan."" He added: ""I would like to extend my deep gratitude to the crew on the Caledonian Isles and at Brodick and Ardrossan"" Man who caused woman 'fear or alarm' given legal slap on the wrist Do you know this pooch?

Singing in the rain: Opera returns in the time of Covid,"La Boheme is being performed in a car park Scottish Opera is beginning live performances again with a string of pop-up shows across the country - with musicians behind screens and singers staying three metres apart. Who could have imagined a year ago that the most anticipated live performance of 2020 would involve sitting in the car park of Scottish Opera's production centre as the rain poured down on a temporary canopy, and singers emerged from trailers with remnants of costumes and props from previous shows. The musicians of the reduced orchestra were at least warm, tucked behind Perspex screens in the paint store. Welcome to music in the time of Covid. This is an important milestone for Scottish Opera, the first national performing arts company to stage a live show for a real-life audience. Like everyone else, they've been making virtual work online, but this is a different thing entirely. There is two metre social distancing for everyone - but it increases to three metres when performers are singing. That makes it hard for Rudolfo and Mimi in La Boheme to even get close enough to declare their love. Your tiny hand is frozen, he sings in one of the opera's most famous arias - but he can't possibly get close enough to tell. And anyway, everyone's hands are frozen after hanging around the car park for a couple of hours. But instead of fighting against the pandemic and its restrictions, the team behind this new production embrace it - at least as much as they can. What might seem like a post-apocalyptic world where out-of-work artists, desperate to perform, scavenge for materials is actually strangely poignant, given the entire company have been in lockdown until now and many of the staff are freelance. In a plush theatre, it's hard to share the despair of Puccini's struggling artists, or their fear of the sickness and poverty around them. But suddenly, it takes on a whole new meaning. Each of the national arts companies have their battles persuading taxpayers and successive governments that they have relevance and can reach a wide audience. Opera is often deemed elitist and expensive. For years, the company has attempted to broaden its appeal, to reach the young, the very young (with opera for babies) and those who would sooner be in a sports stadium than a theatre. But Covid has set all that back. It will be months, maybe years, before any of the companies can reach the sort of numbers they did before. The six performances of La Boheme in Glasgow will reach just over 100 people per night. But they're eager, even if it means sitting in a car park in the rain. Tickets for the five initial shows were quickly snapped up, so much so that extra seating and an extra performance had to be added. The performance will attract audiences of about 100 people There's been a similar response to smaller pop up shows around the country, starting in Greenock on Friday, and it's not just audiences who have that pent-up enthusiasm for live performance. There isn't space or budget for a chorus, but regular singers are back as stewards for these shows. The nearest model for this is not any of the grand productions staged at the Edinburgh International Festival, or in the Theatre Royal, but another tented production which was staged in Paisley two years ago. Pagliacci was a massive outdoor production where members of the public sang alongside professional singers in a bold promenade production which was more Glastonbury than Glyndebourne, and showed how wide-reaching opera could be, and how much fun. How much fun singing in the rain is going to be is anyone's guess... but after five months of lockdown, any singing is welcome.

"Earth's 'lost species' only the tip of the icebergHundreds of mammals will go extinct if we do not act now to address biodiversity loss, say scientists.Science & Environment","An endangered white-handed gibbon: The right conservation strategies can save the day Scientists have calculated how many mammals might be lost this century, based on fossil evidence of past extinctions. Their predictions suggest at least 550 species will follow in the footsteps of the mammoth and sabre-toothed cat. With every ""lost species"" we lose part of the Earth's natural history, they say. Yet, despite these ""grim"" projections, we can save hundreds of species by stepping up conservation efforts. Thenew research,external, published in the journal Science Advances, suggests that humans are almost entirely responsible for extinctions of mammals in past decades. And rates will escalate in the future if we don't take action now. Despite this ""alarming"" scenario, we could save hundreds if not thousands of species with more targeted and efficient conservation strategies, said Tobias Andermann of the Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre and the University of Gothenburg. In order to achieve this, we must increase our collective awareness about the ""looming escalation of the biodiversity crisis, and take action in combatting this global emergency"". ""Time is pressing,"" he said. ""With every lost species, we irreversibly lose a unique portion of Earth's natural history."" A mammoth skull at auction in New York City: Many more could follow this extinct species' path The scientists compiled a large dataset of fossils, which provided evidence for the timing and scale of recent extinctions. Their computer-based simulations predict large increases in extinction rates by the year 2100, based on the current threat status of species. Conservation: Glimmer of hope for world's rarest primate 'Billions of years of evolutionary history' under threat Nature crisis: Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' According to these models, the extinctions that have occurred in past centuries only represent the tip of the iceberg, compared with the looming extinctions of the next decades. ""Reconstructing our past impacts on biodiversity is essential to understand why some species and ecosystems have been particularly vulnerable to human activities - which can hopefully allow us to develop more effective conservation actions to combat extinction,"" said Prof Samuel Turvey of ZSL (Zoological Society of London). Last year an intergovernmental panel of scientists saidone million animal and plant species were now threatened with extinction. Scientists have warned that we are entering the sixth mass extinction, with whatever we do now likely to define the future of humanity. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

UK 'sleepwalking into disaster' over border plans,"This video can not be played Rod McKenzie says the government should ""act now before it's too late"" The UK is ""sleepwalking into a disaster"" over its border plans for the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, road hauliers have warned. Groups representing truckers have written to ministers warning of ""severe"" disruption to supply chains. Rod McKenzie, from the Road Haulage Association, said the government should ""act now before it's too late"". But Boris Johnson said the UK was ""ready for any eventuality"" after the transition period. The government has also given itself powers to build temporary lorry parks in England without local approval. However, Mr McKenzie told BBC News: ""It is a real case of the government sleepwalking to a disaster with the border preparations that we have, whether it is a deal or no-deal Brexit at the end of December. Why Brexit is still a big issue What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Barnier: UK risks no-deal unless it compromises ""The supply chain on which we are all dependent to get the things we need could be disrupted and there is a lack of government focus and action on this."" He added: ""When we are trying to emerge from the crisis of Covid, if we then plunge straight into a Brexit-related crisis, that will be a really difficult moment and we need real pace. ""The difference here is between a disaster area and a disaster area with rocket boosters on."" Labour's shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, said the government ""must urgently come forward with a plan to put workable solutions in place"". Speaking to reporters on Friday, Mr Johnson said: ""We must make sure that people understand at the end of the year, whatever happens, we're leaving the EU, leaving the transition period. ""That's why it is vital that people who have questions about what they need to do get onto our government websites â¦ look at what they need to do to prepare, and certainly, we will help them. ""But we will get through this."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson responds to hauliers predicting Britain is ""sleepwalking into a disaster"" over border checks next year. The UK left the European Union on 31 January, but a transition period - where the UK continues to follow some of the bloc's rules - remains in place until 31 December while the two sides negotiate a trade agreement. However, trade talks have been taking place since March and both sides have complained of little progress being made. If a deal is not agreed and ratified by parliaments by the end of the year, the UK will go into 2021 trading with the bloc on World Trade Organization rules, which critics fear cause issues at the border. In a letter to the Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove,seen by Bloomberg,external, eight logistics organisations - including the Road Haulage Association - raised concerns over IT systems, the funding to train up customs agents and the pace of physical infrastructure being built. They asked for an ""urgent roundtable meeting"" with Mr Gove, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Transport Secretary Grants Shapps, saying supply chain must be protected ahead of a potential second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Shapps said he regularly met the Road Haulage Association and wanted to reassure them ""planning for the end of the transition period hasn't stopped"" during the coronavirus outbreak. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he ""could not pre-empt the outcome"" of trade talks with the EU, which he conceded created ""some uncertainty"". But, he said the government had kept supply changes going throughout the pandemic and ""we are absolutely confident we will do that again in the future"". Analysis by Sebastien Ash, BBC political analyst On 1 January 2021, the way that UK businesses trade with the EU will fundamentally change. It'll mean new hurdles for traders to clear, including the need to fill in customs declarations - forms with detailed information on goods being imported and exported. For the first six months of this new era - and whatever the outcome of the negotiations between the UK and the EU - goods entering the UK will not have to complete these processes, as they normally would, at the border. Instead, the government is giving businesses time to file their paperwork and pay the duties they owe after the goods have entered the UK. This exceptional measure is designed to mitigate the risk of delays for goods coming into the UK. However, for goods being exported the concern is greater. The EU has said it will impose its normal controls. And on the UK side, key systems to manage the flow of lorries at the UK border and make sure consignments are cleared to proceed to the EU are not up and running. The concern among the industry is that this could lead to lorries being refused entry onto ferries headed for the EU, long tail-backs at the ports through which much of the UK's trade with the EU flows and slow down and disrupt the supply chains between UK and EU businesses. In short, it becomes hard to conduct business as usual if you can't get your goods to the customer. Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation - another of the groups who wrote the letter - acknowledged the government was carrying out work on the necessary systems now. But he said there was ""no time to get these systems in place to actually do the job effectively"". He told BBC News: ""The supply chain leaders will try to do everything they can to avoid shortages on the shelves, but at its worst, at the extreme, these sorts of situations will lead to food shortages."" Earlier this week, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, saidthe UK was risking leaving the transition period without a deal unless it began to compromise. He said he was ""worried and disappointed"" about the lack of concessions from his British counterpart, David Frost, after a trade deal meeting on Tuesday. No 10 said it was ""clear"" that a deal ""will not be easy to achieve"". This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake breaks down the next round of Brexit negotiations The logistics industry letter came as the government gave itself powers to grant emergency planning permission for it to build temporary lorry parks and inspection posts in 29 councils areas across England, without the need for local approval. Giant lorry park branded 'concrete monstrosity' Post-Brexit lorry park trial 'too late' The government said the lorry parks, which can stay in place until the end of 2025, would contribute to ""an orderly transition to the new system of controls to secure the border"" and would help to address the impact coronavirus may have had on port operators' ability to provide the necessary infrastructure themselves, in time for the end of the transition period.

Wales urged to be 'world leader' in marine energy,"There has been an increase of Â£27.5m in investment in marine projects in Wales over the past year Wales could be a world leader in marine energy and should make the industry a priority, a former energy minister has said. Lord Peter Hain, who served under Tony Blair in 2001, said there was ""massive untapped potential"" around the Welsh coast. He urged a mix of Welsh government and private investment to drive it forward. A new industry report has identified 16 marine energy developers, with the hope of 3,000 jobs over the next 10 years. The projects include a new Â£590m lagoon announced for Flintshire. The Dragon Island project in Swansea Bay was put forward last year Tidal Lagoon Power has not given up hope for its Â£1.3bn project in Swansea Bay, despite the UK governmentsaying it was not value for money. Swansea Bay City Region hasplans for a Dragon Island energy island, with underwater and solar power. Dragon Island hopes to be financially sustainable by persuading big customers, such as local authorities or universities, to pledge to buy decades of electricity up front. Bombora's Â£17m project is well advanced One of the 15m cell modules being transported through Pembroke Dock which will form part of the full-scale megawatt mWave demonstration device Outside a hanger by the water's edge at Pembroke Dock, huge steel structures are waiting to be part of a new structure to be placed on the seabed next spring. Bombora moved its operations from Australia to Wales in 2017 to and is now in the final stages of its Â£17m project to harness wave energy. Its 1.5 megawatt (MW) mWave technology, a ""low impact"" renewable wave energy converter, will sit 11m below the surface of the sea off East Pickard Bay near Freshwater West. ""It sits on the sea bed, completely invisible when you are on the beach or the coast. As waves go overhead, membranes move up and down pushing air through the device, through a turbine that generates electricity,"" said Madeline Cowley of Bombora. ""We are halfway through construction. The project will be ready to go next year."" Could coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery? Clean energy to power all new Welsh homes from 2025 Is the hydrogen tech 'revolution' hope or hype? The company plans to export the knowledge its developed in Wales to marine projects across the world, adding to the 26 local jobs it has already created. It is also developing a project in Lanzarote. It said it would need either a subsidy for the electricity or public money for the next stage of its project. This video can not be played The site will be in the southern corner of Holyhead Deep, separate from shipping lanes Minesto has developed the first of its type of energy generation in the world on Anglesey, where the firm has testing its technology in the sea. Five years in the making, it works like an underwater kite and is now being deployed off the Faroe Islands. The company has 80MW plans but believes with the Irish Sea, there are gigawatts worth of energy potential if the conditions are right. Despite the imminent recession, development manager Osian Roberts believes the project is feasible as ""climate change does not stand still"" and the firm would look to both the UK and Welsh governments for any revenue support for ""emerging technologies such as ourselves"". He added: ""Fossil fuel has to stop. Going into renewable energy, I think for people's conscience, it is really important and for the world it is really important"". Artist impression of the Mostyn lagoon Mostyn Seapower plans a Â£590m lagoon built of boulders and aggregates over four miles (6.5km) A 7.5-mile (12.2km) enclosed area with eight turbines operating on tidal variation in Dee Estuary Flood protection for low-lying land, covering A548 coast road and main Crewe to Holyhead railway Aims to produce 298 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity a year -one GWh is enough to power about one million homes for one hour,external Jim O'Toole, managing director of Port of Mostyn, said building will not start until 2023 and the site should be producing electricity by late-2027. ""We think the small scale makes it an ideal pathfinder that other turbine manufacturers and projects can learn from and that will benefit all technology in Wales,"" he added. Johnson sets out 'ambitious' economic recovery plan Economy speech fact-checked Five key questions about energy after Covid-19 Britain goes coal free as renewables edge out fossil fuels Marine Energy Wales says a total of 16 developers are actively progressing projects in Wales There are two wave and tidal stream demonstration zones, seabed agreements in place for three separate wave and tidal stream projects and a number of proposals for significant tidal range projects. Industry body Marine Energy Wales - in its latest report out on Thursday - said there had been an increase of Â£27.5m in investment in projects in Wales over the past year and thinks the sector could have an export market worth an estimated Â£76bn by 2050. Jessica Hooper, programme manager at Marine Energy Wales, said it showed the positive impact marine energy was having ""particularly in coastal regions such as Anglesey and Pembrokeshire that are most in need of economic regeneration"". Like most new technologies though, it is the development stage that is particularly expensive. Onshore and offshore wind needed substantial subsidies initially but are now considered to produce electricity relatively cheaply. Most energy projects have to agree a guaranteed price - or strike price - for the electricity they generate. This acts as a subsidy in the expensive early days, topping up the market price, but as the technology develops and the price tends to fall, subsidies are no longer needed. But Michelle Davies, head of clean energy and sustainability at lawyers Evershed Sutherland, said the economic climate was a barrier. ""Banks and funds are telling UK government that they will not be able to fund the energy transition, or if they do so, it will be prohibitively expensive due to the dynamics of the UK market."" Meanwhile, the price of energy has fallen because of the economic impact of coronavirus. Ms Davies added: ""Green growth and the energy transition is a huge opportunity in the UK but it won't happen at scale without first an understanding by government of the dynamics of the market and secondly, according to an overwhelming majority of those funding and financing the energy transition who responded to our survey, government helping with the solution."" Lord Hain has been a big backer of tidal energy and evenquit his role as shadow Welsh secretary in 2012 to throw his weight behind a Severn barrage. He said there was a ""vast untapped potential"" for Wales to be a ""world leader"" in the technology. ""Other governments across the world have chosen particular technologies, particular industries, and invested in them. And that means Welsh government investment as well as private investment to really drive this forward. ""Unless you have a combination of business and government working together to harness this huge energy resource, it's not going to develop. If that happens, it could be fantastic."" Asked about timing, with the economy facing recession, he said: ""This is not a time to sit back and wait for a few years to come, when the economy picks up again, this is to make sure the economy picks up soon by investing now."" Welsh Energy Minister Lesley Griffiths said she considered marine and offshore renewable energy would play a ""fundamental part"" in building the future in the recovery from the pandemic. ""I have written urging the UK government to work with the devolved nations to ensure their financial support mechanisms for energy deliver for the whole of the UK,"" she added. Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart said: ""Renewable energy projects in Wales will play a vital role in the UK government's work to reach our aim of net-zero emissions by 2050. ""The UK is a leader in technologies that harness the clean, natural energy of our tides and offshore wind. The development of these projects in Welsh waters could create hundreds of sustainable jobs and accelerate the shift to clean growth. ""We will continue to examine cost-effective projects in Wales which will reduce costs for consumers, minimise environmental impacts and create green jobs.""

"Co-op to create 1,000 jobs and open 50 new stores","Grocery chain the Co-op is opening 50 new stores and creating 1,000 new jobs this year. The new roles come on top of the 1,000 posts it added during lockdown as demand from shoppers increased. The extra jobs announced today will be spread across the new shops and 15 stores that are being enlarged. The Co-op said its research had found that 70% of adults have relied on their local convenience store for food and other goods in recent months The retailer also said that it had expanded its online shop. The Co-op currently employs 55,000 workers across the UK and has 2,600 stores. The new stores will open in areas such as Wrexham, London, Poole, Leeds and Guildford. Meanwhile up to 12 new Co-op franchise stores are also set to launch this year, including at Oxford Brookes University and Stirling University, with more university locations planned for 2021. ""We continually look for new locations, sites which are definitively convenient in their community,"" said David Roberts, managing director of Co-op Property. 'Three quarters of UK does grocery shopping online' Ocado says switch to online shopping is permanent He said more than 100 of the Co-op's outlets would receive major makeovers as part of a Â£130m investment programme. The chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, James Lowman, said: ""This commitment to investing in stores in the coming months is testament to the importance of the convenience sector."" The grocery sector has seen a surge in demand during the pandemic, and the big supermarket chains have also been creating jobs. Last month, Tesco saidit would create 16,000 permanent jobsafter the lockdown led to ""exceptional growth"" in its online business. While the grocery sector has done well, other parts of the economy have been hit hard by the pandemic. It was announced on Friday that 540 workers at Nationwide Accident Repair Services have lost their jobs after the struggling business was sold to RunMyCar in a pre-packaged administration. As part of the deal 30 of Nationwide's sites have been shut. Founded in 1993 in Witney, Oxfordshire, the business operated 115 garages across the country, as well as a mobile fleet of repair vans, servicing the accident repair market for UK insurers. But the company suffered a substantial decline in business during lockdown as millions of motorists stayed off the road. ""As with many other businesses, the group had to weather major financial fallout due to the economic impact of Covid-19, which meant that trading volumes were significantly reduced,"" said Rob Lewis, joint administrator at PwC. ""Against that backdrop, the sale announced today reflects a significant positive outcome for the business, and we are especially pleased to have safeguarded 2,350 roles including apprentices, mechanics and technicians. ""Sadly we have had to make 540 staff redundant.""

Search continues for possible Beirut survivor,"This video can not be played Rescuers remove rubble in the hope of finding someone alive Hopes are fading in Beirut that anyone will be found beneath the rubble of a building destroyed in last month's explosion. Rescue workers are searching for the third day after sensor equipment detected possible signs of life. But the rescuers, including Chilean specialists, have not yet found the source of the signal. Beirut held a minute's silence on Friday to mark a month since the explosion, which killed almost 200. Thousands more were injured by the blast, which happened when 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate detonated. How long can survivors last under rubble? There has been outrage that so much hazardous material was stored unsafely in a warehouse in the city's port, close to many residential areas. This video can not be played A candle vigil was among the events held to mark one month since the explosion in Beirut The Lebanese government's resignation shortly afterwards failed to pacify protesters, who clashed with police in the city for several nights. One month on, seven people are still missing, according to Lebanese officials. Search efforts got under way after a rescue team from Chile said it had detected possible signs of life under a destroyed building located between the residential districts of Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael. The rescuers were walking through the area on Wednesday night when their sniffer dog - trained to find bodies - gave a sign that there was a person inside. When they returned on Thursday, the dog went to the same place and gave the same sign. Specialist sensor equipment then detected a pulsing signal in the area. The head of the Chilean rescue team, Francisco Lermanda, told reporters on Friday that slow breathing had been detected under the rubble at a depth of 3m (9.8ft). Rescuers dug three tunnels to try to reach the spot where the pulse was detected, he said. But, he added, it was too soon to know if anyone was ""alive or dead"" beneath the debris. Earlier on Friday, rescue co-ordinator Nicholas Saade told the AFP news agency that the pulse had slowed significantly since the previous day. Reporters at the scene said the most recent test detected no signals at all. Crowds have been gathering to watch the search efforts, hoping for a miracle. ""Search operations have been going on since the day before yesterday but the chances are very low,"" the civil defence agency's operations director, George Abou Moussa, told AFP. People at the scene have been hoping for a miraculous story of survival The Chilean rescuers are from the renowned Los Topos aid organisation, which took part in the2010 rescue of 33 Chilean miners trapped 700m (2,300ft) underground for more than two months. In the same year, the Chilean team also rescued a survivor after 27 days following a devastating earthquake in Haiti, the Washington Post reported.

"Bowling, casinos and soft play can reopen in north","Casinos are among the businesses that can reopen from Tuesday A host of businesses including soft play centres, bowling alleys and casinos can finally reopen across the north of England from Tuesday. Extra Covid-19 restrictions imposed on Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire are being eased. It means skating rinks, conference centres and exhibition halls can also resume, with the exception of Bolton - where the infection rate remains high. The easing brings the north in line with changes in the rest of England. The relaxation of measures also applies to socially-distanced indoor shows and close-contact services such as facials. However, a ban on people from different households meeting indoors remains in all areas of Greater Manchester except in Stockport and Wigan. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he welcomed the easing of restrictions for businesses in the county but added it was ""understandable that this won't apply in Bolton for the time being"". ""We will be working hard with Bolton Council and partners to move to a position where the restrictions on business opening can be eased as soon as possible,"" he added. Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, director of public health for Lancashire, said the ""further easing of the restrictions is due to the hard work of local people, businesses and local organisations"". ""It's still really important to follow the guidance and keep the cases down. This way you can avoid further restrictions coming back again in the future,"" he added. Beauty treatments such as facials can resume, the government as confirmed Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was glad to make the changes ""because local lockdowns are working to control the virus"". ""We are seeing improvements in the rates of infection thanks to the huge efforts made by local communities and authorities working alongside our effective test and trace system,"" he added. Stricter lockdown ruleswere imposedon Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire in July amid a rise in coronavirus cases. But these tightened measures are under constant review and certain areashave seen restrictions easedin recent weeks, while others have seen stricter rules introduced. Leeds was designated ""an area of concern""earlier after its seven-day infection rate rose to 32.5 cases per 100,000 people. By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit The boroughs of Greater Manchester were put into a tightened lockdown in July together, but they're coming out of it at a different pace. Bolton, Trafford and Stockport had been singled out for rules to be relaxed on Wednesday, but councils in Trafford and Bolton sounded the alarm over a recent rise in cases andthe decision for those two areas was reversed. Now Bolton has recorded the highest rate of new coronavirus cases in England for the week to 1 September, with 265 cases, equivalent to 92 per 100,000 residents. Over in Lancashire, when people in the eastern part of county were told they should not meet indoors, Rossendale looked to have been pulled in simply because it was surrounded by areas with high rates of infection. For two weeks at the end of June and beginning of July it didn't have any new cases at all and until recently it would only see a few a day. That changed last week with a big spike on Friday 28 August as 16 positive tests were recorded in one day. Under the latest changes to the restrictions, every pool, gym and sports facility will now be able to open across the country from Tuesday. Indoor swimming pools, including water parks, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports courts and facilities will also be able to open in Leicester and the remaining parts of Blackburn with Darwen and Bradford. The current coronavirus restrictions include: Greater Manchester A ban on two households mixing indoors will continue in the city of Manchester, Salford, Rochdale, Trafford, Bury, Bolton, and Tameside In Oldham, in addition to a household mixing ban indoors, residents will continue to be advised to avoid mixing with anyone from another household In Bolton, casinos, skating rinks, bowling alleys, exhibition halls, conference centres, and indoor play areas including soft play areas, will remain closed. Socially distanced indoor performances will remain closed, and restrictions on certain close contact services will remain Lancashire In Blackburn and parts of Pendle residents will continue to be advised to avoid mixing with anyone from another household A ban on two households mixing indoors will continue in Preston and the rest of Pendle West Yorkshire Urban areas of Bradford, where the ban on indoor household gatherings, remains in place In Kirklees, the ban on indoor household gatherings will continue in Dewsbury and Batley The ban will also continue in parts of Calderdale Leicester Indoor gatherings restrictions remain andthe next review of these measures will take place by 11 September Indoor swimming pools, including water parks, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports courts and facilities will be able to lawfully reopen from Tuesday, but casinos, skating rinks, bowling alleys, exhibition halls, conference centres, and indoor play areas including soft play areas, will remain closed Socially distanced indoor performances will remain closed, and restrictions on certain close contact services will remain Newark and Sherwood, Slough and Wakefield will be removed from the Public Health England ""watchlist"" while Leeds, South Tyneside, Middlesbrough,Corby and Kettering have been added ""as areas of concern"". Norfolk, Rossendale and Northampton will be added as ""areas of enhanced support"", which means the government will work with local authorities to provide additional resources - such as testing or contact tracing - to help bring the numbers of infections down.

Thanks for staying with us! Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Early results from small trials on a Russian vaccine against
Covid-19 have found it is safe and there were no serious side-effects in
people. âEncouragingâ and âso far so goodâ are some of the reactions
from scientists in the UK â but there is still, clearly, a long way to go. Two small trials, with 38 people in each, were carried out
in two hospitals in Russia. Although the vaccine showed an antibody response in all
participants in phase 2 (40 people), this doesnât necessarily mean it would
protect them from the virus. That still hasnât been established yet. From these results, we can tell that the vaccine - named
Sputnik V - appeared to be safe in healthy people between the age of 18 and 60
for 42 days, because that was how long the study lasted. But what about older people and those with underlying health
conditions who are most at risk of Covid-19 â how safe is it for them and over
a longer period of time? This can only be answered after much larger, long-term
randomised trials where the people taking part donât know if they are receiving
the vaccine or a dummy injection. These will also tell scientists how effective the vaccine
really is among a much wider population. There have also been calls for openness and transparency. Of
the many vaccines currently being trialled around the world, some will work
better than others in certain situations and in certain groups of people,
perhaps. So knowing exactly how well they work and for whom is
paramount â it is unlikely that one vaccine will be suitable for everyone. And here are the main developments around the world in the past 24 hours: Soon we will be pausing our live coverage - but before we do, here's a reminder of todayâs main headlines
from the UK:  Businesses including soft play centres, bowling alleys and casinos can finallyreopen across the north of Englandfrom Tuesday. The extra Covid-19 restrictions imposed on Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire are being eased. It means that from Tuesday, casinos, skating rinks, bowling alleys, exhibition halls, conference centres, and indoor play areas will be able to reopen throughout Greater Manchester - apart from Bolton, where these restrictions will remain in place - Lancashire and West Yorkshire. And indoor swimming pools, including water parks, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports courts and facilities will also be able to open in Leicester and the remaining parts of Blackburn with Darwen and Bradford, where restrictions had not already been eased. Meanwhile, Newark and Sherwood, Slough and Wakefield will be removed from Public Health England's list of ""areas of concern"". And Leeds, South Tyneside, Corby, Middlesbrough and Kettering have been added to the watchlist, Mr Hancock confirmed. Norfolk, Rossendale and Northampton are being added as ""areas of enhanced support"", which means the government will work with local authorities to provide additional resources - such as testing or contact tracing - to help bring the numbers of infections down. Scottish Opera is beginning live performances again with a string of pop-up shows across the country - with musicians behind screens and singers staying three metres apart. It is the first national performing arts company in Scotland to stage a live show for a real-life audience. Like everyone else, they've been making virtual work online. The shows kick off in Glasgow with six performances of La BohÃ¨me for an audience of just over 100 people per night sitting in a car park. Tickets for the five initial shows were quickly snapped up, so much so that extra seating and an extra performance had to be added. Read the full story here There have been more than 340,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far in the UK and more than 40,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus - and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.  Daily confirmed cases began edging up again in July - after falling significantly from their April peak - as lockdown restrictions imposed in March were eased. Today, the government said there had been 1,940 newly-confirmed cases. The official number of confirmed cases during the peak in the UK underestimated the true level of infection at the time, as widespread testing was not as available until mid-May. Theincrease in testing,externalpartly explains the rise in daily cases in July - if you are testing more, you are likely to find more cases. But despite some local outbreaks, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England remained stable in the week to 25 August, according to the Office for National Statistics. And the apparent rise in cases since July has not, however, translated into an increase in people being admitted to hospital. There are several local hotspots in the UK which have seen a spike in cases since the nationwide lockdown ended. Public Health England produces aweekly watchlist,externalof areas of concern, based on an assessment of incidence rates, and other indicators such as trends in testing, healthcare activity and deaths.

the pandemic has affected the area you are in. Jobs in Canada continue to grow, new labour market numbers say. Statistics Canada reported on Friday that the economy had added 246,000 jobs in
August. When added to the 419,000 new jobs in July, and 1.2m added in May and
June, employment is now just about 5.7% shy of its pre-coronavirus levels in
February. As of the week of Aug 15, about 1.8m Canadian workers are affected by the
Covid-19 shutdown, either because they are unemployed or have had their hours
reduced. In April, this number reached a peak of 5.5 million. Most of the employment gains have been in full-time work, the statistical agency
said. Additionally, the number of those working from home has decreased, from 3.4m in April to 2.5m
in August. France has reported 8,975 infections in the past 24 hours - the highest number of new infections since the start of the outbreak. The authorities also say the number of patients in intensive care units has been rising in the past few days. Earlier on, we reported that patients taking part in early tests of a Russian vaccine developed antibodies with ""no serious adverse events"" (see our 15:29 entry). However, the World Health Organization (WHO) now says it does not expect widespread immunisation against the virus until mid-2021. The WHO acknowledged that a ""considerable number"" of vaccine candidates had entered final stage trials, which typically involve tens of thousands of people. But WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris was quoted by AFP news agency as saying that ""in terms of realistic timelines, we are really not expecting to see widespread vaccination until the middle of next year"". The UN health agency has said it will not endorse any vaccine without proof that it is safe and effective.  Officials say 56 people have tested positive at an asylum centre in Birmingham, in England's West Midlands. Staff and residents at the Serco-run Stone Road Asylum Centre in Edgbaston are affectedand the centre has been closed, the city council says. Those infected have been moved to alternative accommodation where they can safely self-isolate. Contact tracing is also under way and being carried out in the relevant languages of affected residents, the council says. Switzerland has reported more than 400 new infections in the past 24 hours for the first time since mid-April. But health officials say that - despite 405 confirmed cases - the situation in the country is ""stable"", and the reproduction rate remains below 1. Three-quarters of the new cases are in people aged under 40. âAt the moment weâre not talking of a second wave; weâre talking of a slow increase in infections,"" said Stefan Kuster, the head of the Swiss health ministry's communicable diseases unit. ""The efforts of the population and the cantons are bearing fruit,"" he added. The Alpine nation of about 8.5 million people has so far recorded more than 43,000 infections, with over 2,000 deaths. The infection rate in Leeds has been rising over the last few weeks Leeds has been
added to Public Health England's weekly watch list of areas of concern, after its seven-day infection rate rose to 32.4 cases per 100,000 people. The city council said the data suggests a lot of the cases are in
different areas of the city, meaning they may be linked to social interaction
and leisure activities. ""The spread is broad and changeable across wards and cases
have also been increasingly detected in younger people aged 18-34, with some
concern over activities like house parties and gatherings,"" it said. There will not be any further restrictions on Leeds at this stage but it does mean increased monitoring of cases and potential additional steps in future if the infection rates do not start to fall. Council leader Judith Blake said: ""This rise in infection rates means that inevitably, our window of opportunity is shrinking by the day and the city is rapidly approaching a tipping point."" Some 1,940 new daily confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been
recorded in the UK, the highest since 30 May, according to the latest
government figures. Ten more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for
coronavirus, the government said, bringing the total death toll in the UK to 41,537. The
UK's testing capacity has increased since the peak of the outbreak earlier
this year. Derek Burt faces a race to get home to Scotland from the Algarve with his mother and children All Derek Burt's mother wanted when she was diagnosed with terminal motor neurone disease (MND) six weeks ago was one last holiday with her family, he says. ""MND is such an evil and unpredictable disease. We have no idea if she will be able to go on a family holiday with us when all the Covid craziness is over, so had to make the tough decision and deliver on one of her wishes now."" With trips to Florida and Croatia already cancelled, they decided on Portugal when quarantine restrictions were lifted two weeks ago. But now the family from Dunfermline in Fife is having to race to get home from the Algarve to beat the new restrictions that come into force at 04:00 on Saturday in Scotland. Mr Burt says the family researched different holidays and tried to follow the guidance available, but ""nobody has a clue what the governments are thinking"". Read the full story here Hong Kong has now decided to extend by four days a China-backed mass coronavirus testing programme,despite concerns that it is not effective and could be misused for surveillance. Officials said that only six people had been found infected among 128,000 people tested since the voluntary free programme was launched on Tuesday. They say that overall more than 900,000 people have registered for such tests. A health workers union has criticised the effort as an inefficient waste of resources, while activists have said it could be used by the authorities in mainland China to collect DNA samples. Boris Johnson has
insisted ""overwhelmingly the UK is proceeding as one"" after Transport
Secretary Grant Shapps admitted differing quarantine rules across the four
nations was âconfusingâ. During a visit to Solihull,
the UK prime minister said the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland have âdifferent rates of infectivity, different approaches to
the problemâ. He said digging below the
surface âyou will find overwhelmingly the UK takes the same approach"". The PM said quarantine
measures for arrivals from countries deemed high-risk must remain ""a vital
part"" of the fight against coronavirus. He said he understands the difficulties the airline
industry is going through, but that testing at points of entry only identifies
7% of the cases. Here's a round-up of what is happening in the US:  There have been 159 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland in the past 24 hours. This compares to 101 the previous day - an increase of 58 cases. Seventy three of the new cases are in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board area. Restrictions on visiting other householdswere reintroduced in Glasgow and two neighbouring areason Tuesday. Two new cases have been reported in the Western Isles for the first time since June. There have been no new reported deaths of people who tested positive in the last 28 days. Vials with a Russian vaccine Patients taking part in early tests of a Russian vaccine developed antibodies with ""no serious adverse events"",the Lancet medical journal has reported, quoting findings by several Russian scientists.,external But researchers said longer and larger trials were needed to prove the Sputnik V vaccine would be safe and effective. Last month, Russia announced that the vaccine had been approved by the country's health regulatory body - a move that was met with scepticism in some countries. A number of experts, particularly in the West, warned Moscow was moving too quickly, skipping a key stage required for research. Russia has rejected the criticism as baseless. President Vladimir Putin has said that one of his two daughters has already been vaccinated. And of Friday, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was shown on Russia's state TV getting the jab himself.

Thanks for staying with us! Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Early results from small trials on a Russian vaccine against
Covid-19 have found it is safe and there were no serious side-effects in
people. âEncouragingâ and âso far so goodâ are some of the reactions
from scientists in the UK â but there is still, clearly, a long way to go. Two small trials, with 38 people in each, were carried out
in two hospitals in Russia. Although the vaccine showed an antibody response in all
participants in phase 2 (40 people), this doesnât necessarily mean it would
protect them from the virus. That still hasnât been established yet. From these results, we can tell that the vaccine - named
Sputnik V - appeared to be safe in healthy people between the age of 18 and 60
for 42 days, because that was how long the study lasted. But what about older people and those with underlying health
conditions who are most at risk of Covid-19 â how safe is it for them and over
a longer period of time? This can only be answered after much larger, long-term
randomised trials where the people taking part donât know if they are receiving
the vaccine or a dummy injection. These will also tell scientists how effective the vaccine
really is among a much wider population. There have also been calls for openness and transparency. Of
the many vaccines currently being trialled around the world, some will work
better than others in certain situations and in certain groups of people,
perhaps. So knowing exactly how well they work and for whom is
paramount â it is unlikely that one vaccine will be suitable for everyone. And here are the main developments around the world in the past 24 hours: Soon we will be pausing our live coverage - but before we do, here's a reminder of todayâs main headlines
from the UK:  Businesses including soft play centres, bowling alleys and casinos can finallyreopen across the north of Englandfrom Tuesday. The extra Covid-19 restrictions imposed on Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire are being eased. It means that from Tuesday, casinos, skating rinks, bowling alleys, exhibition halls, conference centres, and indoor play areas will be able to reopen throughout Greater Manchester - apart from Bolton, where these restrictions will remain in place - Lancashire and West Yorkshire. And indoor swimming pools, including water parks, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports courts and facilities will also be able to open in Leicester and the remaining parts of Blackburn with Darwen and Bradford, where restrictions had not already been eased. Meanwhile, Newark and Sherwood, Slough and Wakefield will be removed from Public Health England's list of ""areas of concern"". And Leeds, South Tyneside, Corby, Middlesbrough and Kettering have been added to the watchlist, Mr Hancock confirmed. Norfolk, Rossendale and Northampton are being added as ""areas of enhanced support"", which means the government will work with local authorities to provide additional resources - such as testing or contact tracing - to help bring the numbers of infections down. Scottish Opera is beginning live performances again with a string of pop-up shows across the country - with musicians behind screens and singers staying three metres apart. It is the first national performing arts company in Scotland to stage a live show for a real-life audience. Like everyone else, they've been making virtual work online. The shows kick off in Glasgow with six performances of La BohÃ¨me for an audience of just over 100 people per night sitting in a car park. Tickets for the five initial shows were quickly snapped up, so much so that extra seating and an extra performance had to be added. Read the full story here There have been more than 340,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far in the UK and more than 40,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus - and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.  Daily confirmed cases began edging up again in July - after falling significantly from their April peak - as lockdown restrictions imposed in March were eased. Today, the government said there had been 1,940 newly-confirmed cases. The official number of confirmed cases during the peak in the UK underestimated the true level of infection at the time, as widespread testing was not as available until mid-May. Theincrease in testing,externalpartly explains the rise in daily cases in July - if you are testing more, you are likely to find more cases. But despite some local outbreaks, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England remained stable in the week to 25 August, according to the Office for National Statistics. And the apparent rise in cases since July has not, however, translated into an increase in people being admitted to hospital. There are several local hotspots in the UK which have seen a spike in cases since the nationwide lockdown ended. Public Health England produces aweekly watchlist,externalof areas of concern, based on an assessment of incidence rates, and other indicators such as trends in testing, healthcare activity and deaths.

the pandemic has affected the area you are in. Jobs in Canada continue to grow, new labour market numbers say. Statistics Canada reported on Friday that the economy had added 246,000 jobs in
August. When added to the 419,000 new jobs in July, and 1.2m added in May and
June, employment is now just about 5.7% shy of its pre-coronavirus levels in
February. As of the week of Aug 15, about 1.8m Canadian workers are affected by the
Covid-19 shutdown, either because they are unemployed or have had their hours
reduced. In April, this number reached a peak of 5.5 million. Most of the employment gains have been in full-time work, the statistical agency
said. Additionally, the number of those working from home has decreased, from 3.4m in April to 2.5m
in August. France has reported 8,975 infections in the past 24 hours - the highest number of new infections since the start of the outbreak. The authorities also say the number of patients in intensive care units has been rising in the past few days. Earlier on, we reported that patients taking part in early tests of a Russian vaccine developed antibodies with ""no serious adverse events"" (see our 15:29 entry). However, the World Health Organization (WHO) now says it does not expect widespread immunisation against the virus until mid-2021. The WHO acknowledged that a ""considerable number"" of vaccine candidates had entered final stage trials, which typically involve tens of thousands of people. But WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris was quoted by AFP news agency as saying that ""in terms of realistic timelines, we are really not expecting to see widespread vaccination until the middle of next year"". The UN health agency has said it will not endorse any vaccine without proof that it is safe and effective.  Officials say 56 people have tested positive at an asylum centre in Birmingham, in England's West Midlands. Staff and residents at the Serco-run Stone Road Asylum Centre in Edgbaston are affectedand the centre has been closed, the city council says. Those infected have been moved to alternative accommodation where they can safely self-isolate. Contact tracing is also under way and being carried out in the relevant languages of affected residents, the council says. Switzerland has reported more than 400 new infections in the past 24 hours for the first time since mid-April. But health officials say that - despite 405 confirmed cases - the situation in the country is ""stable"", and the reproduction rate remains below 1. Three-quarters of the new cases are in people aged under 40. âAt the moment weâre not talking of a second wave; weâre talking of a slow increase in infections,"" said Stefan Kuster, the head of the Swiss health ministry's communicable diseases unit. ""The efforts of the population and the cantons are bearing fruit,"" he added. The Alpine nation of about 8.5 million people has so far recorded more than 43,000 infections, with over 2,000 deaths. The infection rate in Leeds has been rising over the last few weeks Leeds has been
added to Public Health England's weekly watch list of areas of concern, after its seven-day infection rate rose to 32.4 cases per 100,000 people. The city council said the data suggests a lot of the cases are in
different areas of the city, meaning they may be linked to social interaction
and leisure activities. ""The spread is broad and changeable across wards and cases
have also been increasingly detected in younger people aged 18-34, with some
concern over activities like house parties and gatherings,"" it said. There will not be any further restrictions on Leeds at this stage but it does mean increased monitoring of cases and potential additional steps in future if the infection rates do not start to fall. Council leader Judith Blake said: ""This rise in infection rates means that inevitably, our window of opportunity is shrinking by the day and the city is rapidly approaching a tipping point."" Some 1,940 new daily confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been
recorded in the UK, the highest since 30 May, according to the latest
government figures. Ten more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for
coronavirus, the government said, bringing the total death toll in the UK to 41,537. The
UK's testing capacity has increased since the peak of the outbreak earlier
this year. Derek Burt faces a race to get home to Scotland from the Algarve with his mother and children All Derek Burt's mother wanted when she was diagnosed with terminal motor neurone disease (MND) six weeks ago was one last holiday with her family, he says. ""MND is such an evil and unpredictable disease. We have no idea if she will be able to go on a family holiday with us when all the Covid craziness is over, so had to make the tough decision and deliver on one of her wishes now."" With trips to Florida and Croatia already cancelled, they decided on Portugal when quarantine restrictions were lifted two weeks ago. But now the family from Dunfermline in Fife is having to race to get home from the Algarve to beat the new restrictions that come into force at 04:00 on Saturday in Scotland. Mr Burt says the family researched different holidays and tried to follow the guidance available, but ""nobody has a clue what the governments are thinking"". Read the full story here Hong Kong has now decided to extend by four days a China-backed mass coronavirus testing programme,despite concerns that it is not effective and could be misused for surveillance. Officials said that only six people had been found infected among 128,000 people tested since the voluntary free programme was launched on Tuesday. They say that overall more than 900,000 people have registered for such tests. A health workers union has criticised the effort as an inefficient waste of resources, while activists have said it could be used by the authorities in mainland China to collect DNA samples. Boris Johnson has
insisted ""overwhelmingly the UK is proceeding as one"" after Transport
Secretary Grant Shapps admitted differing quarantine rules across the four
nations was âconfusingâ. During a visit to Solihull,
the UK prime minister said the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland have âdifferent rates of infectivity, different approaches to
the problemâ. He said digging below the
surface âyou will find overwhelmingly the UK takes the same approach"". The PM said quarantine
measures for arrivals from countries deemed high-risk must remain ""a vital
part"" of the fight against coronavirus. He said he understands the difficulties the airline
industry is going through, but that testing at points of entry only identifies
7% of the cases. Here's a round-up of what is happening in the US:  There have been 159 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland in the past 24 hours. This compares to 101 the previous day - an increase of 58 cases. Seventy three of the new cases are in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board area. Restrictions on visiting other householdswere reintroduced in Glasgow and two neighbouring areason Tuesday. Two new cases have been reported in the Western Isles for the first time since June. There have been no new reported deaths of people who tested positive in the last 28 days. Vials with a Russian vaccine Patients taking part in early tests of a Russian vaccine developed antibodies with ""no serious adverse events"",the Lancet medical journal has reported, quoting findings by several Russian scientists.,external But researchers said longer and larger trials were needed to prove the Sputnik V vaccine would be safe and effective. Last month, Russia announced that the vaccine had been approved by the country's health regulatory body - a move that was met with scepticism in some countries. A number of experts, particularly in the West, warned Moscow was moving too quickly, skipping a key stage required for research. Russia has rejected the criticism as baseless. President Vladimir Putin has said that one of his two daughters has already been vaccinated. And of Friday, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was shown on Russia's state TV getting the jab himself.

"Coronavirus cases 'remain unchanged' in EnglandDespite local outbreaks, household tests suggest the level of the virus was stable during August.","The level of coronavirus among the community in England remains ""unchanged"" for the week to 25 August, the Office for National Statistics suggests. Its latest survey of people in households estimates there were around 2,000 new cases of coronavirus per day. This suggests that, despite outbreaks in some local areas, overall case numbers remain stable. The ONS figures,externalgive one of the most accurate pictures of infections levels. They are based on more than 151,000 swab tests collected from people at home, whether they have symptoms or not. But there is always a margin for error in the figures because over the past six weeks of the study very few people have tested positive - just 71 from 68 households. The figures also do not cover what is going on in hospitals or care homes, where infection rates are likely to be different. However, they continue to paint a picture of a stable level of infections among private households in England. How do I get a coronavirus test? Covid testing boss 'very sorry' for shortages As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again 'Upset stomach' in children may be coronavirus The ONS estimates that 27,100 people in the community had the virus during that week from 19 to 25 August. This is similar to the estimate for the previous week and several weeks before that. In Wales, during the week to 25 August, 1,400 people are estimated to have had Covid-19 - also unchanged from previous weeks. A different kind of test - an antibody test, using blood samples - which looks for evidence of people having previously had the infection, has been carried out on 7,000 people as part of the ONS study. Results suggest that around 6% of the population - or one in 17 people - have been infected with the coronavirus in the past. This equates to 2.7 million people in England. The R number for the UK is between 0.9 and 1.1, say the government's scientific advisors, which means the number of people with the virus is staying at a constant level. The reproduction number or R is the average number of people that one infected person passes the virus onto. An R number of 1 means that on average every person who is infected will infect one other person, meaning the total number of infections is stable. This estimate of R is a guide to the general trend rather than a description of what is happening today. The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, said the ONS data showed that the government's approach, using contact tracing and local restrictions, was working and was helping the country ""to safely return to normal"". ""This reassuring news is testament to the hard work of everybody in following social distancing guidelines to protect themselves, their loved ones and the NHS."" Mr Hancock added: ""I would urge everybody to continue to be vigilant - wash your hands, wear a face covering and keep social distance from those outside your household - so we can keep the virus at bay.""

Spears appears to endorse #FreeBritney movement,"The star is trying to have her father removed as her legal guardian. Britney Spears has welcomed public scrutiny of the legal arrangement that has controlled various aspects her life and finances for more than a decade. A court-appointed guardian has been in charge of her affairs since her public breakdown in 2008. Her father Jamie has filled the role for most of that time. Now, the star is trying to remove him from power, and has argued the public has a right to know what is happening. ""The world is watching,"" said her lawyer in a court filing on Thursday. Spears' comments came in response to a motion from her father, who wanted to seal a recent filing in the case. The star is ""vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret"", said her lawyer Samuel Ingham III in the court documents. Spears' teams also appeared to endorse the #FreeBritney movement, which argues the star is being held against her will by people who stand to gain financially from her situation. Britney Spears calls conservatorship 'voluntary' What exactly is the #FreeBritney campaign? Britney reassures fans 'all is well' Its supporters frequently protest outside court hearings, and the campaign has won support from celebrities including Cher, Miley Cyrus and actress Ariel Winter - who herself won emancipation from her mother as a teenager. ""At this point in her life when she is trying to regain some measure of personal autonomy, Britney welcomes and appreciates the informed support of her many fans,"" wrote Ingham. Fans say Britney is being held hostage by her family, a claim the family denies Jamie Spears has previously called the fan-led #FreeBritney movement ""a joke"" and characterised its supporters as ""conspiracy theorists"". ""I have to report every nickel and dime spent to the court every year. How the hell would I steal something?""he said to the New York Post last year.,external But Ingham challenged that idea in his latest court filing ""Britney's conservatorship has attracted an unprecedented level of scrutiny from mainstream media and social media alike,"" said the court papers. ""Far from being a conspiracy theory or a 'joke' as James reportedly told the media, in large part this scrutiny is a reasonable and even predictable result of James' aggressive use of the sealing procedure over the years to minimise the amount of meaningful information made available to the public."" Britney Spears asks court to remove dad's control Britney Spears' sister seeks control of finances Britney Spears takes indefinite work break Mr Spears and his lawyers have routinely sought to have legal filings sealed from the public and hearings held behind closed doors,  arguing that the case involves private medical information, details about Spears' children and trade secrets that should be protected. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny has routinely approved their requests. Ingham argued on Thursday that the strategy might have had ""merits"" years ago, when the pop musician was trying to restart her career, but that the situation has changed. ""The sealing motion is supposedly being brought by her father to 'protect' Britney's interests, but she is adamantly opposed to it,"" he wrote. Spears has been subject to a conservatorship since 2008, when she was twice admitted to a psychiatric ward. The arrangement is usually reserved for people with a diminished capacity to make decisions for themselves, but they rarely last this long. In a filing earlier this week, the 38-year-old indicated that she was happy for the conservatorship to continue - calling it ""voluntary"" - but she no longer wants her father to be in charge of her affairs. Spears has not performed live since 2018, and cancelled a planned Vegas residency in 2019 Jamie Spears and lawyer Andrew M Wallet were Britney's co-conservators from 2008 until the latter stepped down in 2019. Mr Spears temporarily stepped down last year, citing health concerns, but retained control of her finances. Jodi Montgomery then became conservator of Britney's personal affairs. In legal papers lodged last month, Britney said she wanted Montgomery to stay in the role and strongly objected to her father returning. In a new filing on Wednesday, she added that she wants a wealth-management company called the Bessemer Trust, to oversee  her $57.4 million (Â£42.5 million) fortune - a move that would push her father out entirely. Her father has requested that Mr Wallet be reinstated as conservator, and that documents relating to that request remain sealed. Spears has opposed both motions. Her lawyer also argued that the moment her father obtained the power to handle Spears' affairs, he ""surrendered a large measure of privacy as to the manner in which he exercises that power"". ""Transparency is an essential component in order for this court to earn and retain the public's confidence with respect to protective proceedings like this one,"" he wrote. ""In this case, it is not an exaggeration to say that the whole world is watching."" A hearing on the conservatorship is scheduled for October. Last month, Judge Brenda Penny also extended the current version of the conservatorship until 1 February, 2021, in accordance with Spears' wishes.

Punk legend accuses water firm of sewage 'dumping',"Feargal Sharkey fronted Northern Irish punk band The Undertones, and in the 1980s had a huge hit as a solo artist with A Good Heart Singer Feargal Sharkey has criticised a water company for ""dumping"" thousands of hours' worth of sewage in a river. The former Undertones front man, a ""life-long fly fisherman"", said the 12,734 hours of dumping in the River Kennet last year was ""utterly shocking"" and potentially illegal. Thames Water acknowledged the duration of sewage discharge but said it was due to storms and so was ""heavily diluted"". It added discharges into rivers stopped flooding in homes and streets.

Sharkey, who fronted punk band The Undertones and went on to have a successful solo career in the 1980s, said: ""The UK Government was taken to court in 2012 regarding dumping sewage and allowing water companies to dump sewage into rivers. ""The court ruled that that should not be allowed to happen, and in fact ruled that it should only possibly ever happen in what the court referred to as 'exceptional circumstances'. ""Using Thames Water's own monitoring data, we now know that last year they spent 12,734 hours dumping sewage into the River Kennet. ""Well can someone please explain to me what the exceptional circumstances were?"" The River Kennet is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is one of England's most important chalk streams On Twitter, Sharkey described the 46-mile river - a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which runs from Malborough, Wiltshire, to Woolhampton, Berkshire - as ""one of the rarest habitats on earth"". A Thames Water spokesman said: ""We work hard to minimise storm discharges, while also looking at how we can improve the system for the future, including reducing groundwater infiltration and increasing capacity. ""We've also invested heavily in monitoring equipment to understand how frequently spills occur and help us plan improvements."" Feargal Sharkey is a keen fly fisherman He added sewage discharges were not ""the only sources of pollutants"" but that ""animal faeces from livestock and wildlife, along with run-off from farms and roads, also contribute to the hazards"". Sharkey said: ""In Thames Water you're talking about a company that has paid billions of pounds in dividends to shareholders. Perhaps they should have spent some of that money in maintaining and upgrading their sewage networks."" A Thames Water spokesman said: ""Our shareholders are in it for the long term and have not taken a dividend for three years to prioritise investment in improving service for customers, and to protect the environment.""

'Huge explosion' as fire rages at industrial unit,"People living nearby described hearing a ""huge explosion"" and said ""the whole place shook"" A large fire has broken out in an industrial building and people have been evacuated from the nearby area. One resident of Hoo Marina, close to the blaze on Vicarage Lane, described hearing a ""huge explosion"" and an eyewitness said the ""place shook"". Kent Fire and Rescue Service said about 200 people were removed from the area and advised others to keep windows and doors closed. Crews are to stay at the site overnight after the blaze started at 04:40 BST. The flames could be seen from miles around, but no-one was injured. Investigators are yet to establish how the fire started. Mark Woodward, the incident commander for the fire service, said the building was used to store animal welfare equipment and some Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders had exploded in the blaze. This video can not be played Residents of Hoo reported hearing ""two massive bangs"" Another eyewitness told BBC Radio Kent he heard ""two massive bangs"" at about 05:00. ""We thought it was a thunderbolt because the whole place shook,"" he said. ""All I could see in the background was a red ball of fire and we were all told to evacuate."" Residents in the area were advised to keep windows and doors closed Mr Woodward said the blaze had been ""well contained"" and the fire service was ""considering how best to extinguish it"". At its height, 10 fire engines were tackling the flames, and a 200 metre cordon was in place. UK Power Networks confirmed it sent engineers to the area at 10:00 after receiving reports of an interruption to power supplies to 13 properties. The power supply to 40 customers was also cut as work continued to reconnect supplies, the company said. A spokeswoman said the fire had damaged an overhead power cable. Roads in the area were closed off by Medway Council while emergency teams dealt with the blaze. No-one was injured in the blaze Many residents were sent to the Village Institute in Hoo, where an emergency rest centre was set up. Chris Hosegood said the fire had been intense. ""As we walked up Vicarage Lane we looked back and saw the black smoke and all of a sudden the big fireballs. ""We could feel the heat half way up the lane,"" she said. At 18:30 BST three fire engines were still at the scene, with firefighters saying they would remain for another one or two days. Most residents have been allowed to return home.

Differences in UK quarantine rules 'confusing',"This video can not be played Grant Shapps says differences in UK quarantine rules are ""confusing"" Differences in UK quarantine rules are ""confusing"" for travellers, Grant Shapps has admitted, as the four nations take varying approaches to countries with rising Covid-19 cases. The transport secretary acknowledged people's frustrations, as Scotland and Wales asked arrivals from Portugal and parts of Greece to isolate, but England and Northern Ireland held off. Wales' rules,external, including only six Greek islands, began at 04:00 BST on Friday. Travel firms called for urgent clarity. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast the difference in quarantine rules was similar to the way lockdown had been applied across the UK. ""It is similar, unfortunately, with the quarantining where we look at the data and then we do speak, but, I'm afraid, quite often come to slightly different outcomes, which I appreciate is confusing for people,"" he said. He described Portugal as being on a ""borderline"", adding that ""the opinion of England and Northern Ireland is that it did not justify quarantine this week"". What are the UK's quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Scotland""sort of jumped the gun"" by introducing restrictionsfor arrivals from the whole of Greece. ""I'm very keen and do try to coordinate... with the other administrations so we can both announce at the same time, and ideally both announce the same things, and this week that didn't work out,"" he said. The seven-day infection rate in Portugal has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people, above the threshold of 20. Mr Shapps explained that cases per 100,000 people was just one measure taken into account bythe UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre, with the test positivity rate also a factor. The proportion of tests proving positive in Portugal was lower than it was when quarantine restrictions were lifted last month, Mr Shapps added. But the minister warned: ""As I constantly sayâ¦ we will have to move quickly if the figures change."" Derek Burt, from Dunfermline in Fife, wastrying to organise last-minute travelback to the UK before Scotland's quarantine begins when he spoke to the BBC from the Algarve. He said he booked a trip to Portugal with his terminally ill mother because he ""assumed the government knew what they were doing"" and would not return the country to its quarantine list. ""How stupid was I to show any faith in our countries' decision-makers?"" he said. Some holidaymakers due to return to England told the BBC theypaid around Â£1,000 for flightsto get home from Portugal in anticipation of the rules changing - but that did not happen. Kelly, from Birmingham, and her family changed their flights home from the Algarve from Saturday to Friday at a cost of Â£900 to avoid potential quarantine because she did not want her children to miss out on two weeks of school. ""It's cost us a lot more money and it's money we didn't need to spend now,"" she said. Ron, who was preparing to travel to Manchester from Faro Airport on Friday, told the BBC flights for three people cost over Â£1,000. ""It would be good if governments could all get together... and come up with one set of policies which are applied reasonably consistently,"" he said. While Wales' advice has already changed, arrivals toScotland,externalfrom Portugal and French Polynesia will also have to self-isolate from 04:00 on Saturday. Scotland has already reintroduced quarantine for arrivals from Greece. The measures will affect those who reside in Wales and Scotland but return to the UK via England. Portugal, Greece and French Polynesia are still onEngland,externalandNorthern Ireland's,externallists of travel corridors. The latestquarantine rules introduced in Wales, which also apply to travellers from Gibraltar, affect six Greek islands - Crete, Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos. Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething told Today that Wales has seen 30 coronavirus cases from four different flights from Zakynthos, two of which landed in England. ""I did not feel that there was any course of action other than taking some form of action,"" he said. Scotlandreintroduced self-isolation measures for arrivals from Greeceearlier in the week, and has sinceadded Portugal and French Polynesiato its list of countries requiring quarantine. ""This week's data shows an increase in test positivity and cases per 100,000 in Portugal,"" said Scottish justice minister Humza Yousaf. It may look confusing and it may leave holidaymakers and other travellers scratching their heads as to why the quarantine rules are different depending on where you live in the UK. But this is devolution in action. The new emergency coronavirus legislation introduced earlier this year gave the devolved administrations new powers to tackle the pandemic, adding to their existing control over many domestic issues. Their chief medical officers give ministers their own own advice, though they do confer with their counterparts and through UK-wide committees. Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast have already shown a willingness to move at their own pace over easing lockdown restrictions and reopening schools. With the R number (the speed at which the virus is spreading or receding) rising above the overall UK level in Scotland, it is perhaps no surprise that Holyrood wants to take its own initiatives on quarantine. Themuch-publicised flight from Greece to Cardiff, with several cases traced to passengers, is another illustration of why a devolved administration has taken action. Greece's rate overall is below the 20 cases per 100,000 threshold, at 13.8 in the seven days to 2 September, down from 14.9 a week earlier. Northern Ireland will not make further changes to quarantine rules at present, its department of health said. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries The variety of rules across the four UK nations has drawn criticism from industry experts. ""The quarantine policy is in tatters,"" said Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy firm The PC Agency. ""Consumers are totally confused by the different approaches."" It comes as the level of coronavirus among the community in England remains ""unchanged"",according to Office for National Statistics estimatesbased on a survey during the week ending 25 August.

Court threat to housebuilders over leasehold âtrapâ,"Four of the UK's largest housebuilders are being investigated after ""troubling evidence"" was uncovered over the way leaseholds were sold. Barratt Developments, Countryside Properties, Persimmon Homes and Taylor Wimpey face action from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Buyers have argued that they were caught in a leasehold trap, with rising ground rents and unfair fees. The CMA has demanded information from the developers and could go to court. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: ""It is unacceptable for housing developers to mislead or take advantage of homebuyers. ""Everyone involved in selling leasehold homes should take note: if our investigation demonstrates that there has been mis-selling or unfair contract terms, these will not be tolerated."" The watchdog said there was troubling evidence of potentially unfair terms and mis-selling. Someone who owns a property outright, including the land it is built on, is a freeholder. With a leasehold, the person owns a lease which gives them the right to use the property. But they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes. When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years, but sometimes up to 999 years - although people may extend their lease or buy the freehold. But leasehold house owners are often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell. Millions of properties in England and Wales have been sold as leaseholds, with the buyer getting a mortgage to live in the property, but also having to pay ground rent to the owners of the freehold. Buyers of new homes discovered that they were tied into contracts that saw ground rents become hugely more expensive, with the freehold sometimes having been sold on to a third-party. Some also faced large fees when they planned to add an extension to their property or even basic home improvements. It prompted campaigners to describe the situation as ""fleecehold"", with an estimated 100,000 people affected. The CMA has found that some some leasehold buyers were being hit with ground rents that doubled every decade, and said that others were wrongly told that they were unable to buy the freehold on a site. The watchdog said it also had concerns over mis-selling, such as pressure being put on potential buyers to complete a house purchase quickly. Some were also told that they would be able to buy the freehold for a small sum, only to later find this cost increase to many thousands of pounds. This left many people in a position of never being able to sell. Katie Kendrick welcomed the CMA's actions Paediatric nurse Katie Kendrick bought her ""forever"" home in Cheshire six years ago. She said she was told she could buy the freehold for between Â£2,000 and Â£4,000 two years later, only for it to be sold on to an investment company which quoted her more than Â£13,000. Her experience led her to set up the National Leasehold Campaign, which has 18,000 members - many of whom gave evidence  to the CMA. She described the latest stage of the CMA investigation as a ""massive step forward"". ""Thousands of leaseholders face continued uncertainty from the leasehold scandal and its long-term financial burden. It is time these developers do the right thing. Their profits and executive bonuses prove they can afford to put things right,"" she said, on behalf of the campaign group. She added that she hoped the investigation ""shamed developers and investors into action"". Barratt Developments, one of the four housebuilders named by the CMA, said: ""The group is committed to putting its customers first and will continue to co-operate with the CMA whilst it completes its investigation."" Taylor Wimpey said it would continue to co-operate fully with the CMA. Persimmon said it stopped selling leasehold houses in 2017 where it owned the land freehold. ""Any customers of a Persimmon leasehold property in the last six years have been given the right to buy their lease at below market value and many have done so,"" it said. Countryside Properties said it was ""committed to resolving this issue to the satisfaction of our customers"". The CMA has written to the four developers demanding information about how they operated. It is also telling other firms to review their policies. The watchdog is investigating certain firms who bought freeholds from these developers and have continued to use the same ""unfair leasehold contract terms"". It could tell firms to change the way they sell leasehold deals, and could go to court. Previously, it has said those affected could be refunded. It added that it would work with government on plans for the leasehold market, including supporting the move to ban the sale of new leasehold houses and reduce ground rents for new leases to zero. 'We've been caught in a leasehold trap' NAEA Propertymark, which represents estate agents, said: ""For too long housebuilders and developers have not been transparent enough about what it means to buy a leasehold property, leaving many in financial difficulty as they have become trapped in confusing contracts with their freeholder."" Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""Shameful practices of the kind set out by the CMA have no place in our housing market and we are going to put an end to them. ""I want to see homeowners who have been affected by crippling ground rents swiftly obtain the justice and redress they deserve. ""Developers and freeholders must rectify the problems and ensure these disgraceful practices never happen again.""

Abbott set to get UK trade advisor role,"This video can not be played The prime minister says he ""can't be expected"" to agree with everyone who works with the government. Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been appointed as an unpaid trade adviser to the UK government. Boris Johnson rejected claims Mr Abbott was not suitable for the role, despite criticism over past comments on women, LGBT people and climate change. The UK prime minister said he did ""not agree with those sentiments"". Mr Abbott, who negotiated trade deals for Australia when in power, will not take part in post-Brexit talks between the UK and other countries. Instead, he will advise the new Board of Trade, set up to help ministers and encourage firms to do more business internationally. Who is Tony Abbott? UK 'sleepwalking into disaster' over border plans New Zealand 'frustrated' over UK trade talks Mr Abbott was a prominent opponent of same-sex marriage in Australia's 2017 referendum on the issue and has been accused of making homophobic and misogynist comments in the past. He has also described the idea of climate change as ""faddish"" and, last year, claimed the world was ""in the grip of a climate cult"". Asked about the new appointee's past comments, Mr Johnson said he could not be expected to agree with all the views of everyone who worked with the government. He said Mr Abbott had been elected by the ""great, liberal democratic nation of Australia,"" adding: ""I think that speaks for itself."" This government has recently had the word ""U-turn"" lobbed at it, a lot. But there's been no change of heart here. While the appointment of Tony Abbott has sparked serious concern in some quarters, the government has on this occasion decided it doesn't want to back down. Perhaps it doesn't want to hand critics more ""U-turn"" ammunition. And ministers have argued that Mr Abbott will bring real trade expertise. But there may also be a calculation in Downing Street, rightly or wrongly, that this is a ""Westminster bubble"" issue - a story that, in the end, won't do the government significant political damage. Other advisers to the Board of Trade will include former Labour health secretary Patricia Hewitt, ex-Conservative Member of the European Parliament Daniel Hannan and economist and broadcaster Linda Yueh. Mr Abbott, who was prime minister of Australia from 2013 to 2015, negotiated free-trade deals with Japan, China and South Korea. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he had ""real concerns"" and ""wouldn't appoint"" Mr Abbott if he were prime minister. Tony Abbott at the launch of sister Christine Forster's book in June Shadow international development secretary Emily Thornberry said Mr Abbott was ""the wrong"" choice ""on every level"" and had ""no experience of detailed trade negotiations, no understanding of Brexit, no belief in climate change, no concern for workers' rights"". A group of equality activists - including actor Sir Ian McKellen and Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies - haswritten an open letter against Mr Abbott's appointment,external. It says: ""This is a man who described abortion as 'the easy way out' and suggested that men may be 'by physiology or temperament more adapted to exercise authority or to issue command'."" ""For all these reasons and more besides, this man is not fit to be representing the UK as our trade envoy,"" the letter adds. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Abbott had ""no place in any British government"". And the SNP's deputy Westminster leader, Kirsten Oswald, called the appointment ""beyond indefensible"". But Mr Abbott's sister, Christine Forster, defended him against claims of misogyny and homophobia. ""As a woman who has always been part of his life and who came out to him as gay in my early 40s, I know incontrovertibly that Tony is neither of those things,""she wrote on Twitter.,external ""In reality he is a man of great conviction and intellect; an unabashed conservative but with great compassion, respect for others, and an indelible sense of doing what is right."" This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake breaks down the next round of Brexit negotiations The Board of Trade will meet four times a year. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, who will chair the body, said: ""At a time of increased protectionism and global insecurity, it's vital that the UK is a strong voice for open markets and that we play a meaningful role in reshaping global trading rules alongside like-minded countries."" She said she was bringing together ""a diverse group of people who share Britain's belief in free enterprise, democracy, and high standards and rules-based trade"".

Late-night rescue for stranded Waverley passengersMost of the passengers onboard and waiting at the terminal returned to the mainland last night.Glasgow & West Scotland,"The paddle steamer was badly damaged in Thursday's crash More than 130 people were returned to the mainland on a late-night ferry after the Waverley's collision with Brodick Pier in Arran. More than 200 passengers and 26 crew were onboard the paddle steamer when it crashed into the pier as it arrived at Brodick on Thursday evening. The coastguard said 24 passengers were injured in the crash, with some airlifted to hospital on the mainland. The boat's operators confirmed its sailing season is now over. The Waverley set sail for thefirst time in two years less than a fortnight ago, an event which was itself delayed due to an ""unexpected technical and administration issue"". The boat, described as the world's last seagoing paddle steamer, had been due to continue sailing until 12 September. Twenty four injured as Waverley crashes into pier Waverley Excursion, the company that owns and operates the paddle steamer, said on its website: ""[The] Waverley made heavy contact while berthing at Brodick Pier on Thursday 3rd September and will be unable to undertake any further sailings this season. ""An investigation into the incident is ongoing."" This was the scene on the boat moments after it struck the pier Police, paramedics, coastguard and rescue helicopters were called to the pier when the alarm was raised at 17.15. Eyewitnesses reported seeing people falling over when the boat struck the pier earlier in the day. Rita McLeod, who was waiting to board the Waverley, said she saw people with head injuries, and heard of one who required an air ambulance. ""We were actually queued up waiting to get in when it crashed,"" she said. ""It came in bow first. It came in far too fast. We saw a lot of people falling and there were people taken away in ambulances. ""We saw a lot of people, pretty badly shaken, coming off."" The Caledonian Isles ferry was sent to pick up stranded passengers Passengers who had been waiting to board the paddle steamer had feared that they might have to spend the night at the terminal. But Calmac's Caledonian Isles ferry was sent to pick them up late on Thursday night following discussions between Transport Scotland and the Marine and Coastguard Agency Robbie Drummond, managing director of CalMac, said: ""We were more than happy to help return passengers to the mainland and worked closely with agencies including Waverley Excursions, who transported everyone onwards once they landed in Ardrossan."" He added: ""I would like to extend my deep gratitude to the crew on the Caledonian Isles and at Brodick and Ardrossan"" Man who caused woman 'fear or alarm' given legal slap on the wrist Do you know this pooch?

Punk legend accuses water firm of sewage 'dumping'Former Undertones front man Feargal Sharkey hit out at Thames Water on Twitter.Berkshire,"Feargal Sharkey fronted Northern Irish punk band The Undertones, and in the 1980s had a huge hit as a solo artist with A Good Heart Singer Feargal Sharkey has criticised a water company for ""dumping"" thousands of hours' worth of sewage in a river. The former Undertones front man, a ""life-long fly fisherman"", said the 12,734 hours of dumping in the River Kennet last year was ""utterly shocking"" and potentially illegal. Thames Water acknowledged the duration of sewage discharge but said it was due to storms and so was ""heavily diluted"". It added discharges into rivers stopped flooding in homes and streets.

Sharkey, who fronted punk band The Undertones and went on to have a successful solo career in the 1980s, said: ""The UK Government was taken to court in 2012 regarding dumping sewage and allowing water companies to dump sewage into rivers. ""The court ruled that that should not be allowed to happen, and in fact ruled that it should only possibly ever happen in what the court referred to as 'exceptional circumstances'. ""Using Thames Water's own monitoring data, we now know that last year they spent 12,734 hours dumping sewage into the River Kennet. ""Well can someone please explain to me what the exceptional circumstances were?"" The River Kennet is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is one of England's most important chalk streams On Twitter, Sharkey described the 46-mile river - a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which runs from Malborough, Wiltshire, to Woolhampton, Berkshire - as ""one of the rarest habitats on earth"". A Thames Water spokesman said: ""We work hard to minimise storm discharges, while also looking at how we can improve the system for the future, including reducing groundwater infiltration and increasing capacity. ""We've also invested heavily in monitoring equipment to understand how frequently spills occur and help us plan improvements."" Feargal Sharkey is a keen fly fisherman He added sewage discharges were not ""the only sources of pollutants"" but that ""animal faeces from livestock and wildlife, along with run-off from farms and roads, also contribute to the hazards"". Sharkey said: ""In Thames Water you're talking about a company that has paid billions of pounds in dividends to shareholders. Perhaps they should have spent some of that money in maintaining and upgrading their sewage networks."" A Thames Water spokesman said: ""Our shareholders are in it for the long term and have not taken a dividend for three years to prioritise investment in improving service for customers, and to protect the environment.""

Sex-filming ruling 'clarifies' voyeurism law,"Tony Richards failed to overturn his voyeurism conviction Filming a partner during sex without consent is voyeurism, Appeal Court judges have ruled. Tony Richards, from Cardiff, was jailed for filming two sex workers, but argued his conviction should be quashed as the filming happened in a private setting. Rejecting his appeal, judges ruled that the women he recorded had had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Wednesday's ruling ""clarified this point of law"". Richards, 40, of Heritage Drive, Caerau, was jailed in August for 15 months for two counts of voyeurism and three counts of possessing indecent images of children. The Appeal Court's rejection of his appeal is likely to have consequences for other cases, according to the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ). Emily Hunt launched a legal challenge against a decision not to bring a prosecution against a man she said filmed her without consent One such case is that of a naked, sleeping woman who says she was filmed by a man without her consent, the CWJ says. Emily Hunt launched a legal challenge last year against the CPS's decision not to bring a prosecution against the man, who she said filmed her without consent in May 2015. The CWJ, which represented Ms Hunt, said the CPS would no longer oppose her challenge and would review its earlier decision, following the latest ruling. Upskirting now a crime after campaign Voyeurism 'under-researched' subject Ms Hunt said: ""This decision was the clear, obvious and commonsense answer to a question no-one else was asking: is it illegal to video someone naked without their consent? ""Because the answer is obvious: yes it is. And the court agreed."" Ms Hunt was given permission by the court to intervene in the case after the CWJ learned the CPS would be opposing Richards's appeal. The ruling at the Court of Appeal will have ramifications for other cases CWJ director Harriet Wistrich said: ""We would like to know why the CPS chose to argue opposite points in two separate cases."" A CPS spokesman said: ""What constitutes a 'private act' for the purposes of the offence of voyeurism had never been conclusively defined by a higher court. ""Now this new judgment has clarified this point of law, the CPS will review its position in the judicial review brought by Emily Hunt.""

Where can I still go on holiday?,"More than 50 countries had suspended routes to the UK because of the rapid spread of a new variant of Covid, but some of them have now lifted those restrictions. On 24 December, theUK banned travel from South Africaamid concerns over another new strain of the virus linked to that country. People who have transited through South Africa in the past 10 days will also be banned. However, UK and Irish nationals as well as the UK visa holders and permanent residents are exempt, but they will have to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. It had already been pretty difficult to travel abroad - because of quarantine rules either at your destination or when returning to the UK. Here are some of the requirements currently in place. EU countries held discussions on Tuesday and decided to lift the compete travel ban, allowing national citizens, foreign residents and key workers to travel from the UK to their home country, if they have a negative Covid test. But EU countries are free to set their own rules on border controls, so the exact rules vary from country to country. France:French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers are among those able to travel again - if they have had a recent negative test. Rapid ""lateral flow"" tests  - which give results in about 30 minutes - will be accepted. Netherlands: Anyone arriving from the UK will need to have had a so-called PCR test to enter. These can take more than 24 hours to turn around, as they need to be processed in a lab. Belgium: Between 23 and 31 December, only those who are resident in Belgium, Belgian citizens and a limited number of strictly necessary journeys will be allowed from the UK. No prior test is necessary, but there will be strict controls on the Passenger Locator form and a quarantine of 7 days, followed by a compulsory PCR test. Spain: Flights from Britain have been stopped until further notice, except for those carrying Spanish citizens or people with Spanish residency. Travellers have to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. Italy: Only Italian citizens will be allowed to return from the UK, along with those who urgently need to enter the country. They will have to have a PCR test before departing and spend two weeks in quarantine in Italy. Germany:Flights and passenger transport by rail, bus and ship is banned until 6 January. From 1 January 2021, transport operators can apply to the German authorities for an exemption to transport people who are resident in Germany. People arriving from the UK will need to either present a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours, or be tested when entering the country. Even with a negative test, travellers will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with the possibility for a test and release after five days Ireland:Passengers arriving by plane or ferry from England, Wales and Scotland are banned until 31 December, regardless of nationality. Essential workers are exempt China:Direct flights to and from the UK have been suspended indefinitely Canada:Passenger flights from the UK were stopped for 72 hours from midnight on Sunday (Monday 05:00 GMT), but on Christmas Eve the measure was extended indefinitely India:All flights from the UK are suspended until 31 December US:New York City has introduced quarantine rules for international travellers, who must stay for 14 days at the address they provided on arrival. Arrivals from the UK will be checked on by sheriff's deputies This isnot a complete list of countries, as so many have taken measures. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office hasupdates on the latest advice for UK travellers,externalto other countries. Many restrictions in place to limit the spread of coronavirus mean travel options are limited. InEngland, people who live in a tier four ""stay at home"" area or a tier three ""very high alert"" area have been told to avoid travel, including overnight stays, unless it is necessary. InWales, people can only travel internationally for essential reasons. From December 28, Wales will go in to a lockdown, meaning people should only leave their area for essential reasons. InNorthern Ireland, people have been told to ""avoid all unnecessary travel"" from 26 December, when a six-week lockdown starts. InScotland, people living in higher risk level three or four areas should avoid unnecessary travel. Most people arriving in the UK from many destinations - including British nationals - must quarantine for 10 days. Exceptions are made for the Common Travel Area - the Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - or people coming from countries in travel corridors with the UK. It means there have been only a small number of destinations with no restrictions at either end. What are the Covid regulations where you live? There are hopes that the newcoronavirus vaccineswill make travel to more destinations possible in the coming months. People arriving in England can now cut their quarantine period by at least half if they pay for a private Covid test after five days and it comes back negative. But the government will only allow certain test providers to take part in the scheme, and they havestruggled under the weight of demand. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also suggested rapid testing - which can give a result in under an hour - could eventually""open the way"" for quarantine-free travel.

Differences in UK quarantine rules 'confusing'The transport secretary admits varying approaches to international travel restrictions are frustrating.,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps says differences in UK quarantine rules are ""confusing"" Differences in UK quarantine rules are ""confusing"" for travellers, Grant Shapps has admitted, as the four nations take varying approaches to countries with rising Covid-19 cases. The transport secretary acknowledged people's frustrations, as Scotland and Wales asked arrivals from Portugal and parts of Greece to isolate, but England and Northern Ireland held off. Wales' rules,external, including only six Greek islands, began at 04:00 BST on Friday. Travel firms called for urgent clarity. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast the difference in quarantine rules was similar to the way lockdown had been applied across the UK. ""It is similar, unfortunately, with the quarantining where we look at the data and then we do speak, but, I'm afraid, quite often come to slightly different outcomes, which I appreciate is confusing for people,"" he said. He described Portugal as being on a ""borderline"", adding that ""the opinion of England and Northern Ireland is that it did not justify quarantine this week"". What are the UK's quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Scotland""sort of jumped the gun"" by introducing restrictionsfor arrivals from the whole of Greece. ""I'm very keen and do try to coordinate... with the other administrations so we can both announce at the same time, and ideally both announce the same things, and this week that didn't work out,"" he said. The seven-day infection rate in Portugal has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people, above the threshold of 20. Mr Shapps explained that cases per 100,000 people was just one measure taken into account bythe UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre, with the test positivity rate also a factor. The proportion of tests proving positive in Portugal was lower than it was when quarantine restrictions were lifted last month, Mr Shapps added. But the minister warned: ""As I constantly sayâ¦ we will have to move quickly if the figures change."" Derek Burt, from Dunfermline in Fife, wastrying to organise last-minute travelback to the UK before Scotland's quarantine begins when he spoke to the BBC from the Algarve. He said he booked a trip to Portugal with his terminally ill mother because he ""assumed the government knew what they were doing"" and would not return the country to its quarantine list. ""How stupid was I to show any faith in our countries' decision-makers?"" he said. Some holidaymakers due to return to England told the BBC theypaid around Â£1,000 for flightsto get home from Portugal in anticipation of the rules changing - but that did not happen. Kelly, from Birmingham, and her family changed their flights home from the Algarve from Saturday to Friday at a cost of Â£900 to avoid potential quarantine because she did not want her children to miss out on two weeks of school. ""It's cost us a lot more money and it's money we didn't need to spend now,"" she said. Ron, who was preparing to travel to Manchester from Faro Airport on Friday, told the BBC flights for three people cost over Â£1,000. ""It would be good if governments could all get together... and come up with one set of policies which are applied reasonably consistently,"" he said. While Wales' advice has already changed, arrivals toScotland,externalfrom Portugal and French Polynesia will also have to self-isolate from 04:00 on Saturday. Scotland has already reintroduced quarantine for arrivals from Greece. The measures will affect those who reside in Wales and Scotland but return to the UK via England. Portugal, Greece and French Polynesia are still onEngland,externalandNorthern Ireland's,externallists of travel corridors. The latestquarantine rules introduced in Wales, which also apply to travellers from Gibraltar, affect six Greek islands - Crete, Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos. Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething told Today that Wales has seen 30 coronavirus cases from four different flights from Zakynthos, two of which landed in England. ""I did not feel that there was any course of action other than taking some form of action,"" he said. Scotlandreintroduced self-isolation measures for arrivals from Greeceearlier in the week, and has sinceadded Portugal and French Polynesiato its list of countries requiring quarantine. ""This week's data shows an increase in test positivity and cases per 100,000 in Portugal,"" said Scottish justice minister Humza Yousaf. It may look confusing and it may leave holidaymakers and other travellers scratching their heads as to why the quarantine rules are different depending on where you live in the UK. But this is devolution in action. The new emergency coronavirus legislation introduced earlier this year gave the devolved administrations new powers to tackle the pandemic, adding to their existing control over many domestic issues. Their chief medical officers give ministers their own own advice, though they do confer with their counterparts and through UK-wide committees. Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast have already shown a willingness to move at their own pace over easing lockdown restrictions and reopening schools. With the R number (the speed at which the virus is spreading or receding) rising above the overall UK level in Scotland, it is perhaps no surprise that Holyrood wants to take its own initiatives on quarantine. Themuch-publicised flight from Greece to Cardiff, with several cases traced to passengers, is another illustration of why a devolved administration has taken action. Greece's rate overall is below the 20 cases per 100,000 threshold, at 13.8 in the seven days to 2 September, down from 14.9 a week earlier. Northern Ireland will not make further changes to quarantine rules at present, its department of health said. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries The variety of rules across the four UK nations has drawn criticism from industry experts. ""The quarantine policy is in tatters,"" said Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy firm The PC Agency. ""Consumers are totally confused by the different approaches."" It comes as the level of coronavirus among the community in England remains ""unchanged"",according to Office for National Statistics estimatesbased on a survey during the week ending 25 August.

Voyeur sentenced after woman's five-year campaignChristopher Killick filmed Emily Hunt while she was naked and unconscious in a London hotel room.London,"This video can not be played Emily Hunt: ""This isn't about vengeance, it's about justice"" A man has been sentenced for filming a naked woman in a hotel room while she was unconscious, following her five-year campaign for justice. Christopher Killick, 40, recorded a 62-second clip of Emily Hunt in an east London hotel in 2015. Prosecutors told Ms Hunt what he did was not illegal,until the law was clarified by the Court of Appeal. Killick, who previously pleaded guilty to voyeurism, was given a 30-month community order and fined Â£2,000. At a Stratford Magistrates' Court hearing, he was also ordered to pay Ms Hunt Â£5,000 in compensation and put on the sexual offenders register for five years. Christopher Killick was given a 30-month community order and fined Â£2,000 Ms Hunt, a New York-born former PR executive, said she had no recollection of how she ended up in the Town Hall Hotel in Bethnal Green in May 2015. She maintains she was drugged and raped. Killick, from Brent, north-west London, was initially arrested on suspicion of rape, but police dropped the case due to a lack of evidence. The 40-year-old had always claimed the encounter was consensual and no prosecution for rape was ever brought against him. This video can not be played Ms Hunt spoke about what happened in an interview in 2017 During the course of their investigation, officers discovered the video of Ms Hunt, which Killick told police he had filmed for his own sexual gratification. On six separate occasions the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) told Ms Hunt what had happened was not illegal. But in January, judges considering a separate case at the Court of Appeal ruled that filming a partner during sex without their consent is voyeurism and Killick was subsequently charged. In her victim impact statement, Ms Hunt told the court his actions ""ruined my life"" and the case had been ""profoundly disturbing, debilitating and ultimately devastating"". By BBC Reality Check In law in England and Wales, a person has committed an act of voyeurism if they: â¢ Observe for their own sexual gratification someone else ""doing a private act"" â¢ Know the other person does not consent to being observed The law also says you have committed a voyeurism offence if you film someone ""doing a private act"" without consent. Because Emily Hunt's encounter with the man who filmed her was deemed consensual, the CPS said she had consented to being observed naked and this extended to filming. In other words, you don't have a reasonable expectation to privacy when with a consensual partner. But Ms Hunt maintains she didn't ever give consent and was raped, but the police dropped the case due to lack of evidence. In January, during a different case, the Court of Appeal clarified that someone should not be filmed doing ""a private act"" without consent, even if the person filming was the consensual partner. Effectively, even if you are having consensual sex with someone, it does not entirely remove the expectation of privacy from that person when it comes to filming them. This decision meant that Ms Hunt had the legal grounds to pursue her case against Killick. Speaking about her five-year battle for justice, Ms Hunt - who has waived her right to anonymity - told the BBC that the CPS had ""behaved in an appalling manner"". ""It's just inexcusable. We deserve better, we deserve a criminal justice system and a prosecution service that believes that violent criminals belong in jail."" She said that since January's ruling she had been contacted about similar cases to hers, adding that now ""somebody was taking this seriously from the beginning and treating the victim like a victim"" that this was ""the biggest win"". A CPS spokesperson said: ""We recognise the delays in bringing this case to court have had a lasting impact on the victim. ""This is a complex area of law, which was clarified for the first time in the Court of Appeal this year... the CPS does not make or decide the law; that is the remit of Parliament and the courts respectively.""

Jane Garvey to leave Woman's Hour,"Broadcaster Jane Garvey is to leave Woman's Hour at the end of the year, the BBC has confirmed. Garvey has presented the programme, which offers a female perspective on the world, since 2007. She will now go on to host her own new Radio 4 series in the new year. ""It's been a real privilege to play a small part in the history of this very special radio programme,"" she said, adding how proud she was of its relationship with its listeners. ""On one unforgettable day, I interviewed David Cameron in the morning, and Mary J Blige in the afternoon. There's no other job like it,"" she said. ""But famous people are not the reason people engage with Woman's Hour. It's because the programme still talks about the subjects and challenges no one else goes near. I'm very proud of our relationship with the audience and the trust they place in us."" During her time on the show, Garvey helped to mark important legal changes for women, including 100 years of women's suffrage, and the 50th anniversary of the Abortion Act. She interviewed Sally Challen, who was freed from prison when coercive control became a crime, and actor Rose McGowan, about her experiences with Harvey Weinstein and the #Metoo movement. Radio 4 controller Mohit Bakaya said ""few"" people ""can match the brilliance of Jane Garvey,"" when it comes to ""the art of radio presenting"". ""And whilst I understand that she feels it is time to move on after a terrific 13 years presenting Woman's Hour, I am thrilled that she will stay on the network,"" he said. Woman's Hour presenters Jenni Murray (left) and Jane Garvey in 2016 Garvey's new 09:00 programme will begin in April 2021, and will see her interview ""people with extraordinary stories"". The podcast she also co-hosts with Fi Glover, entitled Fortunatelyâ¦ with Fi and Jane, will move to the broadcast schedule from January 2021 as well.

'Ministry of Defence failed our Army veteran son',"Brett Savage served in Afghanistan while in the Army The parents of an Army veteran who is believed to have taken his life say he was failed by the Ministry Of Defence. Brett Savage, who was 32 and served in Afghanistan, had previously told BBC News NI that the army was not doing enough to help young soldiers when they returned to civilian life. His body was found at his home in Newtownards at the weekend. His parents Noel and Dolores Savage said that the Army ""did nothing"" to help their son. ""We are totally and utterly heartbroken,"" said Mrs Savage. ""He was my world. He would've done anything for anyone, he was so kind."" But he struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when he left the Army. Brett Savage's parents at his funeral on Friday ""The doctor said that he could be walking down the street and it could be a noise or a smell and it would set him off,"" explained his mother. ""He just couldn't control it. ""When they go back from tours like that, they should have someone who can help them deal with all the emotions, with what they've seen and been through. There's nothing, they're just left. ""I feel very sad for all the ones who are going through all of this and I hope that if what happened to Brett is made public it'll maybe help somebody else and maybe the Army will step back and think of what to do when they're in these situations. ""When they're in the Army, they have their meals at certain times, do things at set times, and once they're out they don't have that. ""They can't cope with all the anger and emotions and what they've been through so they really do need some counselling and help. There is no help."" Veterans' charity Beyond The Battlefield was a huge support for Brett Savage, his family say. ""All the Army do is count Brett like a number,"" his father Noel said. ""When he came back [from war] with the problems, I wouldn't let him go back and all they wanted to do was get him back so he ended up going AWOL."" His father told BBC News NI that he carried ""his demons"" and on bad days he would ""lock himself away and watch Star Wars from start to finish or some movies"". ""That's how he got through those couple of bad days and then he would bounce in to us, asking his mum what there was to eat. ""The demons had gone then, until the next time. ""Unfortunately they kept coming back. ""He just couldn't fathom his demons that he carried, and he carried them big time. Unfortunately they got him in the end. ""We thought he was OK. He did say he would never do what he did."" Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show on Friday, Ulster Unionist MLA and former soldier Doug Beattie spoke about his relationship with Mr Savage. He said his death was ""devastating"" and that suicide was not just a problem in the military, but was ""societal"". Mr Beattie said he had served together with him in the Royal Irish Regiment in Afghanistan, and Mr Savage was later under his command as an army reservist in Belfast. ""He was a young, fit man, a good-looking guy. Really enjoyed life, had many friends. Was sociable, personable. A really great soldier. Kind hearted,"" he said. ""I also saw how the demons were affecting him, I saw how his mental health degraded over time. We attempted at times to try and give him help. ""You always think: 'Was there one more thing that I could do? Could I have reached out to him for a cup of coffee? Could I give him a phone call?' ""There will be people out there who knew Brett who will be saying exactly the same as me."" Mr Beattie said the possibility of the minister of defence working with the families of soldiers to help facilitate their return from combat was something that should be considered. In 2016, Brett Savage took part in aBBC NI radio documentary Losing the Battle. The programme examined some of the mental health challenges facing many young soldiers in Northern Ireland after they returned from recent wars. The then 29-year-old reflected on his own post-war struggles after his military service with the Royal Irish Regiment in Afghanistan ended. He said: ""I didn't expect my life to be like this now. Never. You know, I can't sleep and stuff. Stupid things remind me of things."" Johnny Mercer, the Minister for Defence, People and Veterans, said he was ""deeply saddened"" by Mr Savage's death. ""PTSD is a serious and debilitating condition. There is a range of help available, and I am determined to do all I can to make sure that veterans know where they can turn to in times of need."" The Ministry of Defence said it would be inappropriate to comment further until the coroner had concluded their investigation. Brett Savage's funeral took place in Newtownards The chief executive officer of Beyond the Battlefield, a Northern Ireland-based veterans' charity which supported Mr Savage, described his death as ""untimely"". Annemarie Hastings said Mr Savage had initially come to the charity seeking help and proceeded to assist the charity by reaching out to other veterans who were struggling after their military service ended. His funeral service took place in Newtownards on Friday, not far from the local war memorial. Floral tributes have been placed at the memorial, one of them remembering Brett Savage as ""a warrior"".

'Scotland jumped the gun on Greece quarantine'UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also claims adding Portugal to the self-isolation list did not take all data into account.Scotland,"This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has admitted differences in UK quarantine rules are ""confusing"" for travellers UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has claimed Scotland ""jumped the gun"" by adding Greece to the quarantine list. On Wednesday, the Scottish governmentmoved Greece to the list of countries from where returning travellers have to self isolate for 14 days. The Scottish government said its decisions on quarantine measures for travellers were based on the scientific evidence available. It said judgements were made on how best to keep people in Scotland safe. Mr Shapps also said that adding Portugal to the list had caused ""confusion"" and that Scotland and Wales had not taken the latest data into consideration. Quarantine for travellers coming from Portugal begins at 04:00 on Saturday. French Polynesia was also added to the list from 04:00 the same day. Speaking on theBBC's Today programme, Mr Shapps said: ""On Wednesday the Scots - without using the joint bio-security centre data for this particular decision - decided that people from Greece would be excluded, and jumped the gun on that. ""It is their right to do it but it doesn't make the overall message any clearer."" The quarantine rule for travellers coming to Scotland from Greece came into force at 04:00 on Thursday. The ruling also affects those coming in to English airports from those countries on the list, before travelling to Scotland. Mr Shapps said ""ideally"" the UK government would try to co-ordinate with the other administrations on travel announcements but that this week ""it didn't work out"". The UK is now split on its rules for Portugal. Quarantine for Welsh travellers began at 04:00 on Friday, Scots have to self-isolate from 04:00 on Saturday and English returners are not subject to any requirements to self isolate. Portugal, Greece and French Polynesia are still on England and Northern Ireland's lists of travel corridors. Mr Shapps also claimed that the Scottish and Welsh governments may have made decisions on Portugal without seeing all the data. He said: ""The Welsh administration had not noticed or not seen a second figure which is the percentage number of cases which test positive. That is really important because what we don't want to do is exclude countries for doing the right thing in carrying out lots of tests. ""When we brought Portugal into the travel corridor they had a test positivity rate of 1.8% but this week it was 1.6%, so the number had fallen."" He described Portugal as being on a ""borderline"", adding that ""the opinion of England and Northern Ireland is that it did not justify quarantine this week"". The seven-day infection rate in Portugal has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. 'My mother wanted one last holiday to Portugal' Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? A seven-day rate of 20 per 100,000 is the threshold above which the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Holidaymakers have only been able to travel from Scotland to Portugal without quarantine restrictions since 22 August, when it was added to thegovernment ""exemptions"" list.,external The Scottish government said that sometimes its decisions differed from those made by the other three governments. A spokeswoman said: ""In the case of Greece, we had a worrying number of people in Scotland who tested positive for Covid-19 and who had returned from Greece within seven days of the onset of symptoms. We could not afford to ignore that growing threat to public health. ""In the case of Portugal, it was unfortunate that the UK government announced their decision yesterday before ministers from England, Scotland and Northern Ireland met and before considering the latest Joint Biosecurity Centre data. This indicated a significant rise in both the prevalence of the virus in Portugal and in test positivity."" The quarantine developments have been criticised by leading figures in the aviation industry, who have comparedjob losses in the industry to the demise of the coal industry in the 1980s. Mike Tibbert, vice president of Scottish Passenger Agents' Association (SPAA) accused the Scottish government of playing games, with its ""half announcements and teasers"" He said: ""The entire travel sector and the travelling public need consistency and clear, well timed messaging. ""But the toing and froing on the safe list versus quarantine is actually distracting from the main issue which is the total lack of immediate support for the travel sector and the complete absence of a strategic plan to save future travel. ""Once lost, our connectivity to the rest of the world - and consequently theirs to us - will disappear."" IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

"'Huge explosion' as fire rages at industrial unitAbout 200 people are evacuated from the area and residents say they heard ""two massive bangs"".Kent","People living nearby described hearing a ""huge explosion"" and said ""the whole place shook"" A large fire has broken out in an industrial building and people have been evacuated from the nearby area.

White US professor says she lied about being black,"A US academic whose work focuses on Africa and the African diaspora has said she lied about being black. Jessica Krug, an associate professor at George Washington University (GWU), admitted that she was in fact a white Jewish woman from Kansas City. ""I have built my life on a violent anti-Black lie,"" a blog post written under Ms Krug's name read. The university said it was investigating the blog post but would not comment further. Ms Krug's case, which has drawn surprise and condemnation from those who know her, bears strong parallels to Rachel Dolezal, a white race activist who claimed to be black. Ms Dolezal first made headlines in 2015 when her parents outed her as white. The former civil rights activist and African studies instructor had kept up the pretence of being African American for years, but said she ""identified as black"". Race activist Rachel Dolezal: 'I identify as black' 'Transracial' woman's son resents her choices This video can not be played Rachel Dolezal told the BBC that ""the idea of race is a lie"" Writing in a Medium post published on Thursday,Jessica Krug said she had falsely assumed identities ""that I had no right to claim,external: first North African Blackness, then US rooted Blackness, then Caribbean rooted Bronx Blackness"". ""To an escalating degree over my adult life, I have eschewed my lived experience as a white Jewish child,"" she wrote. She described this behaviour as ""the very epitome of violence, of thievery and appropriation, of the myriad ways in which non-Black people continue to use and abuse Black identities and cultures"", adding that she had continued the pretence even in her personal relationships. She blamed her lies on mental health issues and trauma experienced in her early years, although she said this was not an excuse for her actions. Her academic work, including the 2018 book ""Fugitive Modernities: Kisama and the Politics of Freedom"", focuses on the politics and culture of African and African diaspora societies. According to media reports, Ms Krug also used the name Jessica La Bombalera as an activist. In one video posted earlier this year, she berated white New Yorkers for failing to ""yield their time for Black and Brown indigenous New Yorkers"". GWU, where Ms Krug teaches courses in African, Caribbean and diaspora history, says it is ""aware"" of Ms Krug's Medium post and is ""looking into the situation"". Ms Krug's confession has been met with astonishment and anger, with fellow academics, students and friends making their feelings known online and in interviews. Ms Krug's post did not give a reason for her decision to admit her deception, nor its timing. However, screenwriter Hari Ziyad said her admission came ""because she had been found out"". ""Jess Krug... is someone I called a friend up until this morning when she gave me a call admitting to everything written here. She didn't do it out of benevolence,""he wrote on Twitter,external. Black Latino scholars had recently started to confront Ms Krug and ask questions about her background, according to Yomaira Figueroa, an associate professor of diaspora studies at Michigan State University. ""There was no witch hunt, but there was a need to draw the line,""she wrote in a Twitter thread,external. ""Krug got ahead of the story because she was caught."" Yarimar Bonilla, professor of anthropology and Puerto Rican studies at Hunter College,wrote on Twitter,externalthat she had been ""fooled"" by Ms Krug but always suspected ""something was off with her"". ""In that sense, she did gaslight us,"" Ms Bonilla wrote. ""Not only into thinking she was a WOC [woman of colour] but also into thinking we were somehow both politically and intellectually inferior."" A student at GWU, 21-year-old Aria Sakona, said she was ""shocked"" and ""perplexed"" by the academic's admission. She said she was due to start Ms Krug's class on Latin American history on Monday. ""It just breaks my heart that these students came in, very bright-eyed and eager, to learn about Latin heritage and the history,""Ms Sakona told the Washington Post,external.

Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece?,"More than 50 countries had suspended routes to the UK because of the rapid spread of a new variant of Covid, but some of them have now lifted those restrictions. On 24 December, theUK banned travel from South Africaamid concerns over another new strain of the virus linked to that country. People who have transited through South Africa in the past 10 days will also be banned. However, UK and Irish nationals as well as the UK visa holders and permanent residents are exempt, but they will have to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. It had already been pretty difficult to travel abroad - because of quarantine rules either at your destination or when returning to the UK. Here are some of the requirements currently in place. EU countries held discussions on Tuesday and decided to lift the compete travel ban, allowing national citizens, foreign residents and key workers to travel from the UK to their home country, if they have a negative Covid test. But EU countries are free to set their own rules on border controls, so the exact rules vary from country to country. France:French citizens, British nationals living in France and hauliers are among those able to travel again - if they have had a recent negative test. Rapid ""lateral flow"" tests  - which give results in about 30 minutes - will be accepted. Netherlands: Anyone arriving from the UK will need to have had a so-called PCR test to enter. These can take more than 24 hours to turn around, as they need to be processed in a lab. Belgium: Between 23 and 31 December, only those who are resident in Belgium, Belgian citizens and a limited number of strictly necessary journeys will be allowed from the UK. No prior test is necessary, but there will be strict controls on the Passenger Locator form and a quarantine of 7 days, followed by a compulsory PCR test. Spain: Flights from Britain have been stopped until further notice, except for those carrying Spanish citizens or people with Spanish residency. Travellers have to present a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. Italy: Only Italian citizens will be allowed to return from the UK, along with those who urgently need to enter the country. They will have to have a PCR test before departing and spend two weeks in quarantine in Italy. Germany:Flights and passenger transport by rail, bus and ship is banned until 6 January. From 1 January 2021, transport operators can apply to the German authorities for an exemption to transport people who are resident in Germany. People arriving from the UK will need to either present a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours, or be tested when entering the country. Even with a negative test, travellers will have to self-isolate for 10 days, with the possibility for a test and release after five days Ireland:Passengers arriving by plane or ferry from England, Wales and Scotland are banned until 31 December, regardless of nationality. Essential workers are exempt China:Direct flights to and from the UK have been suspended indefinitely Canada:Passenger flights from the UK were stopped for 72 hours from midnight on Sunday (Monday 05:00 GMT), but on Christmas Eve the measure was extended indefinitely India:All flights from the UK are suspended until 31 December US:New York City has introduced quarantine rules for international travellers, who must stay for 14 days at the address they provided on arrival. Arrivals from the UK will be checked on by sheriff's deputies This isnot a complete list of countries, as so many have taken measures. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office hasupdates on the latest advice for UK travellers,externalto other countries. Many restrictions in place to limit the spread of coronavirus mean travel options are limited. InEngland, people who live in a tier four ""stay at home"" area or a tier three ""very high alert"" area have been told to avoid travel, including overnight stays, unless it is necessary. InWales, people can only travel internationally for essential reasons. From December 28, Wales will go in to a lockdown, meaning people should only leave their area for essential reasons. InNorthern Ireland, people have been told to ""avoid all unnecessary travel"" from 26 December, when a six-week lockdown starts. InScotland, people living in higher risk level three or four areas should avoid unnecessary travel. Most people arriving in the UK from many destinations - including British nationals - must quarantine for 10 days. Exceptions are made for the Common Travel Area - the Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - or people coming from countries in travel corridors with the UK. It means there have been only a small number of destinations with no restrictions at either end. What are the Covid regulations where you live? There are hopes that the newcoronavirus vaccineswill make travel to more destinations possible in the coming months. People arriving in England can now cut their quarantine period by at least half if they pay for a private Covid test after five days and it comes back negative. But the government will only allow certain test providers to take part in the scheme, and they havestruggled under the weight of demand. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also suggested rapid testing - which can give a result in under an hour - could eventually""open the way"" for quarantine-free travel.

Deflated tyre 'caused YouTuber's e-scooter crash',"Emily Hartridge had built up a large social media presence on YouTube and Instagram A YouTuber killed in an e-scooter crash lost control due to an underinflated tyre, a coroner has concluded. TV presenter Emily Hartridge, 35, died instantly from multiple traumatic injuries when she was thrown under a lorry in Battersea. Dr Fiona Wilcox said the scooter being ""unsuitably driven, too fast"" and the lack of air in the tyre had caused the crash. A record of inquest document seen by the BBC said the death was accidental. Ms Hartridge, from Hambledon in Hampshire, was believed to have been the first person in the UK to be killed in a crash involving an e-scooter. Her ""10 Reasons Why"" videos on sex, relationships, love, gender and mental health, reached a YouTube audience of more than 354,000 subscribers. She was on her way to a fertility clinic when she died near Queenstown Road roundabout on 12 July 2019. The fatal crash happened at the junction of Queenstown Road and Queen's Circus When can I ride an e-scooter legally? The inquest into her death was held remotely at Westminster Coroner's Court due to the coronavirus pandemic. In her conclusions, senior coroner Dr Wilcox wrote: ""Ms Hartridge was riding an electric scooter on Queenstown Road when she lost control after passing over an inspector hatch in the cycle lane and was thrown under the path of an HGV. ""She died instantly of injuries sustained by the HGV driving over her. ""The scooter was being unsuitably driven, too fast and with an underinflated tyre and this caused the loss of control and her death."" Ms Hartridge's boyfriend Jake Hazell had bought the scooter for her as a present. In February, he told the BBC he regretted buying it and said he was constantly reminded of her death as he ""sees them on the road all the time"". Mr Hazell also said he did not blame the lorry driver for her death. This video can not be played Jake Hazell said earlier this year he wanted to speak openly about his mental health struggles since his girlfriend died Mr Hazell said: ""For those who knew Emily she was just incredible - such an amazing person to be around and to call her my girlfriend was literally the best I felt in my life. ""But what she has taught me has got me through. I feel close to her, I still do the Instagram, still do the YouTube and continue her message that it is OK to have a tough time."" When can I ride an e-scooter legally? Nearly 100 e-scooter users stopped in one week Inflatable e-scooter that fits in backpack unveiled At the time of Ms Hartridge's accident, e-scooters were illegal to ride in the UK - unless on private land with landowner's permission. But, on 1 August rental e-scooters became legal on roads in Great Britain in a bid to ease pressure on public transport amid the coronavirus crisis. Guidance for e-scooter-for-hire firms was published by the Department for Transport (DfT) - but under the new rules the vehicles were still banned on pavements, would be limited to 15.5mph and it was recommended riders wore helmets. The Met Police said nobody had been arrested over Ms Hartridge's death. By BBC London's transport correspondent Tom Edwards The use of privately-owned e-scooters in London is illegal on public roads, but if you stand on any street corner it won't be long before you see them. E-scooter usage has overtaken the regulation and many are of poor quality. But policy is shifting - the government is allowing trials, in some areas like Milton Keynes, of rental e-scooters that means there are minimum safety standards and requirements. It won't be long before those trials end up in London with many of the big operators jostling for that contract. If those trials are deemed successful - who knows?

Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life,"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is in a coma in a Berlin hospital, and Germany has revealed he was poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent. He was taken ill on board a return flight from Siberia to Moscow and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk. Two days later Russian officials were persuaded to let him be airlifted to Germany. BBC Russian has pieced together the story of how flight attendants and medics fought to save his life over the skies of Siberia. This is the dramatic two-hour timeline of that perilous journey. It was 20 August, and Alexei Navalny was taking an S7 airlines flight from Tomsk to Moscow. He didn't eat or drink anything all morning - apart from a cup of tea he bought at Tomsk Bogashevo airport, according to his press secretary Kira Yarmysh. Ilya Ageev took a photo of a smiling Alexei Navalny at Tomsk airport Another passenger on the flight, Ilya Ageev, saw Mr Navalny drinking the tea about an hour before the plane was due to take off. The Kremlin critic was smiling and joking with fellow passengers who recognised him. During the first half hour of the flight, Mr Navalny started to feel unwell. Flight attendants were handing water out to passengers, but he turned it down. He then got up to go to the toilet. Another passenger tried to use the toilet at the same time, but Alexei Navalny was inside for about 20 minutes. A queue began to form outside the door. By now all four flight attendants on board were aware one of their passengers was unwell. Minutes later, a flight attendant made an announcement asking if any doctors were on board. The other passengers now realised the situation was serious. The rest of the cabin crew informed the pilot and tried to administer first aid to Mr Navalny. His assistant, Ilya Pakhomov, walked down the aisle appealing for medical assistance. A woman, who hasn't been identified, came forward to say she was a nurse. For the next hour she and the flight attendants focused on keeping Mr Navalny conscious until the pilot could make an emergency landing, according to S7 airlines. Sergey Nezhenets, a lawyer, was sitting in the back row close to where Mr Navalny was being treated. He was due to transfer in Moscow before flying on to Krasnodar in southern Russia. ""I started paying attention to what was going on when a flight attendant asked for medical professionals on board to come forward,"" Mr Nezhenets told the BBC. ""A few minutes later, the pilot announced we would be landing in Omsk, because a passenger was unwell. I only realised the passenger in question was Navalny after we landed, when I checked Twitter and saw his spokeswoman's posts. ""A few minutes after the call-out for a doctor, Alexei started moaning and screaming. He was clearly in pain. He was lying on the floor in the part of the plane reserved for cabin crew. He wasn't saying any words - he was just screaming."" That was when a nurse went forward to offer medical assistance, he explains. ""I don't know what they were doing, I didn't see,"" he says. ""But I heard them keep on saying 'Alexei, drink, drink, Alexei, breathe!' ""When he was moaning, the rest of us felt better, in a way because we could tell he was at least still alive. I stress, at that point I didn't know it was Navalny."" Two of Mr Navalny's assistants were standing nearby; one was his press secretary Kira Yarmysh. ""She was very nervous,"" Mr Nezhenets says. ""The medic asked her what had happened to him, and Kira said: 'I don't know, he was probably poisoned'."" The crew moved fast to ask permission for an emergency landing at Omsk, the airline says, and it was given immediately. It took little more than 30 minutes for the plane to land after passengers were told there would be an emergency landing. But the cabin crew ""kept checking the windows and complaining that, because it was so cloudy, it was taking longer to land while Alexei was so unwell."" The lawyer heard retching noises as they urged him to drink. Omsk airport's chief doctor, Vasily Sidorus, has refused to confirm or deny this. All he would say was ""There was everything."" Had they suspected food poisoning, the crew may have tried to, says Israeli intensive care expert Mikhail Fremderman. ""But that wouldn't have helped in a case of poisoning with organophosphorus compounds, which is what the Germans are now talking about."" And if Mr Navalny's food or drink had been poisoned, throwing up would have posed a risk to those offering him medical assistance, as well as those cleaning up the plane later. At 09:01 Omsk time, the plane landed. Medical staff at the airport boarded the plane just two minutes after landing. As soon as they had examined Mr Navalny, the medics said ""this is not a case for us - he needs intensive care"", Mr Nezhenets recalls. He then heard one of the medical staff phoning for an ICU ambulance. They asked for it to drive straight on to the landing area, saying that the patient was in a serious condition. He then heard a medic explaining over the phone what colour the plane was and telling the driver to park close to the steps. ""We waited for another 10 minutes for the ambulance to arrive,"" he says. ""During this time, the doctors took Navalny's blood pressure and gave him an intravenous drip - but I think it was clear to them that it was of no use."" Dr Sidorus says he did not treat Alexei Navalny personally, but that his colleagues did their best to save his life. ""It was hard to understand what was going on, as he could not speak,"" he says. ""They did everything they had to do, saved a man's life and made sure he was transferred to an appropriate hospital."" Passengers we spoke to believe the medics spent about 15 to 20 minutes examining Mr Navalny on board the plane. He was then taken off the plane and his stretcher loaded into an ambulance, which drove straight to Omsk Emergency Hospital No 1. The plane was re-fuelled and, after another half an hour, continued its journey to Moscow, Mr Nezhenets told the BBC. ""When we landed at Moscow Domodedovo airport, several policemen and plain-clothed men entered the plane. ""They asked passengers seated in the rows closest to where Alexei had been sitting to stay, while the rest were free to go. Alexei had been sitting somewhere in the centre of the plane, row 10 or 11."" It seemed strange to have police come on board. ""At that point, the case did not look criminal. And yet, here was the security service."" For two days, the hospital in Omsk kept Mr Navalny in its acute poisoning department. Initially they would not allow him to be flown to Germany, citing his unstable condition. However, on 22 August, he was airlifted to the CharitÃ© clinic in Berlin and two days later German doctors said their tests showed he had been poisoned. Doctors in Omsk, including the chief doctor of the Emergency Hospital No 1 and the chief toxicologist, insisted that no poisonous substances had been detected in Mr Navalny's body when he was under their care. They said a metabolic disorder was one potential, alternative diagnosis. BBC Russian has asked Omsk health authorities for a comment and a detailed account of Navalny's hospital stay, but has not received a reply.

Coronavirus: Italy ex-PM Berlusconi in hospital,"Berlusconi dominated Italian politics in the 1990s Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, aged 83, is in hospital with early-stage double pneumonia after testing positive for coronavirus, Italian media report. He spent the night in hospital in Milan for checks, having tested positive on Wednesday. Earlier his right-wing Forza Italia party said his condition was not a cause for concern, and ""he is fine"". The media tycoon's partner and two of his children also tested positive. Berlusconi has been in self-isolation with his 30-year-old partner, the Forza Italia MP Marta Fascina, at his villa in Arcore near Milan, after holidaying in Sardinia. The infection rate in Sardinia - famous for its Emerald Coast beaches - is higher than in much of Italy. ""A small precautionary hospitalisation was needed to monitor the progress of Covid-19 but he is fine,"" said Forza Italia senator Licia Ronzulli. Last month Berlusconi was at Villa Certosa, his luxury villa in Sardinia Berlusconi was transferred to an isolation ward at San Raffaele Hospital on Thursday night. Double pneumonia - inflammation of both lungs - is a common complication with Covid patients. The disease is generally more severe among the elderly and those with other medical conditions. Silvio Berlusconi: Italy's perpetual powerbroker Blue dress upstages Italy's macho politicians Virus already in Italy in December, study finds Berlusconi, a billionaire who used to own AC Milan football team, remains popular in Italy and he has had many messages of support since being diagnosed. In 2014 he was ordered to do a year of community service after being convicted of tax fraud. His business deals have long been under scrutiny, as have his romantic liaisons, including reports of raunchy""bunga bunga"" parties. Berlusconi addressed party activists in Genoa by phone on Thursday, saying ""I'm continuing to work as best I can on the current election campaign"". Separately, he said he did not know how he had caught the virus. Italy will hold regional elections on 21-22 September, which had to be postponed at the height of the pandemic in Italy in spring. Italy has introduced swab tests for people arriving on the mainland from Sardinia Last month Berlusconi hosted businessman Flavio Briatore at his luxury Sardinia residence, Villa Certosa. Mr Briatore, who tested positive for coronavirus in late August, owns a nightclub on the island called Billionaire and used to run the Benetton Formula One racing team. Berlusconi served as Italian prime minister four times and last year was elected to the European Parliament. After his conviction for tax fraud he was ejected from the Italian Senate and banned from public office. But later his ban was lifted.

Pret starts five-a-day coffee subscription service,"Pret a Manger is to offer customers up to five coffees a day if they sign up to a monthly subscription service. The chain is hoping that the price tag of Â£20 is low enough to win back some of the business lost in the pandemic. But city centres, saturated with coffee shops, remain relatively deserted as many office workers continue to work from home. Pret has already announced it is closing 30 outlets and laying off a third of its staff. Pret boss Pano Christou told the BBC's Today programme: ""There's no doubt that workers will come into the office less often than beforehand. Pret needs to adapt itself to the changes of customer patterns and that's where we've been very focused."" Although many of the sandwich chain's outlets are in central London, Mr Christou said that 40% of its business was in London suburbs and the home counties, where customers were starting to return ""much more swiftly"". He added that Pret had seen its delivery business grow tenfold through the coronavirus crisis. The coffee and sandwich chain is launching YourPret Barista next week as part of new digital strategy which it hopes will help revive its fortunes. Briony Raven, Pret's director of coffee and packaging, said the scheme aimed to help persuade customers to see Pret as the default choice, in the same way they do other subscription services such as Netflix. ""It's Pret's way of doing loyalty,"" she said. ""It's about giving people an easy choice, when they come back into their everyday routine."" Pret A Manger to cut a third of UK workforce Warnings of 'ghost towns' if offices stay empty Costa Coffee warns up to 1,650 jobs at risk For the fixed monthly fee a customer can select any ""barista prepared"" drink from a skinny soya latte to a smoothie, using their phone to access the subscription, up to five times a day, seven days a week. To prevent misuse by anyone planning to get in a round of coffees for their friends and colleagues, each drink must be collected 30 minutes apart. Consumer expert Kate Hardcastle said the Â£20 fee, with a month's free introductory trial, was an ""impressively low-ball offer"", illustrating how desperate retailers are to win people back and build loyalty. ""There has been a significant rise in subscription models over lockdown, everything from socks to gin, so people are into the idea,"" she said. ""But it's not going to be easy to translate to the coffee shop. What was once the daily latte is now interrupted. It may be that trips to the office are only once or twice a week rather than daily. Consumers are also well aware there could be regional lockdowns, which may mean they don't want to commit big amounts upfront."" The scheme appears to be designed around the ""new normal"", at a price that is still attractive even if you're only going to the office twice a week, said Natalie Berg an analyst with NBK retail. ""Pret is betting you'll buy a sandwich with that coffee and it becomes habitual,"" she said. ""Once you become a member of any subscription you want to get value so you use it more, spend more. So if you are a member, it's unlikely you'll go into Starbucks."" The scheme is ""revolutionary"", Ms Berg added, and shows the firm has recognised it needs to be creative in the current circumstances. As well as tempting people back in-store, it paves the way for Pret to offer a range of other services via the new digital platform, allowing it to engage with customers more personally and tailor services according to their spending habits. Pret said it had a number of other innovations in the pipeline, including extending its evening meal offer and deliveries. It has also started selling Pret-branded coffee on Amazon.

'Pivotal moment' as Leeds looks to avoid lockdown,"The infection rate in Leeds has been rising over the last few weeks, officials said Leeds has been added to Public Health England's list as an ""area of concern"" following a rise in coronavirus cases. The latest seven-day infection rate in the city has risen to 32.5 cases per 100,000 people. The city council said being on the list did not mean more restrictions would be brought in immediately. However, it did mean increased monitoring of cases and potential additional steps if the infection rate did not start to fall. Council leader Judith Blake said: ""We have been working tirelessly with our partners and communities, doing everything within our power to keep the spread of this virus under control and to ensure Leeds stays open. ""We completely understand that these past six months have put a tremendous strain on everyone in Leeds and that being able to get out, socialise and enjoy ourselves has provided a massive lift. ""But it is absolutely crucial that if we want to continue to do that, we all do it sensibly and responsibly and follow the latest guidance which is there to keep us all safe,"" she added. What happens if I'm in an area on the watchlist?  More news and stories from Yorkshire The council said many of the cases may be linked to social interaction and leisure activities. The spread was ""broad and changeable across wards"", it said, with increasing numbers detected in young people aged 18-34. Extra Covid-19 restrictions imposed on some other parts of West Yorkshireare being eased. Tattoo artist Nico Pantu said his business had the equipment needed to keep customers safe Local businesses expressed concern over the impact of a potential local lockdown in Leeds. Nico Pantu, owner of Grimm Tattoo Studio, said: ""If Leeds is to go back into lockdown, for us it could be catastrophic. ""Another lockdown would absolutely affect the whole city and most likely leave lasting damage to Leeds and its wide range of independent businesses."" Bar owner Stuart Dixon said it took a month for business to build back up after pubs reopened Stuart Dixon, who owns the Doghouse Bar and 212 Cafe Bar, said: ""My concern is whether it will frighten people off again and ruin footfall for the bars, when we've literally just got back them to a position where we're managing. ""My worry would be if there's a local lockdown, are people going to not go out? That will destroy us. And will there be extra support from the government and council? Probably not. ""It's not their fault but if we have to keep shutting over the next year or so, I'm going to get the point where I'm just not going bother anymore because we'll just accumulate debt and then you end up just working to pay off debt."" West Yorkshire is a densely populated metropolitan county and some parts of it have been subject to restrictions because of coronavirus for a few weeks already. Leeds has escaped these local rules because infection rates weren't high but that's changed. The latest seven-day infection rate,externalshows the city has 29.4 cases per 100,000 people, with 44 new cases on Wednesday, according to council figures. The local authority expected it to be added to Public Health England's weekly watchlist of areas of concern. This doesn't mean any further restrictions at this stage but they could be imminent if infection rates continue to rise. Leeds, unlike neighbouring Bradford, has avoided stricter measures because its infection rates were much lower. However, there were 261 cases in the week up until 30 August, up from 167 in the week up until 23 August. As an area of concern, Leedswould be subject to increased monitoringand could face additional measures if infection rates do not fall. Officers issued seven fines to organisers ofillegal events over the Bank Holiday weekend. Prof Robert West, from University College London's Institute of Epidemiology, was asked whether issues in the city were ""inevitable"" following local outbreaks across West Yorkshire. He said: ""The problem is that this remains a very infectious virus and what that means is that if you're near someone, with someone who has it, there's a good chance you'll get it.""

Last month, the council said it was introducing ""a series of targeted preventative steps"" followinga cluster of cases in parts of Leeds. However the most recent rise is not isolated to specific parts of the city. A range of measures are now to be introduced including additional mobile testing units, door knocking in areas of high prevalence, and officials will work with bars, venues and restaurants to make sure they follow Test and Trace guidelines. Officers injured dispersing illegal gathering Bars shut doors after coronavirus case The authority will also work with West Yorkshire Police and community organisations to discourage gatherings and house parties, as well as working with schools, colleges and universities to try and ensure a safe return to education. People have been urged to follow guidance on social distancing, hand-washing, and wearing face masks while those with symptoms of the virus have been told to stay at home.

'Significant gaps' in UK's Brexit border plans,"This video can not be played Rod McKenzie says the government should ""act now before it's too late"" The UK is ""sleepwalking into a disaster"" over its border plans for the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, road hauliers have warned. Groups representing truckers have written to ministers warning of ""severe"" disruption to supply chains. Rod McKenzie, from the Road Haulage Association, said the government should ""act now before it's too late"". But Boris Johnson said the UK was ""ready for any eventuality"" after the transition period. The government has also given itself powers to build temporary lorry parks in England without local approval. However, Mr McKenzie told BBC News: ""It is a real case of the government sleepwalking to a disaster with the border preparations that we have, whether it is a deal or no-deal Brexit at the end of December. Why Brexit is still a big issue What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Barnier: UK risks no-deal unless it compromises ""The supply chain on which we are all dependent to get the things we need could be disrupted and there is a lack of government focus and action on this."" He added: ""When we are trying to emerge from the crisis of Covid, if we then plunge straight into a Brexit-related crisis, that will be a really difficult moment and we need real pace. ""The difference here is between a disaster area and a disaster area with rocket boosters on."" Labour's shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, said the government ""must urgently come forward with a plan to put workable solutions in place"". Speaking to reporters on Friday, Mr Johnson said: ""We must make sure that people understand at the end of the year, whatever happens, we're leaving the EU, leaving the transition period. ""That's why it is vital that people who have questions about what they need to do get onto our government websites â¦ look at what they need to do to prepare, and certainly, we will help them. ""But we will get through this."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson responds to hauliers predicting Britain is ""sleepwalking into a disaster"" over border checks next year. The UK left the European Union on 31 January, but a transition period - where the UK continues to follow some of the bloc's rules - remains in place until 31 December while the two sides negotiate a trade agreement. However, trade talks have been taking place since March and both sides have complained of little progress being made. If a deal is not agreed and ratified by parliaments by the end of the year, the UK will go into 2021 trading with the bloc on World Trade Organization rules, which critics fear cause issues at the border. In a letter to the Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove,seen by Bloomberg,external, eight logistics organisations - including the Road Haulage Association - raised concerns over IT systems, the funding to train up customs agents and the pace of physical infrastructure being built. They asked for an ""urgent roundtable meeting"" with Mr Gove, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Transport Secretary Grants Shapps, saying supply chain must be protected ahead of a potential second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Shapps said he regularly met the Road Haulage Association and wanted to reassure them ""planning for the end of the transition period hasn't stopped"" during the coronavirus outbreak. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he ""could not pre-empt the outcome"" of trade talks with the EU, which he conceded created ""some uncertainty"". But, he said the government had kept supply changes going throughout the pandemic and ""we are absolutely confident we will do that again in the future"". Analysis by Sebastien Ash, BBC political analyst On 1 January 2021, the way that UK businesses trade with the EU will fundamentally change. It'll mean new hurdles for traders to clear, including the need to fill in customs declarations - forms with detailed information on goods being imported and exported. For the first six months of this new era - and whatever the outcome of the negotiations between the UK and the EU - goods entering the UK will not have to complete these processes, as they normally would, at the border. Instead, the government is giving businesses time to file their paperwork and pay the duties they owe after the goods have entered the UK. This exceptional measure is designed to mitigate the risk of delays for goods coming into the UK. However, for goods being exported the concern is greater. The EU has said it will impose its normal controls. And on the UK side, key systems to manage the flow of lorries at the UK border and make sure consignments are cleared to proceed to the EU are not up and running. The concern among the industry is that this could lead to lorries being refused entry onto ferries headed for the EU, long tail-backs at the ports through which much of the UK's trade with the EU flows and slow down and disrupt the supply chains between UK and EU businesses. In short, it becomes hard to conduct business as usual if you can't get your goods to the customer. Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation - another of the groups who wrote the letter - acknowledged the government was carrying out work on the necessary systems now. But he said there was ""no time to get these systems in place to actually do the job effectively"". He told BBC News: ""The supply chain leaders will try to do everything they can to avoid shortages on the shelves, but at its worst, at the extreme, these sorts of situations will lead to food shortages."" Earlier this week, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, saidthe UK was risking leaving the transition period without a deal unless it began to compromise. He said he was ""worried and disappointed"" about the lack of concessions from his British counterpart, David Frost, after a trade deal meeting on Tuesday. No 10 said it was ""clear"" that a deal ""will not be easy to achieve"". This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake breaks down the next round of Brexit negotiations The logistics industry letter came as the government gave itself powers to grant emergency planning permission for it to build temporary lorry parks and inspection posts in 29 councils areas across England, without the need for local approval. Giant lorry park branded 'concrete monstrosity' Post-Brexit lorry park trial 'too late' The government said the lorry parks, which can stay in place until the end of 2025, would contribute to ""an orderly transition to the new system of controls to secure the border"" and would help to address the impact coronavirus may have had on port operators' ability to provide the necessary infrastructure themselves, in time for the end of the transition period.

Giant library of online IS propaganda discovered,"Thousands of videos, graphics and other images have been collected together to form a growing propaganda archive One of the largest collections of online material belonging to the group calling itself Islamic State has been discovered by researchers at the Institute of Strategic Dialogue (ISD). The digital library contains more than 90,000 items and has an estimated 10,000 unique visitors a month. Experts say it provides a way to continually replenish extremist content on the net. But taking it down is difficult because the data is not stored in one place. And despite counter-terrorism authorities in Britain and the US having been alerted to this growing repository, it continues to grow. This video can not be played WATCH: Islamic State group's online propaganda library The discovery came after the death of the prominent IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in October 2019. At the time, many social media posts supporting the organisation contained a short link. It led researchers to documents and videos in nine different languages. They included details of attacks, including those on Manchester Arena on 22 May 2017, in London on 7 July 2005 and in the US on 11 September 2001. ""[There's] everything you need to know to plan and carry out an attack,"" said ISD deputy director Moustafa Ayad, who discovered the archive. ""Things that teach you how to be a better terrorist essentially."" This graphic relate to the London bombings in July 2005 The ISD named the library the Caliphate Cache. For months the institute's researchers have studied how it evolves, how it is being administered and who is visiting it. The data is spread across a decentralised system, rather than a single computer server. Anyone can share the content across the web, via servers based at multiple locations. And this hampers any effort to take it offline. But as long as the Caliphate Cache remains live, it aids IS by providing a means to continuously seed out content. The material is added to social-media comments pages and spread via bot accounts. Another technique has been to target Twitter accounts linked to celebrities and athletes. For example, IS hijacked an account belonging to a fan of the pop singer Justin Bieber and used it to promote material from the cache. This image was posted within a tweet from a compromised Justin Bieber fan account In another case, the group managed to fool the English rugby team's account into following one of its own by masquerading as a supporter. ""They understand how not just to game platforms, they understand the power of the content that is contained within the Caliphate Cache,"" Mr Ayad said. Not all the cache's content is violent. Visitors also encounter philosophies of IS, religious texts and propagandised versions of what an IS lifestyle looks like. The researchers say this includes material runaway brides such as Shamima Begum would have seen. Most of those drawn to the Caliphate Cache are 18- to 24-year-old males in the Arab world, with 40% of the traffic coming from social media, largely via YouTube. The ISD has also discovered the Caliphate Cache is not unique. There are smaller repositories belonging to other extremist groups, many of which are also using decentralised platforms. The library of material available for IS accounts to draw on continues to grow ""The attraction for jihadists of these platforms is that the developers of these decentralised platforms have no way of acting against content that is stored on user-operated servers or content that's shared across a dispersed network of users, "" BBC Monitoring senior jihadi specialist Mina Al-Lami said. ""It's really all about privacy, freedom and encryption. ""That's what attracts jihadists."" The researchers have alerted the US Attorney's Office for Eastern District of New York, which prosecutes counter-terrorism cases, as well as the Met Police. The authorities in New York have not commented. But the Met acknowledged receiving the referral and said it was being assessed by specialist officers.

"HS2 project work begins with pledge of 22,000 jobsWork on the controversial rail line formally starts on Friday, with Boris Johnson saying it will ""fire up growth"".","The Prime Minister visited an HS2 construction site on Friday Construction work on HS2 officially begins on Friday, with companies behind the controversial high-speed rail project expecting to create 22,000 jobs in the next few years. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said HS2 would ""fire up economic growth and help to rebalance opportunity"". He endorsed the rail link in February, withformal government approval granted in Aprildespite lockdown. But critics said HS2 will also cost jobs, and vowed to continue protesting. HS2 is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. It is hoped the 20-year project will reduce passenger overcrowding and help rebalance the UK's economy through investment in transport links outside London. HS2 Ltd chief executive Mark Thurston said the reality of high-speed journeys between Britain's biggest cities had moved a step closer. When the project was mooted in 2009, it was expected to cost an estimated Â£37.5bn and when the official price tag was set out in the 2015 Budget it came in at just under Â£56bn. Butan official government report has since warnedthat it could cost more than Â£100bn and be up to five years behind schedule. Some critics of HS2 describe it as a ""vanity project"" and say the money would be better spent on better connections between different parts of northern England. Others, such asthe Stop HS2 pressure group,external, say it will cause considerable environmental damage. When will HS2 open and how much will it cost? The prime minister said HS2 was at the heart of government plans to ""build back better"" and would form ""the spine of our country's transport network"". ""But HS2's transformational potential goes even further,"" he added. ""By creating hundreds of apprenticeships and thousands of skilled jobs, HS2 will fire up economic growth and help to rebalance opportunity across this country for years to come."" HS2's main works contractor for the West Midlands, the Balfour Beatty Vinci Joint Venture, has said it expects to be one of the biggest recruiters in the West Midlands over the next two years. Up to 7,000 skilled jobs would be required to complete its section of the HS2 route, it said, with women and under-25s the core focus for recruitment and skills investment. Other firms hiring include: Another joint venture partner, EKFB, said it would recruit more than 4,000 people over the next two years for its section from Long Itchington Wood site in Warwickshire south to the Chiltern tunnel portals Skanska Costain Strabag, Balfour Beatty Vinci Systra, Align JV and Mace Dragados JV, based in Greater London, will collectively recruit more than 10,000 HS2 Ltd itself is already directly recruiting for 500 new roles over the next three months, with the majority based in Birmingham. HS2 Ltd's Mr Thurston said the railway would be ""transformative"" for the UK. ""With the start of construction, the reality of high speed journeys joining up Britain's biggest cities in the North and Midlands and using that connectivity to help level up the country has just moved a step closer,"" he added. Special tunnelling machines will be needed for sections of the line Campaign group Stop HS2 said Boris Johnson and others who hail the creation of 22,000 jobs are ""rather less keen to mention that HS2 is projected to permanently displace almost that many jobs"". Stop HS2 campaign manager Joe Rukin said: ""Trying to spin HS2 as a job creation scheme is beyond desperate. Creating 22,000 jobs works out at almost Â£2m just to create a single job."" But speaking on the BBC's Breakfast programme, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps disputed those figures. ""I can't see how there's an argument that making it easier to get about this country is somehow going to destroy jobs, quite the opposite in fact.  It's clearly going to make the economy level up"", he said. ""Find those left behind areas, that have found themselves too disconnected before and join it together."" Stop HS2 chairwoman Penny Gaines called the project ""environmentally destructive"" to wildlife: ""This is why there are currently hundreds of activists camped out along the HS2 route. We don't expect them to go away any time soon."" However, the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP), which fights for investment in the regional economy, said such major infrastructure projects are transformative and called for the planned extensions of HS2 to be started as soon as possible. ""Increasing capacity on the North's rail network and better connecting our towns and cities will be vital in the economic regeneration of the Northern Powerhouse - both now and long in the future,"" said Henri Murison, director of the NPP. This is an important symbolic move for HS2, but in the real world it changes very little. Work preparing for the new line - demolishing buildings and clearing sites for example - has already been going on for the past three years. And in some areas, construction work has also begun. But the arguments over whether or not the railway should actually be built are continuing to rage. The government has long insisted that it will help re-balance the country's economy, by promoting investment outside London. It now says the jobs created by the scheme will support the post-Covid recovery. But opponents claim that lockdown has undermined the case for HS2 - by showing how easily people can work remotely, and how little business travel is really needed. Same dispute, new arguments. But now shovels are - officially - in the ground. The government has also defended itself against criticism that the new line will no longer be needed, as people travel less as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Shapps acknowledged more people are working at home, but said the government was looking at the country's long term transport needs: ""We're not building this for what happens over the next couple of years or even the next 10 years, whilst we're building it.  We're building this, as with the west coast and the east coast main lines, for 150 years and still going strong. ""I think it actually shows a lot of faith in the future of this country,"" he added.

Deflated tyre 'caused Youtuber's e-scooter crash',"Emily Hartridge had built up a large social media presence on YouTube and Instagram A YouTuber killed in an e-scooter crash lost control due to an underinflated tyre, a coroner has concluded. TV presenter Emily Hartridge, 35, died instantly from multiple traumatic injuries when she was thrown under a lorry in Battersea. Dr Fiona Wilcox said the scooter being ""unsuitably driven, too fast"" and the lack of air in the tyre had caused the crash. A record of inquest document seen by the BBC said the death was accidental. Ms Hartridge, from Hambledon in Hampshire, was believed to have been the first person in the UK to be killed in a crash involving an e-scooter. Her ""10 Reasons Why"" videos on sex, relationships, love, gender and mental health, reached a YouTube audience of more than 354,000 subscribers. She was on her way to a fertility clinic when she died near Queenstown Road roundabout on 12 July 2019. The fatal crash happened at the junction of Queenstown Road and Queen's Circus When can I ride an e-scooter legally? The inquest into her death was held remotely at Westminster Coroner's Court due to the coronavirus pandemic. In her conclusions, senior coroner Dr Wilcox wrote: ""Ms Hartridge was riding an electric scooter on Queenstown Road when she lost control after passing over an inspector hatch in the cycle lane and was thrown under the path of an HGV. ""She died instantly of injuries sustained by the HGV driving over her. ""The scooter was being unsuitably driven, too fast and with an underinflated tyre and this caused the loss of control and her death."" Ms Hartridge's boyfriend Jake Hazell had bought the scooter for her as a present. In February, he told the BBC he regretted buying it and said he was constantly reminded of her death as he ""sees them on the road all the time"". Mr Hazell also said he did not blame the lorry driver for her death. This video can not be played Jake Hazell said earlier this year he wanted to speak openly about his mental health struggles since his girlfriend died Mr Hazell said: ""For those who knew Emily she was just incredible - such an amazing person to be around and to call her my girlfriend was literally the best I felt in my life. ""But what she has taught me has got me through. I feel close to her, I still do the Instagram, still do the YouTube and continue her message that it is OK to have a tough time."" When can I ride an e-scooter legally? Nearly 100 e-scooter users stopped in one week Inflatable e-scooter that fits in backpack unveiled At the time of Ms Hartridge's accident, e-scooters were illegal to ride in the UK - unless on private land with landowner's permission. But, on 1 August rental e-scooters became legal on roads in Great Britain in a bid to ease pressure on public transport amid the coronavirus crisis. Guidance for e-scooter-for-hire firms was published by the Department for Transport (DfT) - but under the new rules the vehicles were still banned on pavements, would be limited to 15.5mph and it was recommended riders wore helmets. The Met Police said nobody had been arrested over Ms Hartridge's death. By BBC London's transport correspondent Tom Edwards The use of privately-owned e-scooters in London is illegal on public roads, but if you stand on any street corner it won't be long before you see them. E-scooter usage has overtaken the regulation and many are of poor quality. But policy is shifting - the government is allowing trials, in some areas like Milton Keynes, of rental e-scooters that means there are minimum safety standards and requirements. It won't be long before those trials end up in London with many of the big operators jostling for that contract. If those trials are deemed successful - who knows?

Seventeen injured after Waverley crashes into pierThe paddle steamer was damaged as it collided with the pier at Brodick with more than 200 passengers on board.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Eyewitnesses say the paddle steamer struck the pier A total of 24 people have been injured after the paddle steamer Waverley collided with Brodick Pier in Arran. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said ""a number have been taken to hospital"" following the incident. People stranded in Arran were later due to be returned to the mainland by an emergency sailing of a CalMac ferry. Police, paramedics, coastguards and rescue helicopters were scrambled to the scene after the alarm was raised at about 17:15 on Thursday. MCA said 213 passengers and 26 crew were on board the vessel when it struck the pier. Waverley finally sets sail after two years 'Save the Waverley' appeal launched Cruises cancelled after Waverley crash One passenger, Graham McWilliams, told BBC Scotland'sThe Nineabout the moment of collision. He said: ""As we came into the pier, everything seemed quite normal. ""Then there was a sudden crash, a loud bang, and the boat stopped very quickly. I saw people falling and it was quite distressing."" This video can not be played Waverley crash: 'I saw one lady fly past the window' He added: ""There was a lady that I saw who literally flew past the window."" Mr McWilliams said that, several hours after the accident, passengers were still milling about the ferry terminal at Brodick. He said it was unclear if they would be able to leave the island or whether accommodation could be found for them. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson later tweeted to sayarrangements had been made for CalMac to operate an emergency sailing,externalto take the Waverley passengers back to the mainland. Rita McLeod, who was waiting to board the Waverley, said she saw people being taken away in ambulances. ""We were actually queued up waiting to get in when it crashed,"" she said. ""It came in bow first. It came in far too fast."" ""We saw a lot of people falling, a few people fell over. There were people taken away in ambulances. ""We saw a lot of people, pretty badly shaken, coming off."" The ship was due to into Brodick at about 17.00 after leaving Greenock in the morning. A fire engine and other emergency services were visible from the terminal building Another eyewitness saw the crash from the departure terminal as she waited to board. Anne Cochrane from Bishopbriggs near Glasgow, said: ""It just crashed into the pier when it was coming back from the Holy Isle. We're just stuck in the departure terminal. We've had no information."" The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has been informed of the incident. The Waverley has just returned to service after undergoing repairs The Waverleyset sail for the first time in two years less than two weeks ago, an event which was itself delayed due to an ""unexpected technical and administration issue"". The ship, described as the world's last seagoing paddle steamer, missed the 2019 season as it waited for urgent repairs. A funding appeal was launched in June 2019 and it hit its target in December after receiving a Â£1m grant from the Scottish government to help with the restoration.

LiveLiveNew Zealand records first Covid-19 death in monthsLive New Zealand records first Covid-19 death in months,"Russia's Sputnik V vaccine produced antibodies without ""serious adverse effects"" in early trials, the Lancet reports Researchers say longer and larger trials are needed to prove it safe and effective The number of new daily UK cases rises to 1,940 - the highest since the end of May France sees a record rise in new infections with 8,975 reported A man in his 50s is the first to die with coronavirus in New Zealand since May, health officials say Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 83, is in hospital in Milan with coronavirus Passengers returning to Wales from Portugal, Gibraltar and six Greek Islands now have to self-isolate for two weeks Globally more than 23.6 million cases and 868,000 deaths have been confirmed, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Lauren Turner Today's live coverage was edited by Lauren Turner and Jasmine Taylor-Colemen, and our team of writers was: Jo Couzens, Penny Spiller, Yaroslav Lukov, Paul Kirby and Victoria Lindrea.

Thanks for staying with us! Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Early results from small trials on a Russian vaccine against
Covid-19 have found it is safe and there were no serious side-effects in
people. âEncouragingâ and âso far so goodâ are some of the reactions
from scientists in the UK â but there is still, clearly, a long way to go. Two small trials, with 38 people in each, were carried out
in two hospitals in Russia. Although the vaccine showed an antibody response in all
participants in phase 2 (40 people), this doesnât necessarily mean it would
protect them from the virus. That still hasnât been established yet. From these results, we can tell that the vaccine - named
Sputnik V - appeared to be safe in healthy people between the age of 18 and 60
for 42 days, because that was how long the study lasted. But what about older people and those with underlying health
conditions who are most at risk of Covid-19 â how safe is it for them and over
a longer period of time? This can only be answered after much larger, long-term
randomised trials where the people taking part donât know if they are receiving
the vaccine or a dummy injection. These will also tell scientists how effective the vaccine
really is among a much wider population. There have also been calls for openness and transparency. Of
the many vaccines currently being trialled around the world, some will work
better than others in certain situations and in certain groups of people,
perhaps. So knowing exactly how well they work and for whom is
paramount â it is unlikely that one vaccine will be suitable for everyone. And here are the main developments around the world in the past 24 hours: Soon we will be pausing our live coverage - but before we do, here's a reminder of todayâs main headlines
from the UK:  Businesses including soft play centres, bowling alleys and casinos can finallyreopen across the north of Englandfrom Tuesday. The extra Covid-19 restrictions imposed on Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire are being eased. It means that from Tuesday, casinos, skating rinks, bowling alleys, exhibition halls, conference centres, and indoor play areas will be able to reopen throughout Greater Manchester - apart from Bolton, where these restrictions will remain in place - Lancashire and West Yorkshire. And indoor swimming pools, including water parks, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports courts and facilities will also be able to open in Leicester and the remaining parts of Blackburn with Darwen and Bradford, where restrictions had not already been eased. Meanwhile, Newark and Sherwood, Slough and Wakefield will be removed from Public Health England's list of ""areas of concern"". And Leeds, South Tyneside, Corby, Middlesbrough and Kettering have been added to the watchlist, Mr Hancock confirmed. Norfolk, Rossendale and Northampton are being added as ""areas of enhanced support"", which means the government will work with local authorities to provide additional resources - such as testing or contact tracing - to help bring the numbers of infections down. Scottish Opera is beginning live performances again with a string of pop-up shows across the country - with musicians behind screens and singers staying three metres apart. It is the first national performing arts company in Scotland to stage a live show for a real-life audience. Like everyone else, they've been making virtual work online. The shows kick off in Glasgow with six performances of La BohÃ¨me for an audience of just over 100 people per night sitting in a car park. Tickets for the five initial shows were quickly snapped up, so much so that extra seating and an extra performance had to be added. Read the full story here There have been more than 340,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far in the UK and more than 40,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus - and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.  Daily confirmed cases began edging up again in July - after falling significantly from their April peak - as lockdown restrictions imposed in March were eased. Today, the government said there had been 1,940 newly-confirmed cases. The official number of confirmed cases during the peak in the UK underestimated the true level of infection at the time, as widespread testing was not as available until mid-May. Theincrease in testing,externalpartly explains the rise in daily cases in July - if you are testing more, you are likely to find more cases. But despite some local outbreaks, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England remained stable in the week to 25 August, according to the Office for National Statistics. And the apparent rise in cases since July has not, however, translated into an increase in people being admitted to hospital. There are several local hotspots in the UK which have seen a spike in cases since the nationwide lockdown ended. Public Health England produces aweekly watchlist,externalof areas of concern, based on an assessment of incidence rates, and other indicators such as trends in testing, healthcare activity and deaths.

the pandemic has affected the area you are in. Jobs in Canada continue to grow, new labour market numbers say. Statistics Canada reported on Friday that the economy had added 246,000 jobs in
August. When added to the 419,000 new jobs in July, and 1.2m added in May and
June, employment is now just about 5.7% shy of its pre-coronavirus levels in
February. As of the week of Aug 15, about 1.8m Canadian workers are affected by the
Covid-19 shutdown, either because they are unemployed or have had their hours
reduced. In April, this number reached a peak of 5.5 million. Most of the employment gains have been in full-time work, the statistical agency
said. Additionally, the number of those working from home has decreased, from 3.4m in April to 2.5m
in August. France has reported 8,975 infections in the past 24 hours - the highest number of new infections since the start of the outbreak. The authorities also say the number of patients in intensive care units has been rising in the past few days. Earlier on, we reported that patients taking part in early tests of a Russian vaccine developed antibodies with ""no serious adverse events"" (see our 15:29 entry). However, the World Health Organization (WHO) now says it does not expect widespread immunisation against the virus until mid-2021. The WHO acknowledged that a ""considerable number"" of vaccine candidates had entered final stage trials, which typically involve tens of thousands of people. But WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris was quoted by AFP news agency as saying that ""in terms of realistic timelines, we are really not expecting to see widespread vaccination until the middle of next year"". The UN health agency has said it will not endorse any vaccine without proof that it is safe and effective.  Officials say 56 people have tested positive at an asylum centre in Birmingham, in England's West Midlands. Staff and residents at the Serco-run Stone Road Asylum Centre in Edgbaston are affectedand the centre has been closed, the city council says. Those infected have been moved to alternative accommodation where they can safely self-isolate. Contact tracing is also under way and being carried out in the relevant languages of affected residents, the council says. Switzerland has reported more than 400 new infections in the past 24 hours for the first time since mid-April. But health officials say that - despite 405 confirmed cases - the situation in the country is ""stable"", and the reproduction rate remains below 1. Three-quarters of the new cases are in people aged under 40. âAt the moment weâre not talking of a second wave; weâre talking of a slow increase in infections,"" said Stefan Kuster, the head of the Swiss health ministry's communicable diseases unit. ""The efforts of the population and the cantons are bearing fruit,"" he added. The Alpine nation of about 8.5 million people has so far recorded more than 43,000 infections, with over 2,000 deaths. The infection rate in Leeds has been rising over the last few weeks Leeds has been
added to Public Health England's weekly watch list of areas of concern, after its seven-day infection rate rose to 32.4 cases per 100,000 people. The city council said the data suggests a lot of the cases are in
different areas of the city, meaning they may be linked to social interaction
and leisure activities. ""The spread is broad and changeable across wards and cases
have also been increasingly detected in younger people aged 18-34, with some
concern over activities like house parties and gatherings,"" it said. There will not be any further restrictions on Leeds at this stage but it does mean increased monitoring of cases and potential additional steps in future if the infection rates do not start to fall. Council leader Judith Blake said: ""This rise in infection rates means that inevitably, our window of opportunity is shrinking by the day and the city is rapidly approaching a tipping point."" Some 1,940 new daily confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been
recorded in the UK, the highest since 30 May, according to the latest
government figures. Ten more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for
coronavirus, the government said, bringing the total death toll in the UK to 41,537. The
UK's testing capacity has increased since the peak of the outbreak earlier
this year. Derek Burt faces a race to get home to Scotland from the Algarve with his mother and children All Derek Burt's mother wanted when she was diagnosed with terminal motor neurone disease (MND) six weeks ago was one last holiday with her family, he says. ""MND is such an evil and unpredictable disease. We have no idea if she will be able to go on a family holiday with us when all the Covid craziness is over, so had to make the tough decision and deliver on one of her wishes now."" With trips to Florida and Croatia already cancelled, they decided on Portugal when quarantine restrictions were lifted two weeks ago. But now the family from Dunfermline in Fife is having to race to get home from the Algarve to beat the new restrictions that come into force at 04:00 on Saturday in Scotland. Mr Burt says the family researched different holidays and tried to follow the guidance available, but ""nobody has a clue what the governments are thinking"". Read the full story here Hong Kong has now decided to extend by four days a China-backed mass coronavirus testing programme,despite concerns that it is not effective and could be misused for surveillance. Officials said that only six people had been found infected among 128,000 people tested since the voluntary free programme was launched on Tuesday. They say that overall more than 900,000 people have registered for such tests. A health workers union has criticised the effort as an inefficient waste of resources, while activists have said it could be used by the authorities in mainland China to collect DNA samples. Boris Johnson has
insisted ""overwhelmingly the UK is proceeding as one"" after Transport
Secretary Grant Shapps admitted differing quarantine rules across the four
nations was âconfusingâ. During a visit to Solihull,
the UK prime minister said the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland have âdifferent rates of infectivity, different approaches to
the problemâ. He said digging below the
surface âyou will find overwhelmingly the UK takes the same approach"". The PM said quarantine
measures for arrivals from countries deemed high-risk must remain ""a vital
part"" of the fight against coronavirus. He said he understands the difficulties the airline
industry is going through, but that testing at points of entry only identifies
7% of the cases. Here's a round-up of what is happening in the US:  There have been 159 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland in the past 24 hours. This compares to 101 the previous day - an increase of 58 cases. Seventy three of the new cases are in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board area. Restrictions on visiting other householdswere reintroduced in Glasgow and two neighbouring areason Tuesday. Two new cases have been reported in the Western Isles for the first time since June. There have been no new reported deaths of people who tested positive in the last 28 days. Vials with a Russian vaccine Patients taking part in early tests of a Russian vaccine developed antibodies with ""no serious adverse events"",the Lancet medical journal has reported, quoting findings by several Russian scientists.,external But researchers said longer and larger trials were needed to prove the Sputnik V vaccine would be safe and effective. Last month, Russia announced that the vaccine had been approved by the country's health regulatory body - a move that was met with scepticism in some countries. A number of experts, particularly in the West, warned Moscow was moving too quickly, skipping a key stage required for research. Russia has rejected the criticism as baseless. President Vladimir Putin has said that one of his two daughters has already been vaccinated. And of Friday, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was shown on Russia's state TV getting the jab himself.

"Eat Out to Help Out: Diners claim 100 million mealsRestaurants. pubs and cafes claimed Â£522m under the discount scheme in August, Treasury figures show.Business","Restaurants have claimed more than 100 million meals under the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, Treasury figures show. Diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays during August. The Treasury said restaurants have so far made 130,000 claims worth Â£522m, figures likely to rise as outlets have until the end of September to claim. Restaurant bookings surged during the scheme, especially on the final day. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""From the get-go our mission has been to protect jobs, and to do this we needed to be creative, brave and try things that no government has ever done before. ""Today's figures continue to show Eat Out to Help Out has been a success. I want to thank everyone, from restaurant owners to waiters, chefs and diners, for embracing it and helping drive our economic recovery."" About 84,700 restaurants signed up for Eat Out to Help Out. According to data from booking site OpenTable, restaurant reservations rose by 53% compared with the Monday-to-Wednesday period in August 2019. In July, restaurant bookings were down 54% on Mondays-to-Wednesdays, compared with July 2019. The final day of the scheme, Monday 31 August, saw a 216% jump in bookings against the equivalent day in 2019, according to OpenTable. The government has set aside Â£500m to fund Eat Out to Help Out. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data. Rishi Sunak said that to support jobs the government needed ""to be creative and brave"". However, the scheme has critics. Some pubs and restaurants pulled out in August,citing increased hostility towards stafftrying to cope with the increased demand and need for social distancing. Some outlets were concerned the scheme could pull in diners earlier in the week to the detriment of weekend trade. In July, the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecast the scheme would most likely be a ""giveaway"" that benefitted those well-off enough to eat out. And anti-obesity campaigners said the scheme ""would be a green light to promote junk food"". However, Stephen Wall, managing director and co-founder of the Pho restaurant chain, said it ""has really been amazing. It has certainly benefited our early-week figures and seems to have encouraged the British public to dine out safely, as our restaurants are filling up and staying busy throughout the weekend, too."" And Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, said spending data collected by the bank suggested the scheme had given a ""real boost"" to the hospitality sector. He added: ""Consumer feedback was also very encouraging, with almost one in five planning to continue dining out more often... and a similar number saying that they will return to restaurants that they would not have visited otherwise."" Mr Sunak has ruled out extending the scheme, but some pub and restaurant chains, including Pizza Hut and Bill's, have said they will finance similar offers this month following the jump in demand.

Portugal and Greek islands on Wales list,"Portugal has been added to Wales' quarantine list but not England's People arriving in Wales from mainland Portugal and six Greek islands must self-isolate for 14 days from 04:00 BST Friday. It is the first time the Welsh Governmenthas set different quarantine rules from the UK government. People returning from Gibraltar and French Polynesia will also be required to self-isolate. Crete, Zakynthos, Mykonos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos are among the Greek islands affected. Portugal will also be added to the Scottish quarantine listfrom Saturday, but advice for travellers in England, issued by the UK government, and in Northern Ireland remains unchanged. Portugal was only removed from the quarantine rules less than two weeks ago. The Portuguese islands of the Azores and Madeira were not included in Thursday's announcement. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was acting on public health advice, and had sought a meeting with the UK government but was not able to get one. The decision follows a number of coronavirus cases in Wales linked to flights from Zakynthos, anda rise in cases in Portugal. Travellers to Wales from the Greek island were asked toself-isolateearlier in the week, but Thursday's changes mean those who do not self-isolate now face potential fines of Â£1,000. Greece? Portugal? Spain? What are the quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? UK split over Portugal quarantine rules There had been 20 cases connected to one flight from Zante to Cardiff Airport. The quarantine rules apply to travellers arriving home in Wales regardless of what part of the UK they return through - including English airports. Mr Gething said he took the decision because of a large number of coronavirus cases ""imported into Wales from tourists returning from the Greek islands"". He said there were more than 20 cases confirmed in passengers on one flight from Zakynthos to Cardiff. But UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday there were no changes in England. Mr Gething said he had hoped to discuss the situation with the UK government and counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but a meeting on Thursday was not possible. ""My responsibility is to make the right choices to keep Wales safe. My preference is to do that on a four-nation basis where possible,"" he said. ""If it isn't possible, I still have to make the right choice for Wales."" Although he said it was possible people could be fined, he added: ""That is the very last step that I want us to take."" Damian Martin arrived in Portugal on Wednesday Damian Martin, from Swansea, arrived in Lagos, Portugal, on Wednesday after having already switched his holiday from Spain. He said he would not be able to return early. The supermarket employee said he believed he would be able to self-isolate: ""My work said they would deal with it if it came to it."" ""I thought I'd be fine going to the Algarve, that most cases would be in the north,"" he said. ""Work had been full on and I really really needed a break, so I decided to go. I'm supposed to be here eight nights. I might as well try to enjoy it."" Jon Lake and his wife Nicole were due to celebrate their 10-year wedding anniversary by returning to Lake Garda, Italy, where they tied the knot. But the family, who are currently on holiday in Crete, will now have to mark the special day in their home in Cardiff, as they will be in self-isolating. ""It's all down the pan, we had wanted to do something special, now it will likely be pasta and a glass of wine back home,"" he said. Jon, who works in pharmaceuticals, said he had tracked the cases every day before going on the two-week Greek break. ""I wanted to give my family a little bit of normality, and now it is ruined,"" he said. ""We are now going back into a worse situation, it's a mess."" His oldest son, aged six, was due to start back at school, but will now have to quarantine. Mr Lake said he was angry with the Welsh Government for changing the rules, which he said ""made no logical sense"". ""They've literally given people eight hours to get home, what is Vaughan Gething expecting us to do - get a private plane? It's a joke,"" he said. For some the different rules among the nations have caused confusion and anger. Martin, lives in Gladestry, Powys, and while his village is in Wales, he has an English postcode. Having arrived home from Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, he said he was halfway through the two-week self-isolation period, but had not had any contact from the government. ""My friend who lives a few miles away in a Welsh postcode has had an email from the government about isolation,"" he said ""I live inside the border of Wales - we pay our council tax to a Welsh council, the schools are Welsh but the postcode is English. ""It's mixed messaging. Why can't the country stick together?"" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? Because it is a public health measure, the quarantine system in Wales is set by the Welsh Government. Up until now, Wales has followed the UK government in deciding which countries travellers could return from and not need to self-isolate. It has also followed any changes made, including the recent decision to order travellers from Switzerland to quarantine. Travellers abroad are expected tofill in a form online,externalwith their contact details 48 hours before they arrive back in the UK. Not providing accurate details could alsoresult in fines of Â£1,920,external. Crete is among the places included in the announcement Wales, for the first time, has now announced significantly different quarantine rules to those across the border. The Welsh health minister says this action came after ""clear advice"" from the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) that travel from these countries poses a public health risk. But the UK government's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also cited the JBC when announcing there was no need for additions or removals to the travel corridor list for England today. These differences come with complications. With only one major airport in Wales - Cardiff - many passengers flying into places like Bristol or Birmingham will land into one set of rules but face another when they get home. Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said it would be ""better if, when travel measures are announced, they are done on a joint basis"" across the four nations. ""This would help keep everyone informed and safe,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the experience ""with Zakynthos tells us that the quicker a Welsh Government can act, the better"". Are you affected by the new quarantine rules?

Scotland adds Portugal to list,"Portugal has been added to Scotland's quarantine list Passengers arriving in Scotland from Portugal after 04:00 on Saturday will have to self-isolate for 14 days, the Scottish government has confirmed. French Polynesia has also been added to Scotland's quarantine list. And travellers from Gibraltar have been warned that the territory was""high up our watch list"" by Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf,external. Earlier this week Scotland announcedsimilar quarantine restrictions for travellers from Greece. Ministers said they considered targeting regions of Portugal with the quarantine rule but ultimately decided a ""whole country approach"" was necessary. Click here for Scotland's full quarantine list,external Differences in UK quarantine rules 'confusing' Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Mr Yousaf said people should ""think very hard"" before embarking on non-essential travel during the pandemic. ""With Scotland's relatively low infection rate, importation of new cases is a significant risk to public health,"" he added. ""I would also encourage people who have returned to Scotland from Portugal or French Polynesia in the last few days to be particularly careful in their social contacts and to ensure they stick to theFACTS,external. ""I am also concerned by the level of infections in Gibraltar and we will be monitoring the situation there very carefully."" He said they were in regular discussions with the other three governments in the UK. ""We continue to closely monitor the situation in all parts of the world and base the decisions we make on the scientific evidence available,"" he said. ""The requirement for travellers to quarantine for 14 days on arrival from a non-exempt country is vital to help prevent transmission of the virus and to suppress it - not doing so poses a significant risk to wider public health across Scotland."" When Derek Burt's mother was diagnosed with MND six weeks ago, she asked for ""one more trip"" - a holiday with her family. With trips to Florida and Croatia already cancelled, when quarantine restrictions were lifted two weeks ago they settled on Portugal. Although the virus rates seemed on the high-side, he ""assumed the government knew what they were doing"" and would not return the country to the quarantine list. ""How stupid was I to show any faith in our countries' decision-makers?"" he said. They have had an amazing week, and his mother was able to fulfil her wish to watch her grandchildren playing in the pool of their villa. But now the family from Dunfermline in Fife is racing to get home to beat the new restrictions that come into force at 04:00 on Saturday. Mr Burt said he is ""incredibly frustrated"" by the decision of the Scottish and Welsh governments, describing it as a ""complete shambles"". The Scottish government will monitor the situation in Gibraltar carefully The decision follows the Welsh government's announcement thattravellers to Wales from six Greek islands and mainland Portugalwould have to isolate from 04:00 on Friday. However, arrivals to England and Northern Ireland from Portugal and Greece will not be subject to the same restrictions. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shappstold BBC Breakfastthat the different rules across the UK were confusing for travellers, and said it was similar to the way lockdown had been applied across the four nations. He added: ""We look at the data and then we do speak - but I'm afraid quite often come to slightly different outcomes which I appreciate is confusing for people"". He described Portugal as being on a ""borderline"", adding that ""the opinion of England and Northern Ireland is that it did not justify quarantine this week"". Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? The seven-day infection rate in Portugal has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people. A seven-day rate of 20 per 100,000 is the threshold above which the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions. Holidaymakers have only been able to travel from Scotland to Portugal without quarantine restrictions since 22 August, when it was added to thegovernment ""exemptions"" list.,external. It follows the addition of Greece to Scotland's quarantine list, which came into force on Thursday; Ministers blamed the decision on a ""significant rise"" in coronavirus cases being brought into Scotland from people who had been to Greece. The moves have been criticised by leading figures in the aviation industry, who have comparedjob losses in the industry to the demise of the coal industry in the 1980s.

Eat Out to Help Out serves up 100 million meals,"Restaurants have claimed more than 100 million meals under the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, Treasury figures show. Diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays during August. The Treasury said restaurants have so far made 130,000 claims worth Â£522m, figures likely to rise as outlets have until the end of September to claim. Restaurant bookings surged during the scheme, especially on the final day. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""From the get-go our mission has been to protect jobs, and to do this we needed to be creative, brave and try things that no government has ever done before. ""Today's figures continue to show Eat Out to Help Out has been a success. I want to thank everyone, from restaurant owners to waiters, chefs and diners, for embracing it and helping drive our economic recovery."" About 84,700 restaurants signed up for Eat Out to Help Out. According to data from booking site OpenTable, restaurant reservations rose by 53% compared with the Monday-to-Wednesday period in August 2019. In July, restaurant bookings were down 54% on Mondays-to-Wednesdays, compared with July 2019. The final day of the scheme, Monday 31 August, saw a 216% jump in bookings against the equivalent day in 2019, according to OpenTable. The government has set aside Â£500m to fund Eat Out to Help Out. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data. Rishi Sunak said that to support jobs the government needed ""to be creative and brave"". However, the scheme has critics. Some pubs and restaurants pulled out in August,citing increased hostility towards stafftrying to cope with the increased demand and need for social distancing. Some outlets were concerned the scheme could pull in diners earlier in the week to the detriment of weekend trade. In July, the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecast the scheme would most likely be a ""giveaway"" that benefitted those well-off enough to eat out. And anti-obesity campaigners said the scheme ""would be a green light to promote junk food"". However, Stephen Wall, managing director and co-founder of the Pho restaurant chain, said it ""has really been amazing. It has certainly benefited our early-week figures and seems to have encouraged the British public to dine out safely, as our restaurants are filling up and staying busy throughout the weekend, too."" And Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, said spending data collected by the bank suggested the scheme had given a ""real boost"" to the hospitality sector. He added: ""Consumer feedback was also very encouraging, with almost one in five planning to continue dining out more often... and a similar number saying that they will return to restaurants that they would not have visited otherwise."" Mr Sunak has ruled out extending the scheme, but some pub and restaurant chains, including Pizza Hut and Bill's, have said they will finance similar offers this month following the jump in demand.

Long-term pollution fears after train derailment,"Ten wagons, each containing 75 tonnes of diesel, derailed and caught fire at Llangennech There may be ""long-term effects"" from diesel spillage after a train derailed in Carmarthenshire, Natural Resources Wales has said. Ten wagons, each containing 75 tonnes of diesel,derailed and spilled oilinto the Loughor Estuary at Llangennech near Llanelli last week. Homes were evacuated and a major incident declared after the freight train derailed and burst into flames NRW said it had found evidence of diesel at various sites on the estuary. Cockle beds and shell fisheries on the estuary have been closed since the spillage. The fire lit up the sky in the surrounding area Robert Griffiths, a cockle picker and Secretary of the Burry Inlet Handgatherers Association said it was a difficult time for the industry. ""No work, no pay. If we don't go to work we don't get any money to pay our bills, our mortgages. ""Most of us don't know anything else. I've gathered cockles for over 25 years, some have been doing it over 40 years. ""That's all they've ever done. They have never had to fall back on something else, so they wait."" Robert Griffiths says people in the cockle-picking industry cannot work The estuary is part of the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation, and wildlife groups have already warned it could have a ""devastating impact"" on the environment. Mr Griffiths said he was also worried about the effect the spillage would have on consumer confidence in their product, with suppliers turning away from the area. ""I suppose half the world knows now there's been an oil spill - due to the internet - in the Loughor Estuary. ""Is half the world going to buy a can of cockles because they may or may not have diesel in them? I don't know. ""They might turn around and say 'sorry boys, we've done a survey and our customers don't want them so we can't buy them'. It's hard."" Natural Resources Wales was not able to investigate the damage of the spill until the fire was put out, which took 33 hours. How wildfire pollution may be harming your health River water tested after pollution kills fish Heavy oil spill 'up to 10,000 litres' British Transport Police's initial probe has ruled out criminal intent, and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch is examining the cause of the crash. The driver and engineer of the DB Cargo train escaped unhurt. On Saturday, NRW said the spill was ""no longer confined to the upper reaches of the estuary and had been observed at many locations as far as Crofty"". Criminal intent has been ruled out Ioan Williams, from the agency, said experts would continue monitoring the area over the next few weeks. ""There may well be long-term effects, we don't know yet is the bottom line. ""This may take a period of timeâ¦ and also, as the diesel starts to come out of the sand and manage to come a bit further down the estuary, we may see impacts a bit later on. ""It's a big clean-up operationâ¦ the cost will be substantial. ""This is a very important area, of European importance, there are a raft of designations here. ""Penclacwydd isn't far from here, it's very important for migratory wildfowl, it's important for the mussels, the cockles etcâ¦ and we are concerned about the impact that this may have.""

Quarantine lists split UK as new Wales rules kick in,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps says differences in UK quarantine rules are ""confusing"" Differences in UK quarantine rules are ""confusing"" for travellers, Grant Shapps has admitted, as the four nations take varying approaches to countries with rising Covid-19 cases. The transport secretary acknowledged people's frustrations, as Scotland and Wales asked arrivals from Portugal and parts of Greece to isolate, but England and Northern Ireland held off. Wales' rules,external, including only six Greek islands, began at 04:00 BST on Friday. Travel firms called for urgent clarity. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast the difference in quarantine rules was similar to the way lockdown had been applied across the UK. ""It is similar, unfortunately, with the quarantining where we look at the data and then we do speak, but, I'm afraid, quite often come to slightly different outcomes, which I appreciate is confusing for people,"" he said. He described Portugal as being on a ""borderline"", adding that ""the opinion of England and Northern Ireland is that it did not justify quarantine this week"". What are the UK's quarantine rules? Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Scotland""sort of jumped the gun"" by introducing restrictionsfor arrivals from the whole of Greece. ""I'm very keen and do try to coordinate... with the other administrations so we can both announce at the same time, and ideally both announce the same things, and this week that didn't work out,"" he said. The seven-day infection rate in Portugal has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people, above the threshold of 20. Mr Shapps explained that cases per 100,000 people was just one measure taken into account bythe UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre, with the test positivity rate also a factor. The proportion of tests proving positive in Portugal was lower than it was when quarantine restrictions were lifted last month, Mr Shapps added. But the minister warned: ""As I constantly sayâ¦ we will have to move quickly if the figures change."" Derek Burt, from Dunfermline in Fife, wastrying to organise last-minute travelback to the UK before Scotland's quarantine begins when he spoke to the BBC from the Algarve. He said he booked a trip to Portugal with his terminally ill mother because he ""assumed the government knew what they were doing"" and would not return the country to its quarantine list. ""How stupid was I to show any faith in our countries' decision-makers?"" he said. Some holidaymakers due to return to England told the BBC theypaid around Â£1,000 for flightsto get home from Portugal in anticipation of the rules changing - but that did not happen. Kelly, from Birmingham, and her family changed their flights home from the Algarve from Saturday to Friday at a cost of Â£900 to avoid potential quarantine because she did not want her children to miss out on two weeks of school. ""It's cost us a lot more money and it's money we didn't need to spend now,"" she said. Ron, who was preparing to travel to Manchester from Faro Airport on Friday, told the BBC flights for three people cost over Â£1,000. ""It would be good if governments could all get together... and come up with one set of policies which are applied reasonably consistently,"" he said. While Wales' advice has already changed, arrivals toScotland,externalfrom Portugal and French Polynesia will also have to self-isolate from 04:00 on Saturday. Scotland has already reintroduced quarantine for arrivals from Greece. The measures will affect those who reside in Wales and Scotland but return to the UK via England. Portugal, Greece and French Polynesia are still onEngland,externalandNorthern Ireland's,externallists of travel corridors. The latestquarantine rules introduced in Wales, which also apply to travellers from Gibraltar, affect six Greek islands - Crete, Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros and Antiparos. Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething told Today that Wales has seen 30 coronavirus cases from four different flights from Zakynthos, two of which landed in England. ""I did not feel that there was any course of action other than taking some form of action,"" he said. Scotlandreintroduced self-isolation measures for arrivals from Greeceearlier in the week, and has sinceadded Portugal and French Polynesiato its list of countries requiring quarantine. ""This week's data shows an increase in test positivity and cases per 100,000 in Portugal,"" said Scottish justice minister Humza Yousaf. It may look confusing and it may leave holidaymakers and other travellers scratching their heads as to why the quarantine rules are different depending on where you live in the UK. But this is devolution in action. The new emergency coronavirus legislation introduced earlier this year gave the devolved administrations new powers to tackle the pandemic, adding to their existing control over many domestic issues. Their chief medical officers give ministers their own own advice, though they do confer with their counterparts and through UK-wide committees. Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast have already shown a willingness to move at their own pace over easing lockdown restrictions and reopening schools. With the R number (the speed at which the virus is spreading or receding) rising above the overall UK level in Scotland, it is perhaps no surprise that Holyrood wants to take its own initiatives on quarantine. Themuch-publicised flight from Greece to Cardiff, with several cases traced to passengers, is another illustration of why a devolved administration has taken action. Greece's rate overall is below the 20 cases per 100,000 threshold, at 13.8 in the seven days to 2 September, down from 14.9 a week earlier. Northern Ireland will not make further changes to quarantine rules at present, its department of health said. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries The variety of rules across the four UK nations has drawn criticism from industry experts. ""The quarantine policy is in tatters,"" said Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy firm The PC Agency. ""Consumers are totally confused by the different approaches."" It comes as the level of coronavirus among the community in England remains ""unchanged"",according to Office for National Statistics estimatesbased on a survey during the week ending 25 August.

"'Significant gaps' in UK's Brexit border plansLogistics industry groups warn supply chains could be ""severely disrupted"" if issues aren't addressed.UK","This video can not be played Rod McKenzie says the government should ""act now before it's too late"" The UK is ""sleepwalking into a disaster"" over its border plans for the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, road hauliers have warned. Groups representing truckers have written to ministers warning of ""severe"" disruption to supply chains. Rod McKenzie, from the Road Haulage Association, said the government should ""act now before it's too late"". But Boris Johnson said the UK was ""ready for any eventuality"" after the transition period. The government has also given itself powers to build temporary lorry parks in England without local approval. However, Mr McKenzie told BBC News: ""It is a real case of the government sleepwalking to a disaster with the border preparations that we have, whether it is a deal or no-deal Brexit at the end of December. Why Brexit is still a big issue What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Barnier: UK risks no-deal unless it compromises ""The supply chain on which we are all dependent to get the things we need could be disrupted and there is a lack of government focus and action on this."" He added: ""When we are trying to emerge from the crisis of Covid, if we then plunge straight into a Brexit-related crisis, that will be a really difficult moment and we need real pace. ""The difference here is between a disaster area and a disaster area with rocket boosters on."" Labour's shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, said the government ""must urgently come forward with a plan to put workable solutions in place"". Speaking to reporters on Friday, Mr Johnson said: ""We must make sure that people understand at the end of the year, whatever happens, we're leaving the EU, leaving the transition period. ""That's why it is vital that people who have questions about what they need to do get onto our government websites â¦ look at what they need to do to prepare, and certainly, we will help them. ""But we will get through this."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson responds to hauliers predicting Britain is ""sleepwalking into a disaster"" over border checks next year. The UK left the European Union on 31 January, but a transition period - where the UK continues to follow some of the bloc's rules - remains in place until 31 December while the two sides negotiate a trade agreement. However, trade talks have been taking place since March and both sides have complained of little progress being made. If a deal is not agreed and ratified by parliaments by the end of the year, the UK will go into 2021 trading with the bloc on World Trade Organization rules, which critics fear cause issues at the border. In a letter to the Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove,seen by Bloomberg,external, eight logistics organisations - including the Road Haulage Association - raised concerns over IT systems, the funding to train up customs agents and the pace of physical infrastructure being built. They asked for an ""urgent roundtable meeting"" with Mr Gove, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Transport Secretary Grants Shapps, saying supply chain must be protected ahead of a potential second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Shapps said he regularly met the Road Haulage Association and wanted to reassure them ""planning for the end of the transition period hasn't stopped"" during the coronavirus outbreak. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he ""could not pre-empt the outcome"" of trade talks with the EU, which he conceded created ""some uncertainty"". But, he said the government had kept supply changes going throughout the pandemic and ""we are absolutely confident we will do that again in the future"". Analysis by Sebastien Ash, BBC political analyst On 1 January 2021, the way that UK businesses trade with the EU will fundamentally change. It'll mean new hurdles for traders to clear, including the need to fill in customs declarations - forms with detailed information on goods being imported and exported. For the first six months of this new era - and whatever the outcome of the negotiations between the UK and the EU - goods entering the UK will not have to complete these processes, as they normally would, at the border. Instead, the government is giving businesses time to file their paperwork and pay the duties they owe after the goods have entered the UK. This exceptional measure is designed to mitigate the risk of delays for goods coming into the UK. However, for goods being exported the concern is greater. The EU has said it will impose its normal controls. And on the UK side, key systems to manage the flow of lorries at the UK border and make sure consignments are cleared to proceed to the EU are not up and running. The concern among the industry is that this could lead to lorries being refused entry onto ferries headed for the EU, long tail-backs at the ports through which much of the UK's trade with the EU flows and slow down and disrupt the supply chains between UK and EU businesses. In short, it becomes hard to conduct business as usual if you can't get your goods to the customer. Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation - another of the groups who wrote the letter - acknowledged the government was carrying out work on the necessary systems now. But he said there was ""no time to get these systems in place to actually do the job effectively"". He told BBC News: ""The supply chain leaders will try to do everything they can to avoid shortages on the shelves, but at its worst, at the extreme, these sorts of situations will lead to food shortages."" Earlier this week, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, saidthe UK was risking leaving the transition period without a deal unless it began to compromise. He said he was ""worried and disappointed"" about the lack of concessions from his British counterpart, David Frost, after a trade deal meeting on Tuesday. No 10 said it was ""clear"" that a deal ""will not be easy to achieve"". This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake breaks down the next round of Brexit negotiations The logistics industry letter came as the government gave itself powers to grant emergency planning permission for it to build temporary lorry parks and inspection posts in 29 councils areas across England, without the need for local approval. Giant lorry park branded 'concrete monstrosity' Post-Brexit lorry park trial 'too late' The government said the lorry parks, which can stay in place until the end of 2025, would contribute to ""an orderly transition to the new system of controls to secure the border"" and would help to address the impact coronavirus may have had on port operators' ability to provide the necessary infrastructure themselves, in time for the end of the transition period.

Five children found dead in German flatPolice say they are investigating a crime in the city of Solingen and the mother is a suspect.Europe,"The children, aged between one and eight, were found in a family home The bodies of five children have been found in a flat in a large housing block in the western German city of Solingen, police say. Police say they suspect the 27-year-old mother of killing the children before attempting to take her own life at a train station in nearby DÃ¼sseldorf. Few details have been provided, with no information about the cause of death. Emergency services were called to the residential block in the Hasseldelle area of the city on Thursday afternoon. Responding to call at about 13:45 local time (11:45 GMT), police said they arrived at the building in Solingen, in North Rhine-Westphalia state, to discover the bodies of five children - three girls and two boys - aged from one to eight. A sixth child, reportedly an 11-year-old boy, was said to have survived. The children's grandmother, who lives 60km (37 miles) away in the city of MÃ¶nchengladbach, had alerted the emergency services, the German news website Bild reported. The entrance to the block of flats has been sealed off and forensic officers are at the scene Police spokesman Stefan Weiand said the children's mother had been ""seriously injured"" after throwing herself in front of a train in DÃ¼sseldorf and was being treated in hospital under police guard. ""Background and further details are not known at this point and that is what we are trying to find out,"" Mr Weiand told journalists, adding that police investigators were at the scene ""in full force"". Police said they were hoping to learn more about the ""incredibly tragic occurrence"" after speaking with the mother. The entrance to the block of flats in Solingen has been sealed off and images show police cars and ambulances lining the streets, with forensic officers also at the scene. A woman places a candle alongside a teddy at the residential building in Solingen, Germany The mayor of Solingen, Tim Kurzbach, wrote on Facebook that he had visited the housing block where ""this terrible act took place"" after hearing the news. ""For me it is still incomprehensible,"" he wrote in the post, adding: ""Today is a day of mourning for all of Solingen."" Later on Thursday, residents began leaving flowers and candles at the entrance to the building as a tribute.
