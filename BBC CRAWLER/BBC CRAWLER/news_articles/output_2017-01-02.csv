Arts news in 2016: Knocking on death's door,"Will Gompertz appeared with Huw Edwards on the BBC One Ten O'Clock News on the night of David Bowie's death Each specialism within journalism has its area of breaking news. For foreign correspondents, it tends to be a conflict or catastrophe. Politicos deal in shock resignations or revelations. For us in the arts unit, it is award ceremonies - and celebrity deaths. An instant obit of a once great, but now late, talent is what programme editors demand from us. And you can be as Boy Scoutish as you like in your preparations, but the artistic life - and death - isn't about pleasing the establishment: creative souls do things their own way. So, I was not entirely awake on Monday 11 January 2016 when my phone rang around 6.55am. It was a producer at the Today programme. Had I heard the news, he asked? Mâ¦maybe - I hedged. What news? David Bowie is dead, he said. Oh no! Oh no for lots of reasons. Firstly, it was awful news. I loved David Bowie; couldn't imagine him dead. He was still making great records. He wasn't particularly old, and now - well - he was no longer here. And then, oh no - I had to make sense of his incredible life, without much time to pause for thought. Six minutes later, I was on-air talking to Today's Nick Robinson. I got home late from work that night, put Heroes on and thoughtâ¦ sad day, but thankfully rare - a once-a-year occasion at worst. But three days later came another call from another producer. Had I heard the newsâ¦? Oh dear. Alan Rickman was fine actor whom one generation fell for Truly, Madly, Deeply, in 1990, and a new generation got to know and eventually love as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films. By the time news emerged of Sir Peter Maxwell Davies's death on 14 March, we had already paid our tributes to Pierre Boulez, Harper Lee and Sir George Martin. All titanic figures, but at least they had led full lives. This video can not be played Will Gompertz looks back at the life of ""trailblazer"" Dame Zaha Hadid And then on 31 March, another shock. Dame Zaha Hadid had died. I had interviewed the Bagdad-born British architect just a few weeks before, when she appeared as hale and hearty and feisty as ever. She was frustrated with her adopted country, rightly so. Her fellow Brits had been sniffy and slow in recognising her brilliance - and now she was gone, still in her prime, before amends could be made. 2016 was beginning to feel like a weird year. A sense compounded three weeks later with the announcement of Victoria Wood's death. That was a blow, too. We adored her. She was great. Always funny, jokes on the money; and never mean. We need such towering talents in our lives, not scythed down by the Grim Reaper. But he wasn't done yet. Tributes were left to Prince after his death in April The very next day, at around 3pm our time, social media stories started bubbling up speculating that Prince had died at his Paisley Park estate. Now, come on! Don't be silly. Don't be true. Don't be dead. But he was. At this point, articles started to appear asking if arts deaths were at an all-time high. Columnists wrote think pieces explaining to us that it was all to do with our obsession with celebrity in a post-Warholian media age. Meanwhile, the man in charge of obituaries at the BBC noted his services had been called upon far more frequently in the first third of 2016 than in the same months of the past five years. It had been an extraordinary period. It has been an extraordinary year - with a sting in its tail. On 11 November at 1:15am - a call from a producer on the Today Programme. Had I heard the news? ""Who's dead?"" I said. ""Leonard Cohen,"" came his reply. I knew he was frail and unwell, but there is something about truly great, unique artists - which he was - that you hope can circumnavigate that realities of live and death. That pop's longstanding poet-in-residence had succumbed while still making fine work seemed unfair, to us and to him. He knew better: If you are the dealer I'm out of the game If you are the healer It means I'm broken and lame If thine is the glory Mine must be the shame You want it darker We kill the flame You Want it Darker by Leonard Cohen (2016) And so we went into the festive season. Surely Death was done? Sadly not. In fact, he indulged in a Christmas rush with many unpleasant surprises to unpack. The news about Status Quo's Rick Parfitt broke on Christmas Eve. George Michael was found dead on Christmas Day. And then, the following day Richard Adams passed away. So did Carrie Fisher, and her mother - Debbie Reynolds - 24 hours later. I think it is fair to say 2016 was a most unusual year. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Media: What to look out for in 2017,"What will be the big themes in the media industry for 2017? All the forces of change in the media industry are very likely to accelerate in 2017. Be it the consolidation of companies, technological advances and even the future of the BBC, there will be lots happening. Here are the 10 themes to look out for. The big theme in the media business is the coming consolidation, usually between distributors and owners of content. In other words, those who own the pipes and those who tell the stories and ideas. Why is this happening? It's simple. When there is such ferocious competition for eyeballs, the best way to ensure you reach big audiences is to own the delivery mechanism for reaching them. The proposed (but far from certain) merger between AT&T and Time Warner fits into this theme, as does the (also far from certain) proposed deal between 21st Century Fox and Sky. Look out for Disney bidding for Netflix or Vice, and BT or Liberty bidding for ITV. Big bids could see consolidation in the media industry Consolidation also happens when you get sub-sectors that are highly populated while demand for their product is falling. British newspapers fit this category very well. Fewer people are reading newspapers, yet there is (compared for instance to the US) a huge array of newspapers. Expect, therefore, a few of them to be bought - perhaps the Daily Telegraph or Daily Express - and expect to hear more soon about the idea of the industry coming together to form a single advertising sales team. Facebook and Google account for an ever-growing slice of digital advertising around the globe. Companies wholly dependent on digital advertising may therefore struggle to survive unless their cost bases are low. The advertising industry is estimated at over $540bn (Â£440bn) annually. But the threats to it are growing, from ""cord-cutting"", whereby consumers ditch satellite and cable services for ad-free subscription services, to ad-blocking and widespread fraud, with concerns that many digital ads aren't seen by humans. This was compounded by Facebook's admission that it had given advertisers false information about the videos seen on the social network. All together, these pressures have damaged trust and confidence in this vast global industry. This year is going to be a tough one for many chief marketing officers. I often wonder what philosopher AJ Ayer, who wrote the seminal Language, Truth and Logic in 1936, would have made of the phrase ""post-truth politics"". I suspect he would have said plus ca change. And then he would have reminded us that whereas falsity comes by degrees, truth is absolute. Fake news became a big factor in 2016 The idea that there are concrete facts we can agree on as a basis for civilised public conversation has taken a pounding of late. The rise of social media's echo chambers; growth in fake news; state propaganda broadcast in the West (whether Russian, Iranian, or Chinese); and the frenzied campaigns over Brexit and for the White House were all threats to the truth. In 2017 it will be incumbent on all those who believe in truths to prove both that such things exist, and that they are worth knowing. World-class media only has a future if it is financially viable, and throughout the history of commerce, asking customers to pay for products they demand has been the surest guarantee of such viability. Specialist publications from the Spectator to the Economist and the Financial Times have grown their subscriber bases by charging for digital access. So too have general publications like the Times and the New York Times. If consumers recognise that quality costs and are willing to pay - which the growth of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime suggests is the case in television - 2017 could provide fresh cheer. We should know in the coming weeks whether the second phase of the Leveson Inquiry will go ahead, and also whether Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act - which requires papers to bear the costs of legal action brought against them, even if they win - will become law. Whatever happens, Britain's newspaper industry won't accede to what it sees as state regulation of the press without one hell of a fight. It should never be forgotten that in many parts of the world, being a journalist is still a subversive act. I reported recently that, according to Reporters sans Frontiers, 74 journalists died doing their jobs in 2016. This year, whether that number goes up or down, journalists are certain to be murdered, taken hostage, and used as blackmail. A number of journalists were murdered in Mexico last year The sheer danger of reporting from some parts of the world will make those areas information vacuums. Social media abhors an information vacuum, so our knowledge of places such as Raqqa will continue, unfortunately, to depend on the use of social media by militant groups. One of the most remarkable stories of 2016 was Peter Thiel's war on Gawker. The Silicon Valley entrepreneur was outed as gay by the gossip and news website. In response, he funded a legal action brought by former wrestling champion Hulk Hogan (real name Terrence Bollea), who was furious about the site publishing a sex-tape in which he starred. The action was successful, in so far as Thiel and Bollea won, rendering Gawker bankrupt. Gawker Media, the parent company, was bought by Univision but gawker.com, the flagship site, was shut down. In a piece for the New York Times, Thiel said he would do it again. Which raises the question: will other rich individuals who can finance such legal actions be encouraged to take on media organisations? Perhaps encouraged by Donald Trump's disdain for the ""mainstream media"" (Thiel was a Trump supporter), and the rise of the ""alt-right"", it's just possible that free speech will come under attack in America as never before. Already threatening to overtake Twitter in many key measures, from its user base to market value, the video messaging app's much anticipated Initial Public Offering (IPO), scheduled for the spring, could value it between $20bn and $25bn. Snapchat could be valued for as much as $25bn There are thought to be well more than 10 million users in the UK already, and while Snapchat's growth among the under-30s gives it a unique appeal to advertisers, the really fascinating thing is how new forms of social media are changing our behaviour. Teenagers across the country are sending each other videos - or ""snaps"" - several times a day. What is this doing to our sense of privacy, attention spans, and friendship circles? In 2017, we may begin to find out. A new BBC chairman (or chairwoman) will be announced in the coming days. Whoever gets the role will need to lead a new governance structure, with the BBC Trust having been scrapped and regulatory oversight being passed to Ofcom. With a new 11-year charter having come into force from 1 January, the BBC needs to find substantial savings, focus on ""distinctive content"" and compete with the new predators stalking the media jungle such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. Aside from those challenges, managing the ""Compete and Compare"" strategy announced by director general Tony Hall in 2014, whereby many more programmes will be put out to tender rather than made in house, amounts to a radical rethink of the BBC's place within the industry and our culture more broadly. The future of Channel 4 remains unclear. There has been talk of privatisation, moving to Birmingham or further north, and selling the Channel 4 offices on Horseferry Road in London. A private equity fund could soon offer to buy the broadcaster. But there have been few decisions, as yet. The anxiety this has induced in staff at Channel 4 is considerable. Chief executive David Abraham and chief creative officer Jay Hunt showed, with their purchase of Great British Bake Off, that they have immense editorial ambition. With over Â£1bn in revenues for the sixth year in a row, the channel's unique model, as a public broadcaster that is commercially funded, has worked well. In 2017, the broadcaster should - finally - discover what, and where, it's future will be. Aside from all of the above, there are countless other media trends, themes and stories that will flare up in 2017. Will Adam Crozier move on from ITV, having achieved a turnaround? How many more Chinese people will spend most of their waking hours on WeChat, the remarkable app that has few equivalents in the West? And will digital technology help create a flourishing media sector across Africa, South America and Asia? So 2017 will be very exciting across media. Watch this space.

Tim Harford: How fertiliser helped feed the world,"It has been called one of the greatest inventions of the 20th Century, and without it almost half the world's population would not be alive today. A hundred years ago two German chemists, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, devised a way to transform nitrogen in the air into fertiliser, using what became known as the Haber-Bosch process. But Haber's place in history is controversial. He is also considered the ""father of chemical warfare"" for his years of work developing and weaponising chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War One. Fritz Haber's work weaponising poisonous gases during World War One was extremely controversial Plants need nitrogen: it is one of their five basic requirements, along with potassium, phosphorus, water and sunlight. In a natural state, plants grow, they die, the nitrogen they contain returns to the soil, and new plants use it to grow. Agriculture disrupts that cycle: we harvest the plants, and eat them. From the earliest days of agriculture, farmers discovered various ways to prevent crop yields from declining over time: by restoring nitrogen to their fields. Manure has nitrogen. So does compost. The roots of legumes host bacteria that replenish nitrogen levels. That is why it helps to include peas or beans in crop rotation. But these techniques struggle to fully satisfy a plant's appetite for nitrogen. Add more, and the plant grows better. That is exactly what Fritz Haber worked out how to do, driven in part by the promise of a lucrative contract from the chemical company BASF. That company's engineer, Carl Bosch, then managed to replicate Haber's process on an industrial scale. Both men later won Nobel Prizes - controversially, in Haber's case, as many by then considered him a war criminal. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You canlisten onlineand find information about the programme's sources orsubscribe to the programme podcast. The Haber-Bosch process is perhaps the most significant example of what economists call ""technological substitution"", where we seem to have reached some basic physical limit, then find a workaround. For most of human history, if you wanted more food to support more people, then you needed more land. But the thing about land, as Mark Twain once joked, is that they are not making it any more. Haber and Bosch provided a substitute: instead of more land, make nitrogen fertiliser. It was like alchemy. ""Brot aus Luft"", as Germans put it, or ""Bread from air"". From air and quite a lot of fossil fuels. First of all, you need natural gas as a source of hydrogen, the element to which nitrogen binds to form ammonia. Then you need energy to generate extreme heat and pressure. Schematic diagram of the Haber-Bosch process to make ammonia from nitrogen Haber discovered that was necessary, with a catalyst, to break the bonds between air's nitrogen atoms and persuade them to bond with hydrogen instead. Imagine the heat of a wood-fired pizza oven, with the pressure you would experience 2km under the sea. To create those conditions on a scale sufficient to produce 160 million tonnes of ammonia a year - the majority of which is used for fertiliser - the Haber-Bosch process today consumes more than 1% of all the world's energy. That is a lot of carbon emissions. And there is another very serious ecological concern. Only some of the nitrogen in fertiliser makes its way via crops into human stomachs, perhaps as little as 15%. Most of it ends up in the air or water. This is a problem for several reasons. Compounds like nitrous oxide are powerful greenhouse gases. They pollute drinking water. They also create acid rain, which makes soils more acidic, disrupting ecosystems, and threatening biodiversity. Phosphorus and other nutrients can create marine dead zones such as this one in the Gulf of Mexico When nitrogen compounds run off into rivers, they likewise promote the growth of some organisms more than others. The results include ocean ""dead zones"", where blooms of algae near the surface block out sunlight and kill the fish below. The Haber-Bosch process is not the only cause of these problems, but it is a major one, and it is not going away. Demand for fertiliser is projected to double in the coming century. In truth, scientists still do not fully understand the long-term impact on the environment of converting so much stable, inert nitrogen from the air into various other, highly reactive chemical compounds. We are in the middle of a global experiment. One result is already clear: plenty of food for lots more people. If you look at a graph of global population, you will see it shoot upwards just as Haber-Bosch fertilisers start being widely applied. Again, Haber-Bosch was not the only reason for the spike in food yields. New varieties of crops like wheat andricealso played their part. Still, if we farmed with the best techniques available in Fritz Haber's time, the earth would support about four billion people. Our current population is around seven and a half billion, and growing. New strains of rice such as the IR8 variety first planted in 1967 also boosted the global food supply Back in 1909, as Haber triumphantly demonstrated his ammonia process, he could hardly have imagined how transformative his work would be. On one side of the ledger, food to feed billions more human souls; on the other, a sustainability crisis that will need more genius to solve. For Haber himself, the consequences of his work were not what he expected. As a young man, he converted from Judaism to Christianity, aching to be accepted as a German patriot. Beyond his work on weaponising chlorine, the Haber-Bosch process also helped Germany in World War One. Ammonia can make explosives, as well as fertiliser. Not just bread from air, but bombs too. When the Nazis took power in the 1930s, however, none of this outweighed his Jewish roots. Stripped of his job and kicked out of the country, Haber died, in a Swiss hotel, a broken man.

Tigers sack director of rugby Cockerill,"Leicester Tigers never missed out on reaching the Premiership semi-finals under Richard Cockerill Leicester Tigers have sacked director of rugby Richard Cockerill after nearly eight years in charge. The 46-year-old has been on the Premiership club's coaching staff since 2004, took over as head coach in 2009 and became director of rugby in 2010. ""It is with great sadness and regret that I leave my position. I still believe that I am the right person to lead the team,"" Cockerill said. Head coach Aaron Mauger will take over on an interim basis. Tigers' achievements under Cockerill Leicester won three Premiership titles under Cockerill and were twice runners-up Leicester were runners-up in the European Cup in Cockerill's first season in charge and won the LV Cup in 2011-12 Tigers are fifth in the Premiership, 15 points adrift of leaders Wasps having lost five of their 12 league games so far this season. They were beaten 16-12 by Saracens on New Year's Day. Cockerill, who has spent 23 of the last 25 years of his career with Tigers, said he ""respected the board's decision"" to make a change they see as being ""in the best interests of the club"". He added: ""This club has made me the person and the coach I am today and I will never forget what they have done for me. I will miss being part of the Tigers family."" Last month, following the 18-16 Champions Cup win over Munster, Cockerill said reports claiming he faced the sack and that described the coaching structure at Leicester Tigers as toxic were""rubbish"". Listen: Cockerill sacking 'a sad day for Leicester' Listen: 'Lancaster would be a very good choice for Leicester' Former England and Tigers hooker Cockerill spent 10 years with the club as a player from 1992 before returning to Welford Road as an academy coach. After two spells in interim charge he was appointed full-time head coach in April 2009, with Tigers winning the Premiership title and reaching the European Cup final in his first season in the role. Leicester have never failed to reach the Premiership semi-finals under Cockerill and as well as winning the final in 2008-09, they were also victorious in 2009-10 and 2012-13. Tigers chairman Peter Tom CBE said: ""We thank Richard for his loyal and dedicated service as a player, coach and director of rugby. He has a great passion for the club and for the game of rugby, and has shared in many massive occasions with the Tigers. ""The club always has aspirations to contest the major honours in the game and that remains unchanged but the board believes this is the right time to make a change."" As a player, hooker Cockerill made 262 appearances for Tigers, winning five league titles, two domestic cups, two Heineken Cups and he also played 27 times for England. BBC Radio Leicester commentator and ex-Tigers fly-half Bleddyn Jones I am not surprised. Tigers cannot stand the fact they are in fifth position and quite a bit away from the top four; they want to be top two and won't get there this season. They haven't been there for the last three or four seasons and that is one of the reasons that Tigers have reluctantly had to say goodbye to Richard. His record is second to none. He is man and boy with the Tigers and if you cut him in half he would be Tigers colours through and through.

SportTigers sack director of rugby Cockerill2 January 2017 (12:59:48),"Leicester Tigers never missed out on reaching the Premiership semi-finals under Richard Cockerill Leicester Tigers have sacked director of rugby Richard Cockerill after nearly eight years in charge. The 46-year-old has been on the Premiership club's coaching staff since 2004, took over as head coach in 2009 and became director of rugby in 2010. ""It is with great sadness and regret that I leave my position. I still believe that I am the right person to lead the team,"" Cockerill said. Head coach Aaron Mauger will take over on an interim basis. Tigers' achievements under Cockerill Leicester won three Premiership titles under Cockerill and were twice runners-up Leicester were runners-up in the European Cup in Cockerill's first season in charge and won the LV Cup in 2011-12 Tigers are fifth in the Premiership, 15 points adrift of leaders Wasps having lost five of their 12 league games so far this season. They were beaten 16-12 by Saracens on New Year's Day. Cockerill, who has spent 23 of the last 25 years of his career with Tigers, said he ""respected the board's decision"" to make a change they see as being ""in the best interests of the club"". He added: ""This club has made me the person and the coach I am today and I will never forget what they have done for me. I will miss being part of the Tigers family."" Last month, following the 18-16 Champions Cup win over Munster, Cockerill said reports claiming he faced the sack and that described the coaching structure at Leicester Tigers as toxic were""rubbish"". Listen: Cockerill sacking 'a sad day for Leicester' Listen: 'Lancaster would be a very good choice for Leicester' Former England and Tigers hooker Cockerill spent 10 years with the club as a player from 1992 before returning to Welford Road as an academy coach. After two spells in interim charge he was appointed full-time head coach in April 2009, with Tigers winning the Premiership title and reaching the European Cup final in his first season in the role. Leicester have never failed to reach the Premiership semi-finals under Cockerill and as well as winning the final in 2008-09, they were also victorious in 2009-10 and 2012-13. Tigers chairman Peter Tom CBE said: ""We thank Richard for his loyal and dedicated service as a player, coach and director of rugby. He has a great passion for the club and for the game of rugby, and has shared in many massive occasions with the Tigers. ""The club always has aspirations to contest the major honours in the game and that remains unchanged but the board believes this is the right time to make a change."" As a player, hooker Cockerill made 262 appearances for Tigers, winning five league titles, two domestic cups, two Heineken Cups and he also played 27 times for England. BBC Radio Leicester commentator and ex-Tigers fly-half Bleddyn Jones I am not surprised. Tigers cannot stand the fact they are in fifth position and quite a bit away from the top four; they want to be top two and won't get there this season. They haven't been there for the last three or four seasons and that is one of the reasons that Tigers have reluctantly had to say goodbye to Richard. His record is second to none. He is man and boy with the Tigers and if you cut him in half he would be Tigers colours through and through.

British singer invited to Trump inauguration,"Rebecca Ferguson says she's been asked to perform at Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony. The singer tweeted she would ""graciously accept"" the invitation from the American president-elect if she can perform Strange Fruit. ""[It's] a song that has huge historical importance, a song that was blacklisted in the United States,""she posted,external. Strange Fruit was originally recorded by Billie Holiday but was written as a poem by Abel Meeropol. A sample from Nina Simone's 1965 rendition was used on Kanye West's Blood on the Leaves. The words of Strange Fruit describe the lynching of African Americans in the early 20th century: ""Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze"". It's been described as one of the first great protest songs. Rebecca wrote that the song ""speaks to all the disregarded and down trodden black people"" in the US and if she can sing it she will ""see [Mr Trump] in Washington"". The 2010 X Factor runner-up released an album covering Billie Holiday songs in 2015, although Strange Fruit does not feature on the track listing.

Sherlock beats Queen in festive ratings,"Benedict Cumberbatch is back as Sherlock for the new three-part series More than eight million people tuned in to see the return of Sherlock on BBC One on Sunday, overnight ratings show. That means it was the UK's second-most watched programme of the festive period - behind the New Year's Eve fireworks, which were watched by 11.6 million. The biggest Christmas Day audience came for the Queen's Christmas message,which was seen by 7.7 million people. The first episode of the fourth series of Sherlock had an average audience of 8.1 million. This video can not be played Benedict Cumberbatch talks about the new Sherlock series The episode, entitled The Six Thatchers, was based on Arthur Conan Doyle's story The Adventure of the Six Napoleons and involved six smashed statues of the former UK prime minister. It ""reached new heights of action and emotion"", according toThe Guardian's Mark Lawson,external, who saw parallels between Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes and James Bond. He wrote: ""The episode felt very Bond overall - Holmes has never done so much running towards or away from explosions."" The Telegraph's Ben Lawrence,externalwrote that it was ""a dizzying triumph of complex plotting (although the much-talked-about demolition of six busts of Margaret Thatcher was an unnecessary piece of iconoclasticism) and beautifully choreographed action scenes"". Martin Freeman has made Watson ""a nuanced, compelling character"", he said, but added: ""It is, of course, Cumberbatch's show and here he looked tanned and lean, ready for action but heading, ultimately, for a fall. ""Cumberbatch is an actor who invests so much in every scene that watching him is an exhilarating experience and an almost psychological exercise."" The programme's overnight ratings were slightly down compared with those for last year's New Year's Day one-off Sherlock special, which had 8.4 million. Elsewhere in Sunday's BBC One schedule, Mrs Brown's Boys was watched by an estimated 6.7 million, while six million saw Ronnie and Roxy Mitchell's demise in EastEnders. EastEnders narrowly lost the battle of the soaps to Coronation Street, which attracted 6.2 million on ITV.

Papers focus on George Michael's 'torment',"The death of George Michael continues to dominate several newspaper front pages. The Daily Mirror leads withan exclusive interview,externalwith Michael's partner, Fadi Fawaz, who reveals he slept in a car on the night the star died. It also says Mr Fawaz denied he was responsible for several posts that appeared on his Twitter account claiming the singer ""wanted to die"" and had ""finally managed it"" after ""trying to kill himself several times"". Mr Fawaz said his Twitter account had been hacked and that the account has since been shut down. The new year attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul was, for the Daily Mail, the ""massacre of the beautiful people"". The Guardian says the venue has earned a reputation asthe place to be seen,externalamong Turkey's young, secular elite - attracting footballers from the top Turkish sides, TV stars, tourists, business people and celebrities from around the world. Thei's story,externalsays that for those who had wished for a new year that would see a diminution of the bloody attacks that have convulsed Turkey in recent months, their hopes survived unblemished for less than ninety minutes. An hour after the gilded youth of Istanbul and well-heeled Middle East revellers had cheered the advent of the new year,the Times reports,external, the gunman began shooting and the noise turned from music to gunshots and screams. It was by no means Turkey's worst terrorist incident,the Daily Telegraph says,external, but the timing and death toll among foreign nationals who were in the city to celebrate the arrival of 2017 seems intended to rip the heart out of Istanbul's tourism, and it must not be allowed to do so, the paper adds. The prime minister is tooverhaul the honours system,externalafter making clear that controversial appointments in the new year list had been put forward under David Cameron's tenure, the Times reports. According to the paper, Theresa May wants the honours system to have five priorities. It will recognise those who boost the economy; support young people in achieving their potential; aid social mobility; help local communities; and tackle discrimination. The government's plans fornew garden villages in England,externalmake the lead for the Daily Telegraph. It says Theresa May's first announcement of 2017 suggests her government will make housing one of its main priorities in the year ahead. The ambitious scheme has won support from campaign groups - it adds - despite earlier concerns that the developments would lead to urban sprawl and put added pressure on infrastructure. The Queen's absence from church for the second weekend in a row because of a lingering heavy cold is the Daily Mail's main story. The paper has been told that she's on the mend, but has developed a hacking cough. A source is quoted as saying: ""Her Majesty doesn't like going to church with a cough because she thinks it's off-putting for other celebrants."" ""Get better soon, Ma'am"",external, is the paper's headline. The Guardian led with a warning from Britain's top GP thatsurgeries will have to stop seeing patients,externalat some points during the week unless the government abandons its drive to guarantee access to family doctors across the weekend. Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, tells the paper that ministers are ignoring the lack of demand among patients to see GPs at weekends and the serious shortage of family doctors. A number of papers also criticise the annual increase in rail fares that comes into effect today. The Daily Mail reports that even if the train companies provided a decent service, theÂ£600 average increase,externalin the cost of annual season tickets since 2010 would be monstrous. At this time of disruption by the unions, it adds, the rises are simply inexcusable. Inthe Telegraph's,externalview, while it's reasonable for people to be asked to fork out more for a better service, it's galling to have to stump up more for trains that don't arrive or are jam-packed if they do. The Daily Mail also runs with a story saying cabinet ministers have urged Theresa May tothreaten the House of Lords with a ""bloodbath"",externalif peers seek to frustrate Brexit. According to the paper, senior Tories say the Prime Minister should stand ready to threaten the upper chamber with abolition or a huge cut in numbers and powers. An un-named minister tells the paper: ""We will be sending a one-line bill to the Lords on triggering Article 50. If they send it back to the Commons, it should be returned with a second line added - the abolition of the Lords"". A Daily Telegraph investigation reveals that British expatriates are flying to the UK from their Spanish homesto earn lucrative sums,externalas carers for the elderly, amid a spiralling crisis in social care. The paper says thousands of expats are funding lifestyles in the sun by jetting in for fortnightly placements to take sole charge of the vulnerable, with just a few days' training. According to the report, many of the recruits have no professional qualifications or previous experience and are driven by financial desperation after a downturn in the Spanish economy, or to supplement income from businesses such as bars and restaurants. A familiar sight in some newspapers at this time of year is pictures of new year revellers worse for wear after a night of partying and drinking in city centres across the country. TheDaily Express,externalsays many partygoers drank so much they were unable to stand or speak. ""While some young women struggled to stay upright in towering high heels, others gave up completely and simply lay down, befuddled."" ""Many cared little for their modesty"", the paper goes on, and they braved ""the cold and pouring rain in outfits more suited to high summer than mid-winter."" Writing in the Daily Mail,Sarah Vine,externalexpresses her concern in an article headlined ""Pictures that make me weep for today's young women"". The Sun has pictures of what it callsthe ""bedlam"" in Hull,external- and quotes one reveller as saying it wasn't a good advert for the UK City of Culture.

Tigers part company with Cockerill,"Leicester Tigers never missed out on reaching the Premiership semi-finals under Richard Cockerill Leicester Tigers have sacked director of rugby Richard Cockerill after nearly eight years in charge. The 46-year-old has been on the Premiership club's coaching staff since 2004, took over as head coach in 2009 and became director of rugby in 2010. ""It is with great sadness and regret that I leave my position. I still believe that I am the right person to lead the team,"" Cockerill said. Head coach Aaron Mauger will take over on an interim basis. Tigers' achievements under Cockerill Leicester won three Premiership titles under Cockerill and were twice runners-up Leicester were runners-up in the European Cup in Cockerill's first season in charge and won the LV Cup in 2011-12 Tigers are fifth in the Premiership, 15 points adrift of leaders Wasps having lost five of their 12 league games so far this season. They were beaten 16-12 by Saracens on New Year's Day. Cockerill, who has spent 23 of the last 25 years of his career with Tigers, said he ""respected the board's decision"" to make a change they see as being ""in the best interests of the club"". He added: ""This club has made me the person and the coach I am today and I will never forget what they have done for me. I will miss being part of the Tigers family."" Last month, following the 18-16 Champions Cup win over Munster, Cockerill said reports claiming he faced the sack and that described the coaching structure at Leicester Tigers as toxic were""rubbish"". Listen: Cockerill sacking 'a sad day for Leicester' Listen: 'Lancaster would be a very good choice for Leicester' Former England and Tigers hooker Cockerill spent 10 years with the club as a player from 1992 before returning to Welford Road as an academy coach. After two spells in interim charge he was appointed full-time head coach in April 2009, with Tigers winning the Premiership title and reaching the European Cup final in his first season in the role. Leicester have never failed to reach the Premiership semi-finals under Cockerill and as well as winning the final in 2008-09, they were also victorious in 2009-10 and 2012-13. Tigers chairman Peter Tom CBE said: ""We thank Richard for his loyal and dedicated service as a player, coach and director of rugby. He has a great passion for the club and for the game of rugby, and has shared in many massive occasions with the Tigers. ""The club always has aspirations to contest the major honours in the game and that remains unchanged but the board believes this is the right time to make a change."" As a player, hooker Cockerill made 262 appearances for Tigers, winning five league titles, two domestic cups, two Heineken Cups and he also played 27 times for England. BBC Radio Leicester commentator and ex-Tigers fly-half Bleddyn Jones I am not surprised. Tigers cannot stand the fact they are in fifth position and quite a bit away from the top four; they want to be top two and won't get there this season. They haven't been there for the last three or four seasons and that is one of the reasons that Tigers have reluctantly had to say goodbye to Richard. His record is second to none. He is man and boy with the Tigers and if you cut him in half he would be Tigers colours through and through.

The A-Z of Brexit,"""Brexit means Brexit"" is something we've all heard many times. But it's still not entirely clear what it actually means. If you're feeling lost, help is at hand: here's our handy guide to the A-Z of Brexit. Known as the ""exit clause"", Article 50 sets out the process the UK will go through to leave the European Union. It sets the clock ticking on negotiations, giving a deadline of two years before the UK's membership of the EU ends - unless all EU member states' leaders vote unanimously to extend that period. It says that any deal negotiated between the UK and EU will come down to a vote of European leaders, where it will need to be passed by a qualified majority and passed by the European Parliament. Previously tasked with cleaning up the continent's financial services,Michel Barnieris the European Commission's chief Brexit negotiator. He's a politician with a long career as an MEP, vice-president of the centre-right European People's Party, French foreign minister, and European commissioner. Mr Barnier is also known for not being keen on giving interviews in English. At the height of the eurozone crisis he implied this policy was led by caution, saying: ""One wrong word, and we could move markets."" TheEuropean Council,externalis made up of the 28 EU heads of government, plus the European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. The council doesn't make laws, but the heads of EU governments can vote on the union's political direction through a process that weights their votes according to the size of the country they represent. Although Prime Minister Theresa May represents the UK on the council, she won't attend any meetings or votes it holds on the subject of Brexit negotiations after Article 50 is triggered. More properly known as the Department for Exiting the European Union, DexEU is the government department responsible for the UK's negotiations with the EU. It is led by David Davis. The department will conduct negotiations on Brexit with the EU, as well as talking to individual states about bilateral agreements after the UK leaves the EU. Academic Sara Hagemann, who is Danish, said she had been told she could no longer advise the government on Brexit. Leave campaigner Michael Gove made waves during the EU referendum campaign when he claimed Britain had""had enough of experts."",external More recently, academics at the London School of Economics said that Foreign Office officials had told them non-UK nationals wouldno longer be able to brief the departmenton issues relating to Brexit. The FCO insisted that it was a misunderstanding, saying ""We will continue to take advice from the best and brightest minds, regardless of nationality."" Trading with other countries without customs duties, import bans or quotas is the goal of International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who has previously said that free trade ""transformed the world for the better"". EU membership means the UK isn't allowed to make its own deals with other countries - deals like the Ceta free trade agreement signed between Canada and the EU after seven years of negotiations. But opponents of free trade deals like Ceta and the proposed TTIP deal between the EU and US have claimed that the deals harm workers' rights and damage environmental safeguards. Nuuk, the capital of Greenland Greenland provided the closest thing Brexit has to a precedent when it left the European Economic Community - a precursor to the EU - in 1982. Greenlandic objections to its membership to the EEC, as part of the Kingdom of Denmark, centred on the Common Fisheries Policy which allowed European trawlers to fish in its waters. Since then, Greenland's fishermen have fared better than its fur industry, which since 2010 has been barred from selling any seal products within the EU. The style of Brexit favoured by campaigners like Nigel Farage, ""hard Brexit"" would entail the UK leaving the European single market. It would allow the British government more direct control over policies on immigration, but may mean tariffs on exports to the EU. It's often presented as the opposite of ""soft Brexit"", which sees the UK remain in the EU single market - potentially having to accept EU rules like freedom of movement as a part of the deal. Nigel Farage said 23 June should go down in history as the UK's ""independence day"" in commemoration of the vote to leave the EU. But apetition,externalcalling for a national holiday on 23 June received a negative response from the government, which said it had ""no current plans to create another public holiday"" because of the economic cost of days off. Former Prime Minister of Luxembourg and President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker will be a key figure during the Article 50 negotiations with the EU. Before the vote to leave,Mr Juncker warned the UKthat ""out is out"", and that there would be no way back. The European Commission is the EU body that will carry out much of the negotiating between the EU and UK, before a final deal is approved by the European Council's 27 non-UK EU leaders. It's reported the Russian government of Vladimir Putin may stand to gain from Brexit, as the UK's decision to leave the EU could distract from its sanctions against Russia. FormerBulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev saidthe UK had supported a harder line on EU-Russian relations. Mr Plevneliev said: ""If Brexit is going to be a divorce, we should stay the best possible and the closest friends."" This video can not be played Lord Kerr says Article 50 was drawn up in the event of a coup Ratified in 2009, the Lisbon Treaty aimed to streamline the EU's decision making process following a period of expansion that saw membership grow. It created the post of President of the European Council (currently held by Poland's Donald Tusk) and expanded the use of the proportional qualified majority voting system that awarded votes according to the size of a member state. The Lisbon Treaty also contains Article 50 -drafted by Scottish peer Lord Kerr-  the mechanism that dictates the way in which a member state can leave the EU. The leader of the EU's largest member state, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has said ""Brexit negotiations won't be easy"" but that there's no need for the EU to be ""nasty"" to the UK during negotiations. German leader since 2005, Ms Merkel will face a re-election battle in 2017. Her decision to welcome more than one million refugees to Germany is likely to be a big issue in that campaign. Norway isn't a member of the EU, but is a part of the European Economic Area, the European Free Trade Association and the Schengen Zone. Norway has been mooted as one of the models a post-Brexit UK could emulate after a ""soft Brexit"", but Prime Minister Erna Solberg said the UK""wouldn't like"",externalfinding itself on the fringes of the EU after Brexit. The Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban is a strident critic of many aspects of the EU. Since the UK voted to leave, he has spoken of the opportunity it presents for change, saying: ""We are at a historic cultural moment. There is a possibility of a cultural counter-revolution right now."" In October Mr Orban held a referendum of his own, calling on Hungarian voters to reject the EU's refugee quotas. A member of the European Council, Mr Orban will be one of the EU leaders voting on the UK's Brexit negotiations. Nothing to do withthe colourof your UK passport, this is the process by which London-based financial institutions can operate in the rest of the EU. Passporting became a concern for global banks after the referendum, as they feared they could lose their rights to access the European single market. International Trade Minister Mark Garnier suggested that such a thing could happen. Whenasked,externalif passporting could end and be replaced by something else, he replied: ""Exactly."" This video can not be played US President Barack Obama: ""UK is going to be in the back of the queue"" President Barack Obama enraged Leave campaigners before the referendum with his suggestion that a post-Brexit UK would find itself at the ""back of the queue"" to negotiate trade deals with the US. Boris Johnson called his intervention ""hypocritical"", while Tory MP Dominic Raab called him a ""lame-duck president"". In-coming US president Donald Trump has been much more positive... See entry below, for T. The Commons Library says the position of UK citizens in the EU - and vice versa - after Brexit remains uncertain. It does, however,suggest,externalthat people already using their freedom of movement to live in other EU countries are unlikely to be affected, as it would be difficult - practically and politically - to change their residency rights retrospectively. The UK could give up its membership of the European Union, but still have access to the single market. This would make trading with other European countries easier, as there would be less change after Brexit. The price would most likely be some kind of free movement agreement - meaning that EU citizens could still move to the UK to live and work, even after Brexit. The incoming American president is a fan of Brexit, even saying in the days before his election victory over Hillary Clinton that a win for him would be""like Brexit plus-plus-plus."" He has befriended leading Brexiteer Nigel Farage - who was the first foreign politician to meet the president-elect after his win over Hillary Clinton. Some in the UK, including Mr Farage, hope a Trump administration will move the UK to the front of the queue for trade deals with the US, heralding a new economic special relationship. The UK's nations and regions weren't united in voting leave - Scotland, Northern Ireland and London voted to remain in the EU. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hassuggestedshe will hold a second independence referendum if the UK goes for a hard Brexit. In Northern Ireland there are mixed responses. Some fear the return of border controls - the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny is planning an a summit on the issue. Meanwhile, the border town of Newry has seen aninfluxof shoppers from the Republic, keen to take advantage of the euro's increased spending power. Former Belgian Prime Minister and the European Parliament's lead Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, has suggested he is unwilling to negotiate on the free movement of people, saying: ""European values will never be up for negotiation."" He has already held a preliminary meeting with David Davis (See entry for D, above) which the two said afterwards ""a good start"". And he has since warned that the European Parliament would negotiate directly with the British if EU leaders ""don't take the parliament's role seriously"". Home SecretaryAmber Rudd sparked controversywith an announcement that firms would have to publish the percentage of overseas workers they hired -  although the government later rowed back on the idea. There is also uncertainty over what could happen to UK employment rights, as some things like agency workers' rights and limitations on working time are guaranteed by EU law. Police figuresshowed a risein religious or racially motivated hate crimes in the weeks following the EU referendum. In response, the government launched a newhate crime action plan,externalto combat the increase. Or more specifically, the yeast-based spread Marmite. The falling value of the pound after the UK voted to leave the EU led to arow between Tescoand the manufacturer, Anglo-Dutch corporation Unilever, which wanted to raise the price of Marmite and other products. The companies resolved their differences, which came after Unilever said the weak pound made selling its wares in the UK less profitable. The capital of Croatia, the EU's newest member state. The Croatian Foreign Minister Miro Kovac expressed his concerns about the effect Brexit could have on the EU's growth plans,saying,external: ""We also want stability in southeastern Europe and we will work so that Brexit does not have too much effect on the enlargement process."" Croatia's fellow Balkan states Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia are all currently in the process of joining the EU.

Can Corbyn ride anti-elitism wave?,"Can Jeremy Corbyn reach out beyond Labour Party members? ""Our job is to make Jeremy Corbyn the Left's Donald Trump"", whispered a political adviser over cold sausage rolls at Labour's annual Christmas party, ""Trump shows if we take the anti-establishment message and run with it, anything is possible"". This most unlikely of strategies, to replicate the electoral tactics of a man Mr Corbyn has called divisive and wrong, is clear. If you have lost trust in politicians, well, don't go for fake anti-elitism. Go for the real thing. Corbyn. The Labour leader's office are convinced that the anti-elitist wave which delivered Jeremy Corbyn the leadership twice is the same that brought President Trump and Brexit. How do they ride that wave? Efforts will be made in the early part of the year to roll out radical retail policies on the economy and the cost of living, with an attempt at every turn to avoid the potentially sticky wicket of Brexit. Whether he will be able to sell his message beyond Labour's 515,000 members remains to be seen but we should see a return to the campaign rallies and speaking tours that played such a part of his summer 2015 leadership bid. Can Jeremy Corbyn ride the wave of anti-elitism that delivered Donald Trump the US presidency? Harnessing the energy of large crowds and speaking direct through TV into the living rooms of the general public, rather like one Donald J Trump, will be just one part of a new turbo-charged media strategy. This will be first put to the test in the Copeland by-election. The resignation of Jamie Reed, one of Mr Corbyn's most prominent critics, will mean the party having to defend a 2,500 majority in a seat which Labour has held since 1935. It should be an easy hold for an opposition party taking on a mid-term government; after all a governing party hasn't made a by-election gain, without a defection, for 56 years. The bookies think the Conservatives have a good chance of taking the seat, but after outperforming many people's expectations in Oldham West and Royton, it would be foolish to write Labour off six weeks before voting begins. Andy Burnham's mayoral bid in Manchester will be among high-profile contests Next year's set of local elections will take place on 4 May and will see elections to English, Scottish and Welsh councils, as well as the first set of elections for newly created regional mayors. The most high-profile race for Labour will be Andy Burnham's attempt to become the first directly elected mayor of the Manchester region. But there will be more competitive elections in the West Midlands, where MEP Sion Simon faces a challenge from Andy Street - the former managing director of John Lewis - who is standing for the Conservatives. Outside of the inaugural mayoral contests, there will be elections to 34 councils in England. This will be a challenging environment for the Labour Party; back in 2013 the party made substantial gains and is facing elections in swathes of safe Conservative shire areas. The 2013 vote share of 29% was actually two points behind their final general election result and a replication of this result would not be too surprising. The danger, perhaps, would be if Labour fell into third place behind a resurgent UKIP and Conservative Party. Should that happen, then it is likely the carefully maintained silence of Mr Corbyn's opponents within the Parliamentary Labour Party will break. Perhaps the most consequential battles will be outside national electoral contests and within the movement itself. Len McCluskey will face re-election for general secretary of Unite in April. Few individuals have been as vital as the leader of the UK's biggest union to preserving Jeremy Corbyn's position. Len McCluskey faces a battle for re-election as Unite general secretary Moderates are organising hard to elect Gerard Coyne, a close friend of Tom Watson, someone who, they think, could deliver thousands of votes for a moderate candidate in a future leadership contest. Momentum, the powerful grassroots organisation that supports Mr Corbyn's leadership, will also face internal challenges in 2017. Since the party conference in Liverpool, a bitter dispute has broken out over who should hold the reins of power. The organisation is facing internal squabbles over its future direction with a concerted effort to remove Corbyn ally Jon Lansman from his leadership role. Momentum tearing itself apart could seriously imperil Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to make Labour a movement. This will be, of course, with a Parliamentary party doggedly against him but maintaining a Trappist silence following Mr Corbyn's 2016 re-election as Labour leader. In all of this the key question for Jeremy Corbyn will be whether he can translate the powerful populist movement that took him to the leadership of his party in 2015 and 2016 onto a national stage. Polling, with Labour at its lowest ebb since the dog days of Gordon Brown's government, suggests that it is a tall order. But if 2016 has taught us anything, it is to expect the unexpected.

What next for Paul Nuttall's UKIP?,"Paul Nuttall, left, is hoping to push Labour hard in UKIP's post-Farage era Is UKIP the most successful party in the history of British politics? Or an amateurish rabble which has lost its reason to exist?  Or maybe a bit of both? The UK Independence Party was founded in 1993 with one main goal: to take the UK out of the European Union. Back then, the idea was way outside the political mainstream. But on 23 June the country narrowly voted to leave and Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to implement the people's decision. So what is the point of UKIP after Brexit? Leader Paul Nuttall will have three main priorities for the year ahead as it faces a potentially tricky set of local elections, defending many of the council seats won in the 2013 surge: Holding the government's ""feet to the fire"" over Brexit Putting a stop to the infighting that has long plagued UKIP, especially since the referendum Eating away at Labour's vote, particularly in northern England. ""Brexit means Brexit,"" says Mrs May, but as of yet, we don't know many more details. She says she will trigger Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty before the end of March, starting two years of divorce negotiations. But there are many unresolved questions. Should the UK continue to pay into the European budget and accept the free movement of people, in exchange for closer economic ties? Or should it pursue what some call a ""clean"" and others a ""hard"" Brexit, severing the link more definitively? UKIP is firmly in the second camp. ""The British people voted for Brexit, so we could control our borders, leave the single market, and create our own laws,"" the party says. It will be on hair-trigger alert in 2017, ready to campaign against anything it sees as Brexit backsliding from the government. Despite its remarkable successes in 2016, at times UKIP resembled a circular firing squad. Nigel Farage, UKIP's longest-serving leader and best known public face, does not get on with the party's only MP Douglas Carswell, or former deputy chair Suzanne Evans. Diane James last just 18 days as UKIP leader Diane James resigned as leader in October only 18 days into the job, causing Mr Farage to take over on an interim basis before Mr Nuttall's election. It is hard to keep track of the various alliances and schisms. Ideological differences exist within UKIP like in all parties. But often the differences seem to be more personal than political. The party's most ignominious fight - whether it  was a literal one or not - of 2016 saw one-time leadership favourite Steven Woolfe in hospital in October following an alleged ""altercation"" with fellow MEP Mike Hookem at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Mr Woolfe subsequently left the party, saying it was ""ungovernable"" and in a ""death spiral"". But an internal report by the party said it could not ""verify"" whether a fight had taken place, and Mr Hookem denied striking his colleague. If UKIP is to remain a serious force, Mr Nuttall will have to contain these sorts of tensions. After comfortably winning his leadership election in November, two days shy of his 40th birthday, he has appointed a team from across the party. Things seem more stable than at any time since the referendum. For now. UKIP began as a thorn in the side of the Conservative Party. But in recent years the party has had Labour voters in its sights, gaining ground in northern England and Wales. Lots of Labour-supporting areas voted Leave in June, even though the party officially backed Remain. Also, many of those who did not vote in the 2015 general election did in fact turn out for the EU referendum - and according to NatCen research a lot more of them backed Leave than backed Remain. Mr Nuttall, who has working-class Northern roots, thinks these voters are closer to UKIP than Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party on policy areas such as immigration, the EU and welfare. UKIP will be hoping to win some of its support in 2017, causing existential problems for Labour. A by-election early in the new year in Copeland in Cumbria, which voted Labour in 2015 and Leave in 2016, will give an early sign of whether this approach is working. After one of the craziest years in British political history, the party will be hoping for a calmer 2017. But with UKIP, you can never quite be sure what lurks around the corner.

Lib Dems: Bouncing back in 2017?,"A by-election win in Richmond Park was welcome news for the Liberal Democrats In 2015, the Liberal Democrats had a near death experience. But 2016 was the year there were signs of life - will 2017 be their year of resurrection? The vote to leave the EU has breathed fresh life into the UK's most pro-European major party. Last year they had a sensational by-election victory in Richmond Park, a modest increase in national polls, and won a clutch of council seats at by-elections. In 2017 they will be hoping to pick up more council seats and improve their national standing. As the most full-throated advocates of the 16m people who voted Remain, they have a fresh opening. But 2016's successes come from a low base. The party was nearly annihilated in 2015. They now have nine MPs and struggle to get airtime. Leader Tim Farron is secure in his job, following a year in which Labour, the Conservatives and the Greens all held leadership elections. UKIP even managed two. Prime Minister Theresa May is fairly popular with the public and Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn is unpopular, polls suggest. But Mr Farron has another problem - almost half of voters have no opinion at all. The road to a Lib Dem recovery will be a long one, if it happens at all. The Lib Dems will be hoping to capitalise on anti-Brexit feeling After the referendum, Guardian columnist Rafael Behr spoke of ""an unrecognised state - call it Remainia - whose people were divided between the Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems; like a tribe whose homeland has been partitioned by some insouciant Victorian cartographer"". The Lib Dems are hoping to win over some of these 16m lost tribesmen. Even though most backed Remain, Conservatives MPs are now largely united behind Theresa May's ""Brexit means Brexit"" stance. Labour MPs are divided. Though most backed Remain, many represent areas which voted to Leave. They do not want to be seen as circumventing voters' wishes. The Lib Dems have a unique approach: they want a second referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal. At the moment, there is no demonstrable appetite to refight the battles of June and hold another EU vote. But Mr Farron thinks that could change in 2017. The prime minister says she will kick-start divorce proceedings by the end of March. We know few details about the deal she wants but should it disappoint, the Lib Dems hope to pounce. Sarah Olney's stunning by-election win on 1 December in Richmond Park was the best piece of news the Lib Dems had in years. She became the ninth Lib Dem MP, and the only woman. But this leafy south-west London seat, with more university graduates than anywhere else in Britain, is far from typical. The national referendum result was narrow but Remain votes piled up in big cities, affluent suburbs and Scotland. The Leave vote was more evenly spread. Although most MPs backed Remain, a large majority of constituencies voted to Leave. A Lib Dem win in Richmond Park does not make a national Brexit backlash. The party also picked up lots of seats at council by-elections in 2016. Further gains are likely in May's local elections. The party did terribly when the same seats were up for grabs four years ago. Nick Clegg was punished by voters for going into coalition with the Conservatives When the then Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg joined David Cameron in 2010 to form the country's first coalition government since World War Two, it was a bold move. But voters brutally punished Mr Clegg for his gamble. The party had not fallen below 17% of the vote in general elections since its formation in 1988, But it collapsed to 8% in May 2015, losing 49 of its 57 seats. The number of Lib Dem councillors halved between 2010 and 2015. Recently they have remained in the high single figures and low teens. One recent poll put them at dizzy heights of 14%. After some successes in 2016, Liberal Democrats should enjoy their seasonal break. But there are two reasons they should not get carried away. First, they were brutally punished for going into coalition government and are now doing better, far from the levers of power. If they form a government in the future, they may well be punished once more. Second, the party's liberal internationalist beliefs have taken a pounding over the past two years. Their core values are more unpopular than at any time in recent history. Farron hails 'shock' by-election win Analysis: Was by-election vote on Brexit? Farron calls for second UK-EU referendum.

Why Japanese adults are getting wrapped up,"All wrapped up If you don't like tight spaces, you might want to look away now. Otonamaki, which directly translates to ""adult wrapping"", is a Japanese therapeutic method meant to alleviate posture problems and stiffness and it is gaining traction around the country. The idea for Otonamaki comes from the practice of Ohinamaki, which sees babies wrapped up in cloth in a similar fashion. This is meant to help with their physical development. Each session lasts around 20 minutes. A large sheet of white breathable cloth is used And each session lasts around 20 minutes Which is meant to help the person relax and become more flexible ""The reason why Otonamaki was invented was because some people were worried about babies struggling or feeling claustrophobic while being wrapped up,"" says Orie Matsuo of Kyoko Proportion, one of several companies that offer Otonamaki to its customers. ""We thought if adults were rolled up like them, they could experience how good it feels."" And if customer feedback is anything to go by, Otonamaki is certainly proving successful. ""It looks cramped but it doesn't feel tight at all,"" said a 40-year-old customer of Kyoko Proportion. ""It's the opposite of that. Afterwards I felt an improvement in my shoulders and back."" ""It felt so good I almost fell asleep. My neck and lower back were relaxed, "" said another customer. ""I want my husband to learn [how to do] it."" But not everyone is convinced. ""This looks so creepy,"" said one user on Twitter. Another compared it to something out of a horror film. ""This looks like the horror movie 'Audition'"", said this user on Twitter Otonamaki was first invented by famous Japanese midwife Nobuko Watanabe, who also invented a popular maternity belt used commonly in Japan. The massage is offered mainly to women, some of whom come to see it as an alternative to massage or physical therapy. Before (L) and after (R)- Otonomaki is said to help improve posture Ms Matsuo says Otonamaki allows users to make their hip, leg and shoulder muscles more flexible. ""By pushing your shoulders and legs together, your body gets straightened and removes the pain of your back, lower back and hip joint,"" she tells the BBC. ""Some of our clients come to treat their pelvis after childbirth, or others to fix bow legs."" Poland buys famed artworks at discount Tourists take homeless man to Sweden India opens first transgender school The company first introduced the practice in 2015, and so far, some 70 people have experienced Otonamaki with them. But it might take a while for the practice to catch on, it's certainly not mainstream yet. ""I've never heard of Otonamaki or tried it myself"", said Director of the Fukumoto Japanese Holistic Clinic, Shimpei Fukumoto. ""I understand what they are trying to do but it's not traditional physiotherapy."" As an anti-stress technique many of those who have experienced it, testify to its effectiveness. However, it still feels some way from being part of established physical therapy procedure. ""I totally disagree with the treatment method,"" said Mr Visvanathan Ravi, Senior Physiotherapist at Hallmark Physiotherapy. ""They way they were wrapped up may lead to muscle strains if not in the short term, but the long term. ""If a person stays in the position for 30 minutes, I'm sure there will be spine problems. It's not advisable to do this treatment."" Reporting by Mariko Oi and Yvette Tan. Checking into a hotel staffed by robots.

Sound of 2017,"This video can not be played The Sound of 2017: Nadia Rose Young UK rapper Nadia Rose hastaken fifth place on the BBC's Sound of 2017 list, which showcases emerging artists for the coming 12 months. Alongside the likes of Little Simz and Lady Leshurr, she's part of a groundswell of female voices in the male-dominated world of UK hip-hop and grime. Two years ago, the 23-year-old was studying for a degree while working 12-hour shifts in a betting shop to make ends meet. She would scribble down lyrics in her spare time as her male contemporaries - Section Boyz, Bonkaz and her cousin Stormzy - were starting to break through. Realising the job was holding her back, she packed it in and started to make her name with her savage, witty lyrics and sense of fun. Her breakthrough video, Station, was shot, without permission, at a local railway station, with Nadia dancing nonchalantly on the tracks as a train pulled in. More recently, the colourful, funky single Skwod saw the rapper take over the streets of London with a girl gang, complete with body-popping Beyonce choreography and all. She spoke to the BBC about her upbringing in Croydon, the rappers she looks up to, and why she read the dictionary as a child. 5.Nadia Rose 4.Jorja Smith 3.Raye 2.Rag 'N' Bone Man 1.Ray BLK For people who haven't heard you, describe what they're missing. My sound is just really bassy, hard-hitting, dancehall, hip-hop infused fun. I call it magic. And funny, too. Your lyrics have proper punchlines. Yeah, quite a few! Do you work hard on them? It varies, depending on what it is I'm creating. A lot of the time I don't even write the bars. It's all in my head, really. The rapper says her verses are ""full of fun, full of energy"" Apparently you used to read the dictionary as a child? That is true, yeah! What's your favourite word? Antidisestablishmentarianism. It's one of the longest words in the English language. Have you ever tried to get it into a song? I've been asked and I'm definitely working on it! It might not fit on a single cover, but it could definitely fit in a lyric. What triggered your interest in words? It was learning about synonyms that did it for me. I was like, ""Wow, you can use another word to mean the same thing as this word?"" It just went crazy from there. This video can not be played Nadia Rose performs Tight Up for BBC Music Sound of 2017 When did you first perform in public? Oohâ¦ The first time I performed in public? To be fair, growing up I was always performing. It didn't have to be on a stage. It could be a family event and I would just make it about me, somehow. I would perform anywhere. Going up in a lift, on the side of a road, wherever. One of your teachers said you were the most entertaining pupil she ever had. Yeah, that was touchingâ¦ And actually, I do agree. There's a fine line between ""entertaining"" and ""troublemaker"". How often did you end up on the wrong side? Ha ha! Some days it did tip over into what some teachers would call ""disruptive"". But I thought it was creative. What did you study at university? Music and music management. It was very helpful when signing my deal - because there were things I definitely wouldn't have had a clue about prior to taking that course. At the same time as studying, you were working at a betting shop and making music in your spare time. Did you get any sleep? Nah, barely. All my free time was up in the studio. I just had a feeling I was giving music my spare time, rather than my time. It got to a point where it felt very weird and I thought, ""This is all the wrong way round. I'm getting too comfortable at work and keeping music as a little side thing."" I needed to give it my all to actually get the results that I wanted. The video for Skwod captures the star's charisma and personality Your dad was an MC too. How instrumental was he in your musical education? He played a huge part in all of this. He had quite an eclectic music taste, but there was loads of Sizzla, Buju Banton, a lot of the old-school reggae guys. That's where that part of my musical personality comes from. Who were the MCs you listened to growing up? In terms of MCs and rappers, it was definitely a lot of the hip-hop legends, like Busta, Eminem, Missy, Lil Kim. But I wasn't just inspired by MCs. I was a huge Spice Girls fan, too. Which one were you? They called me Wavey Spice! [Wavey is London slang for cool/good.] There weren't many female MCs in the UK to look up to. Well, there was Ms Dynamite. Seeing what she was able to achieve was inspiring. How do you feel about the current wave of female MCs? It's a good time and hopefully it'll continue to build. Why do you think it's happening now? Probably me! I bringing them with me! I saw afreestyle you recorded for SB:TV,externalwhere you said you'd been told to ""get naked and wear thongs"" to sell records. Was that based on real experience? It's from personal experience as well as people that have told me stories. As women in this male-dominated field, we've all been approached with something along those lines at one point. It happens, but we have to be able to overcome it. Rose risked life and limb to make the video for Station I need to ask about the video to Station... I was worried you might die on the train tracks. A few people were, including my mum. How dangerous was it? It was literally by chance that we survived. There was no real planning. We didn't even get permission. Recently I found out we got the train times wrong. The train that would have been coming on the other side was actually due at the time we got off the tracksâ¦ We thought we had a good five minutes spare, but we had seconds. Network Railhas asked the BBC to point out that, while they applaud Nadia Rose on her success, they were concerned to see her music video set on the working railway. A spokesperson said: ""Trespassing on the railway is highly dangerous and can maim or kill you. As the operator of the railway, Network Rail has a responsibility for keeping passengers and visitors safe and we take these responsibilities very seriously. No one wants to stop people from having innocent fun but they should do so safely without putting their lives at risk."" The other notable thing about that video, and Skwod too, is how much charisma you have. Were you always a natural in front of the camera? Yeah, basically. I'm in my element. I'm doing the thing I love and I'm being able to share that with people. Nadia Rose: ""I definitely need a Grammy under my belt"" This summer, you got to go to Rio for a grime showcase at the British embassy. What was that like? That was amazing. I loved Rio. Just to be part of the Olympics was extra-special, again with my squad. I look forward to going again. You'd expect the British embassy to choose something more boring, like Sting... Well, I'm actually a huge Sting fan. I wouldn't call him boring, but I get what you mean. It was definitely good to bring my sound over there. So what's your plan for 2017? It's going to be filled with a lot of music, a lot of visuals. If you thought this year was the Nadia Rose takeover, you have no idea! What's your biggest ambition?

India's year,"In India, 2016 has been a year of political surprises, alcohol ban and heated debates about nationalism, and plenty of other news in between. The BBC's in-house cartoonist Kirtish Bhat picks five news events to give his humorous take on 2016. Two news events in February were all about freedom. One firm launched theworld's cheapest smartphone, priced at 251 rupees ($3.67; Â£3), and called it Freedom 251. At the same time,police arrested some studentsin Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University for allegedly raising anti-India slogans, and demanding ""freedom"" for Kashmir from Indian rule. The students denied the allegations, but they were charged with sedition. Later, they were freed on bail. India's flamboyant businessman Vijay Mallya made his fortune selling beer under the Kingfisher brand and branched out into aviation, Formula1 racing, and Indian cricket.But he incurred huge debtsbecause of the failure of his airline. Many have criticised banks for their inability in recovering the debt from Mr Mallya, who denies any wrongdoing.  He is currently living in the UK, and hasn't returned to India despite repeated summons by the authorities. When the chief minister of the eastern state of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, promised during his election campaign that he would ban the sale and consumption of alcohol if elected, not many thought he would actually do it. But thenhe proved everybody wrong! When Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office in 2014, he promised to change the country.  But his critics say that he has been concentrating more on foreign policy, and travelling the world. In one of the biggest surprises of 2016, Mr Modi on 8 Novemberannounced the scrapping of 500 and 1,000 rupee notesto crack down on corruption and illegal cash holdings known as ""black money"". The sudden announcement made many people's cash worthless.

'Bread from air',"It has been called one of the greatest inventions of the 20th Century, and without it almost half the world's population would not be alive today. A hundred years ago two German chemists, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, devised a way to transform nitrogen in the air into fertiliser, using what became known as the Haber-Bosch process. But Haber's place in history is controversial. He is also considered the ""father of chemical warfare"" for his years of work developing and weaponising chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War One. Fritz Haber's work weaponising poisonous gases during World War One was extremely controversial Plants need nitrogen: it is one of their five basic requirements, along with potassium, phosphorus, water and sunlight. In a natural state, plants grow, they die, the nitrogen they contain returns to the soil, and new plants use it to grow. Agriculture disrupts that cycle: we harvest the plants, and eat them. From the earliest days of agriculture, farmers discovered various ways to prevent crop yields from declining over time: by restoring nitrogen to their fields. Manure has nitrogen. So does compost. The roots of legumes host bacteria that replenish nitrogen levels. That is why it helps to include peas or beans in crop rotation. But these techniques struggle to fully satisfy a plant's appetite for nitrogen. Add more, and the plant grows better. That is exactly what Fritz Haber worked out how to do, driven in part by the promise of a lucrative contract from the chemical company BASF. That company's engineer, Carl Bosch, then managed to replicate Haber's process on an industrial scale. Both men later won Nobel Prizes - controversially, in Haber's case, as many by then considered him a war criminal. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You canlisten onlineand find information about the programme's sources orsubscribe to the programme podcast. The Haber-Bosch process is perhaps the most significant example of what economists call ""technological substitution"", where we seem to have reached some basic physical limit, then find a workaround. For most of human history, if you wanted more food to support more people, then you needed more land. But the thing about land, as Mark Twain once joked, is that they are not making it any more. Haber and Bosch provided a substitute: instead of more land, make nitrogen fertiliser. It was like alchemy. ""Brot aus Luft"", as Germans put it, or ""Bread from air"". From air and quite a lot of fossil fuels. First of all, you need natural gas as a source of hydrogen, the element to which nitrogen binds to form ammonia. Then you need energy to generate extreme heat and pressure. Schematic diagram of the Haber-Bosch process to make ammonia from nitrogen Haber discovered that was necessary, with a catalyst, to break the bonds between air's nitrogen atoms and persuade them to bond with hydrogen instead. Imagine the heat of a wood-fired pizza oven, with the pressure you would experience 2km under the sea. To create those conditions on a scale sufficient to produce 160 million tonnes of ammonia a year - the majority of which is used for fertiliser - the Haber-Bosch process today consumes more than 1% of all the world's energy. That is a lot of carbon emissions. And there is another very serious ecological concern. Only some of the nitrogen in fertiliser makes its way via crops into human stomachs, perhaps as little as 15%. Most of it ends up in the air or water. This is a problem for several reasons. Compounds like nitrous oxide are powerful greenhouse gases. They pollute drinking water. They also create acid rain, which makes soils more acidic, disrupting ecosystems, and threatening biodiversity. Phosphorus and other nutrients can create marine dead zones such as this one in the Gulf of Mexico When nitrogen compounds run off into rivers, they likewise promote the growth of some organisms more than others. The results include ocean ""dead zones"", where blooms of algae near the surface block out sunlight and kill the fish below. The Haber-Bosch process is not the only cause of these problems, but it is a major one, and it is not going away. Demand for fertiliser is projected to double in the coming century. In truth, scientists still do not fully understand the long-term impact on the environment of converting so much stable, inert nitrogen from the air into various other, highly reactive chemical compounds. We are in the middle of a global experiment. One result is already clear: plenty of food for lots more people. If you look at a graph of global population, you will see it shoot upwards just as Haber-Bosch fertilisers start being widely applied. Again, Haber-Bosch was not the only reason for the spike in food yields. New varieties of crops like wheat andricealso played their part. Still, if we farmed with the best techniques available in Fritz Haber's time, the earth would support about four billion people. Our current population is around seven and a half billion, and growing. New strains of rice such as the IR8 variety first planted in 1967 also boosted the global food supply Back in 1909, as Haber triumphantly demonstrated his ammonia process, he could hardly have imagined how transformative his work would be. On one side of the ledger, food to feed billions more human souls; on the other, a sustainability crisis that will need more genius to solve. For Haber himself, the consequences of his work were not what he expected. As a young man, he converted from Judaism to Christianity, aching to be accepted as a German patriot. Beyond his work on weaponising chlorine, the Haber-Bosch process also helped Germany in World War One. Ammonia can make explosives, as well as fertiliser. Not just bread from air, but bombs too. When the Nazis took power in the 1930s, however, none of this outweighed his Jewish roots. Stripped of his job and kicked out of the country, Haber died, in a Swiss hotel, a broken man.

Power to the burger,"May Chow secretly interned at restaurants to pursue her dream of becoming a chef The humble steamed bun is taking Hong Kong's culinary scene by storm - and scooping up awards along the way. May Chow, the owner of restaurant Little Bao, has just been voted Asia's best female chef by a panel of over 300 experts. The 32-year-old's restaurant serves what she calls Chinese burgers: steamed white buns filled with braised pork belly, fried chicken or fish. And there are even burgers for dessert, in the form of fried buns sandwiched with ice cream. Winning the award is no mean feat, considering Asia's competitive food scene, but the restaurant might not have started at all if Ms Chow hadn't sneaked behind her parents' back. A Chinese burger with braised pork belly She developed a love of cooking from watching her mother cook in Canada - where a typical meal involved serving more than 20 people in the extended family. ""Growing up I told my parents I wanted to be a chef,"" Ms Chow tells the BBC. ""But back then, cooking was considered low-class work, and my parents felt it would be a waste of my education."" The buns are assembled with leek and red onions As a result, Ms Chow studied hotel management at university in the US instead, but says her love for cooking kept calling out to her. By her third year at university, she was ready to take the plunge. ""I didn't tell my parents, but I started interning with restaurants."" That paved her way to becoming a full-time chef at high-end restaurants in Hong Kong. Her ambition didn't stop at being a chef, either. She says: ""The first day I started working at a restaurant, I decided that I wanted to open my own restaurant."" Just a few years later, and after road-testing her dishes at local food markets, Ms Chow opened Little Bao. This video can not be played A novel take on the humble bao Bao means bun in Chinese, and Ms Chow says she drew on her own identity, as a Chinese person who had grown up in North America, when designing her signature dish. ""If you define me, my food is exactly me,"" she says. ""Am I really Chinese? Why do I sound so American?"" ""That bao is me - Chinese but understands American culture - putting [the two sides] together in an honest way."" She says she is happiest with the authenticity of her buns when her mother and grandmother enjoy them. Their approval ""comes from 30 years of eating bao - you have to stand up to that quality check"". Ms Chow's kitchen is full of mouth-watering smells, including fresh meat being grilled and seafood being fried Little Bao sells over a hundred buns each day The buns are cooked in a giant steamer The dish has also proved a hit with Hong Kong diners and she has just opened a Bangkok branch of Little Bao, as well as a beer bar, Second Draught. But there were plenty of challenges in the move to becoming a business owner, including the high rents and high build-out costs in Hong Kong. ""It's almost been like taking a real-life business masters degree,"" she says. ""I've grown a lot over the past three years. At first you get emotional, now you just look at things and try to fix problems."" What does she think of being named Asia's best female chef 2017? It was ""stressful"", and she jokes that her first reaction, when she learnt of the award, was: ""Oh, I don't want it."" The logo for Little Bao is a smiling baby There is some pressure that comes with the title, because ""there really are not that many female chefs [and] local chefs in that field to be talked about"". She's aware that some will find it strange there is an award specifically for female chefs, but also appreciates how the award has given her a platform to raise awareness about the industry. She's vocal about what she thinks needs to change to encourage more women, and local Hong Kongers, to join the trade. Being a chef ""is a very labour intensive job. The environment is hot, sticky, typically not a favourable environment."" ""Do we really need to work 70 hours a week? Are women allowed to have babies when they're [working] in the kitchen? It's so intense - it's not like a desk job. There are things that need to be improved."" ""Shanghai women are fierce and loud"" There isn't always ""the freedom to dream"" in Hong Kong's competitive education system, she adds. In the past, vocational jobs were seen as jobs for people who couldn't be doctors or lawyers, so there was ""no recognition"" for jobs in the food and beverage industry. Still, she argues that the internet, Michelin guides and growing awareness about fine dining has helped, while local chefs are increasingly learning from restaurants abroad. On a more personal level, she credits her mother with part of her determination to do well in a male-centric field. ""Stereotypical Shanghai women are fierce and loud,"" she says with a grin. Her mother's influence, she adds, ""let me be bold. I never grew up thinking I had to limit myself"".

Toy trouble,"While black dolls can be bought online, they are absent from the shelves of many British toy stores An internet search for black dolls will bring up about 20 million results in less than a second - but parents have discovered the toys to be increasingly hard to find on the shelves of High Street stores. Why is this? Three-year-old Sofia-Lily is the only mixed-race girl in her playgroup. She often points out this difference to her mother Abbey Potter, who has been trying to reassure her child, partly through dolls that look like her. ""They make her feel like it's OK to look the way she does,"" said Mrs Potter, who is from Nottingham. But sourcing these toys is not straightforward. ""I have found a lot of trouble finding dolls of any other ethnicity than white,"" she said. ""I got a Cabbage Patch doll from eBay - it took me so long to find one and I think it was from America. ""My parents go to a lot of different countries like Mexico and Jamaica and they get Sofia-Lily dolls from these places. ""On her first holiday, we went to Spain and I found these dolls that were hard-bodied and smelt like cocoa butter. The next year, we found dolls with curly and different types of hair. ""I would say to big toy manufacturers that they need to evolve and they need to produce more dolls of different varieties: race, disability, size. If they don't, it could affect our children, because they grow up having been affected by all sorts of things."" A dark-skinned doll, carried by Johnathan Thurston's daughter Frankie at last year's Australian Rugby League final, was seen as a moment of inclusion and diversity Despite the revolution of internet shopping, some families' finances do not stretch as far as a bespoke broadband package - and on the High Street, they can find their retail options are significantly reduced. Abbey Rose, 32, who has 11-year-old and four-year-old girls and a three-year-old boy, said a lack of black dolls could stunt a child's emotional development, leading them to be ""less affectionate"". ""My four-year-old daughter said she wanted a baby doll for Christmas,"" said the black mother-of-three from Nottingham. ""I said: 'Do you want a white or black one?' She said a white one because 'they were prettier'."" Abbey Potter, pictured with daughter Sofia-Lily, has called on toy manufacturers to ""evolve"" and produce more black dolls But why are black dolls and toys absent from the shelves of many stores in the UK? Is the demand just not there? First, let's run some numbers. Census data for 2011 from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed a population in England and Wales of 56,075,912. About 14% of these people are from non-white backgrounds - so is that enough of a market for toy companies to make big bucks? Given that estimated 14% equates to nearly eight million people, the answer would seemingly be yes. Additionally, this somewhat unscientific calculation is assuming white parents solely buy white dolls for their children. While most people in England and Wales are from white backgrounds, parents believe there is more than enough demand for a greater number of black toys to feature on the shelves of high street stores But it would appear that a lack of demand is the underlying narrative from toy firms in the UK. An email sent in October 2015 by an executive at Zapf Creation - the firm behind the famous Baby Born and Baby Annabell dolls - said the sales of an ethnic version of its Baby Annabell went ""step-by-step down"" from 1998 to 2013. The executive said at the end of 2013 it was decided that production of this doll would stop as of 2014. ""As a public limited company, we are forced to make decisions like that if business figures do not justify to keep a product in the range,"" the executive said. A Zapf Creation spokeswoman told the BBC: ""Whilst the black version of the Baby Annabell doll was discontinued due to lack of demand, the black version of the Baby Born Interactive doll is still in production and available to all UK toy retailers. However, some retailers take the decision not to stock all versions of the dolls and accessories due to shelf space constraints."" Lecturer Sheine Peart said white dolls and ethnic dolls should be ""side by side"" on the shelves Speaking at the annual Toy Fair in London, Peter Ireland, from Bigjigs Toys Ltd, said the importance of black dolls was clear, but added a firm's ability to sell them might depend on the company's size. ""There's no reason why we shouldn't stock black dolls... we have far more white dolls in our range as the sales on these are greater than those of black dolls, but if we don't stock any then people are never going to get black dolls,"" he said. ""If you're [a business that is] all over the world, then you've got a bigger market, but if you're just in the UK, your market's a bit limited."" Numerous toy companies were contacted several times by the BBC. The Entertainer declined to comment, while Disney, Smyths Toys and Toys R Us failed to respond. An organisation that represents toy manufacturers, the British Toy & Hobby Association, said in a brief statement: ""Toy makers offer a diverse range of dolls, including different ethnicities."" Last year, Mattel introduced itsnew generation Barbies, a moment hailed by black rapper, actor and producer Queen Latifah as ""the industry catching up with what the public wants"". But a walk around four major toy store departments in ethnically-diverse Nottingham - John Lewis, Toys R Us, The Entertainer and Disney - garnered a total of three types of black doll on sale. BBC News came up short in its quest to find black toys and dolls in Nottingham's John Lewis store A black doll by Barbie manufacturer Mattel was found inside Toys R Us In the same store, a dark-skinned DC Super Hero Girl was found - but the vast majority of the toys were white No black toys were found in The Entertainer store in Nottingham One type of black doll - based on Princess Tiana in The Princess and the Frog - was on sale at the Disney store in Nottingham BBC journalist Khia Lewis-Todd, who has made a film on this subject, said the toys currently on offer ""do not support"" her daughter's culture. ""Carrying outthe doll test,externalat a school and youth group in Nottingham and going to the Toy Fair opened my eyes in terms of how some children portrayed toys of ethnicity, and how some suppliers approach them,"" she said. ""Some suppliers believe they are important, but if something doesn't sell as well, why should they continue to make it? Some critics have argued this is putting profit over the importance of what children need to see."" Accurately representing physical features is just as important as offering dolls of different skin colours, according to the Race Equality Foundation's Jane Lane Jane Lane, from the Race Equality Foundation, believes the issues are not solely to do with colour. ""The key issues, I think, are not only a range of skin colour differences but accurate depictions of physical features,"" she said. ""Mouth, lip shapes, nose and eye shapes and hair texture. ""The main point about black dolls is they are, for a child, white or black, a true three-dimensional representation of real people - unlike book pictures and jigsaws. ""They need to be accurate because our society is... racist and dolls need to counter this by being positive and not stereotypical of some mythical concept."" Toy manufacturers should work closely with local communities to properly assess demand, says lecturer Sheine Peart Sheine Peart, a lecturer at Nottingham Trent University, said a lack of black dolls ""marginalises"" black children. ""If I want to have black figures, Lego figures provide that, as do Playmobil, and I can buy a black Barbie and a black male doll called Steve - who's the equivalent of Ken,"" she said. ""I can buy them, but I have to hunt them out if I want to buy them as a parent. I've never seen this black Steve anywhere but I've seen Kens in the shops - it should almost be side by side. ""If there's a black child, and they see no black toys, it almost creates a colonial environment and that effectively says, 'there's no place for me'. ""It positions the black child as an outsider and not integral to society. It marginalises them. Psychologically, that probably will have some impact."" Ms Peart has called on schools across the country to help kick-start a change. ""The dolls need to be marketed more, displayed more and advertised more, and supermarkets can't put them on the shelves unless the manufacturers are producing them,"" she said. ""I'd like to see schools ensure they have a stock that is available and a stock that is replenished. ""I would also like to see manufacturers work with youth groups, schools and other members of community groups so they can find out [the need]. Making things happen is not just a case of money and availability, it's also a case of will.""

Fireworks mark start of Hull 2017,"This video can not be played Fireworks were launched over the Humber to celebrate Hull's year as UK City of Culture A spectacular display of fireworks and giant video projections has launched Hull's year as UK City of Culture. More than 25,000 people descended on the city's waterfront for the display, which organisers claimed to be bigger than London's New Year's Eve show. Historic buildings across the city became backdrops for projections illustrating the history of the area. Organisers said they hoped to attract more than one million extra visitors to Hull during 2017. As it happened: Hull City of Culture 2017 launch The UK has seen several huge events marking the start of the 2017, including fireworks anda paradein London, Newcastle'sWinter CarnivalandEdinburgh's Hogmanay. The fireworks were launched from two barges in the Humber In Queen Victoria Square in Hull, thousands of people watched Made in Hull, which saw images of the city's maritime and aviation connections beamed onto the walls of several buildings. Across the city, shops were turned into art spaces and The Deep aquarium carried a giant projection about the people of the port city. The light show told the story of Hull over the past 100 years Historic buildings came to life with stunning animations and archive footage. Normally empty shop windows became cabinets of curiosities. A paved city yard was filled with the noise of a football crowd. There was a rave in an underpass. Hull wants and needs to get everybody on board for its City of Culture year from the start, so opening 2017 with a free, open-air extravaganza on the streets was a very good move. The eight art installations in the city centre were not distant or impenetrable - they tried to connect with the city and the people, whether that was through Invisible Flock bringing the surprisingly compelling crowd noise from a Hull City match to Zebedee's Yard, or Urban Projections letting people step into their own instant artworks in the shadow of the tidal barrier. The centrepoint was Zsolt Balogh's beautiful film weaving together the story of the city, which was projected onto the blank facades of the City Hall, Ferens Art Gallery and Maritime Museum. It ended with the words ""We are Hull"" writ large - at which point a cheer went up in the crowd. Hull aims to win over culture sceptics Is Hull a city on the rise? Why City of Culture will change Hull The fireworks display, called In With A Bang, included 15,000 fireworks and was accompanied by music from some of the city's most famous musical exports. Martin Green, chief executive of City of Culture, said: ""I want nationally and internationally people to see that that this is a fantastic city with great stories, great people and a lot to offer. ""Because every city deserves its moment in the limelight and 2017 is ours."" Several shop windows in the window were used for temporary art installations Hull is the second city to be given UK City Culture status, following Derry-Londonderry in 2013. The city was selected in 2013 from a shortlist which included Dundee, Leicester and Swansea Bay. More than Â£30m is being spent on the year's events andÂ£25m has been invested in revamping the city centreand refurbishing the Ferens Art Gallery and the city's main theatre. The city will host the Turner Prize and will see hundreds of concerts and other performances throughout the year. The Deep aquarium was transformed by a giant animated projection Organisers promise at least one cultural event every day during 2017 Former Hull Labour MP Lord Prescott said he hoped the event would be a catalyst for change in Hull.

'It was like the Four Horsemen arriving',"The festive football action keeps coming, with no sign of the Chelsea juggernaut slowing down. The Premier League leaders extended their winning run to 13 matches, but Liverpool and Arsenal remain in pursuit, with Manchester City out of the top four after Tottenham's thumping win at Watford. At the other end of the table, Swansea and Sunderland were both humbled, while champions Leicester got a much-needed win. Schmeichel made five saves to help Leicester to a 1-0 win over West Ham; only his third clean sheet of the season There seems to be a correlation between Kasper Schmeichel being in goal and Leicester City keeping clean sheets. They haven't kept that many this season and that's probably why the Foxes are mightily relieved to have their number one back between the sticks. Injuries are an occupational hazard for any footballer, and some might argue you can't enjoy the full experience of top-flight football until you have felt the misery of a long-term injury and the sheer euphoria of the return. Of course Kasper's father Peter (an infinitely better keeper, by the way) would have schooled him in the arts of football survival. Considering the way Leicester have been defending this season, that may come in very handy. Valencia completed a higher share of his passes against Middlesbrough than any other United player (98%) and attempted the most crosses (12) I was very tempted to select Bournemouth's Simon Francis at right-back, but I was so impressed with Manchester United's comeback that I had to go for Antonio Valencia. The game against Middlesbrough was going away from United and they needed a few cool heads to see them through. If there is one player they can count on, it's Valencia. The full-back is as safe as houses. Valencia was one of those players who shut the game down for United once they got their noses in front. In the final minutes, Valencia had no hesitation launching the ball into the crowd in order to relieve the pressure and kill the game. Sometimes even exceptional defenders can't afford to be too proud to do what needs be done. Cahill made more clearances (seven) than any other Chelsea player against Stoke and also scored the gameâs opening goal What a thumping header by the Chelsea captain. Victory over Stoke made it 13 consecutive wins for the Blues and there was a touch of inevitability about the outcome of this match. Did anyone really believe Stoke could pull this off? To be fair, the Potters went to Stamford Bridge and gave the Blues a game and were even the better side in the early exchanges, but there was only one winner. It's not common for Stoke to concede goals from a corner but the way in which a Chelsea quartet descended upon Cesc Fabregas' beautiful floated corner was like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I've never before seen a Stoke defence bulldozed down like that on a set-play. It was Cahill who scored the goal but it was Chelsea's heavy mob that contributed to Stoke's total destruction. No Leicester player made more clearances in their win over West Ham than Morgan's eight It has been some time since Wes Morgan made my team of the week. Last season he was practically ever-present, but Leicester's preoccupation with the Champions League seems to have created a Premier League paralysis. However, against a stubborn West Ham they managed a rare clean sheet, which was the basis upon which last season's title success. Claudio Ranieri's celebration at the end of this fixture was telling enough, and without these three points Leicester would have been in big trouble. Morgan's contribution was central to their clean sheet and it was just as well. Milner had more touches of the ball than any other Liverpool player in their win over Manchester City (86) James Milner is making me eat my words. When I saw him in Liverpool's worst performance of the season against Burnley, I accused the England man of being a square peg in a round hole. A right-footed midfield player playing left-back? He looked awkward and was exposed. Admittedly his team-mates weren't much help that day, but since then he has grown into the part beautifully. He has been Liverpool's best player during the past four games and never gave Manchester City's Raheem Sterling a kick on his return to Anfield. In fact, the battle between Milner and Sterling was the highlight of the game for me. It was like a throwback to the 1970s, when you had players like George Best and Ron Harris going at it for 90 minutes, only without the brutality. I must admit, Jurgen Klopp has certainly got that one right. Pogba has been directly involved in five goals in his past four Premier League appearances (two goals, three assists) It's been a great Christmas period for Paul Pogba. He was inspirational against Sunderland and a match-winner against Middlesbrough. Please don't think for one minute that his header against Boro that gave United all three points was easy. He didn't panic and steered the ball in the only place Victor Valdes could not retrieve it. I've seen those last-ditch efforts float wide of the post all too often, but Pogba absolutely nailed it. He's getting there. Willian notched his first Premier League brace and has equalled his goal tally for last season in the competition (five) The finish with his left foot was brilliant and the one he scored with his right was even better. Chelsea had just conceded for the second time in this match against Stoke but on each occasion the Blues raised their game. The touch from Diego Costa that set up Willian to score his first goal was sensational, but the Brazilian still had much to do and did it with calculated precision. However, it was Fabregas who cut Stoke's throats with a glorious through ball for Willian, who smashed it past visiting goalkeeper Lee Grant. Liverpool boss Klopp and Manchester City counterpart Pep Guardiola spent the week stroking each other's artichokes prior to their meeting at Anfield, but neither of them can hold a candle to Antonio Conte and what he is doing with Willian and company at the moment. Phillips has been involved in 10 goals in his 18 Premier League games this season (four goals, six assists). Winning at Southampton was a very impressive performance by West Brom and in particular Matt Phillips, who is having an excellent season. He took his goal brilliantly and from that moment there was no coming back for the Saints. It's been a miserable holiday period for Southampton since their controversial defeat by Tottenham and they never really looked like they had recovered from that mauling in time for the match against the Baggies. What Tony Pulis has going at The Hawthorns is nothing short of miraculous. The purchase of Phillips has been inspired. Alli has scored five goals in his past three Premier League appearances after a run of seven without one Dele Alli is officially 'in the mood'. Just like the oldGlenn Miller classic,,externalthe player looks upbeat and gets you on your feet. From the moment he struck the bar with a cracking drive, I knew he was up for the Tottenham game at Watford. To be fair, this performance against a poor Hornets side was a continuation of his display against Southampton. Spurs have been desperate for someone to share the goalscoring responsibilities with Harry Kane, and Alli has duly obliged. We've now got to get him playing for England the way he is playing for Spurs. Kane has now scored 59 goals in 100 Premier League games, the same number as Thierry Henry had at this stage Harry Kane is back to his best again and he hasn't been looking like that for a while. The first signs of a more relaxed, but purposeful, Kane were against Southampton and he would have capped an excellent performance that night had the earth not moved beneath his feet as he was about to take a penalty. His all-round display against Watford was fantastic, not to mention his two goals. I have had a real dilemma this weekend having seen Diego Costa play one of his best games for Chelsea, Kane playing like he's finally put the European Championship behind him and Andre Gray scoring his first hat-trick. I couldn't have had three more exciting candidates. Sadly, Costa has hit the cutting-room floor but somebody had to. Gray became the first Burnley player to score a Premier League hat-trick It is good to see Andre Gray playing football and scoring goals again. I was more than a little perturbed by the severity of the punishment imposed by the Football Association for his inappropriate Twitter remarks four years earlier. How sad that the governing body had no room for redemption. Much has changed since those remarks and an extremely apologetic Gray seems far more mature than he was four years ago but, nevertheless, he took his medicine like a man. He took his goals against Sunderland in a similar fashion too.

How fertiliser helped feed the world,"It has been called one of the greatest inventions of the 20th Century, and without it almost half the world's population would not be alive today. A hundred years ago two German chemists, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, devised a way to transform nitrogen in the air into fertiliser, using what became known as the Haber-Bosch process. But Haber's place in history is controversial. He is also considered the ""father of chemical warfare"" for his years of work developing and weaponising chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War One. Fritz Haber's work weaponising poisonous gases during World War One was extremely controversial Plants need nitrogen: it is one of their five basic requirements, along with potassium, phosphorus, water and sunlight. In a natural state, plants grow, they die, the nitrogen they contain returns to the soil, and new plants use it to grow. Agriculture disrupts that cycle: we harvest the plants, and eat them. From the earliest days of agriculture, farmers discovered various ways to prevent crop yields from declining over time: by restoring nitrogen to their fields. Manure has nitrogen. So does compost. The roots of legumes host bacteria that replenish nitrogen levels. That is why it helps to include peas or beans in crop rotation. But these techniques struggle to fully satisfy a plant's appetite for nitrogen. Add more, and the plant grows better. That is exactly what Fritz Haber worked out how to do, driven in part by the promise of a lucrative contract from the chemical company BASF. That company's engineer, Carl Bosch, then managed to replicate Haber's process on an industrial scale. Both men later won Nobel Prizes - controversially, in Haber's case, as many by then considered him a war criminal. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You canlisten onlineand find information about the programme's sources orsubscribe to the programme podcast. The Haber-Bosch process is perhaps the most significant example of what economists call ""technological substitution"", where we seem to have reached some basic physical limit, then find a workaround. For most of human history, if you wanted more food to support more people, then you needed more land. But the thing about land, as Mark Twain once joked, is that they are not making it any more. Haber and Bosch provided a substitute: instead of more land, make nitrogen fertiliser. It was like alchemy. ""Brot aus Luft"", as Germans put it, or ""Bread from air"". From air and quite a lot of fossil fuels. First of all, you need natural gas as a source of hydrogen, the element to which nitrogen binds to form ammonia. Then you need energy to generate extreme heat and pressure. Schematic diagram of the Haber-Bosch process to make ammonia from nitrogen Haber discovered that was necessary, with a catalyst, to break the bonds between air's nitrogen atoms and persuade them to bond with hydrogen instead. Imagine the heat of a wood-fired pizza oven, with the pressure you would experience 2km under the sea. To create those conditions on a scale sufficient to produce 160 million tonnes of ammonia a year - the majority of which is used for fertiliser - the Haber-Bosch process today consumes more than 1% of all the world's energy. That is a lot of carbon emissions. And there is another very serious ecological concern. Only some of the nitrogen in fertiliser makes its way via crops into human stomachs, perhaps as little as 15%. Most of it ends up in the air or water. This is a problem for several reasons. Compounds like nitrous oxide are powerful greenhouse gases. They pollute drinking water. They also create acid rain, which makes soils more acidic, disrupting ecosystems, and threatening biodiversity. Phosphorus and other nutrients can create marine dead zones such as this one in the Gulf of Mexico When nitrogen compounds run off into rivers, they likewise promote the growth of some organisms more than others. The results include ocean ""dead zones"", where blooms of algae near the surface block out sunlight and kill the fish below. The Haber-Bosch process is not the only cause of these problems, but it is a major one, and it is not going away. Demand for fertiliser is projected to double in the coming century. In truth, scientists still do not fully understand the long-term impact on the environment of converting so much stable, inert nitrogen from the air into various other, highly reactive chemical compounds. We are in the middle of a global experiment. One result is already clear: plenty of food for lots more people. If you look at a graph of global population, you will see it shoot upwards just as Haber-Bosch fertilisers start being widely applied. Again, Haber-Bosch was not the only reason for the spike in food yields. New varieties of crops like wheat andricealso played their part. Still, if we farmed with the best techniques available in Fritz Haber's time, the earth would support about four billion people. Our current population is around seven and a half billion, and growing. New strains of rice such as the IR8 variety first planted in 1967 also boosted the global food supply Back in 1909, as Haber triumphantly demonstrated his ammonia process, he could hardly have imagined how transformative his work would be. On one side of the ledger, food to feed billions more human souls; on the other, a sustainability crisis that will need more genius to solve. For Haber himself, the consequences of his work were not what he expected. As a young man, he converted from Judaism to Christianity, aching to be accepted as a German patriot. Beyond his work on weaponising chlorine, the Haber-Bosch process also helped Germany in World War One. Ammonia can make explosives, as well as fertiliser. Not just bread from air, but bombs too. When the Nazis took power in the 1930s, however, none of this outweighed his Jewish roots. Stripped of his job and kicked out of the country, Haber died, in a Swiss hotel, a broken man.

Future tech,"This video can not be played WATCH: A device that lets children create their own bedtime stories is just one of thousands of new products that will go on show at CES CES provides a first glimpse at the future. Pretty much all of the tech giants attend the vast Vegas expo - either to unveil new products or to clinch deals behind the scene. But in recent years it's been start-ups that have had many of the most eye-arresting and sensational reveals. There are more at this year's show than ever before, thanks in part to crowdfunding. They now have to convince retailers - hunting through the halls for the next bestsellers - that the promise of their concept videos has been delivered upon. This video can not be played WATCH: A start-up offering virtual reality thrills without the need for a headset is one of more than 200 French companies at CES this year Dozens of start-ups are also there thanks to help from governments and other national bodies - France, Israel, Ukraine and the Netherlands all have stands where they'll fly the flag for local talent. But China may make the biggest splash with more than 1,300 registered exhibitors. ""Every year at CES I meet the people who work on the technology that affects our lives and you can see literally every part of the tech industry represented,"" innovation evangelist Robert Scoble told the BBC. Of course, there's a lot of crud too - the challenge is to distinguish the potential hits from the glitch-ridden flops. Below, we have picked what could be some of the week's highlights: CES marks the beginning of a land grab by three of the leading virtual assistants: Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana and the Google Assistant. The companies all want their voice-controlled AIs to power third-party products. And Amazon looks to have the head start. The C by GE table lamp has a central blue ring that responds when Alexa is summoned The headphones specialist OnVocal will be showing off wireless earphones that link up to Alexa, and GE has also preannounced a table lamp that doubles as a speaker powered by Amazon's voice service. Sonos too aims to add the facility to its wireless speakers, though we believe it isn't quite ready to show off its efforts. But don't count the other two out. We know Microsoft isworking with Harman Kardonon a ""premium audio"" speaker, and the firm has teased adding Cortana to other types of products, including toasters. And Google has secured at least one bit of kit at CES - the Aivia speaker - to host its cloud-based intelligence. Aivia says its smart speaker will be equipped with Google Assistant One expert suggested others will also try to gatecrash the party. It's not all about voice though. The French start-up Bixi will be making the case for gesture controls. It will be demoing the final design of a gizmo that lets you control smartphones and tablets with a wave of a hand. This video can not be played WATCH: Bixi's glowing pad lets smartphones and tablets be controlled with a wave of the hand More groundbreaking perhaps is the Blitab, a tactile tablet described as the iPad for the blind. The Austrian innovation produces small physical bubbles in an area above its touchscreen which delivers refresh double lines of dynamic Braille. Blitab plans to show off an Android tablet with a dynamic braille display We're still decades away from having the type of androids seen on TV shows such as Westworld or Humans. But CES is still an opportunity to see how far along more specialised kit has become. London-based Emotech is one to watch. The Olly robot learns over time how best to behave with different users It will unveil Olly - a tabletop bot with its own smart assistant that recognises different household members and adapts it personality to suit each one. The project was developed with help from academics at University College London, Imperial College and Edinburgh University, and has already secured $10m (Â£8.2m) of investment from China. There will also be a range of modular robots. Several companies are backing the concept, which allows users to switch about parts to change skills and manoeuvrability. The Unibot offers changes function depending on which modules are connected to its base Examples will include Modi, a Lego-style kit that lets owners build a bot out of small cubes - each offering different functions such as motors, lights and infra-red detectors. Another is Unibot, a robotic vacuum cleaner that trebles up as a mobile home security camera and an air purifier/humidifier. Meanwhile, OAPs can look forward to Cutii, a robot that resembles an iPad on wheels, which will supposedly become their ""companion"". And there will also be bots that zoom round tennis courts picking up balls, remove droppings from cat litter, and even move physical chess pieces around a board. There will be a range of robots specialising in niche tasks at the show Keep an eye out for Laundroid, too. The Japanese clothes-folding machine raised $60m from Panasonic and others for its giant clothes-folding droid following an appearance at last year's CES. Some have described the idea as ridiculous. But it will be interesting to see if it works well enough to go on sale later this year, as planned. Potential buyers of the Laundroid will have to make sure they have room to install it Health and wearables Pregnancy seems to be one of health tech's preoccupations this year. There is both Ava, a sensor-equipped wristband that apparently alerts women to when they are most fertile, and Trakfertility, a DIY sperm count test that tells an associated app what steps the owner should take to boost their numbers. Ava claims its wearable will help women ""understand"" their bodies better to help them get pregnant And just in case you are tempted to pair off with the wrong partner, Milo Sensors is in town with what it describes as the world's first blood alcohol wearable. It's easy to joke, but health tech is booming and analysts are competing to predict how many billions of pounds it will be worth in a decade's time. The ultimate goal is to create something resembling Star Trek's Tricoder - an all-in-one device that diagnoses any ailment. An Israeli start-up will be showing off a gadget that promises to get us at least partly there. TytoCare says it wants to put ""health in the hands of consumers"" with its diagnostic devices The TytoHome is designed to let families take heart, lungs, throat, abdomen and other organs' readings and send them to their clinicians. Its slogan is a ""check-up without the check-in"", but medics may need convincing. There will doubtless be new twists on the fitness tracker too. It would be unwise to suggest the market for such devices has peaked - Fitbit's app topped Apple's App Store this Christmas, indicating people are still buying them in droves. But a more intriguing development is wearables with built-in airbags. At least two companies at CES are trying to adapt the car's airbag for the human body ActiveProtective is promising to show off a prototype smart belt for the elderly that triggers a cushioning action over their hips if it detects a fall. And Inemotion has developed ski racing clothes with a similar function to prevent injuries on the piste. France's Wair has a different spin on discreet wearable tech with a internet-connected scarf that doubles as an air filter. This video can not be played WATCH: Wair's smart scarf promises cleaner air with a focus on fashion But the question remains whether wearable tech has a profitable future beyond health. There will be more app-laden smartwatches - including the possibility of the first Android Wear 2.0 devices - at the show, but the sector has not been the hit many had predicted. We're also promised the world's first vibrating tight cut jeans that offer their wearers directions without having to look at a screen. Spinali Design's jeans connect to a smartphone to buzz different sides of the wearer's body to direct them to turn left or right If you had asked the experts a decade ago, they would probably have predicted OLED (organic light-emitting diode) TVs would be the norm by now. But the tech has faced several setbacks. It's stubbornly refused to become as cheap to manufacture as hoped, it doesn't go as bright as LED equivalents and some complain that it ""crushes the blacks"" making it hard to distinguish detail in the shadows. Panasonic was once famed for its plasma TVs, now its focus is OLED Even so, OLED retains a wow factor thanks to its ability to control the light of each individual pixel, helping its images to have more ""pop"", and its screens to be ever thinner. Panasonic has hinted it will show off an OLED display at CES that will better handle dim scenes, and there is speculation Sony has similar news. Plus there's reason to believe prices are about to drop. Until recently, LG manufactured all the OLED panels used by itself and other brands. But now BOE - a Chinese company - has a rival component. The question is who will break ranks to adopt it. QLED, UHD, HDR, HLG - OMG!!! - be prepared to get your head round a lot of acronyms if you want to understand the latest TV tech Expect Samsung to make a loud noise about QLED, a new spin on its ""quantum dot"" technology that allows its screens to be brighter than ever before. That's important because of HDR - another acronym you're going to have to get used to. It refers to high dynamic range, which allows images to appear more vibrant and detailed - especially in scenes containing both glints of light and shadows. Dolby claims its version of HDR offers the best picture quality, but most TV-makers have opted to support the open source HDR10 standard instead The problem is that there are three rival HDR standards - HDR10, Dolby Vision and theBBC's forthcoming HLG- meaning the potential for another format war. But it is possible to support all three, so it will be revealing to see if any of manufactures make a commitment to do so with their new screens. It's now relatively cheap and power-efficient to add sensors and wireless data links to products. That's led to an explosion of ideas - some more sensible than others. It's debateable how many of us really need Genican, for example, a device that scans rubbish's barcodes as it is thrown away in order to build up a shopping list of replacement items. Likewise, it's not clear whether an aromatherapy diffuser needs to be smartphone-controlled, even if its scents really boost memory and clean lungs, as claimed. This video can not be played WATCH: A new gadget at CES allows users to change the smell of a room via a tap of an app. Where things get more interesting is when tech genuinely makes lives simpler without requiring too much effort. One way firms are trying to do this is by focusing on the refrigerator. LG has a model that activates a sterilisation process when it senses temperature and/or humidity issues in order to extend food's shelf life. And for those who would prefer to retrofit their existing equipment, UK start-up Smarter Applications has Fridgecam: a device that keeps track of what its owners have in stock and when it expires, sending alerts to buy new items when necessary. The Fridgecam shows owners what's in their fridge and can suggest recipes based on the contents But one expert says if the sector is to achieve its potential, consumers need to be reassured that the risks do not outweigh the benefits. ""In the last 18 months the conversation about security and privacy has moved from the tech pages to the front pages of newspapers,"" said John Curran from the consultancy Accenture. ""To make these devices easy to connect and easy to use, some companies have hardcoded passwords or put no security measures in place, and that made them an easy target. ""At CES we're looking for businesses to be more transparent about what data is being collected, how it's being used and with whom it's being shared. ""And they need to make it easier for consumers to adjust their security settings."" HTC beat Sony and Oculus to bring a virtual reality headset to market in April There are rumours that HTC will unveil a second-generation Vive VR headset at CES - possibly introducing wireless capabilities - but the system is only nine months old, so that seems a tad optimistic. The two other big virtual reality firms - Sony and Facebook's Oculus division - launched their kit even more recently. Even so, there should still be lots of developments. Huawei has just hired Steve LaValle, one of the brains behind Oculus, and the Chinese firm is set to reveal more about its VR plans at the show. It's a safe bet that several third-party headsets previously teased by Microsoft will also be on display. In October, Microsoft disclosed that several firms were working on Windows 10 compatible VR headsets And we will also see the introduction of Fove, a crowdfunded VR headset with eye-tracking abilities, allowing gamers to control action with shifts in their gaze. Fove won't be the only one trying to offer new ways for users to interact with virtual experiences. Fove raised $480,000 for its eye-tracking headset via Kickstarter and plans to start delivering them during the week of CES A foot controller that lets you direct where your character walks, a sensor-laden T-shirt that tracks your torso's movements, and various haptic devices that try to let consumers feel virtual objects are just some of the products with CES stands. With augmented reality - where graphics and real-world views are mixed together - things are still at an early stage. But Asus and others may reveal handsets that include Google's Project Tango depth-sensing technology, adding basic AR capabilities. Most augmented headsets overlay graphics over the real world, but Intel is taking the reverse approach Intel will have more to say about Project Alloy - a headset that lets you see your hands and other real-world objects within VR worlds. And a start-up called Occipital will demo a contraption that uses an iPhone to create something akin to Microsoft's HoloLens mixed-reality headset. While hardware may dominate the headlines, it could be content that determines which products are winners. Occipital's Bridge headset scans the surrounding area to create a digital copy in which the user can interact with virtual characters ""In the US the National Basketball Association recently announced that it will broadcast games in virtual reality,"" noted Mr Curran. ""And as other big media and content companies get involved, they will attract more types of consumers to VR, rather than just the tech-enthused. ""So, I'll be looking to see which platforms the media providers target as they pursue opportunities in this space."" There's going to be a lot of talk and demos of self-driving cars by the big automakers on and off the Las Vegas strip. Rinspeed will be exhibiting a concept vehicle designed for a self-driving future Menawhile, rival chipmakers - including Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm - will be excitedly pitching their processors and 5G chips as the potential heart of the autonomous vehicle revolution. But you'll have to wait for a future CES to find anything road-ready that allows the ""driver"" to really ignore the steering wheel. BMW says the functions of its concept car can be controlled without any physical contact This time round, look instead for new ways to interact with your vehicle. BMW will unveil its HoloActiv Touch system, in which motorists use finger gestures to interact with graphics that project out of dashboard screens. And Continental will demo facial recognition tech that recognises who is driving and adjusts mirror and seat positions accordingly. Faraday Future is also back for a second year to convince sceptics that it can launch an electric car before its funds dry up. Faraday Future has posted teaser videos in which it claims its car can accelerate from standstill more quickly than the Tesla Model X There will also be all kinds of alternative transport ideas including an intelligent scooter that shuts off its power if it detects an accident, a motorised rideable suitcase and the latest evolutions of the hoverboard. And we've still barely scratched the surface. There are zones dedicated to drones, beauty tech and 3D printing. Plus there's room for oddities, such as a device that claims to be able to record smells. AEE will be showing off a ""flying selfie stick"" while Magic Instruments claims people can learn to play its Mi Guitar in minutes The BBC tech team will do its best to keep you across all the major developments from the first press day on Tuesday until the show floors shut on Sunday.

Striking a pose,"After the New Year festivities, what will 2017 hold for countries across Africa? In our series of letters from African journalists, media and communications trainer Joseph Warungu gives a personal guide to some of the key people, places and events to watch out for in Africa in 2017. Africa will go through six human actions this year - it will stand, kneel, squat, bow, fall and then rise again. Here's how. In the group of those who will be standing in Africa in 2017 is Donald Trump. Yes, I know it's an act of treason to associate him with Africa. But when he's sworn in as president, his foreign policy (or tweetplomacy) will have a bearing on our continent. His critics warn that his isolationist stand might mean less attention will be paid to Africa. But it could just force Africans to find solutions from within, by strengthening our institutions, improving infrastructure, governance and security and trading more amongst ourselves. Another man who also takes office in January is Nana Akufo-Addo, the president-elect of Ghana. Ghana's Nana Akufo-Addo (pictured in background in pink, and on T-shirt) takes over in 2017 He's tried to enter Flagstaff House (the presidential residency) through the ballot box as the New Patriotic Party candidate since 2008. Now that he has the keys, Ghanaians will wait to see how he delivers his pledge of one district, one factory, lest he becomes one man, one term. And then there's the state of emergency in Ethiopia, which still stands. It was put in place last October following violent protests. The government says the security situation has improved save for some clashes in the northern part of Amhara region. Some 9,000 people detained under the state of emergency have been released and the government says it could lift the emergency before its six-month period is over. There are two prominent men who will be kneeling before voters to ask for a job. Paul Kagame has been president for the last 16 years, but Rwandans appear to want more of him and have voted to remove the term-limit barrier. In August, Mr Kagame will therefore use his constitutional right to ask for a new employment contract. Rwanda's Paul Kagame (L) and Kenya's Uhuru Kenyatta are both seeking re-election in 2017 In the same month, his Kenyan neighbour Uhuru Kenyatta will also be reapplying for his job. Last September, while warning the main opposition leader Raila Odinga to mind his own party and leave the ruling Jubilee party alone, President Kenyatta famously said: ""â¦ as you continue to search for a seat and salivate, we are feasting on the meat"". It will be clear in August whether Kenyans will give Jubilee more time to feast or turn the party itself into mince meat. Joseph Warungu: ""The Nigerian economy... enters 2017 in the squat position"" The African Union has been searching for a new Chief Executive Officer and will fill the position in January. Three men and two women from Botswana, Kenya, Chad, Senegal and Equatorial Guinea will fight it out to replace the outgoing South African Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, as Chair of the AU Commission. Now to some situations and people who can't decide whether to stand or sit. The Nigerian economy has caught its nastiest stomach bug in more than two decades. And so it enters 2017 in the squat position. A combination of factors including a crash in the global price of oil, which Nigeria relies a lot on, and a fall in the naira, the country's currency, contributed to the sizeable contraction of the economy in 2016. The anger and frustration among the people was aptly captured by this online comment from one Nigerian in November: ""We are now going into depression and deep S***! Buhari has himself to blame for unfortunately being a gentleman!"" Nigeria's economy has a lot of ground to make up Over in The Gambia, Yahya Jammeh is no gentleman - he's chosen to squat at State House. He lost the presidential election to Adama Barrow and publicly conceded defeat. A little later, the thought of leaving the seat he has called his own for the last 22 years overpowered him and he changed his mind. Africa and the world have asked him to go home, but he is defiant. As his last day in office approaches on 19 of January, the same force he used to gain power in 1994 could be used to relieve him of his office. There are three notable people who will be bowing out of office in 2017. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first elected female head of state in Africa, is coming to the end of her second and final term of office in Liberia. One of those waiting on the touchline to join the succession race is football star George Weah. The former AC Milan and Chelsea striker failed to score in the 2005 presidential tournament but hopes 2017 will be his year. Angolans will have a chance to replace the only man they've known as president for nearly 40 years. Many young Congolese are hoping President Kabila will go without a fight Although Jose Eduardo dos Santos has announced he'll step down, his blood will still flow through the veins of power and the economy in Angola. His daughter, Isabel, heads Sonangol, the state oil company and is considered by Forbes to be Africa's richest woman, while his son, Jose, is chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, Fundo Soberano de Angola. In neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, 2017 could mark the beginning of the end for another family dynasty, which started in 1997 when Laurent Desire Kabila became president after overthrowing Mobutu Sese Seko. Laurent Kabila's son Joseph picked up the reigns after his father's assassination in 2001, and was bent on staying in power until attempts to change the constitution to allow him a third term backfired. Violent street protests have piled pressure on President Kabila to exit from office this year and the issue is bound to continue into the new year. The theme of falling is alive in South Africa. The #FeesMustFall campaign by university students sought to fight the rising cost of higher education and saw violent clashes between police and protesters, disruptions in the university calendar and the arrest of a number of students. 2017 promises more of the same because not only have the fees not fallen, some top universities have announced an 8% increase. And then there's the question of the country's President Jacob Zuma. Hemlines are just one of the many things that could fall in 2017 In December 2017, his tenure as leader of the governing ANC party runs out, but his term as the country's president only ends in 2019. Allowing Mr Zuma to continue as head of state but with the ANC under someone else's leadership could create two centres of power, which could be political suicide. So will the ANC #LetZumaFall as it did President Thabo Mbeki under similar circumstances? 2017 will have answers. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is another that could face the threat of falling in Africa if more African countries continue to withdraw from the Rome Statute. A number of countries have notified the UN Secretary-General of their intention to withdraw, saying the ICC unfairly targets African leaders in its application of international justice. And now to international trends where fashion, like history, has a habit of repeating itself. A quick glance at catwalk signs for 2017 shows that the hems of women's skirts will be falling - to just below the knee. Apparently midi-skirts elongate the figure and flatter the wearer, so this must be a good fall. The Africa Cup of Nations tournament kicks off in mid-January in Gabon and Uganda carries the hopes of East Africa. The region has a terrible record in continental football. Uganda's last appearance in the finals was in 1978 when it lost to Ghana in the final. Uganda are hoping to become the first East African winners of Afcon for 55 years Kenya and Tanzania have never progressed beyond the group stage, so if Uganda can rise, East Africa can stand tall. In politics, despite all manner of socio-economic challenges, the spirit of the Africans is on the rise - they've already just about removed one long-serving president from power (The Gambia, even if he is still resisting ) and in 2017 a couple more might follow (DR Congo, Angola) When Africa stumbles, it must rise because as they say in Nigeria, the sun shines on those who stand before it shines on those who are sitting.

RIP Harambe,"RIP Harambe His was the face which launched a thousand memes - so why did Harambe the gorilla capture 2016's collective online psyche? It was a sad story that could have been even sadder. In May, a three-year-old child fell into an enclosure at Cincinnati Zoo. One of the Western lowland gorillas inside started dragging the boy around. ""Mommy's right here! Mommy loves you!"" the boy's mother shouted, as bystanders became increasingly panicked. Finally, fearing that the boy's life was in danger, a zoo worker killed Harambe with a single shot. The boy escaped without serious injury. The events were capturedon a YouTube video,externalwhich has been watched millions of times. Harambe's deathtouched off a heated - if predictable - debateabout zoo welfare standards and whether lethal force was necessary. But what wasn't expected was what came next. Harambe became memeified. His image was spread far and wide throughout the internet. He became the subject of serious and unserious campaigns. And he was evenmemorialised in song,external. Join the conversation on this and other storieshere,external. It started as a spontaneous and very real outpouring of shock and grief over the killing. ""Had I been there, I would have gone into the enclosure myself,"" says Frank Paris, one of the people who used the hashtag #RIPHarambe to express his sadness. It quickly began to spread hours after the gorilla's death. Although he lived a few states away in Los Angeles, Paris, along with many others, was upset at Cincinnati Zoo's decision to kill the animal. ""That day was a very sad day for me,"" he tells BBC Trending. ""I absolutely would have risked my own life to save the boy. That's how sure I am that the boy was fine and that Harambe had no intention of hurting anybody."" Of course, that's just one reaction from someone thousands of miles away, whereas zoo officials say they were right to take action to stop any potential serious injury to the boy. But Paris was not alone in his grief and anger. Aside from his canonisation on social media, there were candlelit vigils for Harambe. There were also campaigns targeted the boy's parents. Some online called for them to be prosecuted for negligence. The boy's mother was cleared of any wrongdoing. ""There was definitely a sincere element of outrage over this,"" says Aja Romano, who writes about web culture for news site Vox. ""It just spiralled out of control and was immediately a giant social trend, because it involved an element of supposed animal cruelty. You could argue that by keeping Harambe in the zoo to begin with, the zoo was fostering this unfair environment where the gorilla didn't really have a chance."" That wave of emotion was in turn hijacked by comedians, pranksters and trolls who mocked those who were making so much of the story. ""People online kind of get off on being mad about things that they don't actually care about,"" says Brandon Wardell, a stand-up comedian and one of those who poked fun at the Harambe mourners. ""You didn't know Harambe, your life wasn't really affected by this."" Wardell coined a jokey phrase that - to put it one way - sarcastically encouraged people to expose themselves in tribute to the dead gorilla. ""I think I was probably drunk when I tweeted it and then it just got out of control,"" he tells Trending. It got him branded the ""voice of a generation"" by Rolling Stone magazine. Then things took a dark turn when the memes were picked up by the alt-right,an amorphous but internet savvy white nationalist movement. The gorilla's image was used in racist messages. ""I feel like it was driven to the ground so quickly,"" Wardell recalls. ""It stopped being funny to me two days after. ""I didn't love that there were Nazis that were all of a sudden into a meme that I created."" But the Harambe phenomenon was also too large to be totally owned by one fringe group. The Cincinnati zoodeclared itself unimpressedwith all the riffs on its dead animal - but that certainly didn't put an end to the jokes. Memes comparing Harambe to David Bowie, Prince and Muhammad Ali have since gone viral. He's been the subject of fake news stories, books, comics - and a parody of the Book of Genesis. Hear more on this story and otherson the BBC World Service. ""If you were really tired of seeing media hysteria dominate news cycles and dominate conversations, the sheer absurdity of Harambe as a social issue was a really easy thing to mock,"" says Romano, the Vox writer. ""I think it spoke to a level of outrage fatigue. If you're seeing people freaking out about a dead gorilla, over say thousands of people dying in the Syrian refugee crisis, then what do you do with that anger? ""The only way to sort of express your anger was to just turn this sort of worship of Harambe and turn this deep cultural grief over Harambe's death into a meme."" Indeed, not just any meme, butthememe of 2016. RIP Harambe. You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter@BBCtrending,external, and find us onFacebook,external.  All our stories are atbbc.com/trending.
