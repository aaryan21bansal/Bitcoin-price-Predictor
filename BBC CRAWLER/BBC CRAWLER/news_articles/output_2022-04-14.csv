Child sex victims want Online Safety Bill improved,"A group of victims of child sexual exploitation has written to the UK governmentasking for the Online Safety Bill,externalto be strengthened. They say tech companies must be made responsible,externalfor stopping child abuse on live-stream and video call platforms. Charities say online predators increasingly live-stream, because most tech firms have no built-in software to detect or stop this type of abuse. Currently, the bill does not specifically address live-streaming. The bill does put a duty of care on tech platforms to tackle the distribution of child abuse materials. The International Justice Mission, which helps victims of sexual exploitation, said: ""The bill needs to go further in recognising that these platforms aren't just where abusive material is published, the platforms are used as tools to commit abuse."" The charity reports that half of the victims are 12 or under at the time of rescue, with some being less than a year old. It said children are often abused in places like the Philippines ""while remote offenders in places like the UK pay to direct and view the abuse in real time"". Malone, not his real name, was eight when his uncle started abusing him in the Philippines. ""I was asked to get naked and they were filming me while I was undressing. ""My uncle would fetch me from school and he would ask me to take my clothes off and he would take pictures. It came to a point that he was threatening me to not tell anyone by showing me his gun."" After about two years Malone was rescued, and his uncle was sent to jail. The NSPCCwants the bill to be strengthened,externalto give better protection to children. In 2020, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse,externalheard that the UK was the third largest consumer of live streaming abuse in the world. A recent report by theAustralian Institute of Criminology found,externalthat offenders were paying on average about Â£27 to view the sexual abuse of children. Ruby, not her real name, was 16 when she became a victim of live-streamed sexual exploitation in the Philippines. After her parents died, she was tricked by traffickers who offered her a job. The International Justice Mission says half of the victims of child sexual exploitation it rescues are 12 years old or younger. They trapped her in a house and she was sexually abused live online. ""The times that I spent in that house were the darkest days of my life,"" she said. ""The memories of those things that I did there and those faces of those customers that I interacted with haunted me for years."" The National Crime Agency reports that between 550,000 and 850,000 people in the UK pose a risk to children at any one moment. Rob Jones, from the organisation, said: ""Live-streamed abuse is an increasing problem that is getting worse. ""The only people that can tackle this problem are those working on the tech platforms where live-streaming abuse takes place. ""If you are creating an end-to-end platform, you can introduce technology that can prevent abuse."" NSPCC research has shown,externalone in 20 children in the UK who live-streamed with someone they had not met face-to-face were asked to remove an item of clothing. Andy Burrows, from the charity, said: ""Live-streaming services expanded rapidly during the pandemic, but in a race to roll out products tech firms put growth before children's safety."" The charity wants the Online Safety Bill to force these companies to use ""proactive"" technology to stop live-stream abuse. But creating these solutions isn't easy. The technology has to be extremely accurate, suitable for use on social media platforms with billions of users, and it also needs to satisfy privacy concerns. Meta, Facebook's parent company, says it uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and prioritise video calls and live-streams that are likely to contain child sexual exploitation. UK firm SafeToNet was one offive companies given Â£85,000 by the UK government,externalin October to work on ways to stop the spread of child sexual abuse material on end-to-end encrypted online platforms. It claims it is developing AI technology that can recognise when child exploitation is taking place ""in real-time, in live-stream content"" on mobile devices and ""disable the camera"". Technology expert Prof Peter Sommer questions the suitability of this kind of technology. He said: ""Using machine learning as a means of detecting live-streamed videos of child sexual abuse is likely to remain very imprecise, much more so than for static photographs. How do you distinguish the grandparent talking to a grandchild wearing a small swimsuit?"" Prof Sommer points out that moderating this material quickly and effectively would be expensive. There has been strong objection to the introduction of this kind of technology from privacy campaigners. Jim Killock, from the Open Rights Group, said: ""Blanket monitoring everyone's video calls all of the time is a step too far. ""Removing or limiting encryption would open up video calls to access and exploitation by criminals, so would be an unacceptably dangerous step to take."" The Online Safety Bill is due to be debated in Parliament on Tuesday. Among its proposals are: Regulator Ofcom would get powers to regulate social media sites Companies could be forced to have a duty of care for their users, including protecting them from legal but harmful content, like abuse that doesn't cross the criminality threshold Companies who breach Ofcom rules could face fines of up to Â£18m Social media sites would have to moderate content from different political viewpoints equally and without discrimination Provisions would be introduced to tackle online scams, like romance fraud and fake investment opportunities Online Safety Bill tweaked to target scam ads 'Sex for rent' ads to be banned Harmful content could evade new online law - MPs Watchdog criticises government encryption campaign The battle over end-to-end encryption Death toll rises as governor confirms hydrants issue 'impaired' LA wildfires fight 'I have nothing to go back to' - reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Reeves pledges to 'make UK better off' on China visit LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Schools face further strike disruption after Easter,"Unite workers went on strike in a dispute over pay last month The Education Authority (EA) has said it is facing further strike action by the Unite union for almost two weeks after the Easter school break. In a letter to principals seen by BBC News NI, the EA said it was ""very concerned"" about the potential impact. It said it had been notified of further action from 26 April to 1 May and from Tuesday 3 May to Sunday 8 May. In their letter to principals, the EA said that this would cause ""disruption to some education services"". These include ""a number of EA home-to-school transport (yellow bus) services, some school meal services and on the availability of a number of classroom assistants, particularly in special schools"". Unite has also confirmed its members in all of the eleven local councils, the Housing Executive, some Further Education colleges, some schools and youth services are planning to take strike action after Easter. It will span discontinuously across the last week of April and early May. Members of Unite were previously on strike in March over a local government pay offer of 1.75%. The union called ita ""real-terms pay cut"". The cost of living has been surging due torising fuel, energy and food costs. Previously, one special school -Glenveagh in Belfast- could not offer face-to-face teaching to pupils as almost all of its classroom assistants were on strike. It is not yet clear if the school will be able to open for pupils to attend after Easter. Special schools are particularly affected by the unavailability of Education Authority transport as they rely heavily on the so-called ""yellow buses"". The Education Authority said they would ""request exemptions for special school classroom assistant staff, and for drivers transporting pupils to special schools,"" but these have not previously been agreed by Unite. Strikes at Translink from Monday 25 April could cause significant disruption Gareth Scott, from Unite, told BBC's Evening Extra programme the 1.75% pay offer was not acceptable to members, describing it as insulting. ""We are taking further action in pursuit of our dispute with the local authority and powers across Northern Ireland, some 18 of them, including the Education Authority,"" Mr Scott said. ""As the employer just walked away from the negotiating table, we have been left with no alternative but to pursue our claims by industrial action."" When asked whether special schools would be exempt from the strikes, Mr Scott said requests for dispensations would be considered. ""In respect of the Education Authority, I'm not aware that there is a change in our position on that,"" he said. ""Obviously dispensation requests will be considered but at this moment I'm not aware that any change will be made. ""But our members in those schools have made it clear they wish to be involved in this action, so it would be wrong for them to be ostracised because they merely want to take up their legal right to strike."" Mr Scott has also said he recognises the action may impact some children more than others, but said members should be allowed to ""speak up for a fair and proper pay increase"". 25 April-1 May and 3 May-8 May: Staff at the NI Housing Executive; nine councils (Antrim and Newtownabbey; Armagh, Banbridge & Craigavon; Causeway Coast & Glens; Mid & East Antrim; Belfast City; Derry City & Strabane; Fermanagh & Omagh; Lisburn & Castlereagh; and Mid-Ulster); and three further education colleges (North West Regional College; Belfast Metropolitan College; South Eastern Regional College) 26 April-1 May and 3 May-8 May: Staff at Lumen Christi College in Londonderry 3 May-15 May: Staff at Ards & North Down Borough Council 6 May: Staff at Newry, Mourne and Down District Council The Education Authority also said that astrike at Translink by the Unite and GMB unionsdue to take place from Monday, 25 April would also cause significant disruption to school transport. ""Whilst Translink are continuing to negotiate with the trade unions to seek a resolution, if this action goes ahead it will result in all Translink bus services, including school services, being withdrawn from Monday, 25 April to Sunday, 1 May and on Friday, 6 May causing significant disruption right across the school transport network,"" the Education Authority letter said. ""If children connect from an Education Authority bus to a Translink service, parents should make alternative arrangements for the whole of their journey during the Translink period of strike action if it proceeds."" The Education Authority also said the strikes could cause disruption to pupils about to sit GCSE, AS and A-level exams. ""The EA are concerned that this industrial action will once again impact pupils' learning, particularly for those year groups taking key examinations over the coming weeks,"" their letter to heads said. ""We would therefore ask you to consider how you might provide additional support for pupils who may be unable to arrange alternative transport."" Why are prices rising in the UK?

Elon Musk makes offer to buy Twitter,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has offered to buy Twitter, saying he is the right person to ""unlock"" the social media platform's ""extraordinary potential"". In a surprise announcement, Mr Musk said he would pay $54.20 a share for Twitter, valuing it at about $40bn. It recently emerged that Mr Musk was Twitter's biggest shareholder after he built up a large stake in the firm. He said that if his offer was not accepted: ""I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder"". Mr Musk also said that if the board of directors at Twitter chose to reject the offer, it would be ""utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote"". ""They own the company, not the board of directors,"" hewrote in a tweet.,external Twitter's share price rose jumped by 5.3% to $48.32 in early trading, before falling back to more than $46.20 later on. A filing with the US financial regulator appeared to show text and/or voice messages from Mr Musk to Twitter's board, showing that he had raised the idea at the weekend that the business should go private. Mr Musk had been invited to join the board, but Twitter announced on Sunday he had decided against it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. In the messages published in the filing, Mr Musk said he was not ""playing the back-and-forth game"" and said of his offer: ""It's a high price and your shareholders will love it."" He said he would have to sell his shares if the deal did not go through. ""This is not a threat, it's simply not a good investment without the changes that need to be made,"" he added. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: ""This is a deeply hostile move from Elon Musk who has threatened to 'reconsider' his 9.2% stake in the company if his 100% acquisition offer is rejected."" In his filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Musk said he had invested in Twitter because ""I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. ""However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company."" He added: ""Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it."" Twitter said its board ""will carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all Twitter stockholders"". Mr Musk is the world's richest man, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX. In a wide-ranging interview with head of TED, Chris Anderson, Elon Musk has not only laid out his vision for Twitter but revealed that he has a plan B if the Twitter board reject his offer. He didn't go into details about what it was, saying simply that it was for ""another time"". The interview was much anticipated among the TED audience which gathers in Vancouver every spring to hear a range of talks on technology, entertainment and design. Musk also revealed that his first job, if his offer is accepted, would be to open up the Twitter algorithm so that the decisions it makes can be seen by everyone. The code needs to go on a platform such as GitHub so that other programmers can see it and make suggestions rather like operating system Linux was built, he said. Dan Ives, senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Twitter will either be forced to accept Mr Musk's bid or find another buyer. He said: ""There will be host of questions around financing, regulatory, balancing Musk's time (Tesla, SpaceX) in the coming days but based on this filing it is a now or never bid for Twitter to accept. ""Ultimately, we believe this soap opera will end with Musk owning Twitter."" Rumours have been swirling for weeks that Elon Musk was considering starting his own social network, but with the news he'd lifted his stake in Twitter to 9.2%, it seemed like he was scratching the itch by investing in one rather than building his own. Donald Trump's Truth Social platform's struggle for relevance and technical woes has proven that building a social network is perhaps not so easy. While some were shocked Mr Musk rejected a position on Twitter's board, seasoned watchers commented that accepting it would come with rules and conditions that might not be a good match for the world's richest man and his fondness for speaking his mind on the platform. There's been considerable disquiet among staff at Twitter over the whole affair, with some employees taking to the platform to vent their frustration and concerns about controversial statements Mr Musk has made in the past. If Mr Musk's takeover is successful, we'll likely find out how he intends to run the company courtesy of one of his many tweets. Twitter had offered Mr Musk a seat on its board after it emerged that he held a 9.2% stake in the company. The role was set to become effective last weekend but then Mr Musk decided against taking it. On Monday, Twitter's chief executive Parag Agrawal had tweeted that he thought the decision by Mr Musk not take a seat on the board was ""for the best"". He added: ""We have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our board or not. Elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to his input."" Though he also warned staff: ""There will be distractions ahead."" After that announcement, Mr Musk posted a cryptic tweet of smiling emoji with its hand over its mouth. Mr Musk has already given a hint of the things he would like to change at Twitter. He has suggested changes to the Twitter Blue premium subscription service, which was launched last year in Canada and Australia, including slashing the price, banning advertising and giving users the option of paying the monthly fee with the cryptocurrency, dogecoin. Mr Musk also asked his 81 million followers on Twitter whether the company is ""dying"" and if its headquarters should be turned into a homeless shelter.

Patient access 'essential' amid GP service concerns,"Robin Swann said general practice had been treated as ""a Cinderella service - awarded platitudes but given little actual investment"" It is essential patients can get GP services when they need it, Health Minister Robin Swann has said after concerns were raised that people are having difficulties accessing GPs. Mr Swann also said it was regrettable that ""for so long obvious problems were left unaddressed"". His statement comes afterBBC News NI highlighted issues people are facing when trying to see a GP. Doctors have also reported massive pressures on services. The Royal College of GPs on Wednesday said that a phone-first system adopted by most GP surgeries at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic is here to stay. However, some people told BBC News NI that the system did not work effectively, a point accepted by Royal College of GPs' Dr Ursual Mason who said there was not enough GPs to see people. Mr Swann, in a statement, said primary care was the ""bedrock of our local health service"". ""Over the last two years I've had the privilege to meet and get to know so many GPs right across Northern Ireland,"" the health minister said. GP telephone first system 'here to stay' ""Yet, in early 2020, it was a service I was stunned to see in such a state of internal flux and under so much unsustainable strain."" He said general practice had been treated as ""a Cinderella service - awarded platitudes but given little actual investment or support"". Mr Swann added that he had introduced a number of new measures including the introduction of additional GP nurses and a new graduate entry programme at Ulster University's medical school, with a focus on placements in rural settings and the west. He also said more than Â£5m had been made available to support GPs over the winter period. Since the start of the pandemic most GP surgeries have operated a phone-first system limiting the numbers of patients attending face-to-face appointments On the phone-first service, Mr Swann said it had advantages but that ""the current system still isn't working as it should"". ""Whilst by no means everywhere, in some areas too many patients are having to ring practices far too many times before they get through to somebody on the other end of the line. ""That's clearly not the level of service patients should expect."" He added that GPs had ""performed heroically under the most difficult of circumstances, whilst also playing a huge role in the vacciation campaign"" but that ""more work is needed to improve patient access"".

UK government sanctions two Abramovich associates,"Director of Chelsea FC Eugene Tenenbaum stands alongside Roman Abramovich. Two Russian oligarchs linked to billionaire Roman Abramovich have been sanctioned by the UK government. Chelsea FC director Eugene Tenenbaum and David Davidovich are longstanding business associates of Mr Abramovich, who owns the club. The pair's assets - estimated to be worth up to Â£10 billion in total - have been frozen. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said it was the largest asset freeze in UK history. They join a list of individuals to have been sanctioned following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, includingRussian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters. This will prevent their financial assets being sent back to Russia. The total number of individuals sanctioned by the UK since February now stands at 106. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia after Ukraine invasion? Mr Tenenbaum previously described himself as one of Mr Abramovich's closest business associates. Corporate filings show that he took control of Evrington Investments Limited, an investment company linked to Mr Abramovich, on 24 February. Mr Davidovich then took over the company in March. He is also subject to a travel ban, meaning he is cannot enter - or remain in - the UK. Ms Truss said: ""We are tightening the ratchet on Putin's war machine and targeting the circle of people closest to the Kremlin. ""We will keep going with sanctions until Putin fails in Ukraine. Nothing and no one is off the table."" These sanctions were co-ordinated with action taken by authorities in Jersey earlier this week. On Tuesday, Mr Abramovich had $7bn (Â£5.4bn) worth of assets linked to himfrozen by a Jersey court. In the US, a Gulfstream private jet owned by Mr Abramovichhas been effectively groundedas the US Commerce Department said it was one of a number of planes to contravene US sanctions. Currently it is a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft to fly to, or land in, the UK. The government has powers to remove aircraft belonging to designated Russian individuals and entities from the UK aircraft register, even if the sanctioned individual is not on board. Russian ships are also banned from UK ports. Volodymyr Zelensky's exclusive interview with the BBC.

Three arrests over unofficial Club Penguin site,"City of London police have arrested three people for running an unofficial version of Disney's game Club Penguin. Police, acting on the wishes of Disney, took down the website, which claimed to have millions of registered users. It comes after a BBC investigation in 2020witnessed players simulating sexand exchanging racist and anti-Semitic abuse on another unauthorised clone of the children's game. Police have released the suspects as they investigate copyright offences. Disney's Club Penguin launched in 2005 and was one of the first social networks for children. It had more than 200 million players at its peak, who explored a cartoon world - walking, talking and playing mini games using penguin avatars. Some players accused Club Penguin Rewritten of being 'unsafe' While anybody could join the original website,content filters and human moderators were employed to stop inappropriate messages or personal information being shared. But Disney closed the website in 2017. Since then, unofficial clones of the website have been set up. These so-called 'private servers' were launched using stolen or copied source code, and can easily be found by children searching the internet. Club Penguin Online was the largest of the unauthorised clones and the subject of a BBC investigation in May 2020. Its popularity exploded during the coronavirus pandemic, with seven million registered players. The BBC investigation found racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and sexual messages flowing freely on the unauthorised platform, which saw children playing alongside adults. Disney said it was ""appalled"" by the website and ordered it to close or face legal action. But many players simply moved to another major site, Club Penguin Rewritten, which - nearly two years on - has now been closed. The site included in-game advertising, although it is not known how much money was generated. One player, who spent time on both sites, told the BBC: ""The game had been booming ever since Club Penguin Online's [CPO] shutdown, as that is where the CPO player population migrated to. However, that may have worked against them in the end."" This video can not be played Unofficial Club Penguin games turn toxic Another user contacted the BBC claiming the site was 'unsafe' because of poor moderation. Detective Constable Daryl Fryatt, from the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU) at City of London police, confirmed the seizure of the site and arrests. ""Following a complaint under copyright law, PIPCU have seized a gaming website as part of an ongoing investigation into the site. ""Three people were arrested on April 12 on suspicion of distributing materials infringing copyright, and searches were carried out,"" he said.

Which countries send asylum seekers overseas?,"A Â£120m trial will see mostly single men arriving in the UK via boat crossings sent to Rwanda, under new plans A plan to tackle the number of asylum seekers crossing the Channel in small boats will see some given a one-way ticket to Rwanda, thegovernment has announced. The UK is not the first to explore sending individuals overseas. What has been the impact of other countries' policies? Australia first began using offshore detention centres in 2001. And in 2013, it hardened its immigration law to deny resettlement visas to asylum seekers arriving by boat. Thousands of asylum seekers have been transferred out of Australia during this time. Its Border Force has said more than 4,000 were relocated between 2012 and 2019. How will the Rwanda asylum plan work? Some 112 refugees and asylum seekers currently remain on the nation island of Nauru, but a similar scheme on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea - where 120 people were detained -ended last year. This picture taken in 2014 shows asylum seekers at Australia's Manus Island detention centre Rights groups and the UN have frequently criticised Australia's centres for substandard conditions. In total, 13 people sent to Nauru and Papua New Guinea have died from violence, medical inattention or suicide. Iranian Kurd refugee and author Behrouz Boochani told the BBC in 2019 that detention on Manus Island was like a prison, and said the system felt like it was designed to ""humiliate us and destroy us"". He said people were taken ""from the water"" and sent to Manus Island without being asked questions, and experienced a ""violation of human rights"". This video can not be played Iranian Kurd refugee Behrouz Boochani, speaking in 2019, was sent to Manus Island Australia argues its offshoring policy is justified because it prevents deaths at sea. By its own projections it will spend $811.8m (Â£460m) on offshore processing in 2021-22. In March, a three-year deal was announced for up to 450 refugees from Australia's regional processing centres to be resettled in New Zealand. Faced with a growing influx of asylum seekers and other illegal immigrants, mainly from Sudan and Eritrea, Israel took action to resolve the problem by striking deals with third country ""safe havens"" to take an undisclosed number of people. The two countries were not officially identified but media reports said they were Uganda and Rwanda. When the scheme began in 2015, those rejected for asylum and other illegal immigrants were given the choice of returning to their country of origin, or accepting a payment of $3,500 and a plane ticket to one of the third countries, or being put in jail if they stayed in Israel. African migrants protest against the treatment of asylum seekers by Israel By 2018, Israel said some 20,000 of about 65,000 who had arrived in the country illegally had left under one scheme or another. However, human rights activists criticised the ""voluntary deportation"" programme as giving false promises to those who chose to accept it, putting them at risk in the countries that took them where there was no guarantee of their legal status nor protection against further deportation. Israel's unwanted African migrants A later plan to forcibly deport failed asylum seekers and other illegal immigrants to third countries - reportedly Uganda and Rwanda again - was suspended by Israel's Supreme Court. The Danish government has not been shy about its goal of ""zero"" refugees in Denmark. Last June,legislation was passedthat would allow it to move asylum seekers to third countries outside the EU while their cases were processed. The controversial measure was heavily criticised by the European Commission and human rights groups, while questions were raised about its legality. A surprise visit to Rwanda last year by Immigration Minister Matthias Tesfaye prompted widespread speculation Denmark intended to open a facility there. A memorandum of understanding was signed, but there was nothing concrete about a refugee-processing centre. Just last night, however, the minister met other political parties to spell out his plans. In a statement, Mr Tesfaye told the BBC: ""We are in dialogue with Rwanda, and we have a good cooperation based on a broad partnership, but we do not have an agreement on transfer of asylum seekers. ""I share the view of the Rwandan and British governments that the current asylum system is unsustainable."" Demonstrators in Copenhagen march with a banner reading 'Syria is not safe' following the revoking of hundreds of Syrians' resident permits Denmark was the first country to join the UN Refugee Convention in 1951. But recently, governments on the left and right have repeatedly tightened immigration laws. Last year it began controversiallyrevoking the residence permitsof hundreds of Syrians from the Damascus area, arguing it was now safe for them to return. However, Denmark's approach to Ukrainians is markedly different. It plans to host up to 100,000 people and grant work permits.

UK criticised over 'cruel' Rwanda asylum plan,"This video can not be played Watch: Prime Minister outlines Rwanda immigration plans in April Plans to send some asylum seekers who arrive in the UK on small boats to live in Rwanda have been described as ""absolutely chilling"" and ""cruel and nasty"" by charities and politicians. The government has faced fierce criticism for the policy with questions raised over costs and impact as well as Rwanda's human rights record. But Boris Johnson said the Â£120m pilot scheme would ""save countless lives"". The PM said it would break the business model of ""vile people smugglers"". The pilot scheme would initially focus mainly on single men arriving on boats or lorries and would see them given a one-way ticket for the 4,000-mile trip to Rwanda where they would be processed and, if successful, would have long-term accommodation in the African country. Home Secretary Priti Patel, who travelled to Rwandan capital Kigali to sign the deal, said the ""vast majority"" of those arriving in the UK ""illegally"" would be considered for relocation to Rwanda. Thescheme is one of a number of measures announced to tackle small boat crossings in the Channel, with others including plans to hand operational control of the Channel to the Navy and asylum seekers who are resettled in the UK being spread more evenly across authorities. What does the new Rwanda asylum seeker deal mean? Land of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinion Which countries send asylum seekers overseas? Former RAF station to become asylum centre More than 160 charities and campaign groups - including the UK network of non-governmental organisations Bond - have called on the government to scrap the plans in an open letter that described the scheme as ""shamefully cruel"". Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the charity was ""appalled by the government's cruel and nasty decision"" that would ""do little"" to deter people from coming to the UK. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson was trying to distract from his ""partygate"" fine with the ""unworkable, unethical and extortionate"" scheme, while the Lib Dems said the government was ""slamming the door"" in the face of refugees and the SNP's Ian Blackford called it ""absolutely chilling"". The government has for years struggled to address the issue of small boats crossing the Channel. Different ideas have been floated about how to tackle illegal immigration - many have been dismissed and ruled out. So this is an attempt by Boris Johnson to tackle the issue head on. It matters to Conservative voters - taking back control of borders was one of Mr Johnson's big Brexit promises. But this isn't a simple plan to implement. It will be expensive - and it's extremely controversial. Ministers know they will face legal challenges - and that some are sceptical it will amount to much. The PM admitted it would not be enough on its own to solve the issue, but he insisted that over time it will prove a considerable deterrent. Many will be looking to see if he's right. Former Ukip and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has also criticised the plans, saying they were ""not much more than a short-term solution"". He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme the problem with sending people away to islands or other countries was ""it's not very long before you start to hear tales of abuse"" and after that the Human Rights Act could be invoked to stop it. He suggested the UK should turn boats back - a method that was used by Australia - but Mr Johnson conceded the controversial ""pushback"" technique would be dangerous except in ""extremely limited circumstances"". The plans have been welcomed by some witha snap YouGov poll,externalshowing 35% of those asked supported the proposal, while 42% opposed it. Recent researchby Ipsos Mori,externalsuggested 60% of the public were dissatisfied with the government's migration policy - more than half of which cited Channel crossings. Former UK Border Force chief Tony Smith said it was a ""bold move"" and may put people off paying people smugglers, when they heard they could be sent to a third country. BBC Radio 5 Live listenersshared their views with Nicky Campbell: ""What's crueller - that or being drowned? If it saves one life, surely it's got to be better than what's happening with these migrants now""- Lorraine, Dartington ""How are we treating these humans? Are we suddenly saying those coming from Ukraine, their lives are better value than those coming from certain other countries? I think it's abhorrent""- Hamid, Bicester ""I feel it's a real shame. We seem to have eroded this idea of fairness in our nation. We seem to no longer want to be the nation that wants to help other people. It seems a shame we've lost those values in our country""- Chris, Devon ""Let's forget about the optics and actually look at the reality. People smugglers will keep trying to find different ways until we break it. That's the cruel part here... I applaud the government for having some backbone""- Martin, Bedford Concerns have also been raised about the Rwandan government's human rights record and its president, Paul Kagame. Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK's refugee and migrant rights director, warned sending people seeking asylum in the UK to another country ""let alone one with such a dismal human rights record"" was ""the very height of irresponsibility"". Last year, the UK governmentexpressed concern,externalat the United Nations over ""continued restrictions to civil and political rights and media freedom"" in Rwanda. But Mr Johnson described Rwanda as being one of the safest countries in the world and said there was a ""risk of stereotyping"". Rwanda,a small landlocked country in east-central Africa, has been trying to recover from the ethnic strife that culminated in government-sponsored genocide in the mid-1990s. Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told the BBC it is ""a safe country, it's developing rapidly, we care as much as every country about human rights"". She said the nation had a ""strong record of protecting migrants and refugees"". ""We're expecting thousands here - this is a brand new approach, it's never been done before."" Why is the Nationality Bill causing protests? Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Refugees minister declines to comment on Rwanda plan According to a memorandum of understanding between the two governments the UK would screen asylum seekers ""without delay"" after their arrival in the UK and then provide Rwanda with basic details of each person it wanted to transfer. Rwanda would have to approve all requests before they were transferred, and the arrangement would last for five years. This video can not be played Rwandan foreign minister: Immigration plan not for those from neighbouring nations After arriving in the east African nation each asylum seeker would be given accommodation and support and would be free to come and go from their accommodation at all times, the memorandum says. The UK would also resettle ""a portion of Rwanda's most vulnerable refugees"" in the UK. Mr Johnson said action was needed to stop people smugglers turning the ocean into a ""watery graveyard"", and said the British taxpayer could not be asked ""to write a blank cheque to cover the costs of anyone who might want to come and live here"". On Thursday hundreds of people have crossed the Channel, with women, children and men brought ashore by the RNLI and Border Force at Dover, Kent. Last year,28,526 people are known to have crossedin small boats, up from 8,404 in 2020. In 2021 64% of asylum applications were successful after an initial decision was made, according to government figures, with some more granted after appeals. The number of people who could be relocated would be ""unlimited"", said Mr Johnson. Rwanda will have the ""capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead"", including those who have arrived ""illegally"" since the start of the year, he said. The home secretary said her department had prepared for legal challenges over the deal but she was confident any claims could be successfully contested. During her visit to Kigali, Ms Patel said the British public had been ""crying out for change for the years"" and it was ""incredibly unfair to the British public to see organisations in their own country effectively just putting blockages after blockages in the way"". Dr Niovi Vavoula, lecturer in migration and security at Queen Mary University School of Law, said she anticipated legal challenges being made under the international principle of non-refoulement - which guarantees no-one can be returned to a country where they would face ""torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment and other irreparable harm"". The BBC has seen accommodation the asylum seekers would be housed in, thought to have enough space for about 100 people at a time and to process up to 500 a year The Rwandan government said migrants would be ""entitled to full protection under Rwandan law, equal access to employment, and enrolment in healthcare and social care services"". The UK Home Office believes existing asylum law will be enough to implement the plan, and Ms Patel said it was not reliant on the Nationality and Borders Bill - which has faced a series of defeats in the lords - going through Parliament.

NI set for first Easter with extended pub hours,"Previously, licensed premises had limited hours for the sale of alcohol from Thursday to Sunday over the Easter weekend Pubs and clubs in Northern Ireland will be able to stay open for longer this Easter weekend for the first time under new licensing laws. Stormontpassed legislation extending opening hours last June. Previous restrictions allowed venues to serve alcohol between 17:00 and 23:00 on Good Friday; until midnight on Holy Thursday and Holy Saturday; and 22:00 on Easter Sunday. They can now operate as normal during Easter. The legislation, which came into effect in October 2021, allowsthose with a late licence to sell alcohol until 01:00 or, for those allowed to stay open additional permitted hours, until 02:00.,external Nine years in the making, it was the first major change to Northern Ireland's licensing laws since 1996 and has been described as the biggest change to the laws in a generation. How new alcohol laws will affect pubs and punters Extended pub hours approved by Stormont The Licensing and Registration of Clubs (Amendment) Bill brought many of Northern Ireland's rules around alcohol sales into line with the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Hospitality Ulster says the new rules are a boost for premises operating over Easter Colin Neill, from Hospitality Ulster, the body which represents the industry in Northern Ireland, said bars and restaurants had been looking forward to this Easter ""for years"". He said the legislation had been a ""shot in the arm for the entire hospitality industry as it emerges from a protracted period of pandemic closure"". ""Previous research showed the sector lost millions of pounds during the Easter period under the previous legislative regime,"" he added. He said the new laws would mean customers and tourists can ""enjoy a glass of wine with lunch on Good Friday, or a late night out over the long weekend across Northern Ireland"". ""In years gone by, business owners have been at their wits end having to stay closed and shut early, losing millions in trade due to the restrictive laws of the past,"" he said. ""Following years of campaigning, it is a real boost for the sector to be able to bring families and friends together over a meal and a pint during the Easter holiday period."" Barry McDaid, who manages Pyke and Pommes restaurant in Londonderry, welcomed the changes to what he said were ""archaic laws"". ""I think it is long, long overdue and it's good to see some change at last,"" Mr McDaid told BBC Radio Foyle. ""Working in bars years ago there were always queues outside the door from one o'clock when we didn't even open until three. ""People wanted to come in to sit down for a beer because it was the Easter weekend and most people are off on their holidays."" Mr McDaid said he would often find himself having to explain to tourists in Derry why they were unable to have a drink until a certain time during the Easter holidays. ""They couldn't really understand when you tried to explain to them what the old law was and that they couldn't have a drink before this time. ""Whereas everywhere else in Europe you could have a drink practically 24/7."" 'Question of choice' Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster, Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the new legislation introduces the question of choice for consumers. She added that for the hotel industry, the extended hours now ""opens up the opportunity to stage events over the Easter period"". Gerard Keenan, who owns Dan's Bar in Belfast, said: ""These changes may not seem that big to many people but to us it's a massive thing"". He added: ""I hope this Easter is a super one and we can put all the craziness of the last two years behind us"". Tony O'Neill, the owner of Coppi Restaurant, also in Belfast, told BBC Radio Ulster that in the past, tourists had often been confused about Easter licensing laws. ""They found it very difficult when we try to explain to them why they can't have a drink,"" he said. Mr O'Neill added that the hospitality industry has been in ""despair"" the past two years but he now feels more positive. ""There is a lot of confidence out there and people are enjoying being back out so fingers crossed Northern Ireland will be buzzing through the whole summer,"" he said.

Essential guide to the Northern Ireland election,"Voters in Northern Ireland will go to the polls to elect the assembly on 5 May. The election for the Northern Ireland Assembly comes a few months after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) resigned from the first minister role, causing the executive to collapse. The election result could trigger months of uncertainty and negotiations over who leads the executive. Anyone who is a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen, or a citizen of any other EU country, is eligible to vote. SIGN UP FOR ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC Northern Ireland election coverage You can no longer registet to vote, as the deadline passed on 14 April. The assembly was set up in 1998 as one of the conditions of the Good Friday Agreement peace deal which ended decades of violence and created a devolved administration for Northern Ireland where the largest parties are all entitled to govern together. There are 90 members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) who are elected at least every five years from parties belonging to one of three blocs: unionists, nationalists and non-aligned. Five MLAs are elected in each of the 18 constituencies using a system called the single transferable vote (STV), which ranks candidates by preference. Ten members of the assembly also form its executive - and it's those 10 that collectively need to govern together in a mandatory coalition. The biggest party from the largest of the unionist/nationalist blocs nominates the first minister, and the largest party from the second-largest bloc nominates the deputy first minister. The other eight roles are divided up based on how many seats each party has in the assembly - except the minister of justice, who is elected by the assembly. For the first time ever, a nationalist party may have a realistic chance of becoming the largest party in the assembly. Sinn FÃ©in has been the second-biggest party since 2003 but it is confident of winning more seats than the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) this time around. The DUP is running fewer candidates this time than it did at the last assembly election. It performed poorly by its own standards in other recent elections, including the 2019 UK general election when it lost two seats. It could be at risk losing votes to its unionist rivals the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the more hard-line Traditional Unionist voice (TUV). Meanwhile the other main nationalist party the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) is hoping it can hold on to its position as the third-biggest party and is targeting seats such as Strangford in a bid to increase its tally of 12. But it's no longer as black and white as ""unionism versus nationalism""; certainties about the way people vote also seem to be changing. In 2019, the bloc of non-aligned parties, such as the Alliance Party and the Green Party, increased their vote share at local, UK and European elections and are confident of continuing the trend. This could prompt calls to change the power-sharing system created in 1998, which was designed to ensure unionists and nationalists govern together. The Alliance Party, for example, wants the executive to be a voluntary coalition, which would involve major changes to the Good Friday Agreement. Despite their names, the roles of first and deputy minister are equal: one cannot exist without the other and a first minister cannot take office unless a deputy first minister is also nominated. The largest party gets to nominate the first minister - if that was Sinn FÃ©in, it would be a huge symbolic blow to the DUP, which has held that position since 2007. If that happened, many people would view it as a boost for Sinn FÃ©in's long-running campaign for a referendum on Northern Ireland leaving the UK and uniting with the Republic of Ireland, although Sinn FÃ©in has said its main priority after the election is dealing with the cost of living crisis. Unionists say most voters remain unlikely to support Irish unity. The DUP has refused to specifically say whether it would nominate a deputy first minister to serve alongside a Sinn FÃ©in first minister. Not nominating would be a bid to try to stop Sinn FÃ©in claiming it has won a big victory by becoming first minister. If an agreement over who takes those roles cannot be reached, the assembly can continue to exist and the other ministers who held office before the election - such as the health minister and education minister - can stay in post for up to six months. If a solution cannot be found after that time, there would either need to be further negotiations or a fresh election. But to complicate matters further, even if the DUP was the largest party and was entitled to the first minister position, its leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said he does not want to govern unless changes are made to the Northern Ireland Protocol. In 2024, the assembly will vote on whether to keep elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit deal that creates a trade border in the Irish Sea in order to prevent a hardening of the Irish land border. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. Unionist parties strongly oppose the protocol as they say it has undermined Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom. Nationalist parties, along with the Alliance Party and Green Party, broadly support the protocol and have indicated they would vote to keep it. If the assembly voted against keeping Articles 5-10 - which cover areas such as the movement of goods into Northern Ireland  - then the EU and the UK government would have two years to come up with a new deal to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Northern Ireland usessingle transferable vote (STV) and people can vote for as many or as few candidates as they wantin order of preference. Once counting begins a quota is set for the number of votes a candidate needs to get elected. All the first preference votes are counted and any candidates who meet the quota are elected. Meanwhile the candidate with the least votes is knocked out and their votes are transferred to other candidates based preferences given to them by voters. This continues until either five candidates meet the quota or there are only five candidates left. Counting starts at 09:00 GMT on Friday 6 May and the first results could be declared from lunchtime. The final results could be known by the end of that day, but it's possible counting will pause overnight and start again on Saturday morning, with final results likely by Saturday afternoon. Once the new assembly is elected it must meet within eight days and will be asked to nominate a first and deputy first minster.

UK government sanctions two Abramovich associatesEugene Tenenbaum and David Davidovich have had their assets - estimated to be up to Â£10bn - frozen.UK,"Director of Chelsea FC Eugene Tenenbaum stands alongside Roman Abramovich. Two Russian oligarchs linked to billionaire Roman Abramovich have been sanctioned by the UK government. Chelsea FC director Eugene Tenenbaum and David Davidovich are longstanding business associates of Mr Abramovich, who owns the club. The pair's assets - estimated to be worth up to Â£10 billion in total - have been frozen. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said it was the largest asset freeze in UK history. They join a list of individuals to have been sanctioned following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, includingRussian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters. This will prevent their financial assets being sent back to Russia. The total number of individuals sanctioned by the UK since February now stands at 106. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia after Ukraine invasion? Mr Tenenbaum previously described himself as one of Mr Abramovich's closest business associates. Corporate filings show that he took control of Evrington Investments Limited, an investment company linked to Mr Abramovich, on 24 February. Mr Davidovich then took over the company in March. He is also subject to a travel ban, meaning he is cannot enter - or remain in - the UK. Ms Truss said: ""We are tightening the ratchet on Putin's war machine and targeting the circle of people closest to the Kremlin. ""We will keep going with sanctions until Putin fails in Ukraine. Nothing and no one is off the table."" These sanctions were co-ordinated with action taken by authorities in Jersey earlier this week. On Tuesday, Mr Abramovich had $7bn (Â£5.4bn) worth of assets linked to himfrozen by a Jersey court. In the US, a Gulfstream private jet owned by Mr Abramovichhas been effectively groundedas the US Commerce Department said it was one of a number of planes to contravene US sanctions. Currently it is a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft to fly to, or land in, the UK. The government has powers to remove aircraft belonging to designated Russian individuals and entities from the UK aircraft register, even if the sanctioned individual is not on board. Russian ships are also banned from UK ports. Volodymyr Zelensky's exclusive interview with the BBC.

"Elon Musk makes offer to buy TwitterThe boss of Tesla claims he wants to unlock the social media platform's ""extraordinary potential"".","Tesla boss Elon Musk has offered to buy Twitter, saying he is the right person to ""unlock"" the social media platform's ""extraordinary potential"". In a surprise announcement, Mr Musk said he would pay $54.20 a share for Twitter, valuing it at about $40bn. It recently emerged that Mr Musk was Twitter's biggest shareholder after he built up a large stake in the firm. He said that if his offer was not accepted: ""I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder"". Mr Musk also said that if the board of directors at Twitter chose to reject the offer, it would be ""utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote"". ""They own the company, not the board of directors,"" hewrote in a tweet.,external Twitter's share price rose jumped by 5.3% to $48.32 in early trading, before falling back to more than $46.20 later on. A filing with the US financial regulator appeared to show text and/or voice messages from Mr Musk to Twitter's board, showing that he had raised the idea at the weekend that the business should go private. Mr Musk had been invited to join the board, but Twitter announced on Sunday he had decided against it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In the messages published in the filing, Mr Musk said he was not ""playing the back-and-forth game"" and said of his offer: ""It's a high price and your shareholders will love it."" He said he would have to sell his shares if the deal did not go through. ""This is not a threat, it's simply not a good investment without the changes that need to be made,"" he added. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: ""This is a deeply hostile move from Elon Musk who has threatened to 'reconsider' his 9.2% stake in the company if his 100% acquisition offer is rejected."" In his filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Musk said he had invested in Twitter because ""I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. ""However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company."" He added: ""Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it."" Twitter said its board ""will carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all Twitter stockholders"". Mr Musk is the world's richest man, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX. In a wide-ranging interview with head of TED, Chris Anderson, Elon Musk has not only laid out his vision for Twitter but revealed that he has a plan B if the Twitter board reject his offer. He didn't go into details about what it was, saying simply that it was for ""another time"". The interview was much anticipated among the TED audience which gathers in Vancouver every spring to hear a range of talks on technology, entertainment and design. Musk also revealed that his first job, if his offer is accepted, would be to open up the Twitter algorithm so that the decisions it makes can be seen by everyone. The code needs to go on a platform such as GitHub so that other programmers can see it and make suggestions rather like operating system Linux was built, he said. Dan Ives, senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Twitter will either be forced to accept Mr Musk's bid or find another buyer. He said: ""There will be host of questions around financing, regulatory, balancing Musk's time (Tesla, SpaceX) in the coming days but based on this filing it is a now or never bid for Twitter to accept. ""Ultimately, we believe this soap opera will end with Musk owning Twitter."" Rumours have been swirling for weeks that Elon Musk was considering starting his own social network, but with the news he'd lifted his stake in Twitter to 9.2%, it seemed like he was scratching the itch by investing in one rather than building his own. Donald Trump's Truth Social platform's struggle for relevance and technical woes has proven that building a social network is perhaps not so easy. While some were shocked Mr Musk rejected a position on Twitter's board, seasoned watchers commented that accepting it would come with rules and conditions that might not be a good match for the world's richest man and his fondness for speaking his mind on the platform. There's been considerable disquiet among staff at Twitter over the whole affair, with some employees taking to the platform to vent their frustration and concerns about controversial statements Mr Musk has made in the past. If Mr Musk's takeover is successful, we'll likely find out how he intends to run the company courtesy of one of his many tweets. Twitter had offered Mr Musk a seat on its board after it emerged that he held a 9.2% stake in the company. The role was set to become effective last weekend but then Mr Musk decided against taking it. On Monday, Twitter's chief executive Parag Agrawal had tweeted that he thought the decision by Mr Musk not take a seat on the board was ""for the best"". He added: ""We have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our board or not. Elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to his input."" Though he also warned staff: ""There will be distractions ahead."" After that announcement, Mr Musk posted a cryptic tweet of smiling emoji with its hand over its mouth. Mr Musk has already given a hint of the things he would like to change at Twitter. He has suggested changes to the Twitter Blue premium subscription service, which was launched last year in Canada and Australia, including slashing the price, banning advertising and giving users the option of paying the monthly fee with the cryptocurrency, dogecoin. Mr Musk also asked his 81 million followers on Twitter whether the company is ""dying"" and if its headquarters should be turned into a homeless shelter.

"Elon Musk makes offer to buy TwitterThe boss of Tesla claims he wants to unlock the social media platform's ""extraordinary potential"".Business","Tesla boss Elon Musk has offered to buy Twitter, saying he is the right person to ""unlock"" the social media platform's ""extraordinary potential"". In a surprise announcement, Mr Musk said he would pay $54.20 a share for Twitter, valuing it at about $40bn. It recently emerged that Mr Musk was Twitter's biggest shareholder after he built up a large stake in the firm. He said that if his offer was not accepted: ""I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder"". Mr Musk also said that if the board of directors at Twitter chose to reject the offer, it would be ""utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote"". ""They own the company, not the board of directors,"" hewrote in a tweet.,external Twitter's share price rose jumped by 5.3% to $48.32 in early trading, before falling back to more than $46.20 later on. A filing with the US financial regulator appeared to show text and/or voice messages from Mr Musk to Twitter's board, showing that he had raised the idea at the weekend that the business should go private. Mr Musk had been invited to join the board, but Twitter announced on Sunday he had decided against it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In the messages published in the filing, Mr Musk said he was not ""playing the back-and-forth game"" and said of his offer: ""It's a high price and your shareholders will love it."" He said he would have to sell his shares if the deal did not go through. ""This is not a threat, it's simply not a good investment without the changes that need to be made,"" he added. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: ""This is a deeply hostile move from Elon Musk who has threatened to 'reconsider' his 9.2% stake in the company if his 100% acquisition offer is rejected."" In his filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Musk said he had invested in Twitter because ""I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. ""However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company."" He added: ""Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it."" Twitter said its board ""will carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all Twitter stockholders"". Mr Musk is the world's richest man, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX.

Which other countries send asylum seekers overseas?,"A Â£120m trial will see mostly single men arriving in the UK via boat crossings sent to Rwanda, under new plans A plan to tackle the number of asylum seekers crossing the Channel in small boats will see some given a one-way ticket to Rwanda, thegovernment has announced. The UK is not the first to explore sending individuals overseas. What has been the impact of other countries' policies? Australia first began using offshore detention centres in 2001. And in 2013, it hardened its immigration law to deny resettlement visas to asylum seekers arriving by boat. Thousands of asylum seekers have been transferred out of Australia during this time. Its Border Force has said more than 4,000 were relocated between 2012 and 2019. How will the Rwanda asylum plan work? Some 112 refugees and asylum seekers currently remain on the nation island of Nauru, but a similar scheme on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea - where 120 people were detained -ended last year. This picture taken in 2014 shows asylum seekers at Australia's Manus Island detention centre Rights groups and the UN have frequently criticised Australia's centres for substandard conditions. In total, 13 people sent to Nauru and Papua New Guinea have died from violence, medical inattention or suicide. Iranian Kurd refugee and author Behrouz Boochani told the BBC in 2019 that detention on Manus Island was like a prison, and said the system felt like it was designed to ""humiliate us and destroy us"". He said people were taken ""from the water"" and sent to Manus Island without being asked questions, and experienced a ""violation of human rights"". This video can not be played Iranian Kurd refugee Behrouz Boochani, speaking in 2019, was sent to Manus Island Australia argues its offshoring policy is justified because it prevents deaths at sea. By its own projections it will spend $811.8m (Â£460m) on offshore processing in 2021-22. In March, a three-year deal was announced for up to 450 refugees from Australia's regional processing centres to be resettled in New Zealand. Faced with a growing influx of asylum seekers and other illegal immigrants, mainly from Sudan and Eritrea, Israel took action to resolve the problem by striking deals with third country ""safe havens"" to take an undisclosed number of people. The two countries were not officially identified but media reports said they were Uganda and Rwanda. When the scheme began in 2015, those rejected for asylum and other illegal immigrants were given the choice of returning to their country of origin, or accepting a payment of $3,500 and a plane ticket to one of the third countries, or being put in jail if they stayed in Israel. African migrants protest against the treatment of asylum seekers by Israel By 2018, Israel said some 20,000 of about 65,000 who had arrived in the country illegally had left under one scheme or another. However, human rights activists criticised the ""voluntary deportation"" programme as giving false promises to those who chose to accept it, putting them at risk in the countries that took them where there was no guarantee of their legal status nor protection against further deportation. Israel's unwanted African migrants A later plan to forcibly deport failed asylum seekers and other illegal immigrants to third countries - reportedly Uganda and Rwanda again - was suspended by Israel's Supreme Court. The Danish government has not been shy about its goal of ""zero"" refugees in Denmark. Last June,legislation was passedthat would allow it to move asylum seekers to third countries outside the EU while their cases were processed. The controversial measure was heavily criticised by the European Commission and human rights groups, while questions were raised about its legality. A surprise visit to Rwanda last year by Immigration Minister Matthias Tesfaye prompted widespread speculation Denmark intended to open a facility there. A memorandum of understanding was signed, but there was nothing concrete about a refugee-processing centre. Just last night, however, the minister met other political parties to spell out his plans. In a statement, Mr Tesfaye told the BBC: ""We are in dialogue with Rwanda, and we have a good cooperation based on a broad partnership, but we do not have an agreement on transfer of asylum seekers. ""I share the view of the Rwandan and British governments that the current asylum system is unsustainable."" Demonstrators in Copenhagen march with a banner reading 'Syria is not safe' following the revoking of hundreds of Syrians' resident permits Denmark was the first country to join the UN Refugee Convention in 1951. But recently, governments on the left and right have repeatedly tightened immigration laws. Last year it began controversiallyrevoking the residence permitsof hundreds of Syrians from the Damascus area, arguing it was now safe for them to return. However, Denmark's approach to Ukrainians is markedly different. It plans to host up to 100,000 people and grant work permits.

Why migrants leave France for UK,"Almost 37,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2024, figures released on New Year's Day show. Last year was the deadliest on record for people trying to make the crossing, according to a United Nations agency. In 2024, 36,816 were detected making the crossing. That's higher than in 2023, when29,437 people arrived. However, the highest recorded figures are for 2022, when 45,755 people made the crossing. Since 2018, when figures were first recorded, more than 150,000 people have arrived in small boats. Of those who arrived in 2024, more than23,000 did so after Labour won the July general election. Sir Keir said the UK's new Border Security Command would trace suspected people smugglers and shut down their bank accounts.

Applications peaked at about 103,000 in 2002, as people fled conflicts in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq. Claims then fell sharply, dropping to a 20-year low of 22,600 in 2010. However, numbers rose again throughout the 2010s, as refugees fled Syria. Asylum applications have risen again in recent years, more than doubling from 45,318 in the year to September 2021 to 92,776 just one year later, followed by smaller increases since then. In the year to September 2024, the largest number of asylum seekers came from Pakistan, with more than 9,500 applications. Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, and India were among the other countries with most applications. Ukrainian refugees who came to the UK after Russia's invasion of their country are not included in the figures. As of 26 November 2024,266,300 visas had been issued to Ukrainian refugees,external, who came through legal routes set up by the UK government. There are separate arrangements for a few other specific groups, such as some Afghan refugees and Hong Kong citizens. Some people wait months or even years for their claims to be considered. At the end of September 2024, there were 97,170 cases relating to 133,409 people awaiting an initial decision.

Collecting the dead in BuchaUkraine round-up: US and France divided on genocide,"Police in Bucha examine a body unearthed in a field. At least 500 dead have been found since the Russians left. When the Russians retreated from Bucha, a massive operation began to find and document the dead. BBC News joined the local police officers and bereaved families as they carried out their grim task. Warning: This article contains graphic images. Police Chief Vitaliy Lobas was sitting at a child's desk in an abandoned school in Bucha, collecting the details of the bodies. Every few minutes, Chief Lobas, who has broad shoulders and short dark hair, and rarely uses an unnecessary word, received a call on his mobile phone, and the brief conversations went the same: a location, a few details, a phone number of a relative or friend. Before the Russians came, Lobas was an ordinary local police chief, the head of Buchanksy District 1, who spent his days dealing with ordinary local crime and the occasional murder. Since the liberation of Bucha, he has spent his days in this abandoned school classroom, where school posters still hang on the walls, coordinating the massive operation to find the dead. In front of Lobas on the school desk there was a map of Bucha, a once peaceful and little-known suburb of Kyiv that is now a sprawling crime scene. The area was occupied by Russian forces for a month as they attempted to assault Kyiv, and its liberation a little over a week ago has begun a slow and painful process of uncovering horrors. Each time the phone rang, Lobas consulted the map in front of him, and on a plain piece of paper he wrote down the necessary information in neat handwriting, one line per body. By mid-morning, he had filled one side of A4 and moved on to the reverse. The previous day there had been 64 bodies, he said. The day before, 37. He did not know how many there would be that day, but he was expecting the number to jump by around 40 because a mass grave was being dug up nearby. Lobas is only in charge of one part of this region, and many more bodies are being found outside his jurisdiction. Vitaliy Lobas, the head of Buchansky District 1 police department, takes a call in his command post in a school classroom. Lobas paused occasionally to go to the school playground for a cigarette, but even these moments were interrupted by calls about bodies or problems relating to the collection of bodies. It was raining in Bucha, and one of the vans that ferried corpses to the morgue had become stuck in the mud. A tractor needed to be found quickly, because there was a limited number of vans and a large number of bodies. Lobas generally delegates the field work to his deputies, but in cases of particularly grave crimes he goes himself. ""When people have been shot in the head with their hands tied behind their back, for example, I will go,"" he said. ""When the bodies have been burned I also go."" About mid-morning, a call came in from Dmytro Kushnir, a 24-year-old police deputy in one of Lobas's units, to log a body that had been reported behind an apartment building on the outskirts of Bucha. When Kushnir arrived at the building, which stood alone on an otherwise undeveloped green area on the edge of woodland, he found two men behind the building at the place where the property line met the woods. They were wearing blue surgical gloves and standing over the partially decomposed body of a man who appeared to have been shot in the back of the head. The body lay on a stained white duvet decorated with red flowers and was surrounded by empty bottles of beer and spirits. The blue surgical gloves initially gave the men the appearance of medical officials, but they introduced themselves as Volodymyr and Serhiy Brezhnev, the dead man's father and brother. Lying on the blanket was Vitaliy Brezhnev, a 30-year-old former cook who, until the Russians arrived, lived a peaceful life with his girlfriend on the sixth floor of the apartment building that now towered over his corpse. Serhiy Brezhnev stands over his brother's body. ""He was a kind-hearted man, he gave his all,"" Serhiy said. A passport picture of Vitaliy that Serhiy carried while he searched for his brother Volodymyr and Serhiy had lost contact with Vitaliy a month earlier, when the Russians seized control of Bucha and communications went down. It was impossible to enter the suburb to check his building, so they searched for him for a month online, scouring social media in vain for evidence that he was alive. When the Russians finally retreated, a little over a week ago, Serhiy got a call from Vitaliy's girlfriend and she told them the story. The Russians had assaulted the apartment building and blasted their way into every apartment with a shotgun, she said, demanding people handed over their SIM cards and keys. They interrogated her and Vitaliy in separate rooms, beat them, and shot their dog, she said. Then they took her down to the basement with a group of other residents and bolted the door, but took Vitaliy away separately and told her she wouldn't see him again, and she didn't. As soon as the Ukrainian army declared Bucha safe to re-enter, Volodymyr and Serhiy set out for the apartment building. Inside, they found blood smeared on the floor in the stairwells and personal photographs from people's apartments strewn around. On every door you could see the holes from the shotgun blasts - sometimes one, sometimes four or five. Doors with steel plates had been crowbarred. On one wooden door, where the lock hadn't given way to repeated shots, the Russian soldiers appeared to have become frustrated and blown a hole right through the middle of the door into the apartment. Behind another door, it was clear the homeowners had pushed a heavy table up against the frame in a failed attempt to keep the invaders out. Every door in Vitaliy Brezhnev's apartment building had been blown open with a shotgun. When Volodymyr and Serhiy reached the sixth floor they saw that the shotgun had been used on the door of Apartment 83. A rank odour came from inside. The Russians had trashed the apartment and pried open the air vents and even the bathroom drain, looking for money, Serhiy guessed. When he entered Vitaliy's bedroom he suffered the first of several blows to his hopes of finding his brother alive. On the pillow there was a deep blood stain and blood was sprayed up the walls behind the bed. Among the mess on the floor there were two 7.62mm bullet casings - the calibre used by the Russian army in their rifles. ""You could see that a man had been killed here,"" Serhiy said. ""But there was no body."" So Volodymyr and Serhiy began to search for Vitaliy, knowing that their search was now probably for a body and not a son and brother they could hold again in their arms. Serhiy was carrying a passport photograph of Vitaliy. ""We searched and searched,"" he said, ""and at first we were looking for his face."" Warning: Readers may find some of the following images distressing The scene inside Vitaliy's bedroom. ""You could see a man had been killed here,"" Serhiy said. Vitaliy Brezhnev's body was found behind his apartment, where the property line met the woods. Behind the building, next to the woods, they found what appeared to be a shallow grave, and they began to dig. It took time to exhume the remains there. First they saw a flower-patterned duvet they didn't recognise and their hearts found some hope. But when they brought the body up they saw that inside the duvet there was a curtain from Vitaliy's apartment. Then they saw the dead man's shoes and thought they recognised them. The light was fading by that point and they had to be home before curfew, so they covered the body with the sheet. Embers of hope remained. ""Today was the final touch,"" Serhiy said, the following day, looking down at the body. ""Today we took his shoes off and we saw his feet."" Because Vitaliy's feet had been inside socks and shoes they were better preserved than the rest of his body after a month in the earth. ""We saw the shape of his feet,"" Volodymyr said. ""Then we looked at the shape of the nose and the hands,"" Serhiy said. ""And we knew it was our bloodline."" Volodymyr replaces the thin sheet that covered the body where it lay Volodymyr and Serhiy waiting for the van that collects the bodies. Eventually they gave up. Volodymyr had purchased the small apartment in Bucha two years earlier - an investment in his son's future. Vitaliy had been a cook in a restaurant in Kyiv, until the pandemic hit and he was laid off. He did some work in construction and was looking for something more stable, but he had a girlfriend he loved and a dog, and now an apartment in a nice neighbourhood. He loved to fish and hunt, and forage for mushrooms in his spare time, and cook. ""He was living a peaceful life here,"" Serhiy said. ""He was a normal guy, that's all, a kind-hearted man. He gave his all."" ""He was a son and a brother,"" Volodymyr said, trying to hold back his tears. At the front of the apartment building, Officer Kushnir was filling out his police report. Volodymyr went to his car and took two small pieces of cardboard and wrote his name and phone number and Vitaliy's name and address on each. Then he asked some neighbours for clear tape to cover the ink, because the rain was beginning to fall harder on Bucha, and he went back to the body, without surgical gloves this time, to tie one piece of card to Vitaliy's ankle and one to his wrist. ""I do not want to lose my son,"" he said. Officer Kushnir finished his report and called it in. Chief Lobas would arrange for the van that collected the bodies to stop by. Volodymyr and Serhiy took shelter from the rain and waited for the van to arrive. Families in Bucha attached tags to their loved ones or put passports in their pockets, so as not to lose them again. As the day wore on, Chief Lobas's classroom command post got busier. Officers came and went, filing crime scene reports. The list on Lobas's desk got longer and his phone kept ringing. A dead woman had been found in a well next to a destroyed column of Russian tanks. There was a body on the ninth floor of an apartment building. A driver of one of the vans called to say he couldn't find the body he had been sent to collect. A woman came in to the classroom in person to report that her neighbour was dead. ""I understand everything,"" Lobas told her, keen to move on. ""We will try to collect him today."" Lobas's father called. ""Dad, I am too busy,"" he said. ""Everything is OK."" Two of Bucha district's police departments had been destroyed in the Russian assault and Lobas was struggling for resources. There were not enough body bags. His team had also been whittled down over the preceding days to those who had shown themselves capable of withstanding this new work. ""Those who were weak went at the very beginning,"" he said. There was little room for sentiment amid the scale of the task. Lobas received another call. ""Nine?"" he said. ""Where?"" The call was coming from a unit in a neighbouring police department. Nine bodies were buried in a field nearby. Lobas hung up and dialled one of his mobile units. ""The team there is exhausted and they have no body bags left,"" he said. ""They have been collecting bodies all day. Please go and help them now. Find body bags and help them to pack the bodies."" Nine graves, dug by neighbours behind apartment buildings in Bucha. The nine graves were laid out neatly in a row at the edge of the field, behind a corrugated fence at the end of a dirt track. The dead had been buried by their neighbours during the Russian occupation and now they were being exhumed by their neighbours, with the help of the police. ""Some of these people died because they could not get medicine and some were killed by Russians,"" said Gennadiy, a 45-year-old Ukrainian from one of the buildings by the field, who had helped to bury the the bodies and was doing the most work now to bring them up. ""These were our neighbours,"" Gennadiy said, a look of deep anger set in his face. ""Here is Uncle Tolya from the building next door and a neighbour of his. Here is another person I knew from the next building. This man has a bullet wound, we didn't know him but we found a passport on his body. This elderly woman had severe diabetes and we tried to take her out of Bucha but there was no green corridor, so she died. This man went for a walk with his dog and didn't come back. We are not pathologists but it looks like he was shot."" Gennadiy, a resident who buried his neighbours, helps to bring them up from their graves. The work to remove the bodies was hard. They had been buried well in deep graves, and the rain was soaking into the mud and making it slippery. Gennadiy, in a green plastic rain cape, climbed into each grave, one after the other, and shovelled the earth from around the bodies so that thick straps could be tied around them to hoist them up. Each body had been wrapped in whatever was at hand - curtains, blankets of different colours and patterns. They were examined by the police and any obvious wounds photographed with an iPhone. Enough body bags had been found, and after a while the van arrived. In the dirt on its back doors, someone had scrawled '200' - the military identifier for the transport of the dead. The bodies were loaded inside. The sky was grey and the rain kept falling. At Vitaliy's apartment building, Volodymyr and Serhiy had waited as long as they could for the van to arrive. It was getting dark and they needed to get home. Vitaliy's body would have to spend another night on the ground. They were too late now to make the 9pm curfew in Kyiv, but at the military checkpoints along the route they showed the death report and were waved through. At sunrise the next morning, the father and son got up and began the drive back to Bucha. They could not wait for the van any longer, and they loaded Vitaliy's body into the back of their car and set out for a morgue in the town of Boyarka, about an hour's drive south. Before the invasion, the staff at the Boyarka morgue were used to handling about three bodies a day, the vast majority of them deaths from natural causes. Since Bucha was liberated, they have been autopsying about 50 bodies a day, 80% of which were violent deaths, said Semen Petrovych, 39, who has been the forensic expert there for 16 years. The Boyarka morgue used to receive three bodies a day. Now it is autopsying about 50. The morgue, a small outbuilding at the back of a hospital on the edge of town, where Boyarka meets the forest, had just acquired two rented refrigerator trucks and both were full of bodies. Body bags lay on the floor by the trucks and against the fence nearby and either side of the entrance to the morgue. ""There are not enough staff and there is not enough room,"" said Petrovych, the forensic expert. ""Even if we had more people, where would we put the bodies?"" Normally he would do a careful autopsy on every body and print a death certificate. ""Now we just dissect them quickly and write something simple by hand,"" he said. Volodymyr and Serhiy were not alone in bringing a body themselves. Private cars pulled up to the morgue and bodies were brought out wrapped in blankets and rugs. Relatives and friends came searching. Tatiana Zhylenko was looking for the body of the father of a friend who was abroad. ""He had his passport on his chest,"" she told the staff. Oleksander Zakovorotnyi came for his father-in-law, who, when the Russians cut the gas supply in the depth of winter, rigged up a makeshift heater using a gas cylinder, but fell asleep and was poisoned when the flame went out. Serhiy Brezhnev helps carry Vitaliy's body bag out from the morgue, to await fingerprinting. Volodymyr and Serhiy waited outside until they were called in to identify Vitaliy. They stood inside the cramped, low-ceilinged morgue, where there were bodies on the floor and on every gurney and the smell was overpowering. They had to squeeze between two gurneys, beside an open corpse, to get close to Vitaliy's body, and they searched it for scars they could remember. They repeated to the pathologist that they thought they recognised his feet. Volodymyr looked away and looked back. He was wrestling with doubt and hope. Afterwards, he walked behind the refrigerator truck and stood alone sobbing, his chest heaving with his tears. Vitaliy was brought out, his body bag tagged number 552 - the 552nd body processed by this small morgue since the beginning of the year, nearly double the figure in a normal year, the extra hundreds all condensed into one week. The police took fingerprints and told Volodymyr and Serhiy that the formal identification would take around a month, because of the backlog, but otherwise they were free to take him to the cemetery to be buried. The line of body bags at the Bucha cemetery, waiting to be processed and buried. Because Vitaliy was already identified, he was placed by his family straight into a casket. Rather than wait for the body van, Volodymyr and Serhiy lifted Vitaliy carefully again into the back of their car and drove him the hour or so back to Bucha, past the rows of destroyed homes and places where bodies had laid in the streets for weeks. At the cemetery, which was already full, new graves were being dug outside the boundary fence on a thin strip of earth along the side of the road. A priest intoned the funeral rites over a coffin. The mother of the dead man wailed. In the near distance, past the line of the forest, enormous booms sounded as unexploded ordnance was detonated. Volodymyr and Serhiy drove into the cemetery and unloaded Vitaliy next to a long line of body bags arrayed on the ground. Because Vitaliy had already been identified and would be buried here in Bucha, he was placed into a simple wooden casket with maroon fabric and afforded the small dignity of resting inside a brick building on the cemetery grounds. He would be buried in two days' time. Volodymyr and Serhiy left the cemetery and Volodymyr decided that, even though it was far from their home in Kyiv, he would buy a plot there for his wife Lily, Vitaliy's mother, who was suffering from end-stage cancer, so that when the time came she would be near to her son. Two days later, on a bright, cold morning in Bucha, the family gathered at the cemetery. Once again, Volodymyr and Serhiy took the lead and went inside the brick building to prepare to carry the casket. Lily sat outside on a bench, smoking a cigarette, alone among the body bags. The casket was carried to a stone plinth and the family gathered around it while the priest read the funeral rites and two elderly women from the church held the incense burner and sang. Then Vitaliy was taken by the van marked 200 to one of the fresh graves along the roadside outside the cemetery and laid to rest. Volodymyr was still wrestling with doubt. ""I am still hoping that the fingerprints will show this was not my son,"" he said. The family gathers for a small funeral service for Vitaliy Vitaliy Brezhnev was buried on Monday 11 April, in a fresh grave by the road Later that day, back at the abandoned school in Bucha, Chief Lobas was sitting at his schooldesk, listening carefully to a man who had come in person to ask for help finding a relative he had heard was in a mass grave. The man had been to the large mass grave by the church, he said, but they redirected him to the police. He wanted to give Chief Lobas a picture, but Lobas explained that this was not the way things were done. ""We cannot go around opening all the body bags holding this picture,"" he said. ""Do you understand? It will waste too much time."" Lobas explained that they had to begin burying the unidentified bodies because there was not enough space at the morgues. But he assured the man that fingerprints and photographs were being taken and would be kept. ""Even though the people themselves are buried the information remains,"" he said. ""The photographs remain."" The calls kept coming in - a body on Yablunska Street, another body next to a school. ""We have cleared these two addresses already, give us more to collect,"" Lobas said. He saw a window for a cigarette and went to the playground. The number of bodies each day was already beginning to fall, and he thought the job might be finished soon. ""There are no weekends here now, we will keep working until the collection of the bodies is complete,"" he said. He flicked his cigarette away. His phone was ringing.

UK criticised over 'cruel' Rwanda asylum planSome of those arriving on small boats will be sent to the country as part of a Â£120m trial.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Watch: Prime Minister outlines Rwanda immigration plans in April Plans to send some asylum seekers who arrive in the UK on small boats to live in Rwanda have been described as ""absolutely chilling"" and ""cruel and nasty"" by charities and politicians. The government has faced fierce criticism for the policy with questions raised over costs and impact as well as Rwanda's human rights record. But Boris Johnson said the Â£120m pilot scheme would ""save countless lives"". The PM said it would break the business model of ""vile people smugglers"". The pilot scheme would initially focus mainly on single men arriving on boats or lorries and would see them given a one-way ticket for the 4,000-mile trip to Rwanda where they would be processed and, if successful, would have long-term accommodation in the African country. Home Secretary Priti Patel, who travelled to Rwandan capital Kigali to sign the deal, said the ""vast majority"" of those arriving in the UK ""illegally"" would be considered for relocation to Rwanda. Thescheme is one of a number of measures announced to tackle small boat crossings in the Channel, with others including plans to hand operational control of the Channel to the Navy and asylum seekers who are resettled in the UK being spread more evenly across authorities. What does the new Rwanda asylum seeker deal mean? Land of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinion Which countries send asylum seekers overseas? Former RAF station to become asylum centre More than 160 charities and campaign groups - including the UK network of non-governmental organisations Bond - have called on the government to scrap the plans in an open letter that described the scheme as ""shamefully cruel"". Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the charity was ""appalled by the government's cruel and nasty decision"" that would ""do little"" to deter people from coming to the UK. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson was trying to distract from his ""partygate"" fine with the ""unworkable, unethical and extortionate"" scheme, while the Lib Dems said the government was ""slamming the door"" in the face of refugees and the SNP's Ian Blackford called it ""absolutely chilling"". The government has for years struggled to address the issue of small boats crossing the Channel. Different ideas have been floated about how to tackle illegal immigration - many have been dismissed and ruled out. So this is an attempt by Boris Johnson to tackle the issue head on. It matters to Conservative voters - taking back control of borders was one of Mr Johnson's big Brexit promises. But this isn't a simple plan to implement. It will be expensive - and it's extremely controversial. Ministers know they will face legal challenges - and that some are sceptical it will amount to much. The PM admitted it would not be enough on its own to solve the issue, but he insisted that over time it will prove a considerable deterrent. Many will be looking to see if he's right. Former Ukip and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has also criticised the plans, saying they were ""not much more than a short-term solution"". He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme the problem with sending people away to islands or other countries was ""it's not very long before you start to hear tales of abuse"" and after that the Human Rights Act could be invoked to stop it. He suggested the UK should turn boats back - a method that was used by Australia - but Mr Johnson conceded the controversial ""pushback"" technique would be dangerous except in ""extremely limited circumstances"". The plans have been welcomed by some witha snap YouGov poll,externalshowing 35% of those asked supported the proposal, while 42% opposed it. Recent researchby Ipsos Mori,externalsuggested 60% of the public were dissatisfied with the government's migration policy - more than half of which cited Channel crossings. Former UK Border Force chief Tony Smith said it was a ""bold move"" and may put people off paying people smugglers, when they heard they could be sent to a third country. BBC Radio 5 Live listenersshared their views with Nicky Campbell: ""What's crueller - that or being drowned? If it saves one life, surely it's got to be better than what's happening with these migrants now""- Lorraine, Dartington ""How are we treating these humans? Are we suddenly saying those coming from Ukraine, their lives are better value than those coming from certain other countries? I think it's abhorrent""- Hamid, Bicester ""I feel it's a real shame. We seem to have eroded this idea of fairness in our nation. We seem to no longer want to be the nation that wants to help other people. It seems a shame we've lost those values in our country""- Chris, Devon ""Let's forget about the optics and actually look at the reality. People smugglers will keep trying to find different ways until we break it. That's the cruel part here... I applaud the government for having some backbone""- Martin, Bedford Concerns have also been raised about the Rwandan government's human rights record and its president, Paul Kagame. Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK's refugee and migrant rights director, warned sending people seeking asylum in the UK to another country ""let alone one with such a dismal human rights record"" was ""the very height of irresponsibility"". Last year, the UK governmentexpressed concern,externalat the United Nations over ""continued restrictions to civil and political rights and media freedom"" in Rwanda. But Mr Johnson described Rwanda as being one of the safest countries in the world and said there was a ""risk of stereotyping"". Rwanda,a small landlocked country in east-central Africa, has been trying to recover from the ethnic strife that culminated in government-sponsored genocide in the mid-1990s. Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told the BBC it is ""a safe country, it's developing rapidly, we care as much as every country about human rights"". She said the nation had a ""strong record of protecting migrants and refugees"". ""We're expecting thousands here - this is a brand new approach, it's never been done before."" Why is the Nationality Bill causing protests? Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Refugees minister declines to comment on Rwanda plan According to a memorandum of understanding between the two governments the UK would screen asylum seekers ""without delay"" after their arrival in the UK and then provide Rwanda with basic details of each person it wanted to transfer. Rwanda would have to approve all requests before they were transferred, and the arrangement would last for five years. This video can not be played Rwandan foreign minister: Immigration plan not for those from neighbouring nations After arriving in the east African nation each asylum seeker would be given accommodation and support and would be free to come and go from their accommodation at all times, the memorandum says. The UK would also resettle ""a portion of Rwanda's most vulnerable refugees"" in the UK. Mr Johnson said action was needed to stop people smugglers turning the ocean into a ""watery graveyard"", and said the British taxpayer could not be asked ""to write a blank cheque to cover the costs of anyone who might want to come and live here"". On Thursday hundreds of people have crossed the Channel, with women, children and men brought ashore by the RNLI and Border Force at Dover, Kent. Last year,28,526 people are known to have crossedin small boats, up from 8,404 in 2020. In 2021 64% of asylum applications were successful after an initial decision was made, according to government figures, with some more granted after appeals. The number of people who could be relocated would be ""unlimited"", said Mr Johnson. Rwanda will have the ""capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead"", including those who have arrived ""illegally"" since the start of the year, he said. The home secretary said her department had prepared for legal challenges over the deal but she was confident any claims could be successfully contested. During her visit to Kigali, Ms Patel said the British public had been ""crying out for change for the years"" and it was ""incredibly unfair to the British public to see organisations in their own country effectively just putting blockages after blockages in the way"". Dr Niovi Vavoula, lecturer in migration and security at Queen Mary University School of Law, said she anticipated legal challenges being made under the international principle of non-refoulement - which guarantees no-one can be returned to a country where they would face ""torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment and other irreparable harm"". The BBC has seen accommodation the asylum seekers would be housed in, thought to have enough space for about 100 people at a time and to process up to 500 a year The Rwandan government said migrants would be ""entitled to full protection under Rwandan law, equal access to employment, and enrolment in healthcare and social care services"". The UK Home Office believes existing asylum law will be enough to implement the plan, and Ms Patel said it was not reliant on the Nationality and Borders Bill - which has faced a series of defeats in the lords - going through Parliament.

One-way ticket to Rwanda for some UK asylum seekers,"This video can not be played Watch: Prime Minister outlines Rwanda immigration plans in April Some asylum seekers who cross the Channel to the UK will be given a one-way ticket to Rwanda under new government plans. The pilot scheme will focus on single men arriving on boats or lorries. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Â£120m scheme would ""save countless lives"" from human trafficking. Refugee organisations have criticised the plan as cruel. They questioned its cost and impact and raised concerns about Rwanda's human rights record. Mr Johnson said action was needed to stop ""vile people smugglers"" turning the ocean into a ""watery graveyard"", with the plan designed to break their business model. ""Our compassion may be infinite but our capacity to help people is not,"" he said. ""We can't ask the British taxpayer to write a blank cheque to cover the costs of anyone who might want to come and live here."" How many Channel crossings are there and what will change? Which countries send asylum seekers overseas? Former RAF station to become asylum centre Those who succeed in making it to the UK ""will be taken not to hotels at vast public expense"", the prime minister said, and instead would be housed in detention centres. Speaking in Kent, he said the new plan would ""over time prove a very considerable deterrent"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the scheme as ""unworkable"" and ""extortionate"", claiming it was an attempt to distract from Mr Johnson's ""partygate"" fine. Last year,28,526 people are known to have crossedin small boats, up from 8,404 in 2020. About 600 people made the crossing on Wednesday - the figure could reach 1,000 a day in coming weeks, Mr Johnson said. The number of people who can be relocated will be ""unlimited"", said Mr Johnson. Rwanda will have the ""capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead"", including those who have arrived ""illegally"" since the start of the year, he said. Migrants arriving in Dover after being rescued crossing the Channel ""We cannot sustain a parallel illegal system,"" said the prime minister. ""Our compassion may be infinite, but our capacity to help people is not."" Home Secretary Priti Patel, who travelled to Rwandan capital Kigali to sign the deal, said it was a ""global first and it will change the way we collectively tackle illegal migration"". She said the ""vast majority"" of those arriving in the UK ""illegally"" would be considered for relocation to Rwanda. Why is the Nationality Bill causing protests? Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Refugees minister declines to comment on Rwanda plan Recent researchby Ipsos Mori,externalsuggested 60% of the public were dissatisfied with the government's migration policy - more than half of which cited Channel crossings. BBC home editor Mark Easton, reporting from Rwanda, said ministers would face legal hurdles and substantial costs to launch the scheme. Precise details of the plan are yet to be confirmed - but he said the trial would be restricted to mostly single men. Under the proposal, Rwanda would take responsibility for the people who made the more than 4,000-mile journey, put them through an asylum process, and at the end of that process, if they were successful, they would have long-term accommodation in Rwanda. The BBC has seen accommodation the asylum seekers would be housed in, thought to have enough space for about 100 people at a time and to process up to 500 a year. Journalists were given a tour of a typical government refugee facility in Rwanda The Rwandan government said migrants would be ""entitled to full protection under Rwandan law, equal access to employment, and enrolment in healthcare and social care services"". The UK Home Office believes existing asylum law will be enough to implement the plan, but questions remain about the legality of the scheme. Mr Johnson said the plan was ""fully compliant"" with international law, but acknowledged he expected it to be subject to challenge in the courts and from a ""formidable army of politically-motivated lawyers"". BBC Radio 5 Live listenersshared their views with Nicky Campbell: ""What's crueller - that or being drowned? If it saves one life, surely it's got to be better than what's happening with these migrants now""- Lorraine, Dartington ""How are we treating these humans? Are we suddenly saying those coming from Ukraine, their lives are better value than those coming from certain other countries? I think it's abhorrent""- Hamid, Bicester ""I feel it's a real shame. We seem to have eroded this idea of fairness in our nation. We seem to no longer want to be the nation that wants to help other people. It seems a shame we've lost those values in our country""- Chris, Devon ""Let's forget about the optics and actually look at the reality. People smugglers will keep trying to find different ways until we break it. That's the cruel part here... I applaud the government for having some backbone""- Martin, Bedford British Red Cross executive director Zoe Abrams said the humanitarian network was ""profoundly concerned"" about the scheme and that ""the financial and human cost will be considerable"". Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the charity was ""appalled by the government's cruel and nasty decision"", which it said would ""do little"" to deter people from coming to the UK. Miranda Butler, a barrister who specialises in immigration law, said there were ""serious questions"" about the risks faced by migrants under this ""expedited process"". The Lib Dems said the government was ""slamming the door"" in the face of refugees, while the SNP's Ian Blackford described the plan as ""absolutely chilling"". Questions have been raised over the human rights record of the Rwandan government and its president, Paul Kagame. Last year, the UK governmentexpressed concern,externalat the United Nations over ""continued restrictions to civil and political rights and media freedom"" in Rwanda. But Mr Johnson described Rwanda as being one of the safest countries in the world. Other countries - including Ascension Island and Gibraltar - had also been considered. The prime minister also announced: Asylum seekers who are resettled in the UK will be spread more evenly across local authorities Plans to hand operational control of the Channel to the Royal Navy Â£50m in funding for new equipment and specialist personnel for Channel operations A new government facility to house migrants, described as a reception centre, in Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire A maximum sentence of life imprisonment for people smugglers The government's Nationality and Borders Bill is making its way through Parliament, but time is running out to pass it into law after a series of defeats in the House of Lords. MPs are currently on a break, but when they return, they are due to review a series of amendments, including one about powers to offshore asylum claims.

How will the Rwanda asylum plan work?,"The government says ""stopping the boats"" crossing the English Channel is a key political priority. As part of this, it is pushing ahead with its plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, despite a Supreme Court judgment that the policy is unlawful. Since the Supreme Court ruling,the government has signed a new treaty with Rwanda to strengthen its asylum process, and proposed new UK laws declaring that Rwanda is a safe country. As well as the Rwanda plan, theIllegal Migration Actincludes a number of new provisions: the home secretary has a duty to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally either to Rwanda, or another ""safe"" third country migrants will not be granted bail or able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detention under-18s, those medically unfit to fly or at risk of serious harm in the country to which they are being removed, will be able to delay departure the number of refugees the UK settles through ""safe and legal routes"" is capped. The government also signed a new agreement with France, under which the UK will pay Â£500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre.

Beauty firm L'Occitane keeps Russian shops open,"The French beauty brand L'Occitane says it will keep its shops in Russia open despite the invasion of Ukraine. The firm told the BBC it had discussed closing its stores ""at length"" but said it had not because it wanted to protect staff from potential ""retaliation"". It has stopped shipping to Russia but website sales still seem to be open. Hundreds of international brands including L'Oreal and Estee Lauder have already closed shops and ceased online sales in Russia in protest at the war. Some customers criticised L'Occitane for its decision and called for a boycott of the brand which is sold at more than 3,085 retail outlets worldwide and had sales of â¬1.5bn (Â£1.3bn) last year. The cosmetics firm, which has spas and stores in Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg, said it could not take the ""risk"" of closing its shops. ""At this point we cannot guarantee that our 700 employees in Russia will not face retaliation if we cease to operate in the country,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC.

Why migrants leave for UK,"Almost 37,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2024, figures released on New Year's Day show. Last year was the deadliest on record for people trying to make the crossing, according to a United Nations agency. In 2024, 36,816 were detected making the crossing. That's higher than in 2023, when29,437 people arrived. However, the highest recorded figures are for 2022, when 45,755 people made the crossing. Since 2018, when figures were first recorded, more than 150,000 people have arrived in small boats. Of those who arrived in 2024, more than23,000 did so after Labour won the July general election. Sir Keir said the UK's new Border Security Command would trace suspected people smugglers and shut down their bank accounts. They will also facetravel bans, social media blackouts and phone restrictionsunder new laws, the government has announced. Net migration hit record 906,000 last year Immigration cuts: Why prime ministers keep failing to meet their targets The International Organization for Migration (IOM), a UN agency,tracks the number of people who die crossing the Channel,external. It estimates that at least 78 migrants died trying to cross the Channel in 2024. The Refugee Council said that government enforcement efforts have increased the dangers of crossings, withmore people crammed into less seaworthy boats,external. The IOM says,externalthat 241 migrants are missing or have died attempting to cross the English Channel since 2018. Its figures include people who were travelling to a crossing point and died in other circumstances, such as car crashes or as a result of medical issues. âDeath trapâ Channel boats traded by smugglers in German city 'Merchants of death' trial steps up fight against Channel smugglers In the year to September 2024, almost 5,000 Afghans crossed the Channel. Iranians were the second largest group, followed by people from Syria, Vietnam and Eritrea. Where recorded, more than 80% were male. About 40% were between 25 and 39 years old. Smuggler reveals operation to help Vietnamese reach UK People smuggler advertised Channel boat crossings on Facebook More than99,700 people claimed asylum in the UK,externalin the year ending September 2024, Home Office figures show. Applications peaked at about 103,000 in 2002, as people fled conflicts in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq. Claims then fell sharply, dropping to a 20-year low of 22,600 in 2010. However, numbers rose again throughout the 2010s, as refugees fled Syria. Asylum applications have risen again in recent years, more than doubling from 45,318 in the year to September 2021 to 92,776 just one year later, followed by smaller increases since then. In the year to September 2024, the largest number of asylum seekers came from Pakistan, with more than 9,500 applications. Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, and India were among the other countries with most applications. Ukrainian refugees who came to the UK after Russia's invasion of their country are not included in the figures. As of 26 November 2024,266,300 visas had been issued to Ukrainian refugees,external, who came through legal routes set up by the UK government. There are separate arrangements for a few other specific groups, such as some Afghan refugees and Hong Kong citizens. Some people wait months or even years for their claims to be considered. At the end of September 2024, there were 97,170 cases relating to 133,409 people awaiting an initial decision. Former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to clear older claims by the end of 2023. However, 4,500 ""complex cases"" were still awaiting a decision at the end of December that year. There were 1,669 of these cases remaining at the end of September 2024. The Home Office can remove people with no legal right to stay in the UK, or refuse to let them enter. In the year to the end of September 2024,8,519 people who were not granted asylum were returned to their home country.,external This is up 52% on the same period in 2023, mainly because of a rise in people being returned to Albania. Between 2018 and September 2024, there were 4,420 returns of people who came to the UK in small boats - about 3% of arrivals. There weremore than 180,000 arrivals by sea in Europe,externalduring 2024, with Italy receiving more than a third. Greece and Spain also received large numbers. In 2023, there were 263,000 arrivals by sea in Europe. The UK had the fifth highest number of people claiming asylum in the EU and European Economic Area in the year ending June 2024. Germany received the largest number, with 319,710 applicants. Spain had the second highest number (163,755) followed by France (163,190) and Italy (158,560). In 2023, the UK government made initial decisions on 93,303 asylum applications - including people attached to them such as children or other dependents - and granted more than two thirds of them (67%). In the same period, Germany made 217,430 asylum decisions, and granted 62%. France - a country with a similar-sized population to the UK - made 132,695 decisions, and granted 31% of them.

Collecting the dead in BuchaUkraine round-up: US and France divided on genocideRussia building up troops ahead of new offensive,"Police in Bucha examine a body unearthed in a field. At least 500 dead have been found since the Russians left. When the Russians retreated from Bucha, a massive operation began to find and document the dead. BBC News joined the local police officers and bereaved families as they carried out their grim task. Warning: This article contains graphic images. Police Chief Vitaliy Lobas was sitting at a child's desk in an abandoned school in Bucha, collecting the details of the bodies. Every few minutes, Chief Lobas, who has broad shoulders and short dark hair, and rarely uses an unnecessary word, received a call on his mobile phone, and the brief conversations went the same: a location, a few details, a phone number of a relative or friend. Before the Russians came, Lobas was an ordinary local police chief, the head of Buchanksy District 1, who spent his days dealing with ordinary local crime and the occasional murder. Since the liberation of Bucha, he has spent his days in this abandoned school classroom, where school posters still hang on the walls, coordinating the massive operation to find the dead. In front of Lobas on the school desk there was a map of Bucha, a once peaceful and little-known suburb of Kyiv that is now a sprawling crime scene. The area was occupied by Russian forces for a month as they attempted to assault Kyiv, and its liberation a little over a week ago has begun a slow and painful process of uncovering horrors. Each time the phone rang, Lobas consulted the map in front of him, and on a plain piece of paper he wrote down the necessary information in neat handwriting, one line per body. By mid-morning, he had filled one side of A4 and moved on to the reverse. The previous day there had been 64 bodies, he said. The day before, 37. He did not know how many there would be that day, but he was expecting the number to jump by around 40 because a mass grave was being dug up nearby. Lobas is only in charge of one part of this region, and many more bodies are being found outside his jurisdiction. Vitaliy Lobas, the head of Buchansky District 1 police department, takes a call in his command post in a school classroom. Lobas paused occasionally to go to the school playground for a cigarette, but even these moments were interrupted by calls about bodies or problems relating to the collection of bodies. It was raining in Bucha, and one of the vans that ferried corpses to the morgue had become stuck in the mud. A tractor needed to be found quickly, because there was a limited number of vans and a large number of bodies. Lobas generally delegates the field work to his deputies, but in cases of particularly grave crimes he goes himself. ""When people have been shot in the head with their hands tied behind their back, for example, I will go,"" he said. ""When the bodies have been burned I also go."" About mid-morning, a call came in from Dmytro Kushnir, a 24-year-old police deputy in one of Lobas's units, to log a body that had been reported behind an apartment building on the outskirts of Bucha. When Kushnir arrived at the building, which stood alone on an otherwise undeveloped green area on the edge of woodland, he found two men behind the building at the place where the property line met the woods. They were wearing blue surgical gloves and standing over the partially decomposed body of a man who appeared to have been shot in the back of the head. The body lay on a stained white duvet decorated with red flowers and was surrounded by empty bottles of beer and spirits. The blue surgical gloves initially gave the men the appearance of medical officials, but they introduced themselves as Volodymyr and Serhiy Brezhnev, the dead man's father and brother. Lying on the blanket was Vitaliy Brezhnev, a 30-year-old former cook who, until the Russians arrived, lived a peaceful life with his girlfriend on the sixth floor of the apartment building that now towered over his corpse. Serhiy Brezhnev stands over his brother's body. ""He was a kind-hearted man, he gave his all,"" Serhiy said. A passport picture of Vitaliy that Serhiy carried while he searched for his brother Volodymyr and Serhiy had lost contact with Vitaliy a month earlier, when the Russians seized control of Bucha and communications went down. It was impossible to enter the suburb to check his building, so they searched for him for a month online, scouring social media in vain for evidence that he was alive. When the Russians finally retreated, a little over a week ago, Serhiy got a call from Vitaliy's girlfriend and she told them the story. The Russians had assaulted the apartment building and blasted their way into every apartment with a shotgun, she said, demanding people handed over their SIM cards and keys. They interrogated her and Vitaliy in separate rooms, beat them, and shot their dog, she said. Then they took her down to the basement with a group of other residents and bolted the door, but took Vitaliy away separately and told her she wouldn't see him again, and she didn't. As soon as the Ukrainian army declared Bucha safe to re-enter, Volodymyr and Serhiy set out for the apartment building. Inside, they found blood smeared on the floor in the stairwells and personal photographs from people's apartments strewn around. On every door you could see the holes from the shotgun blasts - sometimes one, sometimes four or five. Doors with steel plates had been crowbarred. On one wooden door, where the lock hadn't given way to repeated shots, the Russian soldiers appeared to have become frustrated and blown a hole right through the middle of the door into the apartment. Behind another door, it was clear the homeowners had pushed a heavy table up against the frame in a failed attempt to keep the invaders out. Every door in Vitaliy Brezhnev's apartment building had been blown open with a shotgun. When Volodymyr and Serhiy reached the sixth floor they saw that the shotgun had been used on the door of Apartment 83. A rank odour came from inside. The Russians had trashed the apartment and pried open the air vents and even the bathroom drain, looking for money, Serhiy guessed. When he entered Vitaliy's bedroom he suffered the first of several blows to his hopes of finding his brother alive. On the pillow there was a deep blood stain and blood was sprayed up the walls behind the bed. Among the mess on the floor there were two 7.62mm bullet casings - the calibre used by the Russian army in their rifles. ""You could see that a man had been killed here,"" Serhiy said. ""But there was no body."" So Volodymyr and Serhiy began to search for Vitaliy, knowing that their search was now probably for a body and not a son and brother they could hold again in their arms. Serhiy was carrying a passport photograph of Vitaliy. ""We searched and searched,"" he said, ""and at first we were looking for his face."" Warning: Readers may find some of the following images distressing The scene inside Vitaliy's bedroom. ""You could see a man had been killed here,"" Serhiy said. Vitaliy Brezhnev's body was found behind his apartment, where the property line met the woods. Behind the building, next to the woods, they found what appeared to be a shallow grave, and they began to dig. It took time to exhume the remains there. First they saw a flower-patterned duvet they didn't recognise and their hearts found some hope. But when they brought the body up they saw that inside the duvet there was a curtain from Vitaliy's apartment. Then they saw the dead man's shoes and thought they recognised them. The light was fading by that point and they had to be home before curfew, so they covered the body with the sheet. Embers of hope remained. ""Today was the final touch,"" Serhiy said, the following day, looking down at the body. ""Today we took his shoes off and we saw his feet."" Because Vitaliy's feet had been inside socks and shoes they were better preserved than the rest of his body after a month in the earth. ""We saw the shape of his feet,"" Volodymyr said. ""Then we looked at the shape of the nose and the hands,"" Serhiy said. ""And we knew it was our bloodline."" Volodymyr replaces the thin sheet that covered the body where it lay Volodymyr and Serhiy waiting for the van that collects the bodies. Eventually they gave up. Volodymyr had purchased the small apartment in Bucha two years earlier - an investment in his son's future. Vitaliy had been a cook in a restaurant in Kyiv, until the pandemic hit and he was laid off. He did some work in construction and was looking for something more stable, but he had a girlfriend he loved and a dog, and now an apartment in a nice neighbourhood. He loved to fish and hunt, and forage for mushrooms in his spare time, and cook. ""He was living a peaceful life here,"" Serhiy said. ""He was a normal guy, that's all, a kind-hearted man. He gave his all."" ""He was a son and a brother,"" Volodymyr said, trying to hold back his tears. At the front of the apartment building, Officer Kushnir was filling out his police report. Volodymyr went to his car and took two small pieces of cardboard and wrote his name and phone number and Vitaliy's name and address on each. Then he asked some neighbours for clear tape to cover the ink, because the rain was beginning to fall harder on Bucha, and he went back to the body, without surgical gloves this time, to tie one piece of card to Vitaliy's ankle and one to his wrist. ""I do not want to lose my son,"" he said. Officer Kushnir finished his report and called it in. Chief Lobas would arrange for the van that collected the bodies to stop by. Volodymyr and Serhiy took shelter from the rain and waited for the van to arrive. Families in Bucha attached tags to their loved ones or put passports in their pockets, so as not to lose them again. As the day wore on, Chief Lobas's classroom command post got busier. Officers came and went, filing crime scene reports. The list on Lobas's desk got longer and his phone kept ringing. A dead woman had been found in a well next to a destroyed column of Russian tanks. There was a body on the ninth floor of an apartment building. A driver of one of the vans called to say he couldn't find the body he had been sent to collect. A woman came in to the classroom in person to report that her neighbour was dead. ""I understand everything,"" Lobas told her, keen to move on. ""We will try to collect him today."" Lobas's father called. ""Dad, I am too busy,"" he said. ""Everything is OK."" Two of Bucha district's police departments had been destroyed in the Russian assault and Lobas was struggling for resources. There were not enough body bags. His team had also been whittled down over the preceding days to those who had shown themselves capable of withstanding this new work. ""Those who were weak went at the very beginning,"" he said. There was little room for sentiment amid the scale of the task. Lobas received another call. ""Nine?"" he said. ""Where?"" The call was coming from a unit in a neighbouring police department. Nine bodies were buried in a field nearby. Lobas hung up and dialled one of his mobile units. ""The team there is exhausted and they have no body bags left,"" he said. ""They have been collecting bodies all day. Please go and help them now. Find body bags and help them to pack the bodies."" Nine graves, dug by neighbours behind apartment buildings in Bucha. The nine graves were laid out neatly in a row at the edge of the field, behind a corrugated fence at the end of a dirt track. The dead had been buried by their neighbours during the Russian occupation and now they were being exhumed by their neighbours, with the help of the police. ""Some of these people died because they could not get medicine and some were killed by Russians,"" said Gennadiy, a 45-year-old Ukrainian from one of the buildings by the field, who had helped to bury the the bodies and was doing the most work now to bring them up. ""These were our neighbours,"" Gennadiy said, a look of deep anger set in his face. ""Here is Uncle Tolya from the building next door and a neighbour of his. Here is another person I knew from the next building. This man has a bullet wound, we didn't know him but we found a passport on his body. This elderly woman had severe diabetes and we tried to take her out of Bucha but there was no green corridor, so she died. This man went for a walk with his dog and didn't come back. We are not pathologists but it looks like he was shot."" Gennadiy, a resident who buried his neighbours, helps to bring them up from their graves. The work to remove the bodies was hard. They had been buried well in deep graves, and the rain was soaking into the mud and making it slippery. Gennadiy, in a green plastic rain cape, climbed into each grave, one after the other, and shovelled the earth from around the bodies so that thick straps could be tied around them to hoist them up. Each body had been wrapped in whatever was at hand - curtains, blankets of different colours and patterns. They were examined by the police and any obvious wounds photographed with an iPhone. Enough body bags had been found, and after a while the van arrived. In the dirt on its back doors, someone had scrawled '200' - the military identifier for the transport of the dead. The bodies were loaded inside. The sky was grey and the rain kept falling. At Vitaliy's apartment building, Volodymyr and Serhiy had waited as long as they could for the van to arrive. It was getting dark and they needed to get home. Vitaliy's body would have to spend another night on the ground. They were too late now to make the 9pm curfew in Kyiv, but at the military checkpoints along the route they showed the death report and were waved through. At sunrise the next morning, the father and son got up and began the drive back to Bucha. They could not wait for the van any longer, and they loaded Vitaliy's body into the back of their car and set out for a morgue in the town of Boyarka, about an hour's drive south. Before the invasion, the staff at the Boyarka morgue were used to handling about three bodies a day, the vast majority of them deaths from natural causes. Since Bucha was liberated, they have been autopsying about 50 bodies a day, 80% of which were violent deaths, said Semen Petrovych, 39, who has been the forensic expert there for 16 years. The Boyarka morgue used to receive three bodies a day. Now it is autopsying about 50. The morgue, a small outbuilding at the back of a hospital on the edge of town, where Boyarka meets the forest, had just acquired two rented refrigerator trucks and both were full of bodies. Body bags lay on the floor by the trucks and against the fence nearby and either side of the entrance to the morgue. ""There are not enough staff and there is not enough room,"" said Petrovych, the forensic expert. ""Even if we had more people, where would we put the bodies?"" Normally he would do a careful autopsy on every body and print a death certificate. ""Now we just dissect them quickly and write something simple by hand,"" he said. Volodymyr and Serhiy were not alone in bringing a body themselves. Private cars pulled up to the morgue and bodies were brought out wrapped in blankets and rugs. Relatives and friends came searching. Tatiana Zhylenko was looking for the body of the father of a friend who was abroad. ""He had his passport on his chest,"" she told the staff. Oleksander Zakovorotnyi came for his father-in-law, who, when the Russians cut the gas supply in the depth of winter, rigged up a makeshift heater using a gas cylinder, but fell asleep and was poisoned when the flame went out. Serhiy Brezhnev helps carry Vitaliy's body bag out from the morgue, to await fingerprinting. Volodymyr and Serhiy waited outside until they were called in to identify Vitaliy. They stood inside the cramped, low-ceilinged morgue, where there were bodies on the floor and on every gurney and the smell was overpowering. They had to squeeze between two gurneys, beside an open corpse, to get close to Vitaliy's body, and they searched it for scars they could remember. They repeated to the pathologist that they thought they recognised his feet. Volodymyr looked away and looked back. He was wrestling with doubt and hope. Afterwards, he walked behind the refrigerator truck and stood alone sobbing, his chest heaving with his tears. Vitaliy was brought out, his body bag tagged number 552 - the 552nd body processed by this small morgue since the beginning of the year, nearly double the figure in a normal year, the extra hundreds all condensed into one week. The police took fingerprints and told Volodymyr and Serhiy that the formal identification would take around a month, because of the backlog, but otherwise they were free to take him to the cemetery to be buried. The line of body bags at the Bucha cemetery, waiting to be processed and buried. Because Vitaliy was already identified, he was placed by his family straight into a casket. Rather than wait for the body van, Volodymyr and Serhiy lifted Vitaliy carefully again into the back of their car and drove him the hour or so back to Bucha, past the rows of destroyed homes and places where bodies had laid in the streets for weeks. At the cemetery, which was already full, new graves were being dug outside the boundary fence on a thin strip of earth along the side of the road. A priest intoned the funeral rites over a coffin. The mother of the dead man wailed. In the near distance, past the line of the forest, enormous booms sounded as unexploded ordnance was detonated. Volodymyr and Serhiy drove into the cemetery and unloaded Vitaliy next to a long line of body bags arrayed on the ground. Because Vitaliy had already been identified and would be buried here in Bucha, he was placed into a simple wooden casket with maroon fabric and afforded the small dignity of resting inside a brick building on the cemetery grounds. He would be buried in two days' time. Volodymyr and Serhiy left the cemetery and Volodymyr decided that, even though it was far from their home in Kyiv, he would buy a plot there for his wife Lily, Vitaliy's mother, who was suffering from end-stage cancer, so that when the time came she would be near to her son. Two days later, on a bright, cold morning in Bucha, the family gathered at the cemetery. Once again, Volodymyr and Serhiy took the lead and went inside the brick building to prepare to carry the casket. Lily sat outside on a bench, smoking a cigarette, alone among the body bags. The casket was carried to a stone plinth and the family gathered around it while the priest read the funeral rites and two elderly women from the church held the incense burner and sang. Then Vitaliy was taken by the van marked 200 to one of the fresh graves along the roadside outside the cemetery and laid to rest. Volodymyr was still wrestling with doubt. ""I am still hoping that the fingerprints will show this was not my son,"" he said. The family gathers for a small funeral service for Vitaliy Vitaliy Brezhnev was buried on Monday 11 April, in a fresh grave by the road Later that day, back at the abandoned school in Bucha, Chief Lobas was sitting at his schooldesk, listening carefully to a man who had come in person to ask for help finding a relative he had heard was in a mass grave. The man had been to the large mass grave by the church, he said, but they redirected him to the police. He wanted to give Chief Lobas a picture, but Lobas explained that this was not the way things were done. ""We cannot go around opening all the body bags holding this picture,"" he said. ""Do you understand? It will waste too much time."" Lobas explained that they had to begin burying the unidentified bodies because there was not enough space at the morgues. But he assured the man that fingerprints and photographs were being taken and would be kept. ""Even though the people themselves are buried the information remains,"" he said. ""The photographs remain."" The calls kept coming in - a body on Yablunska Street, another body next to a school. ""We have cleared these two addresses already, give us more to collect,"" Lobas said. He saw a window for a cigarette and went to the playground. The number of bodies each day was already beginning to fall, and he thought the job might be finished soon. ""There are no weekends here now, we will keep working until the collection of the bodies is complete,"" he said. He flicked his cigarette away. His phone was ringing.

Ukraine round-up: US and France divided on genocideRussia building up troops ahead of new offensive,"Some believe killings in Bucha constitute genocide The United States has historically been reluctant to accuse states of genocide. The UN Genocide Convention, of which the US is a signatory, requires countries to intervene once genocide is formally identified. But amid mounting evidence of atrocities in Ukraine, President Joe Biden has now accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being guilty of what has been called the ""crime of all crimes"". He said President Putin was committing acts of genocide by trying to ""wipe out the idea"" of a Ukrainian identity. Not everyone is ready to go as far. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was reluctant to use the word, stating that he was ""not sure that an escalation of rhetoric serves that cause"". But what is genocide, and is there evidence that Russia is guilty of the crime in Ukraine? The BBC's George Wright took a look at the arguments for and againstaccusing President Putin of genocide. Russia is keeping up its assault on one of its key targets, the southern port city of Mariupol. If captured, it would be only the second major city after Kherson to fall since the war began, and pave the way for a broader Russian campaign in the east. The human cost has been immense: Mariupol's mayor says as many as 21,000 civilians have been killed in the southern city and 100,000 are still awaiting evacuation. Meanwhile, Ukraine has denied Russian reports of more than 1,000 marines surrendering in the city. One of them - a British man -told family there were no weapons left to fight. For a full picture of the fighting on the ground,our Visual Journalism team have been tracking the conflict in maps. When the Russians retreated from Bucha, one of several towns they occupied north of the capital Kyiv, a massive operation began to find and document the dead. One of the bodies belonged to Vitaliy, a former cook who moved to Bucha two years ago. ""He was living a peaceful life here,"" his brother Serhiy said. ""He was a normal guy, that's all, a kind-hearted man. He gave his all."" At least 500 dead have been found since the Russians left. The BBC's Joel Gunter joined the local police officers and bereaved families as they carried out their grim task. Prime Minister Sanna Marin (R) met Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson in Stockholm to discuss Nato One of Russia's main concerns has been the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato, but a consequence of the conflict may be that the bloc gains two new members anyway. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin says her country will decide whether to apply to join Nato ""within weeks"". She was speaking at a news conference alongside her Swedish counterpart - Sweden too is considering membership. As our Diplomatic Correspondent James Landale notes,Russia's invasion of Ukraine is transforming European security. Viktor Medvedchuk is a wealthy businessman who is close to Russia's President Vladimir Putin. So close, in fact, that his daughter has President Putin as a godfather. For years Ukraine tolerated him as a useful channel to the Kremlin. But last year, he was charged with treason and soon after Russia's invasion he escaped house arrest. Ukraine has now recaptured him. On Wednesday security chief Ivan Bakanov gave more details of the operation. He said Ukrainian agents thwarted a plot by Russia's Federal Security Service to smuggle him across the border into Moldova, and then on to Moscow.

UK to give asylum seekers one-way ticket to RwandaSome asylum seekers who arrive on small boats will be sent to the country as part of a Â£120m trial.,"This video can not be played Watch: Prime Minister outlines Rwanda immigration plans in April Some asylum seekers who cross the Channel to the UK will be given a one-way ticket to Rwanda under new government plans. The pilot scheme will focus on single men arriving on boats or lorries. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Â£120m scheme would ""save countless lives"" from human trafficking. Refugee organisations have criticised the plan as cruel. They questioned its cost and impact and raised concerns about Rwanda's human rights record. Mr Johnson said action was needed to stop ""vile people smugglers"" turning the ocean into a ""watery graveyard"", with the plan designed to break their business model. ""Our compassion may be infinite but our capacity to help people is not,"" he said. ""We can't ask the British taxpayer to write a blank cheque to cover the costs of anyone who might want to come and live here."" How many Channel crossings are there and what will change? Which countries send asylum seekers overseas? Former RAF station to become asylum centre Those who succeed in making it to the UK ""will be taken not to hotels at vast public expense"", the prime minister said, and instead would be housed in detention centres. Speaking in Kent, he said the new plan would ""over time prove a very considerable deterrent"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the scheme as ""unworkable"" and ""extortionate"", claiming it was an attempt to distract from Mr Johnson's ""partygate"" fine. Last year,28,526 people are known to have crossedin small boats, up from 8,404 in 2020. About 600 people made the crossing on Wednesday - the figure could reach 1,000 a day in coming weeks, Mr Johnson said. The number of people who can be relocated will be ""unlimited"", said Mr Johnson. Rwanda will have the ""capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead"", including those who have arrived ""illegally"" since the start of the year, he said. Migrants arriving in Dover after being rescued crossing the Channel ""We cannot sustain a parallel illegal system,"" said the prime minister. ""Our compassion may be infinite, but our capacity to help people is not."" Home Secretary Priti Patel, who travelled to Rwandan capital Kigali to sign the deal, said it was a ""global first and it will change the way we collectively tackle illegal migration"". She said the ""vast majority"" of those arriving in the UK ""illegally"" would be considered for relocation to Rwanda. Why is the Nationality Bill causing protests? Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Refugees minister declines to comment on Rwanda plan Recent researchby Ipsos Mori,externalsuggested 60% of the public were dissatisfied with the government's migration policy - more than half of which cited Channel crossings. BBC home editor Mark Easton, reporting from Rwanda, said ministers would face legal hurdles and substantial costs to launch the scheme. Precise details of the plan are yet to be confirmed - but he said the trial would be restricted to mostly single men. Under the proposal, Rwanda would take responsibility for the people who made the more than 4,000-mile journey, put them through an asylum process, and at the end of that process, if they were successful, they would have long-term accommodation in Rwanda. The BBC has seen accommodation the asylum seekers would be housed in, thought to have enough space for about 100 people at a time and to process up to 500 a year. Journalists were given a tour of a typical government refugee facility in Rwanda The Rwandan government said migrants would be ""entitled to full protection under Rwandan law, equal access to employment, and enrolment in healthcare and social care services"". The UK Home Office believes existing asylum law will be enough to implement the plan, but questions remain about the legality of the scheme. Mr Johnson said the plan was ""fully compliant"" with international law, but acknowledged he expected it to be subject to challenge in the courts and from a ""formidable army of politically-motivated lawyers"". BBC Radio 5 Live listenersshared their views with Nicky Campbell: ""What's crueller - that or being drowned? If it saves one life, surely it's got to be better than what's happening with these migrants now""- Lorraine, Dartington ""How are we treating these humans? Are we suddenly saying those coming from Ukraine, their lives are better value than those coming from certain other countries? I think it's abhorrent""- Hamid, Bicester ""I feel it's a real shame. We seem to have eroded this idea of fairness in our nation. We seem to no longer want to be the nation that wants to help other people. It seems a shame we've lost those values in our country""- Chris, Devon ""Let's forget about the optics and actually look at the reality. People smugglers will keep trying to find different ways until we break it. That's the cruel part here...

"Easter will be as bad as any winter, warns NHS","NHS leaders are warning that the health service is facing the ""brutal reality"" of an Easter as bad as most winters. Latest data shows record waits for planned surgery and in A&E, as staff plough through a backlog fuelled by Covid. The government says there is hope on the horizon. Retired seamstress Jean Shepherd had a stroke in April last year, leaving her severely disabled and requiring round-the-clock care. At the end of February there was an outbreak of sickness at her nursing home and she needed hospital treatment. She had to wait in a wheelchair for more than 9 hours until an ambulance arrived to take her to A&E. The 87-year-old from Nottingham then spent the next 31 hours on a trolley between the emergency department and a secondary-care unit. ""She was very distressed because she doesn't like hospitals at the best of time,"" says her son, Andy Shepherd. ""Since the stroke, because of her cognitive ability, she doesn't understand what's happening around her."" Mrs Shepherd was eventually moved to a bed in a main hospital ward, where her family says she later contracted Covid, before recovering and being discharged back to her care home two weeks later. ""I appreciate that A&E departments have always been busy, but I just wasn't prepared for what greeted me at the hospital,"" says her son. ""There were patients on ambulance trolleys literally everywhere and the staff were absolutely rushed off their feet. I remember thinking at the time that this is not sustainable."" Nottingham University Hospitals Trust has apologised for the delay in admitting Mrs Shepherd to a ward, saying she received ""expert care"" in the emergency department while staff were dealing with an ""unprecedented level of demand"". Jean Shepherd back in her care home after hospital treatment That kind of 31-hour wait might be at the extreme end. But nationally, it's in emergency departments that the pressure on the NHS is most visible at the moment. The number of people arriving at A&E has been increasing steadily over the past decade, driven in part by a growing and ageing population. Over the past year the proportion having to wait a long time to be treated has been rising to record levels. In March,external, just 71% of patients were seen, treated and then admitted or discharged in under four hours, compared with 87% in March 2019 - the year before the pandemic began. Over the past few weeks, hospitals from Liverpool to West Yorkshire to Nottingham have had to post warnings online asking the public to think twice before turning up at A&E if they did not need urgent or life-saving care. ""I have never seen it as bad as it is now,"" says Dr Katherine Henderson, the RCEM's president. ""Long waits in emergency departments cause harm because a patient's condition may deteriorate and there may not be the staff there to notice. ""It makes everybody really anxious, and we know that people are not getting the care they deserve."" This problem is not unique to England. A&E waiting times in other parts of the UK have been increasing, too. The pressure the system is under can be seen most acutely when the sickest patients in the emergency department need to be moved to a ward. A record 22,506 people had to wait more than 12 hours on trolleys and in cubicles in A&E departments in March before they could be admitted to the main hospital. The figure is up from 16,404 in February, and is the highest for any month going back to August 2010 when the data started. There are a number of factors playing a role in this - staff shortages, a lack of care in the community - which means some patients wait a long time to be discharged - and the fact that running hospitals has become more difficult because of Covid infection-control measures. This past winter, 131,000 people have tested positive for the virus after being admitted to hospital in England. Around half of those will have been treated predominantly for Covid pneumonia and other direct symptoms of the disease; the others were brought in with other ailments. Either way, that puts pressure on NHS services, as patients need to be isolated, entire hospital bays need to be cleaned and staff who fall sick have to take time off work. Earlier this week, Matthew Taylor, from the NHS Confederation, which speaks for healthcare providers in England, told BBC Breakfast: ""The brutal reality for staff and patients is that this Easter in the NHS is as bad as any winter."" All this means hospital waiting times have deteriorated across the board - not just in A&E but in ambulance response times, in cancer care and for planned surgery. More than 6.2 million people in England are on a waiting list for routine treatment - that's one in nine of the population. More than 23,000 of them have waited more than two years for the likes of a hip replacement or gynaecology services - a nine-fold rise on last year, though down slightly on the previous month. ""Trusts are doing all they can to bear down on care backlogs, which have increased during the pandemic for hospital, mental-health and community services,"" says Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS Trusts. ""But they face extraordinary pressures, including the continuing impact of Covid. ""What is needed is realism on what the NHS can achieve and how quickly, given the immediate pressure it is under."" Ambulances parked outside hospitals have become an increasingly familiar sight To try to manage that pressure, NHS bosses have been overhauling some services and speeding up some treatments. In Buckinghamshire, a new mobile cataract unit, designed to perform an extra 100 surgeries every week, has been set up in the grounds of Stoke Mandeville Hospital. On Merseyside, a grandmother recently became the first person in the region to receive hip-replacement surgery and go home the same day. New community diagnostic hubs have also started operating in places such as supermarket car parks to offer routine scans and blood tests. The NHS says 230,000 patients have been processed through those since the start of February. Earlier this year the health service published its ""elective recovery plan"", pledging that every patient waiting more than two years for routine surgery should be treated by July. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We know the NHS has been under unprecedented pressure - that's why we set out our plan to tackle the Covid backlog and deliver long-term recovery and reform, backed by our record multi-billion-pound investment. ""This will deliver new surgical hubs and up to 160 community diagnostic centres across the country to help patients get the surgery they need and earlier access to tests.""

Cash to help protect homes from repeat flood damage,"Susan Young heads to her new home in 2014 When the village of Datchet in the Thames Valley was hit by flooding, the only way Susan Young could reach her new home was by boat. She had yet to even move into the lower ground floor flat before it was hit by the rising river waters in 2014. But after the initial despair, she wanted to seize an opportunity. She was not only determined to repair her new home, but also to improve it so it was resilient to any future flooding. ""The village is beautiful so I felt the benefits outweighed the flood risks when I bought it. Clearly, the River Thames had other plans,"" she said. ""But I have never regretted buying it. It took time to get it back into a liveable state, but then I was forced into an opportunity."" The measures she took back then will now be available to more people through the Build Back Better scheme, which launches in a week's time. It will allow people, through participating insurers, to claim up to Â£10,000 for flood resilience measures over and above the cost of work to repair damage caused by a flood. The funding comes from the government-backed Flood Re project, which was set up to provide affordable home insurance for people in flood-risk areas, which is itself paid for through a levy on UK insurers. This video can not be played In Datchet the Thames has flooded the village Since the flooding in Datchet in Berkshire in 2014, Mrs Young has spent around Â£6,000 to Â£7,000 on flood prevention and resilience in her home, which is about 260m from the bank of the Thames. This has included pumps and a specially designed door, with seals to stop water getting in. A flood guard has been added to the back door, and non-return valves fitted to the drains. She has accepted that the risk cannot be entirely extinguished, so the floors are tiled, and doors and skirting boards are varnished rather than painted. She has bricks to stand heavy furniture on if there is a flood warning, as well as freestanding pumps and sandbag substitutes ready, and even a toilet bung to prevent backflow. Susan Young with a toilet bung ""If you can reduce the damage, then it reduces the time you are out of your home after flooding, which is probably the worst part of it,"" she said. The village has community flood groups and flood plans. Mrs Young, now aged 59, said everyone had to play their part, which was why she welcomed the new initiative. Insurers plan green replacements for write-offs Minister hears calls for action in flood-hit town She paid for some of the work, and the survey required, with a grant. However, such local or national government funding can be slow, experts say, prompting the inception of the Build Back Better programme. Andy Bord, chief executive of Flood Re, which will launch the scheme next week, said: ""In the UK, since 1998 we have seen six of the wettest years on record, with 5.2 million homes and businesses at risk of flooding. The trajectory will only continue to worsen without urgent, collective action."" He said homeowners needed to be encouraged to adapt and insurers needed to innovate to make tangible change in this area. ""To do so, we must throw the traditional principles of insurance to one side. This means thinking of future resilience and building back better after a flood, rather than simply returning a property to how it was before."" Flooding in Ironbridge, Shropshire in February Insurers NFU Mutual, Aviva, Ageas, Lloyds Banking Group and LV= General Insurance have pledged to join the scheme this year or early next year. They can set their own cap on the extra funding, which could be less than Â£10,000 per claim. They will also decide what work can go ahead, and which measures will be installed. However, insurers would be bound by a code of practice that states all customers should be treated equally and fairly. Malcolm Tarling, from the Association of British Insurers, said the insurance sector was broadly supportive of the scheme, and the trade body was encouraging members to consider joining. ""Insurers have a role to play,"" he said. ""In the end, it is down to individual insurers whether they sign up or not."" He added that some companies may already offer support to help people install flood resilience measures in their home. Village flooded as Thames rises.

Sri Lanka debt default 'has begun' - rating agencies,"Sri Lanka is about to default on its debts, two of the world's largest credit rating agencies have warned. Fitch Ratings lowered its assessment of the South Asian nation, saying ""a sovereign default process has begun"". S&P Global Ratings made a similar announcement and said that a default is now a ""virtual certainty"". This week, Sri Lanka said it will temporarily default on its foreign debts as it faces its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years. Meanwhile, faced with mass protests over major power cuts and the soaring cost of food and fuel, officials have urged Sri Lankans working abroad to send money home. The new governor of the country's central bankappealed for donations,externalin sterling, US dollars and euros on Wednesday. He said the money ""will be utilised only for the purpose of importation of essentials such as food, fuel and medicine"". On Monday, Sri Lanka is due to make $78m (Â£59.4m) of interest payments on its international sovereign bonds. If the payment is not made within a 30-day grace period it would mark the country's first default on its foreign debt since independence from the UK in 1948. Sri Lanka warns it will default on foreign debt Fitch's latest rating puts Sri Lanka at ""near default"" and indicated that its ""payment capacity is irrevocably impaired"". ""We will downgrade the [rating] once a payment on an issuance is missed and the grace period has expired,""the firm said in a statement on Wednesday.,external S&P also downgraded Sri Lanka ""to reflect the virtual certainty of a default on some affected obligations"". The ratings agency said it was waiting for more details on Sri Lanka's debt restructuring plan, or confirmation that its government had failed to pay its creditors. ""We expect the government to miss paying these coupons,"" S&P said in a note. A coupon is the interest payment due on a bond. Credit ratings are intended to help investors understand the level of risk they face when buying a financial instrument, in this case a country's debt - or sovereign bond. On Tuesday, the Sri Lankan government said it would temporarily default on $35.5bn in foreign debt. Its finance ministry said the impact of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine made it ""impossible"" to pay its creditors. The country is due to start talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) next week on a loan programme to get its economy back on track. It steeply devalued its currency last month ahead of talks with the IMF over a bailout.

""Trusts are doing all they can to bear down on care backlogs, which have increased during the pandemic for hospital, mental-health and community services,"" says Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS Trusts. ""But they face extraordinary pressures, including the continuing impact of Covid. ""What is needed is realism on what the NHS can achieve and how quickly, given the immediate pressure it is under."" Ambulances parked outside hospitals have become an increasingly familiar sight To try to manage that pressure, NHS bosses have been overhauling some services and speeding up some treatments. In Buckinghamshire, a new mobile cataract unit, designed to perform an extra 100 surgeries every week, has been set up in the grounds of Stoke Mandeville Hospital. On Merseyside, a grandmother recently became the first person in the region to receive hip-replacement surgery and go home the same day. New community diagnostic hubs have also started operating in places such as supermarket car parks to offer routine scans and blood tests. The NHS says 230,000 patients have been processed through those since the start of February. Earlier this year the health service published its ""elective recovery plan"", pledging that every patient waiting more than two years for routine surgery should be treated by July. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We know the NHS has been under unprecedented pressure - that's why we set out our plan to tackle the Covid backlog and deliver long-term recovery and reform, backed by our record multi-billion-pound investment. ""This will deliver new surgical hubs and up to 160 community diagnostic centres across the country to help patients get the surgery they need and earlier access to tests.""

Sri Lanka debt default 'has begun' - rating agency,"Sri Lanka is about to default on its debts, two of the world's largest credit rating agencies have warned. Fitch Ratings lowered its assessment of the South Asian nation, saying ""a sovereign default process has begun"". S&P Global Ratings made a similar announcement and said that a default is now a ""virtual certainty"". This week, Sri Lanka said it will temporarily default on its foreign debts as it faces its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years. Meanwhile, faced with mass protests over major power cuts and the soaring cost of food and fuel, officials have urged Sri Lankans working abroad to send money home. The new governor of the country's central bankappealed for donations,externalin sterling, US dollars and euros on Wednesday. He said the money ""will be utilised only for the purpose of importation of essentials such as food, fuel and medicine"". On Monday, Sri Lanka is due to make $78m (Â£59.4m) of interest payments on its international sovereign bonds. If the payment is not made within a 30-day grace period it would mark the country's first default on its foreign debt since independence from the UK in 1948. Sri Lanka warns it will default on foreign debt Fitch's latest rating puts Sri Lanka at ""near default"" and indicated that its ""payment capacity is irrevocably impaired"". ""We will downgrade the [rating] once a payment on an issuance is missed and the grace period has expired,""the firm said in a statement on Wednesday.,external S&P also downgraded Sri Lanka ""to reflect the virtual certainty of a default on some affected obligations"". The ratings agency said it was waiting for more details on Sri Lanka's debt restructuring plan, or confirmation that its government had failed to pay its creditors. ""We expect the government to miss paying these coupons,"" S&P said in a note. A coupon is the interest payment due on a bond. Credit ratings are intended to help investors understand the level of risk they face when buying a financial instrument, in this case a country's debt - or sovereign bond. On Tuesday, the Sri Lankan government said it would temporarily default on $35.5bn in foreign debt. Its finance ministry said the impact of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine made it ""impossible"" to pay its creditors. The country is due to start talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) next week on a loan programme to get its economy back on track. It steeply devalued its currency last month ahead of talks with the IMF over a bailout.

'Flooding meant I could only reach my home by boat',"Susan Young heads to her new home in 2014 When the village of Datchet in the Thames Valley was hit by flooding, the only way Susan Young could reach her new home was by boat. She had yet to even move into the lower ground floor flat before it was hit by the rising river waters in 2014. But after the initial despair, she wanted to seize an opportunity. She was not only determined to repair her new home, but also to improve it so it was resilient to any future flooding. ""The village is beautiful so I felt the benefits outweighed the flood risks when I bought it. Clearly, the River Thames had other plans,"" she said. ""But I have never regretted buying it. It took time to get it back into a liveable state, but then I was forced into an opportunity."" The measures she took back then will now be available to more people through the Build Back Better scheme, which launches in a week's time. It will allow people, through participating insurers, to claim up to Â£10,000 for flood resilience measures over and above the cost of work to repair damage caused by a flood. The funding comes from the government-backed Flood Re project, which was set up to provide affordable home insurance for people in flood-risk areas, which is itself paid for through a levy on UK insurers. This video can not be played In Datchet the Thames has flooded the village Since the flooding in Datchet in Berkshire in 2014, Mrs Young has spent around Â£6,000 to Â£7,000 on flood prevention and resilience in her home, which is about 260m from the bank of the Thames. This has included pumps and a specially designed door, with seals to stop water getting in. A flood guard has been added to the back door, and non-return valves fitted to the drains. She has accepted that the risk cannot be entirely extinguished, so the floors are tiled, and doors and skirting boards are varnished rather than painted. She has bricks to stand heavy furniture on if there is a flood warning, as well as freestanding pumps and sandbag substitutes ready, and even a toilet bung to prevent backflow. Susan Young with a toilet bung ""If you can reduce the damage, then it reduces the time you are out of your home after flooding, which is probably the worst part of it,"" she said. The village has community flood groups and flood plans. Mrs Young, now aged 59, said everyone had to play their part, which was why she welcomed the new initiative. Insurers plan green replacements for write-offs Minister hears calls for action in flood-hit town She paid for some of the work, and the survey required, with a grant. However, such local or national government funding can be slow, experts say, prompting the inception of the Build Back Better programme. Andy Bord, chief executive of Flood Re, which will launch the scheme next week, said: ""In the UK, since 1998 we have seen six of the wettest years on record, with 5.2 million homes and businesses at risk of flooding. The trajectory will only continue to worsen without urgent, collective action."" He said homeowners needed to be encouraged to adapt and insurers needed to innovate to make tangible change in this area. ""To do so, we must throw the traditional principles of insurance to one side. This means thinking of future resilience and building back better after a flood, rather than simply returning a property to how it was before."" Flooding in Ironbridge, Shropshire in February Insurers NFU Mutual, Aviva, Ageas, Lloyds Banking Group and LV= General Insurance have pledged to join the scheme this year or early next year. They can set their own cap on the extra funding, which could be less than Â£10,000 per claim. They will also decide what work can go ahead, and which measures will be installed. However, insurers would be bound by a code of practice that states all customers should be treated equally and fairly. Malcolm Tarling, from the Association of British Insurers, said the insurance sector was broadly supportive of the scheme, and the trade body was encouraging members to consider joining. ""Insurers have a role to play,"" he said. ""In the end, it is down to individual insurers whether they sign up or not."" He added that some companies may already offer support to help people install flood resilience measures in their home. Village flooded as Thames rises.

Priti Patel vows to stop illegal Channel crossings,"Priti Patel said she continues to work with her French counterparts to tackle illegal Channel crossings Home Secretary Priti Patel says she is ""determined"" to stop illegal Channel crossings by migrants. On Friday73 migrants were interceptedin the Channel and those landing in Dover were given face masks amid concerns about reports of a coronavirus outbreak in migrant camps near Calais. At least 470 people have attempted to cross the Channel illegally since Britain went into lockdown on 23 March. Ms Patel said: ""I am determined to stop this criminal trade."" Charities have called on the UK government to ""create safe and legal routes"" for those seeking sanctuary. The Home Office said coronavirus had not affected its response to Channel crossings The home secretary said protecting British borders was a priority. ""I will not stand by whilst malicious criminals prey on the vulnerable. ""Criminal gangs are using false promises to take advantage of desperate situations and illegally smuggle people into the UK. ""I am determined to stop this criminal trade,"" she said. ""We are continuing to support the French to deploy extra patrols on French beaches, drones, specialist vehicles and detection equipment to stop these boats leaving European shores,"" she added. ""I will always make sure that Border Force have the resources needed to tackle these dangerous crossings and keep our border secure."" Bella Sankey, director of charity Detention Action, said: ""The home secretary needs to stop chasing unicorns and level with the public.

Beauty firm L'Occitane keeps Russian stores open,"The French beauty brand L'Occitane says it will keep its shops in Russia open despite the invasion of Ukraine. The firm told the BBC it had discussed closing its stores ""at length"" but said it had not because it wanted to protect staff from potential ""retaliation"". It has stopped shipping to Russia but website sales still seem to be open. Hundreds of international brands including L'Oreal and Estee Lauder have already closed shops and ceased online sales in Russia in protest at the war. Some customers criticised L'Occitane for its decision and called for a boycott of the brand which is sold at more than 3,085 retail outlets worldwide and had sales of â¬1.5bn (Â£1.3bn) last year. The cosmetics firm, which has spas and stores in Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg, said it could not take the ""risk"" of closing its shops. ""At this point we cannot guarantee that our 700 employees in Russia will not face retaliation if we cease to operate in the country,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We are particularly concerned for those of our employees who have relatives in Ukraine or who are of Ukrainian descent,"" she added. ""At the same time, we are firmly committed to our partners and their employees in Ukraine."" Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia Chanel restricts sales of goods to Russians abroad The firm said it strongly condemned Russia's ""unjustified and unprovoked"" invasion and had significantly scaled back its operations in Russia, suspending its investment plans and all shipments into the country. It refused to comment on whether it had continued online sales in the country and what the impact of stopping shipments would have on its Russian shops. Tweeting a picture of a L'Occitane product one customer said: ""I've used this cream for years, never again. Even if they back out, they've showed their corporate integrity."" Allow Twitter content?

L'Occitane is one of a number of firmslisted as still operating in Russia,externalby Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld at Yale University's School of Management. Among them are the French energy giant EDF, the UAE's Emirates airline, and China's Lenovo computer brand. However, a much larger group of around 600 big firms have pulled out of Russia or suspended sales since it invaded, including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple. Other international outlets still open in Russia have said they are not able to shut stores due to complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. Burger King and the hotel groups Marriott and Accor are among the firms restricted by these arrangements. On Tuesday, some independent Nike stores were found to be operating in Russia over a week after the sportswear brand said it was temporarily closing all its shops in the country. Professor Vanessa Burbano, from Columbia Business School in the US, said that consistency between claims and actions is important for brands with operations in Russia. ""Customers and employees do pay attention to which companies are first in making these kinds of commitments and which firms don't go as far,"" Prof Burbano said. ""The risk of companies making claims that may not be perceived as consistent with their actions is that they could be seen as a green-washing in the Ukraine context which would be bad for their reputation.""

The Moskva, pictured in 2008 Ammunition stockpiles aboard a Russian ship that was famously defied by Ukrainian troops early in the war have detonated, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry. A fire caused the explosion on the Moskva, the statement in Russian media said, adding that all sailors had evacuated beforehand. The statement said: ""The cruiser Moskva's ammunition has detonated as a result of a fire on the warship. ""The vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated. The cause of the blaze is being investigated."" It did not specify the cause of the fire. But earlier on Wednesday, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was hit by Ukrainian rockets, according to the governor of Odesa. Ukrainian officials said Russia was struggling to rescue the estimated 510 crew members on board. The Moskva warship rose to fame early in the war when Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island refused calls to surrender and told the Russian ship to ""go to hell"", before they were ultimately taken prisoner. Germany must draw up a schedule to withdraw
from using Russia's gas supply, the head of energy utility association BDEW,
Marie-Luise Wolff, has said. There is pressure on Germany to stop providing funds for the
Kremlin to wage war and to guard itself against a sudden stop of exports on the
Russian side. It comes as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he had offered to visit Ukraine with other EU leaders,but Kyiv had told him he was not
welcome due to his close ties with Russiaand his support for
the now-suspended Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline designed to double the flow of Russian gas to
Germany. ""We must now use all our energy to prepare our exit from
Russian gas supplies in detail and to underpin the necessary measures with an
ambitious timetable,"" Wolff said. Germany's leading economic institute said a Russian energy
supply freeze would cause a recession in 2023 and has slashed its 2022
growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy because of the impact of the war in
Ukraine. In his nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky argues that if Russia fails to pursue a peace agreement they must leave the international community forever. ""Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace or as a result of this war Russia will leave the international arena forever,"" he says. Speaking about Russia's increasing strikes in the east and south, he said: ""All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity. ""To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers... the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. ""Well, we do everything to justify their doubts."" He also reiterated his call for a total embargo of Russian oil, saying: ""The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine."" Zelensky expressed gratitude to President Biden after he pledged another massive weapons shipment to Ukraine. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US military aid  'Crime scene' call  Mariupol latest  This is Nathan Williams and Gareth Evans in London handing over to our colleagues Jude Sheerin in Washington DC and Max Matza in Seattle. The Russian military has threatened to strike Ukraine's command centres in the capital, Kyiv, if there are continued attacks on its territory. ""We are seeing Ukrainian troops' attempts to carry out sabotage and strike Russian territory,"" the Russian defence ministry claimed in its regular evening briefing. ""If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,"" it added. Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its territory before, including an alleged attack on an air base last month. As we reported earlier, war crimes prosecutors have been visiting the site of civilian killings in Bucha. Images of the town's streets strewn with bodies shocked the world earlier this month, and local officials say hundreds of civilians were killed and buried in mass graves. ""We have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed,"" the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan told reporters earlier. ""We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,â Khan later wrote on Twitter. He also described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"". Khan has been pictured visiting the site of a mass burial in Bucha. A Ukrainian soldier mans a Howitzer for drills in Kharkiv in June 2021 The $800m worth of US weaponry pledged by President Biden on Wednesday to Ukraine includes artillery and radar systems that may require ""additional training"" for Ukrainian troops. ""The systems that will probably require some additional training for Ukrainian forces are the howitzers (and) ... the counter artillery radar,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. The radar system, he said, is ""not a very difficult system to operate, but it's not one that they have in their inventory"". Howitzers are a type of relatively short-barrelled cannon, used to lob shells into enemy lines. According to the US Defense Department, the shipment will include 18 Howitzers along with 40,000 artillery rounds. It will also include hundreds of missiles and Switchblade drones - also known as kamikaze drones due to the way they can be flown into their target. The US is also sending 11 helicopters, hundreds of armoured vehicles, anti-personnel mines, body armour and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear protective equipment. The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet A Russian cruiser which was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on a small island at the start of the war has been hit by Ukrainian rockets in the Black Sea, according to Ukrainian officials. The Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, received ""very serious damage"", Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko said. ""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!"" he said. On the first day of the invasion, the small garrisonrefused calls from the ship for it to surrender, telling the ship to ""go to hell"". Earlier on Wednesday a fire was reported on the ship. Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian rescuers were unable to reach the vessel. He said the ship could have as many as 510 crew members on board. Presidents Zelensky held talks with the presidents of Poland and the Baltic states The presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have become the latest world leaders to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine. They also visited the town of Borodyanka, near Kyiv. Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch said the aim of the trip was to show support to President Zelensky and the defenders of Ukraine ""in a decisive moment"". Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said it was ""hard to believe that such war atrocities could be perpetrated in 21st-Century Europe"". The four presidents also met Ukrainan Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal during a visit to Borodyanka President Biden made the announcement after a phone call with President Zelensky The US is to send an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine. The announcement follows a phone call between Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden. Biden said the support would include new weapons tailored to combat Russiaâs expected âwider assaultâ in the east of Ukraine. The package also includes helicopters and what Biden called ânew capabilitiesâ such as artillery systems and armoured personnel carriers. Senior US defence officials say the total military aid provided by the US now stands at more than $3bn. Biden has said the weaponry supplied so far has helped ensure the failure of Russiaâs initial war aims. But he added it was not the time to rest, saying: âI assured President Zelenskyy that the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people."" It is ""at least plausible"" to consider whether genocide could be an issue in relation to the war in Ukraine, according to a legal expert. As we have been reporting,US President Joe Biden has said there was evidence of genocidal acts by Russian troops in Ukraine. This was the first time he used the word genocide - defined under international law as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - in relation to the conflict in Ukraine. Philippe Sands QC said to prove ""genocidal intent"" was ""very difficult"" in court. But speaking on BBC Radio 4, the lawyer and University College London professor said: ""I understand why both President Zelensky and President Biden are now using this word, because this is wrongdoing on a scale that is so great that I think it is at least plausible to raise the genocide issue.â We have reports of more people being killed in Ukraine's north-eastern region of Kharkiv. At
least seven people were killed and 22 wounded by shelling in the past 24 hours, according to Kharkiv's governor Oleh Synegubov. He has also said thatUkrainian troops have shot down two Russian planesthat attacked the region. Kharkiv - which sits near the border - has been under attack since the start of the war. But unlike regions further to the west, which have seen Russian troops move away in recent days, it is still in the firing line. This is because of its position on the edge of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, the area Russia hopes to take in its next offensive. The UN chief said there was more to be done to guarantee the safety of Ukrainian evacuees A potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appears unlikely at this stage, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said. He told reporters this afternoon: ""At the present moment a global ceasefire in Ukraine doesn't
seem possible."" Instead, he said the UN was focusing its efforts on supporting evacuees and boosting humanitarian aid. Guterres said the UN had made proposals to Russia to
""bring the parties together... to manage"" humanitarian access and the evacuation of civilians, but had not yet received a response from Moscow. ""There are lots of things that can be done in order to
guarantee evacuation of civilians,"" he said. Donetsk Regional Police have shared footage of the moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk. This video can not be played War in Ukraine: The moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have just spoken by phone. They discussed additional defensive and
financial aid for Ukraine as well as tightening sanctions and alleged Russian
war crimes, Zelensky wrote on Twitter. It comes after the Ukrainian president made another impassioned plea to the West to send heavy weaponry to repel Russian aggression. In an online English-language address, he said Ukraine needed heavy artillery, armoured vehicles, tanks, air defence systems and combat aircraft. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech foreign
ministry says its diplomats have returned to the embassy in Kyiv for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The
ministry tweeted a photo of three diplomats raising the Czech flag in front of
the building. In a statement,
the ministry said it was one of the many steps the country was taking to show its
support for Ukraine. It would always stand with Ukraine, it
said. The Czech
Republic has been one of the more muscular supporters of Ukraine as it defends
itself from Russian aggression. It was the first Nato or EU country to send tanks
to the country, while a crowd-funding effort organised by the Ukrainian Embassy
and the Czech Defence Ministry to buy weapons for the Ukrainian armed forces
has approached 1bn Czech koruna, (Â£34m, 41m euros).  Russia has shifted the focus of its invasion to eastern Ukraine after withdrawing forces from Kyiv and the north. And in recent days, Ukrainian officials have warned that it is preparing to launch a new offensive in the east targeting the Donbas region. This has led analysts to examine Russian military activity around eastern Ukraine more closely. These satellite images from Maxar show Russian military vehicles assembling just 8km (5 miles) from the border. Territory in the region has been seized back from Russian troops More than 100 civilians have been killed in the north-eastern Sumy region -
according to its military chief. Dmytro Zhyvytsky said many corpses were discovered with their
hands tied. Some showed signs of torture or gunshot wounds to the head. He alleged that invading Russian soldiers had ""fired on
everyone"", including the elderly and children. Many people from the city were missing or had been
captured, he added. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these claims. The discoveries in Sumy appear reminiscent of atrocities
uncovered in Bucha. Russia has repeatedly denied committing any war crimes
there. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court earlier
labelled Ukraine a ""crime scene"" after visiting Bucha. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
