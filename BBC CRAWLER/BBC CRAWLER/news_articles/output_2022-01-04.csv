Emergency declared after Kazakhstan fuel protests,"This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in Almaty, the country's biggest city. Internet access has been cut in Kazakhstan amid mass protests sparked by rising fuel prices. Anti-government protesters in the main city, Almaty, stormed the mayor's office on Wednesday. Part of the building appeared to be on fire. Protests have also erupted in several other cities, with security forces using tear gas and stun grenades. The president has promised a tough response, calling the protests a ""black period"" in the country's history. ""As president, I am obliged to protect the safety and peace of our citizens, to worry about the integrity of Kazakhstan,"" Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said in a TV address. He called the protesters ""plotters"" who were ""financially motivated"". Internet services in the country have been disrupted since Tuesday. By Wednesday, internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported that Kazakhstan was ""in the midst of a nation-scale internet blackout"". It came as thousands of people took to the streets, despite a state of emergency in the capital Nur-Sultan, in Almaty, and in the western province of Mangistau. In Almaty, protesters gathered at the mayor's office before eventually storming it. Videos on social media showed a plume of smoke rising from the building, while gunfire could also be heard. The city's police chief, Kanat Taimerdenov, said ""extremists and radicals"" had attacked 500 civilians and ransacked hundreds of businesses. Water cannon was used against protesters in the western city of Aktobe. There are reports that security forces have sided with protesters in some places. Police fired stun grenades at protesters on Wednesday BACKGROUND:Kazakhstan country profile CONTEXT:Rare protests in a country that bans dissent The demonstrations started in the west of Kazakhstan on Sunday, before spreading across the country. They began when the government lifted the price cap on liquefied petroleum gas, which many people use to power their cars. Its price quickly doubled in a matter of days. On Tuesday, the president dismissed the government and said lower fuel prices would be restored, but the announcement has not brought an end to the protests. Dissent and protests are uncommon in Kazakhstan, which declared independence in 1991 amid the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, the town of Zhanaozen, in Mangistau province, was the scene of deadly unrest in 2011. At least 14 oil workers were killed in a police crackdown on a protest over pay and working conditions. The town has also been one of the main centres of the latest unrest. By Olga Ivshina, BBC Russian The speed at which the protests turned violent took many by surprise, both in Kazakhstan and in the wider region, and hinted that they are not only about an increase in fuel prices. This is a traditionally stable Central Asian state, which is often described as authoritarian. Until 2019 it was run by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, whose rule was marked by elements of a personality cult, with his statues erected across the country and a capital renamed after him. Yet when he left, it was amid anti-government protests which he sought to limit by stepping down and putting a close ally in his place. Most elections in Kazakhstan are won by the ruling party with nearly 100% of the vote and there is no effective political opposition. The analysts I spoke to say that the Kazakh government clearly underestimated how angry the population was, and that these protests were not surprising in a country with no electoral democracy - people need to take to the streets to be heard. And their grievances are almost certainly about a far wider set of issues than the price of fuel.

Cinema flouted court ban to show conspiracy film,"Anna Redfern was served with a council closure notice on 18 November A cinema that was ordered to close after breaking Covid rules flouted the ban to premiere a film by the son of conspiracy theorist David Icke. Swansea's Cinema & Co was ordered to shut by a judge after boss Anna Redfernbreached several Covid regulations. Redfern, 45, was also fined Â£15,000 andgiven a suspended prison sentence for contempt of court. But she admitted showing a film making serious unfounded allegations against the NHS after the first court order. Directed and produced by Mr Icke's son Jaymie, it makes several baseless accusations against NHS doctors and nurses, including that they are deliberately killing elderly people in hospitals in order to ""boost the numbers"" of people dying of Covid. The film was described as ""completely false"", ""pernicious"" and ""dangerous"" by the head of research for theCenter for Countering Digital Hate,external(CCDH). Redfern told BBC Wales: ""If the BBC has any concerns regarding the content of the documentary's premiere we screened A Good Death? I suggest that they discuss them with the production company. ""Firstly, Cinema & Co does not practise censorship. ""Secondly, caring for my mother at the end of her life and reflecting upon my own mortality, I have given a great deal of consideration as to what constitutes a 'good death' and found the film very thought provoking."" After this article was first published, the film's director Jaymie Icke contacted BBC Wales to defend the film's content. How my mum became a conspiracy theory influencer How Covid and climate misinformation spread in 2021 David Icke is infamous for his belief that he is the son of God and that the Royal family are shape-shifting lizards. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube suspended his accounts in 2020for posting misleading claims about the pandemic. Facebook said David Icke's official account published ""health misinformation that could cause physical harm"" Before the second court hearing, which ended with her narrowly avoiding Christmas behind bars, Redfern was interviewed by another of Mr Icke's sons, Gareth, on his video streaming service, and said it would be a ""pleasure"" to host the premiere of the ""eye-opening"" film and that she was doing it to ""disseminate real information"". This video can not be played Cinema owner told to close for not requiring Covid passes said the scheme was discriminatory After receiving a court order to close,the cinema reopened on 1 Decemberfor a festive screening of Santa Claus: The Movie. Four nights later, it hosted the ""world premiere"" of the Icke family's conspiracy film. The cinema's media spokeswoman, Jacquelyn Haley, who was at the screening, has shared articles on her Twitter and Facebook accounts - alleging with no evidence - that Covid is caused by 5G phone signals, vaccines have caused more deaths than the virus, and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is responsible for murder due to ""deaths caused by the vaccines"". She also said that if parents allowed their children to be vaccinated then ""you don't deserve your children"". In a video taken at the cinema after the film aired, Ms Haley implored people to ""watch the film and share it far and wide"". The cinema opened a day after a judge ordered it to close Also present at the screening was Wesley Garner, from Morriston, Swansea, who was one of three people fined more than Â£2,000 earlier this year for travelling to Liverpool during lockdown to heckle staff at a school for getting tested for Covid. On his public Facebook page, Mr Garner makes unfounded claims that ""there is no pandemic"", that the vaccine is made of ""5G"" phone signals, and has compared the vaccine roll out to ""genocide"". In a Facebook video filmed and broadcast live from the cinema by Mr Garner, Redfern is seen serving customers while Jaymie Icke explains their ""truth movement"" had been ""crying out"" for people like the Swansea businesswoman who ""refused to back down"". The following week, however, Redfern admitted being in contempt of court and promised the judge her ""stand"" was at an end and that she would comply with the local authority. Callum Hood, head of research at CCDH, said: ""What is really dangerous about the film that the Icke brothers have put together and put on at this cinema in Swansea is that it is painting hardworking NHS doctors and nurses as deliberately setting out to murder patients strictly in order to push up the numbers of the Covid pandemic, which is a complete reversal of what's actually going on in the NHS."" Mr Hood is an expert on the Icke family, having studied David Icke's behaviour for decades. ""I think this is a fairly typical piece of conspiracy theory propaganda about Covid, in that it took real moving stories about people who've lost loved ones during the pandemic, but then tried to turn it to the purpose of conspiracy theories by claiming that they have been deliberately killed in order to push up the numbers of people dying with Covid,"" he said. ""That was what was particularly pernicious and dangerous about it."" Redfern has received more than Â£61,000 in donations since she first received a closure notice after a crowdfunding page was set up by former Brexit Party and Abolish the Welsh Assembly candidate Richard Taylor. Redfern told the BBC she intended to use the funds to ""educate and empower others to claim their universally declared human rights back"" and to take her family on holiday, while the rest would be spent on activities such as ""free film screenings for all schools living in poverty"". At the latest hearing, Redfern's barrister Jonathan Gwyn Mendus Edwards told the court his client did not run the business for profit and was living off Â£30,000 in savings. District Judge Neale Thomas said he was ""sceptical"" of this claim. In May 2019, Cinema & Co went into insolvent liquidation and Companies House records show Redfern then incorporated a new company at the same address named ""Cinema & Go Ltd"". Swansea council said last month that the cinema had also received more than Â£52,000 in Covid-related grants since the start of the pandemic. Officers are assessing whether any of the grant conditions have been breached and ""whether any of the grants should be recovered"". On her public Facebook page, Redfern has previously shared anti-vaccine content, including one post which made unfounded claims that children were being ""coerced"" into being injected with 'an experimental vaccine"", and that children had a ""100% chance of surviving Covid-19"". Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show that up to 10 December there have been two deaths involving Covid in children under 14 - a boy and a girl - out of 9,102 in Wales. There is no evidence that vaccines have contributed to any death in Wales. Cinema refuses to follow law on Covid passes Cinema owner defiant over Covid pass refusal.

Nirvana's 'naked baby' lawsuit dismissed,"More than 30 million copies of Nevermind have been sold worldwide A judge in California has dismissed a lawsuit against Nirvana made by Spencer Elden, who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of their album Nevermind. Elden sued the band last year, alleging sexual exploitation, and that the artwork constituted child sexual abuse. Now 30, he said the infamous image had caused him ""extreme and permanent emotional distress"" as well as loss of wages and ""enjoyment of life"". Nirvana filed to dismiss last month, saying Elden's arguments lacked merit. ""Elden's claim that the photograph on the Nevermind album cover is 'child pornography' is, on its face, not serious,"" their lawyers said, noting that anyone who owned a copy of the record would ""on Elden's theory [be] guilty of felony possession of child pornography"". They continued by noting that, until recently, Elden had seemed to enjoy the notoriety of being the ""Nirvana baby"". ""He has re-enacted the photograph in exchange for a fee, many times; he has had the album title... tattooed across his chest; he has appeared on a talk show wearing a self-parodying, nude-colored onesie; he has autographed copies of the album cover for sale on eBay; and he has used the connection to try to pick up women."" Elden has re-created the photo several times The motion was filed by lawyers representing surviving Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic; Kurt Cobain's widow Courtney Love; and Kirk Weddle, the photographer of the cover image. Regardless of the merits of Elden's case, they argued, the statute of limitations on his claims had expired in 2011, meaning he was too late to sue. His lawyers have argued that the statute of limitations does not apply, as long as Nevermind continues to be sold in its current form. ""Child pornography is a forever crime,""Marsh Law told Variety in a statement last year,external. ""Any distribution of or profits earned from any sexually explicit image of a child not only creates longstanding liability but it also breeds lifelong trauma. This is common for all of our clients who are victims of actively traded child pornography, regardless of how long ago the image was created."" Elden's team had until 30 December to respond to Nirvana's motion to dismiss, but missed the deadline. As a result, Judge Fernando M Olguin dismissed the case ""with leave to amend"" - meaning his team have until 13 January to refile the case with appropriate changes. In a statement to AFP on Tuesday, Elden's lawyer Robert Lewis said they would do so ""very soon."" ""We are confident that Spencer will be allowed to move forward with his case,"" Lewis said.

Pupils return to testing and masks,"Pupils at a Stoke-on-Trent school were among those returning to school who could head into class only if their result was negative Pupils in England have been taking Covid tests before heading into class, as schools reopen to a different set of rules following the Christmas break. More Covid-related staff and pupil absences are expected this term. Teaching unions say it is likely some classes and year groups will be sent home to learn remotely at times because of staff shortages. But Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi insists face-to-face teaching will remain the norm. He emailed England's schools earlier this week to spell out the new measures and suggested classes could be merged and taught together where absences could not be covered. But Dr Mary Bousted, joint-general secretary of the National Education Union, expressed reservations about the idea. She said: ""Collapsing classes will mix groups of pupils and risks providing the conditions for the virus to spread more rapidly, which will result in greater pupil and staff absence."" Across the UK, staff and secondary pupils are being urged to test themselves regularly, but under the new measures, pupils in England must have their first Covid test in school, while elsewhere, pre-term testing takes place at home. One pupil at a school in Stoke-on-Trent, who had turned up early to a temporary testing station in the school hall, told BBC Breakfast she was glad to be back in school. The Stoke pupils took tests at numbered tables They were asked to wait in a separate room for their test results Another said he was ""pretty nervous"" about forthcoming mock exams, noting that he had ""missed quite a big chunk of learning"". The pupils were asked to wait in a separate room for their results. If they were negative after 15 minutes, they could head into class. If not, they were asked to return home. Face masks to be worn in England's classrooms Will schools in the UK stay open this term? Classroom masks for no longer than needed - Zahawi Doubts that ex-teachers will return by January The government ruled on Sunday that pupils should wear masks in classrooms for the first three weeks of term, bringing England in line with other parts of the UK. It also pledged 7,000 air filters would be available to the 20,000-plus schools in England. Liberal Democrat Education spokeswoman Munira Wilson described the investment as ""pocket change"" compared with what was required to keep schools open. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who has backed mass-testing, said there could not be a return to bubbles or classes going home. On Monday, Mr Zahawi said the government had learned a ""painful lesson"" about the impact of previous school closures, which was why he and the prime minister were determined to keep schools open. Before last term ended, the education secretary appealed to former teachers to come out of retirement and sign up with teacher supply agencies to help cover staff absence. There has been a similar call to retired staff in Northern Ireland. However,supply agencies warnedthat it would take time to get those who responded to the call into classrooms. Tom Quinn said pupils sitting exams this year were his priority. Tom Quinn, chief executive of the Frank Field Education Trust, said the organisation had used up its yearly fund for supply teachers last term. ""The call to arms to have extra funding could help us butâ¦ we can't find supply teachers to come in,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We need high-quality professional teachers to come in to help children learn, and they're not there."" Mr Quinn was hopeful the trust would find the money, but Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said that posed its own challenges. ""If you're going to find that money, you would have to take it away from somewhere else,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Mr Barton has previously said that the likelihood of high levels of staff absence caused by the prevalence of the Omicron variant was the biggest problem. He warned: ""There is a possibility that this will mean that some classes and year groups have to be sent home for short periods of time to learn remotely."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said much of schools' planning depended on the results of teacher and staff testing. ""Only then will school leaders know who they have available and be able to properly plan."" Masks are now compulsory again in classrooms for secondary pupils in England Asked on BBC Breakfast whether she could say how many ex-teachers had come forward, Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup said: ""It's a matter of thousands of people."" On Sunday six trades unions representing teaching staff called for more government support to help keep schools Covid-safe. They want easily accessible funds to cover the cost of the temporary staff who are likely to be needed, support with the testing regime and exemption from Ofsted inspections so they can focus on safety. They warned national exams could be at risk if ""urgent and immediate action"" was not taken to minimise Covid-related disruption. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Omicron wave had not really hit schools before they shut for Christmas, and a rise in cases was now expected. ""We expect to now see quite high infection levels - of mild infection I should emphasise - in school-aged children,"" he said. There is a further push for staff and more young people to get vaccinated. The latest official survey of vaccination rates suggest half of households with children in Great Britain have had their Covid jabs. Louise, a mother of two from Cambridge, told Today on Tuesday that she had had not been able to get an appointment for a second jab for her 15-year-old until February. She also said there were no vaccination sites for 12-to-15-year-olds within 50 miles of her home. Are you a teacher or parent? How do you feel about the return to school?

Photographing breastfeeding women to be outlawed,"This video can not be played 'It felt so wrong we were violated this way' Taking photos of breastfeeding mothers in public without their consent is to be made a crime in England and Wales. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the move would stop women being ""pestered, whether it's for self-gratification or for harassment purposes"". Campaigners welcomed the decision, calling it ""a victory for breastfeeding mothers"". The law will form part of the the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill going through Parliament. Mr Raab also confirmed another amendment to the bill to give victims of domestic abuse more time to report crimes to police, and ""plug gaps"" in the law that risks offenders escaping justice. He confirmed the six-month time limit in cases of common assaults involving domestic abuse will be extended, after the BBC revealed almost 13,000 such cases in England and Wales had been dropped in the past five years. 'This is how we fed our babies' Breastfeeding mums 'lacked support' during lockdown Huge rise in domestic abuse cases being dropped Manchester-based designer Julia Cooper began the campaign to make taking pictures of breastfeeding mothers illegal after her own experience in a local park last April. ""I sat down to breastfeed my daughter and I noticed a man on another bench staring at us,"" she told the BBC. ""I stared back to let him know that I had clocked his gaze, but undeterred he got out his digital camera, attached a zoom lens and started photographing us."" Ms Cooper said she was ""completely shocked and devastated"" by the incident, but her troubles continued after Greater Manchester Police told her no crime had been committed and there was nothing they could do. ""I just felt that was so wrong that we had been violated in this way and there was nothing the police could do to help,"" she added. ""I was angry he felt just this right to capture what I was doing. It was disgusting. And I just felt so helpless, so I thought I need to do something about this."" Ms Cooper contacted her local Labour MP Jeff Smith, and his colleague Stella Creasy, who had her own experience of being photographed by a teenager on a train when feeding her child - telling the BBC it was a ""horrible experience"" that made her feel ""so self-conscious"". The pair took the campaign to the Commons and put forward an amendment to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill in June, calling for a change in the law. But while Home Office minister Victoria Atkins called taking such photos ""unacceptable, creepy and disgusting behaviour"", she said the government was waiting for a review from the Law Commission on how best to act. Now there has been a change of heart in the Ministry of Justice, with government minister Lord Wolfson putting forward his own an amendment to the bill in the Lords. It will make a new offence of ""recording images of, or otherwise observing, breastfeeding without consent or a reasonable belief as to consent"" and to be found guilty, the perpetrator ""must be acting for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification or of humiliating, alarming or distressing the victim"". Stella Creasy - pictured here with her son in the Commons - was also photographed when breastfeeding her child Ms Cooper said she was ""delighted"" by the move, despite what she described as ""too-ing and fro-ing from government"" on the issue. ""It is a victory for breastfeeding mothers and it will provide the reassurance that we can breastfeed in public without strangers freely photographing and filming us as they wish. ""The law is on their side, the law is going to protect them and I am so pleased."" Ms Creasy also welcomed the change, saying it ""shows the law needs to keep up with the times, with people having phones and being able to take pictures and share them so easily"". But the Labour MP also said it showed the importance of having more mothers in Parliament - another campaign she is leading - to make sure their voices were heard on the issues that affected them. The other amendment being made to the same bill focuses on extending the six-month time limit victims of common assault face in England and Wales when it comes to reporting the crime. The clock currently starts from the date of the incident, and within the next six months, a victim needs to have come forward and the police have to have carried out their work to secure a charge against the alleged perpetrator, or the case will be dropped. But victims of domestic common assault - which includes things like a push, threatening words or being spat at - are sometimes reluctant to report incidents and the cases can be complex. In October last year, the BBC exclusively revealed that 13,000 cases had been dropped in five years because of the time limit being breached, with campaigners calling for the police to be given more time before having to bring charges. At the time, the BBC was told Home Secretary Priti Patel backed increasing the time limit to two years, but nothing official was announced. Now, her cabinet colleague, Mr Raab, has confirmed the starting point for the sixth month time limit will change - from the point of the offence to when the crime is reported to police - and a new overall time limit of two years will be introduced from the date of the offence to bringing a prosecution. This video can not be played Raab: Domestic abuse law change shows we're on victims' side ""The reason is that if you've been the victim of domestic abuse, it takes time to physically recover, to emotionally recover, and then to muster the confidence, the courage to come forward,"" he told the BBC. ""We want to make sure that the perpetrators of abuse cannot evade justice by being timed out."" Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper welcomed the change, which she had also campaigned for, but insisted she would ""keep up the pressure for more action"" from the government when it came to tackling violence against women and girls. Mr Raab admitted bringing successful prosecutions for domestic abuse and other violent crimes was a ""huge challenge"", but said the government had a ""rigorous and robust"" package in place to support women who'd been subject to abuse or violence, but was ""constantly looking for ways to do better"".

Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes guilty of fraud,"Holmes (centre) remains on bail before sentencing at a later date Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been convicted of defrauding investors after a months-long landmark trial in California. Prosecutors said Holmes knowingly lied about technology she said could detect diseases with a few drops of blood. Jurors found Holmes guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud against investors and three charges of wire fraud. She denied the charges, which carry a maximum prison term of 20 years each. Holmes was not taken into custody, with no date confirmed yet for sentencing and a further hearing scheduled next week. Journalists inside the courtroom said the 37-year-old, who gave birth to her first child last year, showed little emotion when the verdicts were read out, and hugged her husband, Billy Evans, and her parents before leaving the courtroom. Holmes faced 11 charges in total and was found not guilty of four charges relating to defrauding the public. The split verdict came after the judge said the jury, having deliberated for seven days, could deliver a partial verdict after being unable to reach consensus on another three counts. The three wire fraud charges she was found guilty of are tied to specific investors in her failed company. Wire fraud is a relatively wide-ranging federal crime in the US, which involves using electronic communications, such as emails, to make false statements to get something from another person - usually money. Theranos, at one point valued at $9bn (Â£6.5bn), was once the darling of biotech and Silicon Valley. Holmes was able to raise more than $900m from billionaires such as media magnate Rupert Murdoch and tech mogul Larry Ellison. The firm promised it would revolutionise the healthcare industry with a test that could detect conditions such as cancer and diabetes with only a few drops of blood. But these claims began to unravel in 2015 after a Wall Street Journal investigation reported that its core blood-testing technology did not work. For nearly four months at trial, the jury of eight men and four women were presented with two starkly different accounts of the former self-made billionaire, whose downfall shook Silicon Valley. PROFILE:The boss accused of duping Silicon Valley CONTEXT:Has the Theranos scandal changed Silicon Valley? Calling some 30 witnesses, the prosecution sought to prove that Holmes knew the product she was selling to investors - a machine called the Edison - was a sham, but remained hell-bent on the firm's success. Her company secretly relied on commercially available machines to run the tests, prosecutors said. At trial, multiple lab directors testified to telling Holmes about the flaws in Theranos' technology but being instructed to downplay their concerns. At the same time, they added , Holmes told investors the technology was operating as planned. Holmes ""chose fraud over business failure. She chose to be dishonest with investors and patients"", said prosecutor Jeff Schenk in closing arguments. ""That choice was not only callous, it was criminal."" The defence countered with descriptions of a dedicated and driven businesswoman, making waves in a male-dominated industry. This video can not be played The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes Testifying in her own defence, Holmes acknowledged mistakes in Theranos' operation, butmaintained she never knowingly defrauded patients or investors. The defence also laid blame on Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, her former business partner and ex-boyfriend. At trial Holmes accused Mr Balwani, 19 years her senior, of emotional and sexual abuse - allegations he denies. Elizabeth Holmes claimed her diagnostics machines could test hundreds of diseases. They couldn't. Considering she was the founder and CEO of Theranos you might think the case would be an easy win for the prosecution. But for a number of reasons the guilty verdicts were by no means assured. These technical fraud cases are extremely difficult to prosecute. Jurors were asked to consider hundreds of documents and sit through evidence from dozens of witnesses. Holmes has just had a baby and some commentators believed she would strike a sympathetic character. The difficulty in successfully prosecuting Holmes is reflected in the verdicts - a real mixed bag of decisions from the jury. But considering how difficult white-collar fraud cases are to prosecute, the government will be happy with what stuck. Her former partner, Sunny Balwani, will now face trial next month in the same court for similar charges. It's likely Holmes will not be sentenced until after that case has concluded. The verdict sends a clear and frank message to Silicon Valley founders - there are consequences when you say things to investors that aren't true. US Attorney Stephanie Hinds thanked the jurors who, she said, had navigated a ""complex case"" over 15 weeks to reach their verdict. ""The guilty verdicts, in this case, reflect Ms Holmes' culpability in this large-scale investor fraud and she must now face sentencing for her crimes,"" the prosecutor said in a statement read out by an assistant. Holmes was dubbed the ""next Steve Jobs"" by Inc. magazine, trumpeted by Forbes as being ""the world's youngest self-made female billionaire"", and featured in Time magazine's coveted list of the most influential people in 2015. She founded Theranos as a teenager, shortly after dropping out of chemical engineering at Stanford University. The firm officially ceased operations in 2018 following the scandal.

GM's 90-year streak as top US car seller ends,"US car giant General Motors has lost its title as America's top car seller for the first time in 90 years. Japan's Toyota claimed the top spot, selling more than 2.3 million vehicles last year, up 10%. GM said its sales, which fell 13%, were hurt by the widespread shortage of semiconductor parts that has been affecting the car industry. The Detroit company had ranked as the number one US car seller since 1931 and vowed it would bounce back. ""I wouldn't rush out if I were (Toyota) and get a 'We're No 1' tattoo,"" spokesman Jim Cain said, according to Reuters. Toyota extends Japan car production stoppages More young drivers choosing to learn on automatic cars Why is there a chip shortage for computers and cars? Overall, analysts expect the number of new cars sold in the US to have increased roughly 2% in 2021 compared to 2020, when buyers were reeling from the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. But purchases remain depressed compared to their pre-pandemic levels, as companies grapple with supply chain woes, problems that have also pushed prices higher for consumers. ""The key constraint for sales continues to be reduced inventory levels as a result of the semiconductor shortage,"" GM chief economist Elaine Buckberg said in a statement discussing the firm's sales and outlook for 2022. GM sold roughly 2.2 million vehicles last year down from 2.5 million in 2020, relying on its profitable pick-up trucks and SUVs to boost its bottom line. Toyota, which saw strong sales of its hybrids and other models, has been less affected than some other car makers by the shortage of chips, thanks to its decision to build up a stockpile after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. But it has also been forced to cut production amid the shortages. But America's top car companies have been ceding ground to international rivals well before the pandemic-related snarls. Ford, General Motors and Chrysler once accounted foras much as 90% of all US car sales,externaland still claimed more than half as recently as 2008. But that has slid lower. Toyota's Camry has been the top-selling passenger car in the US for 20 years, while its Rav4 has ranked as the best-selling SUV for five years.

"As-it-happened: PM warns of challenging weeks, as cases top 200k","Prime Minister Boris Johnson says this is a moment for utmost caution and anyone who thinks the battle with Covid is over is wrong At a Downing St briefing he says the weeks ahead will be challenging and again urges people to get their booster vaccinations But he adds that there is a ""good chance"" of getting through the Omicron wave without further restrictions It would not be ""tenable"" to give booster jabs every three to six months in the long-term, adds chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance The UK has recorded more than 200,000 coronavirus cases in a day for the first time But the figure of 218,724 is affected by a backlog in reporting from Wales and Northern Ireland over the New Year period From next week daily tests will be available for essential workers in some sectors such as food processing and the Border Force, the PM says Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says more children should have been vaccinated over the Christmas period to ensure schools can stay open Edited by James Clarke and Chris Clayton As we bring our live coverage to a close for another day, here's a recap of some of today's main stories from the UK and around the world:  Today's updates were written by Francesca Gillett, Marie Jackson, Alexandra Fouche, Doug Faulkner, Nathan Williams, James Harness and George Wright. The page was edited by James Clarke, Chris Clayton and Kevin Ponniah. Do join us again tomorrow. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Under England's guidelines, a school must get in touch with public health officials if five pupils, teachers or staff in close contact test positive for Covid in a 10-day period. Then school management must work with local health officials to mitigate the spread of disease. Measures include:  For more information, head to ourback to school explainer. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Earlier today we were at a school in Stoke-on-Trent where pupils told us how they felt about wearing masks in classrooms. Kaitlin, a year 11 pupil, says she finds wearing a mask ""makes learning more difficult because you canât really tell facial expressions"". ""But at the same time everyoneâs main priority is the safety of each other and protecting everyone. So you have to outweigh the negatives and realise itâs for the greater good,"" she adds. Kian, who is also coming up to his GCSEs, says he finds it ""stressful"" being in a classroom with glasses and a mask on. ""My glasses steam up a lot and I canât see the board. Itâs just a bit stressful because the mask is always on my face and I canât really breathe,"" he says. ""But the positive side is that itâs helping people to stay safe."" Sam thinks it's important that face-to-face teaching continues. ""You canât get the same effect online as in the classroom, with the teachers there for support and technical issues as well,"" he says. King Carl XVI Gustaf (R) and Queen Silvia will isolate for a week And in Sweden which is also reporting record numbers of cases, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia have tested positive for coronavirus and have mild symptoms, the palace says. The royal couple, who are aged 75 and 78 respectively, are isolating at the palace in Drottningholm near the capital Stockholm, according to information officer Daniel Urso. In a statement, the palace says they have both had three doses of Covid vaccine and are feeling well under the circumstances. Other members of the royal family contracted coronavirus earlier on in the pandemic. The king and queen met their children and grandchildren over Christmas and tested positive on Monday evening as a routine measure because of Sweden's high Covid infection rates. A record 11,507 cases were reported on 30 December alone and a total of 42,969 infections over the holiday weekend, according to figures from Sweden's public health agency on Tuesday.  The UK is not alone in facing a surge of cases from the Omicron variant. On Tuesday, 271,686 Covid cases were reported by French health authorities, the country's highest tally on record. Another 293 deaths were also recorded. During the press conference, Prof Sir Chris Whitty warned of rising hospital
admission rates in older age groups who are the most vulnerable to becoming ill
with Omicron. The latest data on whoâs going into hospital with Covid in
England shows a steep rise in the over 85s, and a more gentle increase in
people aged 65-84. These groups are most at risk from Covid and if lots of
people are infected â as they are now â then these older age groups are more
likely to contract the virus. They can then end up needing hospital treatment, despite
protection from two vaccines and a booster. Raw admission numbers show there are more people aged 18-64
in hospital with Covid than any other age group, mainly because they make up
the bulk of the population. Children are not being admitted to hospital in large numbers
because of this variant of Covid, although more children are always unwell for
different reasons in winter. One of the key announcements in that press conference from the prime minister was that from next week daily tests will be made available for essential workers in certain industries. Watch what Boris Johnson had to say: This video can not be played PM announces daily tests for essential workers Helen CattPolitical correspondent This feels like the closest the prime minister has come to saying there won't be another lockdown, or even more restrictions, without completely ruling it out. He was clear that he doesn't think such hefty measures are likely to be justified by the Omicron variant, as it stands. It's also pretty clear though that ""riding out"" the Omicron wave has the potential to be a rough experience for everyday services and, particularly, for the NHS. With the other UK nations having chosen to go down the route of restrictions instead, the coming weeks will show whose balancing act has paid off. The UK PM's media
briefing has finished, so here's a reminder of the key things we just heard: The press conference is now over. The Evening Standard had the final questions for Sir Chris and Sir Patrick. Sir Patrick said there was no evidence that Omicron had peaked in London. While rates were flattening in younger age groups - that's not true in older age groups, he said, as we heard earlier. ""It would be very wrong to suggest there's a peak which means it's all over in London,"" said Sir Patrick. Asked what his message would be for people in London returning to pubs and clubs, Sir Chris said that until we've had the peak in the most vulnerable, any measures that slow it down are beneficial and reduce the height of the wave. He added that people had been incredibly responsive - but there remained a need to still be very careful to work from home and to prioritise events. The Sun asks when people will need to have had a booster jab to use vaccine certification. Currently people have to show evidence of two jabs (or a negative lateral flow test) - but ministers have said this will eventually change to require people to have had a third. Boris Johnson does not say when the change will take place, but pledges people will be given ""plenty of time"" before the change is made. But he suggests it will be ""very much to people's advantage"" to get a booster if they want to travel, as other countries are likely to change their rules to require three jabs. The next question comes from the Guardian. Boris Johnson says he won't provide a definition. He thinks different trusts will feel overwhelmed at different moments - and refers to some of those NHS trusts that have already declared incidents. It's people in the hospital, the pressure on A&Es, the ambulances arriving - that's the pressure, he says. He goes on to repeat that there will be a difficult period for the NHS because of Omicron - and we have to get through it as best we can. Repeating another earlier message, he says that in the meantime people have to follow the guidance and get jabbed. Pressed on the availability of high-grade masks and tests for healthcare staff, Johnson says the government is doing ""everything we can"" to ensure staff have what they need. Asked about vaccination, he says it is ""absolutely crazy"" and ""sad"" that there are slots available for booster jabs when most people in intensive care are unjabbed. Asked whether he is frustrated about the number of unvaccinated patients in hospital, Chris Whitty says that he is ""rather saddened"" by it. But he says he is frustrated about vaccine misinformation, which he cites as a reason people are not getting jabbed, along with questions about the effectiveness and side effects of vaccines. Health professionals should be answering these questions, he adds. A question now from ITV for Boris Johnson. He says the NHS is under a lot of pressure, but he's confident it can get through it - and the government will be supporting it in any way it can. He adds we need to remember lockdowns and further restrictions are not cost-free for lives, livelihoods and can have long-term consequences. Omicron is causing lots of hospital admissions, he says, but again stresses that it is resulting in fewer people needing intensive care and less mortality than we've seen from other variants. ""That's why we think this balanced approach is the right one,"" he says. The panel are asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how likely further restrictions are in England and what the threshold for extra curbs would be. Boris Johnson says it depends on whether the Omicron wave mirrors what happened in South Africa - and the government ""can't rule anything out"". But he says there is a currently a ""good chance of getting through the Omicron wave"" without the need for new rules. Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, says pressure on intensive care units is likely to be lower than previous waves but there will still be substantial pressures on A&E departments. Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, says hospitalisations, staff absences and the robustness of testing infrastructure will be key indicators in the coming weeks. A question now from the public for Sir Chris Whitty about what tests should be taken after someone tests positive for Covid. Whitty says the lateral flow tests are a good guide as to whether people are infectious - and they are confident that people who test negative on day six and seven of a period of self-isolation are much less likely to be infectious. He goes on to explain that the PCR tests can remain positive for a long time after someone has had the infection, including beyond the point that they are infectious. There's a question from a member of the public, who asks what number of cases or hospitalisations would justify further restrictions in England. Boris Johnson does not give an answer, saying simply that the current ""balance of measures"" is the ""right approach to take"". But he says the government will continue to monitor the data, and again urges people to come forward for their booster jabs. Sir Chris talks now about how London is in advance of the rest of the UK, saying the number of hospitalisations is still going up. He says it looks as if numbers in younger adults are levelling off but the  rates in older people look as if they are still going up. He says the thing that's likely to reduce that is people getting their booster jabs. Sir Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, talks through the government's slides, saying there's been a substantial increase in cases over the last few weeks. He says about one in 25 people in England had Covid in the last week of data from the ONS - about two million people in total. The expectation is that number will go up, he says. Boris Johnson says the NHS will be put on a ""war footing"" but he will be recommending to the cabinet that the current - plan B - level of restrictions for England remains in place. Adding that 90% of Covid patients in intensive care beds are unvaccinated, he urges people to come forward and get their booster jabs. Â© 2025 BBC.

What are the rules in NI?,"Mask wearing is now guidance rather than law The health minister has revoked Northern Ireland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions, so rules that were formerly legally binding, such as wearing face coverings in enclosed public spaces, are now merely guidance. This means that while people are encouraged to follow restrictions, they will not face any punishment for not doing so. However, individual businesses are still able to ask customers to follow certain rules. Issues that were previously covered by guidance - such as the advice to work from home where possible - have not changed either, because the changes only affect legal restrictions. People are still being strongly encouraged to wear face masks in enclosed public spaces, such as shops, restaurants, cafes, bars and on public transport. In post-primary schools it was always guidance - rather than a legal requirement - for pupils to wear face coverings. This has not changed. Hospitality and entertainment venues will still be strongly encouraged to use so-called Covid passports, and the certificates will still be available for anyone who needs them to travel abroad. Social distancing is also still encouraged as well as meeting outdoors or in well-ventilated places were possible. The requirement for offices to take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing had already been removed, but soon risk assessments will no longer be required. People are still advised to work from home where possible but Health Minister Robin Swann has made it clear he wants the guidance to be urgently reviewed. He said he would work with ministerial colleagues on the issue. There have not been any changes to the rules on self-isolation. The Department of Health clarified on Tuesday evening that - contrary to England - the self-isolation rules in Northern Ireland were never enshrined in legislation. Instead, they were classified as ""very strong guidance"". Anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 should self-isolate for 10 days from the date their symptoms start or the date they took a test, whichever is sooner. They can leave isolation from day six if they have two consecutive lateral flow tests taken 24 hours apart, with the first taken no earlier than day five, and provided they do not have a high temperature. The testing and contact-tracing system will also remain in place. People are no longer required to social distance outdoors in Northern Ireland Travel rules remain in place, although there are currently no countries on the red list for international travel. If you are fully vaccinated and travelling to Northern Ireland from a country outside the Common Travel Area, you do not have to take a pre or post-departure test or self-isolate on arrival. However you must complete a UK passenger locator form in the 48 hours before you arrive and be able to prove your vaccination status. If you are not fully vaccinated you must complete a UK passenger locator form in the 48 hours before you arrive and be able to prove your vaccination status. You must also book and pay for a pre-departure PCR or LFD test to be taken in the two days before you travel to Northern Ireland and book and pay for a PCR test to be taken on or before day two following arrival. Foreign countries all have their own rules which you must follow if you are travelling to them. Dentistry has been severely disrupted by the pandemic and a large backlog of patients seeking routine appointments has built up since the first lockdown in March 2020. Dentistry was not specifically mentioned with the lifting of Covid restrictions, so dentists are still working underoperational guidelines issued by the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) which were last updated in December 2021,external. Currently, patients are asked about their Covid status before they attend appointments and those who have no symptoms of Covid or other respiratory infection can be treated under standard infection control measures that were in place before the pandemic began. But patients who test positive or who report Covid symptoms can only receive dental treatment if it is considered urgent and they should be segregated from other visitors to the surgery. A spokeswoman from the British Dental Association told BBC News NI that all enhanced measures to keep patients and staff safe have radically reduced capacity across the service and the current backlog means that routine appointments ""are still a long way off"". Translink said it will now encourage passengers to continue to wear face coverings in its vehicles and buildings A Translink spokesperson said the public service transport firm would ""continue to follow public health guidance"" regarding face coverings. ""To help keep everyone safe and in line with the latest guidance, we are encouraging our passengers to wear a face covering, if they can, in stations and on-board buses and trains,"" they added. There has been a mixed response on mask wearing guidelines from supermarkets and entertainment venues. Asda said wearing a face covering would now be ""a personal choice"". Sainsburys is continuing to ask people to wear them in its stores in Great Britain, but in Northern Ireland, the supermarket giant said it was reviewing what Stormont's health minister has said and will keep customers informed. Belfast's Grand Opera House has confirmed that it will continue to encourage people to wear face coverings, unless they are exempt or are eating and drinking. However, the Movie House Cinema chain said people could now make their own decisions on wearing face coverings.  It will also be removing guidance signs from its cinemas.

Another 293 deaths were also recorded. During the press conference, Prof Sir Chris Whitty warned of rising hospital
admission rates in older age groups who are the most vulnerable to becoming ill
with Omicron. The latest data on whoâs going into hospital with Covid in
England shows a steep rise in the over 85s, and a more gentle increase in
people aged 65-84. These groups are most at risk from Covid and if lots of
people are infected â as they are now â then these older age groups are more
likely to contract the virus. They can then end up needing hospital treatment, despite
protection from two vaccines and a booster. Raw admission numbers show there are more people aged 18-64
in hospital with Covid than any other age group, mainly because they make up
the bulk of the population. Children are not being admitted to hospital in large numbers
because of this variant of Covid, although more children are always unwell for
different reasons in winter. One of the key announcements in that press conference from the prime minister was that from next week daily tests will be made available for essential workers in certain industries. Watch what Boris Johnson had to say: This video can not be played PM announces daily tests for essential workers Helen CattPolitical correspondent This feels like the closest the prime minister has come to saying there won't be another lockdown, or even more restrictions, without completely ruling it out. He was clear that he doesn't think such hefty measures are likely to be justified by the Omicron variant, as it stands. It's also pretty clear though that ""riding out"" the Omicron wave has the potential to be a rough experience for everyday services and, particularly, for the NHS. With the other UK nations having chosen to go down the route of restrictions instead, the coming weeks will show whose balancing act has paid off. The UK PM's media
briefing has finished, so here's a reminder of the key things we just heard: The press conference is now over. The Evening Standard had the final questions for Sir Chris and Sir Patrick. Sir Patrick said there was no evidence that Omicron had peaked in London. While rates were flattening in younger age groups - that's not true in older age groups, he said, as we heard earlier. ""It would be very wrong to suggest there's a peak which means it's all over in London,"" said Sir Patrick. Asked what his message would be for people in London returning to pubs and clubs, Sir Chris said that until we've had the peak in the most vulnerable, any measures that slow it down are beneficial and reduce the height of the wave. He added that people had been incredibly responsive - but there remained a need to still be very careful to work from home and to prioritise events. The Sun asks when people will need to have had a booster jab to use vaccine certification. Currently people have to show evidence of two jabs (or a negative lateral flow test) - but ministers have said this will eventually change to require people to have had a third. Boris Johnson does not say when the change will take place, but pledges people will be given ""plenty of time"" before the change is made. But he suggests it will be ""very much to people's advantage"" to get a booster if they want to travel, as other countries are likely to change their rules to require three jabs. The next question comes from the Guardian. Boris Johnson says he won't provide a definition. He thinks different trusts will feel overwhelmed at different moments - and refers to some of those NHS trusts that have already declared incidents. It's people in the hospital, the pressure on A&Es, the ambulances arriving - that's the pressure, he says. He goes on to repeat that there will be a difficult period for the NHS because of Omicron - and we have to get through it as best we can. Repeating another earlier message, he says that in the meantime people have to follow the guidance and get jabbed. Pressed on the availability of high-grade masks and tests for healthcare staff, Johnson says the government is doing ""everything we can"" to ensure staff have what they need. Asked about vaccination, he says it is ""absolutely crazy"" and ""sad"" that there are slots available for booster jabs when most people in intensive care are unjabbed. Asked whether he is frustrated about the number of unvaccinated patients in hospital, Chris Whitty says that he is ""rather saddened"" by it. But he says he is frustrated about vaccine misinformation, which he cites as a reason people are not getting jabbed, along with questions about the effectiveness and side effects of vaccines. Health professionals should be answering these questions, he adds. A question now from ITV for Boris Johnson. He says the NHS is under a lot of pressure, but he's confident it can get through it - and the government will be supporting it in any way it can. He adds we need to remember lockdowns and further restrictions are not cost-free for lives, livelihoods and can have long-term consequences. Omicron is causing lots of hospital admissions, he says, but again stresses that it is resulting in fewer people needing intensive care and less mortality than we've seen from other variants. ""That's why we think this balanced approach is the right one,"" he says. The panel are asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how likely further restrictions are in England and what the threshold for extra curbs would be. Boris Johnson says it depends on whether the Omicron wave mirrors what happened in South Africa - and the government ""can't rule anything out"". But he says there is a currently a ""good chance of getting through the Omicron wave"" without the need for new rules. Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, says pressure on intensive care units is likely to be lower than previous waves but there will still be substantial pressures on A&E departments. Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, says hospitalisations, staff absences and the robustness of testing infrastructure will be key indicators in the coming weeks. A question now from the public for Sir Chris Whitty about what tests should be taken after someone tests positive for Covid. Whitty says the lateral flow tests are a good guide as to whether people are infectious - and they are confident that people who test negative on day six and seven of a period of self-isolation are much less likely to be infectious. He goes on to explain that the PCR tests can remain positive for a long time after someone has had the infection, including beyond the point that they are infectious. There's a question from a member of the public, who asks what number of cases or hospitalisations would justify further restrictions in England. Boris Johnson does not give an answer, saying simply that the current ""balance of measures"" is the ""right approach to take"". But he says the government will continue to monitor the data, and again urges people to come forward for their booster jabs. Sir Chris talks now about how London is in advance of the rest of the UK, saying the number of hospitalisations is still going up. He says it looks as if numbers in younger adults are levelling off but the  rates in older people look as if they are still going up. He says the thing that's likely to reduce that is people getting their booster jabs. Sir Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, talks through the government's slides, saying there's been a substantial increase in cases over the last few weeks. He says about one in 25 people in England had Covid in the last week of data from the ONS - about two million people in total. The expectation is that number will go up, he says. Boris Johnson says the NHS will be put on a ""war footing"" but he will be recommending to the cabinet that the current - plan B - level of restrictions for England remains in place. Adding that 90% of Covid patients in intensive care beds are unvaccinated, he urges people to come forward and get their booster jabs. Â© 2025 BBC.

Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Earlier today we were at a school in Stoke-on-Trent where pupils told us how they felt about wearing masks in classrooms. Kaitlin, a year 11 pupil, says she finds wearing a mask ""makes learning more difficult because you canât really tell facial expressions"". ""But at the same time everyoneâs main priority is the safety of each other and protecting everyone. So you have to outweigh the negatives and realise itâs for the greater good,"" she adds. Kian, who is also coming up to his GCSEs, says he finds it ""stressful"" being in a classroom with glasses and a mask on. ""My glasses steam up a lot and I canât see the board. Itâs just a bit stressful because the mask is always on my face and I canât really breathe,"" he says. ""But the positive side is that itâs helping people to stay safe."" Sam thinks it's important that face-to-face teaching continues. ""You canât get the same effect online as in the classroom, with the teachers there for support and technical issues as well,"" he says. King Carl XVI Gustaf (R) and Queen Silvia will isolate for a week And in Sweden which is also reporting record numbers of cases, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia have tested positive for coronavirus and have mild symptoms, the palace says. The royal couple, who are aged 75 and 78 respectively, are isolating at the palace in Drottningholm near the capital Stockholm, according to information officer Daniel Urso. In a statement, the palace says they have both had three doses of Covid vaccine and are feeling well under the circumstances. Other members of the royal family contracted coronavirus earlier on in the pandemic. The king and queen met their children and grandchildren over Christmas and tested positive on Monday evening as a routine measure because of Sweden's high Covid infection rates.

Police probe alleged death threats sent to MSP,"Police are investigating alleged threats made against SNP MSP Karen Adam. The Banffshire and Buchan Coast representative, who was elected last year, had faced a backlash for a tweet about paedophiles last week. Ms Adam said abusers were not ""Mac wearing flashers in the street"" but ""our family, friends and colleagues"". She added: ""It's uncomfortable to humanise them because we then have to face the horrors in plain sight."" Following the post, the MSP - who said she was a survivor of child sexual exploitation - added that she had received death threats, including a threat to put her through a woodchipper. The post was interpreted by some, including Alba Party general secretary Chris McEleny, as an attempt to humanise those who abuse children - something the MSP firmly rejected. Ms Adam said she was attempting to make clear that abusers were normal people who often ""go under cover as 'respectable'"". On Monday, in a tweet posted just after 03:00, Ms Adam said she had received death threats as a result of her original tweet and suggested she could pursue legal action. ""Can't sleep, not eaten. I'm worried for mine and my families safety after I was just told my personal details are now being shared,"" she wrote. ""Death threats, vile abuse, told to kill myself. Told I'd be put through a wood chipper. Grateful for litigation advice. I'm off for a wee bit."" A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""We can confirm that a complaint has been made regarding online threats and police inquiries are ongoing.""

Adele's 30 was the biggest-selling album of 2021,"Adele's 30 was the only album to sell more than half-a-million copies in 2021 Adele's 30 was the best-selling album of 2021, after just six weeks on sale. The star sold more than 600,000 copies of her so-called ""divorce album"", with 80% of those sales on CD and vinyl, bucking the trend towards streaming. However. the total falls far below the 800,000 copies her previous album, 25, sold in its first week. The discrepancy illustrates how the music industry has become dominated by singles, thanks to streaming, which now accounts for 83% of consumption. A record 147 billion tracks were streamed in the UK last year, up 5.7% from 2020. In June, the country saw its first week in which audio streams topped the 3 billion mark - a feat that was repeated three times in December, record labels association the BPI said. Just 10 years ago, in 2012, only 3.7 billion songs were streamed over the entire year. Ed Sheeran had 2021's biggest-selling single, Bad Habits. US pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo had the second and third-biggest songs, with Good 4 U and Drivers License. All of the top five were by solo acts, without featured artists, for the first time since 2009. Eight of the top 10 albums were from British musicians. Ed Sheeran took second place with = (Equals); and Abba came third with their comeback record Voyage - which was the year'sbiggest-seller on vinyl. Perennial best-sellers by Queen, Fleetwood Mac and Elton John held on to their positions in the top 10, thanks to buoyant streaming numbers. The overall recorded music market - including physical sales and digital income - was up 2.5% last year. CD sales fell to a 33-year low, with 14 million discs sold. Album downloads also fell, to 4.6 million; while vinyl sales were up 8% to 5.3 million. But while record labels will be delighted with the growth, especially in streaming, there is disquiet amongst artists about how the profits are divided up. The #BrokenRecord campaign, which was formed to highlight problems with the way streaming revenues are distributed, resulted in a major parliamentary inquiry last year. MPs called for a ""complete reset"" of the market, with musicians given a ""fair share"" of the Â£736.5 million that UK record labels earn from streaming; and the UK's topstreaming services will be investigated by the Competition and Markets Authoritythis year. The BPI's end-of-year report mounted a defence of the streaming's financial model, saying that, in 2021, almost 2,000 artists were streamed 10 million times in the UK alone; compared with 1,798 artists in 2020 and 1,537 artists in 2019. At the top of the leaderboard, 180 different artists had over 100 million streams last year - the equivalent of selling 100,000 CDs. ""The rise of streaming has empowered more artists than ever - from all backgrounds and eras - to build new fanbases around the world and to forge successful careers in music,"" said the BPI's chief executive, Geoff Taylor. The BPI has also warned that government intervention into the market could ""negatively impact performers, jeopardising the [music industry's] hard-won return to growth after years of decline"". However, smaller acts like Nadine Shah told parliament that streaming revenues are not enough to ""keep the wolf from the door"", especially after the pandemic wiped out their touring income. On Sunday, German techno artist Skee Mask pulled all of his music from Spotify in protest at how little ""creators behind the music receive in terms of value, respect or space"" - as well as Spotify founder Daniel Ek's recentÂ£83 million investment in military defence company Helsing,external. Electronic musician Four Tet is taking his former record label to court over streaming royalties Meanwhile, British electronic musician Kieran Hebden, who records under the name Four Tet, is taking legal action against record label Domino over the royalties he is paid on digital services. Hebden argues that, under the terms of his 2001 record deal with Domino, he should be getting a 50% of the money generated when his records are streamed, instead of the 18% the label currently offers. Domino, which argues his reading of the 20-year-old contract is incorrect, recently pulled all three of the Four Tet albums it owns from streaming services, prompting a wave of outrage from fans. Adele gets Spotify to take shuffle off album pages MPs call for complete reset of music streaming Vinyl sales soared again in 2021, thanks to Abba Hebden's case may never be heard - the musician says he cannot afford to pursue it if it is escalated to the High Court - but it is certain to focus musicians' attention on the historical deals they have signed. Meanwhile, the BPI argues that labels are still vital to help artists achieve their dreams. ""The hundreds of millions of pounds labels invest in the UK each year is supporting the emergence of a new wave of musicians connecting with millions of fans all over the world,"" said Geoff Taylor. ""This year's growth shows there is a huge appetite for music and we believe that by working together we can increase the value of the whole music market, so that streaming can support even more artists in the future.

Then school management must work with local health officials to mitigate the spread of disease. Measures include:  For more information, head to ourback to school explainer. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Earlier today we were at a school in Stoke-on-Trent where pupils told us how they felt about wearing masks in classrooms. Kaitlin, a year 11 pupil, says she finds wearing a mask ""makes learning more difficult because you canât really tell facial expressions"". ""But at the same time everyoneâs main priority is the safety of each other and protecting everyone. So you have to outweigh the negatives and realise itâs for the greater good,"" she adds. Kian, who is also coming up to his GCSEs, says he finds it ""stressful"" being in a classroom with glasses and a mask on. ""My glasses steam up a lot and I canât see the board. Itâs just a bit stressful because the mask is always on my face and I canât really breathe,"" he says. ""But the positive side is that itâs helping people to stay safe."" Sam thinks it's important that face-to-face teaching continues. ""You canât get the same effect online as in the classroom, with the teachers there for support and technical issues as well,"" he says. King Carl XVI Gustaf (R) and Queen Silvia will isolate for a week And in Sweden which is also reporting record numbers of cases, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia have tested positive for coronavirus and have mild symptoms, the palace says. The royal couple, who are aged 75 and 78 respectively, are isolating at the palace in Drottningholm near the capital Stockholm, according to information officer Daniel Urso. In a statement, the palace says they have both had three doses of Covid vaccine and are feeling well under the circumstances. Other members of the royal family contracted coronavirus earlier on in the pandemic. The king and queen met their children and grandchildren over Christmas and tested positive on Monday evening as a routine measure because of Sweden's high Covid infection rates. A record 11,507 cases were reported on 30 December alone and a total of 42,969 infections over the holiday weekend, according to figures from Sweden's public health agency on Tuesday.  The UK is not alone in facing a surge of cases from the Omicron variant. On Tuesday, 271,686 Covid cases were reported by French health authorities, the country's highest tally on record. Another 293 deaths were also recorded. During the press conference, Prof Sir Chris Whitty warned of rising hospital
admission rates in older age groups who are the most vulnerable to becoming ill
with Omicron. The latest data on whoâs going into hospital with Covid in
England shows a steep rise in the over 85s, and a more gentle increase in
people aged 65-84. These groups are most at risk from Covid and if lots of
people are infected â as they are now â then these older age groups are more
likely to contract the virus. They can then end up needing hospital treatment, despite
protection from two vaccines and a booster. Raw admission numbers show there are more people aged 18-64
in hospital with Covid than any other age group, mainly because they make up
the bulk of the population. Children are not being admitted to hospital in large numbers
because of this variant of Covid, although more children are always unwell for
different reasons in winter. One of the key announcements in that press conference from the prime minister was that from next week daily tests will be made available for essential workers in certain industries. Watch what Boris Johnson had to say: This video can not be played PM announces daily tests for essential workers Helen CattPolitical correspondent This feels like the closest the prime minister has come to saying there won't be another lockdown, or even more restrictions, without completely ruling it out. He was clear that he doesn't think such hefty measures are likely to be justified by the Omicron variant, as it stands. It's also pretty clear though that ""riding out"" the Omicron wave has the potential to be a rough experience for everyday services and, particularly, for the NHS. With the other UK nations having chosen to go down the route of restrictions instead, the coming weeks will show whose balancing act has paid off. The UK PM's media
briefing has finished, so here's a reminder of the key things we just heard: The press conference is now over. The Evening Standard had the final questions for Sir Chris and Sir Patrick. Sir Patrick said there was no evidence that Omicron had peaked in London. While rates were flattening in younger age groups - that's not true in older age groups, he said, as we heard earlier. ""It would be very wrong to suggest there's a peak which means it's all over in London,"" said Sir Patrick. Asked what his message would be for people in London returning to pubs and clubs, Sir Chris said that until we've had the peak in the most vulnerable, any measures that slow it down are beneficial and reduce the height of the wave. He added that people had been incredibly responsive - but there remained a need to still be very careful to work from home and to prioritise events. The Sun asks when people will need to have had a booster jab to use vaccine certification. Currently people have to show evidence of two jabs (or a negative lateral flow test) - but ministers have said this will eventually change to require people to have had a third. Boris Johnson does not say when the change will take place, but pledges people will be given ""plenty of time"" before the change is made. But he suggests it will be ""very much to people's advantage"" to get a booster if they want to travel, as other countries are likely to change their rules to require three jabs. The next question comes from the Guardian. Boris Johnson says he won't provide a definition. He thinks different trusts will feel overwhelmed at different moments - and refers to some of those NHS trusts that have already declared incidents. It's people in the hospital, the pressure on A&Es, the ambulances arriving - that's the pressure, he says. He goes on to repeat that there will be a difficult period for the NHS because of Omicron - and we have to get through it as best we can. Repeating another earlier message, he says that in the meantime people have to follow the guidance and get jabbed. Pressed on the availability of high-grade masks and tests for healthcare staff, Johnson says the government is doing ""everything we can"" to ensure staff have what they need. Asked about vaccination, he says it is ""absolutely crazy"" and ""sad"" that there are slots available for booster jabs when most people in intensive care are unjabbed. Asked whether he is frustrated about the number of unvaccinated patients in hospital, Chris Whitty says that he is ""rather saddened"" by it. But he says he is frustrated about vaccine misinformation, which he cites as a reason people are not getting jabbed, along with questions about the effectiveness and side effects of vaccines. Health professionals should be answering these questions, he adds. A question now from ITV for Boris Johnson. He says the NHS is under a lot of pressure, but he's confident it can get through it - and the government will be supporting it in any way it can. He adds we need to remember lockdowns and further restrictions are not cost-free for lives, livelihoods and can have long-term consequences. Omicron is causing lots of hospital admissions, he says, but again stresses that it is resulting in fewer people needing intensive care and less mortality than we've seen from other variants. ""That's why we think this balanced approach is the right one,"" he says. The panel are asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how likely further restrictions are in England and what the threshold for extra curbs would be. Boris Johnson says it depends on whether the Omicron wave mirrors what happened in South Africa - and the government ""can't rule anything out"". But he says there is a currently a ""good chance of getting through the Omicron wave"" without the need for new rules. Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, says pressure on intensive care units is likely to be lower than previous waves but there will still be substantial pressures on A&E departments. Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, says hospitalisations, staff absences and the robustness of testing infrastructure will be key indicators in the coming weeks. A question now from the public for Sir Chris Whitty about what tests should be taken after someone tests positive for Covid. Whitty says the lateral flow tests are a good guide as to whether people are infectious - and they are confident that people who test negative on day six and seven of a period of self-isolation are much less likely to be infectious. He goes on to explain that the PCR tests can remain positive for a long time after someone has had the infection, including beyond the point that they are infectious. There's a question from a member of the public, who asks what number of cases or hospitalisations would justify further restrictions in England. Boris Johnson does not give an answer, saying simply that the current ""balance of measures"" is the ""right approach to take"". But he says the government will continue to monitor the data, and again urges people to come forward for their booster jabs. Sir Chris talks now about how London is in advance of the rest of the UK, saying the number of hospitalisations is still going up. He says it looks as if numbers in younger adults are levelling off but the  rates in older people look as if they are still going up. He says the thing that's likely to reduce that is people getting their booster jabs. Sir Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, talks through the government's slides, saying there's been a substantial increase in cases over the last few weeks. He says about one in 25 people in England had Covid in the last week of data from the ONS - about two million people in total. The expectation is that number will go up, he says. Boris Johnson says the NHS will be put on a ""war footing"" but he will be recommending to the cabinet that the current - plan B - level of restrictions for England remains in place. Adding that 90% of Covid patients in intensive care beds are unvaccinated, he urges people to come forward and get their booster jabs. Â© 2025 BBC.

The king and queen met their children and grandchildren over Christmas and tested positive on Monday evening as a routine measure because of Sweden's high Covid infection rates. A record 11,507 cases were reported on 30 December alone and a total of 42,969 infections over the holiday weekend, according to figures from Sweden's public health agency on Tuesday.  The UK is not alone in facing a surge of cases from the Omicron variant. On Tuesday, 271,686 Covid cases were reported by French health authorities, the country's highest tally on record. Another 293 deaths were also recorded. During the press conference, Prof Sir Chris Whitty warned of rising hospital
admission rates in older age groups who are the most vulnerable to becoming ill
with Omicron. The latest data on whoâs going into hospital with Covid in
England shows a steep rise in the over 85s, and a more gentle increase in
people aged 65-84. These groups are most at risk from Covid and if lots of
people are infected â as they are now â then these older age groups are more
likely to contract the virus. They can then end up needing hospital treatment, despite
protection from two vaccines and a booster. Raw admission numbers show there are more people aged 18-64
in hospital with Covid than any other age group, mainly because they make up
the bulk of the population. Children are not being admitted to hospital in large numbers
because of this variant of Covid, although more children are always unwell for
different reasons in winter. One of the key announcements in that press conference from the prime minister was that from next week daily tests will be made available for essential workers in certain industries. Watch what Boris Johnson had to say: This video can not be played PM announces daily tests for essential workers Helen CattPolitical correspondent This feels like the closest the prime minister has come to saying there won't be another lockdown, or even more restrictions, without completely ruling it out. He was clear that he doesn't think such hefty measures are likely to be justified by the Omicron variant, as it stands. It's also pretty clear though that ""riding out"" the Omicron wave has the potential to be a rough experience for everyday services and, particularly, for the NHS. With the other UK nations having chosen to go down the route of restrictions instead, the coming weeks will show whose balancing act has paid off. The UK PM's media
briefing has finished, so here's a reminder of the key things we just heard: The press conference is now over. The Evening Standard had the final questions for Sir Chris and Sir Patrick. Sir Patrick said there was no evidence that Omicron had peaked in London. While rates were flattening in younger age groups - that's not true in older age groups, he said, as we heard earlier. ""It would be very wrong to suggest there's a peak which means it's all over in London,"" said Sir Patrick. Asked what his message would be for people in London returning to pubs and clubs, Sir Chris said that until we've had the peak in the most vulnerable, any measures that slow it down are beneficial and reduce the height of the wave. He added that people had been incredibly responsive - but there remained a need to still be very careful to work from home and to prioritise events. The Sun asks when people will need to have had a booster jab to use vaccine certification. Currently people have to show evidence of two jabs (or a negative lateral flow test) - but ministers have said this will eventually change to require people to have had a third. Boris Johnson does not say when the change will take place, but pledges people will be given ""plenty of time"" before the change is made. But he suggests it will be ""very much to people's advantage"" to get a booster if they want to travel, as other countries are likely to change their rules to require three jabs. The next question comes from the Guardian. Boris Johnson says he won't provide a definition. He thinks different trusts will feel overwhelmed at different moments - and refers to some of those NHS trusts that have already declared incidents. It's people in the hospital, the pressure on A&Es, the ambulances arriving - that's the pressure, he says. He goes on to repeat that there will be a difficult period for the NHS because of Omicron - and we have to get through it as best we can. Repeating another earlier message, he says that in the meantime people have to follow the guidance and get jabbed. Pressed on the availability of high-grade masks and tests for healthcare staff, Johnson says the government is doing ""everything we can"" to ensure staff have what they need. Asked about vaccination, he says it is ""absolutely crazy"" and ""sad"" that there are slots available for booster jabs when most people in intensive care are unjabbed. Asked whether he is frustrated about the number of unvaccinated patients in hospital, Chris Whitty says that he is ""rather saddened"" by it. But he says he is frustrated about vaccine misinformation, which he cites as a reason people are not getting jabbed, along with questions about the effectiveness and side effects of vaccines. Health professionals should be answering these questions, he adds. A question now from ITV for Boris Johnson. He says the NHS is under a lot of pressure, but he's confident it can get through it - and the government will be supporting it in any way it can. He adds we need to remember lockdowns and further restrictions are not cost-free for lives, livelihoods and can have long-term consequences. Omicron is causing lots of hospital admissions, he says, but again stresses that it is resulting in fewer people needing intensive care and less mortality than we've seen from other variants. ""That's why we think this balanced approach is the right one,"" he says. The panel are asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how likely further restrictions are in England and what the threshold for extra curbs would be. Boris Johnson says it depends on whether the Omicron wave mirrors what happened in South Africa - and the government ""can't rule anything out"". But he says there is a currently a ""good chance of getting through the Omicron wave"" without the need for new rules. Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, says pressure on intensive care units is likely to be lower than previous waves but there will still be substantial pressures on A&E departments. Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, says hospitalisations, staff absences and the robustness of testing infrastructure will be key indicators in the coming weeks. A question now from the public for Sir Chris Whitty about what tests should be taken after someone tests positive for Covid. Whitty says the lateral flow tests are a good guide as to whether people are infectious - and they are confident that people who test negative on day six and seven of a period of self-isolation are much less likely to be infectious. He goes on to explain that the PCR tests can remain positive for a long time after someone has had the infection, including beyond the point that they are infectious. There's a question from a member of the public, who asks what number of cases or hospitalisations would justify further restrictions in England. Boris Johnson does not give an answer, saying simply that the current ""balance of measures"" is the ""right approach to take"". But he says the government will continue to monitor the data, and again urges people to come forward for their booster jabs. Sir Chris talks now about how London is in advance of the rest of the UK, saying the number of hospitalisations is still going up. He says it looks as if numbers in younger adults are levelling off but the  rates in older people look as if they are still going up. He says the thing that's likely to reduce that is people getting their booster jabs. Sir Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, talks through the government's slides, saying there's been a substantial increase in cases over the last few weeks. He says about one in 25 people in England had Covid in the last week of data from the ONS - about two million people in total. The expectation is that number will go up, he says. Boris Johnson says the NHS will be put on a ""war footing"" but he will be recommending to the cabinet that the current - plan B - level of restrictions for England remains in place. Adding that 90% of Covid patients in intensive care beds are unvaccinated, he urges people to come forward and get their booster jabs. Â© 2025 BBC.

Channel migrant numbers trebled in 2021,"A record 28,431 migrants made the journey across the English Channel last year The number of people who crossed the English Channel in small boats last year was treble the number for 2020. Figures compiled by the BBC show at least 28,431 migrants made the journey in 2021, despite huge UK investment in France to prevent crossings. A Home Office minister said the government was ""reforming"" its approach and introducing tougher asylum rules. Refugee charities said the ""dangerous and callous policy"" would lead to more arrivals and drownings. Clare Moseley, founder of charity Care4Calais, which supports refugees living in northern France, said rising numbers of small boat arrivals reflect a shift away from attempts to cross by lorry. She said: ""They are some of the most vulnerable people in the world, having lost family members in bloody conflicts, suffered horrific torture and inhumane persecution. ""The Government tells us that people should travel by legal means, but if this were truly possible why would so many be risking their lives in flimsy boats?"" In 2020, a total of 8,417 people crossed the Channel in small boats. Last year's record number - an increase of about 20,000 - saw arrivals peak in November when, despite falling temperatures, at least 6,869 people reached the UK. The first migrants to arrive in 2022 were brought ashore at Dover on Tuesday morning. The Home Office said 66 people arrived in two small boats, while the French authorities stopped 38 people trying to cross in a single boat. A family with a baby are believed to be among the first to migrants to cross the Channel in 2022 On 24 November at least27 people died as their boat sank. The same month saw a new record for a single day, when1,185 people reached British shores aboard 33 boats. In 2020 the most arrivals on a single day was 416, set in September. Border Force has seen a sharp increase in the number and size of small boats making the crossing The government said its new Nationality and Borders Bill would make it a criminal offence to enter the UK illegally and it would introduce life sentences for people-smugglers. Home Office minister Tom Pursglove said the government was ""making the tough decisions to end the overt exploitation of our laws"". He continued: ""The sooner the House of Lords approves the Nationality and Borders Bill, the sooner these reforms will be delivered."" However, the chief executive at Refugee Action, Tim Naor Hilton, said he believed tougher measures would not deter people from making these journeys, and smugglers would continue to profit ""unless ministers open up more routes for refugees to claim asylum"". He said: ""The government wants to legalise this dangerous and callous policy in its Anti-Refugee Bill, which will only lead to more people drowning."" ""It must wake up and scrap this bill now.""

Murder victim's family's anger over 'intimidation',"This video can not be played Glenn Quinn's family believe the South Antrim UDA murdered the Carrickfergus man The family of a terminally ill man murdered in County Antrim two years ago believe people have been intimidated from passing information to police. Glenn Quinn, 47, was beaten to death at his Ashleigh Park home in Carrickfergus on 4 January 2020. His family believe he was murdered by South East Antrim UDA after he spoke out against an attack on a friend's business. Mr Quinn had no connections to any crime. His murder remains unsolved. As a renewed appeal is made for information, Mr Quinn's mother Ellen Quinn said people know who was responsible for her son's murder but are not coming forward. ""A lot of people have been threatened that if they give information to police they would be sorted out,"" she added. ""Glenn didn't deserve what he gotâ¦ they just hammered him and beat him so badly. ""They shouldn't be walking the streets of Carrickfergus."" Glenn Quinn's death in 2020 shocked the town of Carrickfergus and beyond Mr Quinn's sister, Lesley Murphy, said: ""We know members of South East Antrim UDA murdered my brother. ""And they have then used that organisation's name to instil fear in us and witnesses. ""They thrive on intimidation and fear and that is what they use against people to keep them in line. ""Communities shouldn't have to live like that."" Mr Quinn was suffering from a blood condition when he moved into a flat in Carrickfergus just weeks before Christmas 2019. The police say the involvement of South East Antrim UDA in Mr Quinn's murder is a line of inquiry. He was initially attacked by a gang of men in the communal hallway outside his apartment block. Mr Quinn's sister and mother believe he was murdered by South East Antrim UDA after he spoke out against an attack on a friend's business Ms Murphy said her brother ""had injuries from his feet to the top of his head"". ""Almost every part of his body was injured,"" she added ""They showed him no mercy."" This video can not be played 'Next time it might be your son' The gang is a standalone faction of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Formed in 1971 from a number of loyalist vigilante groups, the UDA's stated aims were to protect unionist communities from attacks by republican paramilitaries, but it went on to kill hundreds of people during the Troubles using a cover name - the Ulster Freedom Fighters. The UDA was only proscribed, or declared illegal, in 1992 and, as the Troubles ended, the group began to fracture. The South East Antrim UDA is one of Northern Ireland's largest paramilitary gangs. According to aMI5-police intelligence assessment shared with BBC's Spotlight programmelast year, the gang ""has access to arms"" and is ""heavily involved in drugs supply, community coercion, intimidation and other criminality"". Last year,Spotlight reported the group was believed to have more than 2,000 members. Former PSNI superintendent Ken Pennington said he considers them to be ""a criminal cartel that have wrapped themselves in a flag"". Police have blamed a number of high-profile drug seizures in Carrickfergus and neighbouring areas to the group. Glenn Quinn's body was found in Ashleigh Park in the Woodburn area of Carrickfergus on 4 January 2020 Det Ch Insp Neil McGuinness believes the Carrickfergus community holds the answers to move the police investigation forward. ""I do believe there are people who are not telling us information, not because they don't want to see justice for Glenn but because they're frightened,"" he said. There is now a renewed appeal for information that could help police solve the murder. 'Break the silence about who killed my brother' Family appeal for information about paramilitary murder ""We're at the point now where we need people to come forward and help us out,"" Det Ch Insp McGuinness added. ""I'm begging the people of Carrickfergus to come forward by whatever means necessary and give me the information."" Police have said they will accept information anonymously through the Crimestoppers charity or via intermediators such as politicians. Det Ch Insp McGuinness said Mr Quinn had ""suffered a death at the hands of individuals who are probably still in the community and I want to bring them before the courts"". A reward of Â£10,000 has been offered by Crimestoppers for anyone who passes on information that leads to the conviction of those responsible for Mr Quinn's murder.

Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Earlier today we were at a school in Stoke-on-Trent where pupils told us how they felt about wearing masks in classrooms. Kaitlin, a year 11 pupil, says she finds wearing a mask ""makes learning more difficult because you canât really tell facial expressions"". ""But at the same time everyoneâs main priority is the safety of each other and protecting everyone. So you have to outweigh the negatives and realise itâs for the greater good,"" she adds. Kian, who is also coming up to his GCSEs, says he finds it ""stressful"" being in a classroom with glasses and a mask on. ""My glasses steam up a lot and I canât see the board. Itâs just a bit stressful because the mask is always on my face and I canât really breathe,"" he says. ""But the positive side is that itâs helping people to stay safe."" Sam thinks it's important that face-to-face teaching continues. ""You canât get the same effect online as in the classroom, with the teachers there for support and technical issues as well,"" he says. King Carl XVI Gustaf (R) and Queen Silvia will isolate for a week And in Sweden which is also reporting record numbers of cases, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia have tested positive for coronavirus and have mild symptoms, the palace says. The royal couple, who are aged 75 and 78 respectively, are isolating at the palace in Drottningholm near the capital Stockholm, according to information officer Daniel Urso. In a statement, the palace says they have both had three doses of Covid vaccine and are feeling well under the circumstances.

Another 293 deaths were also recorded. During the press conference, Prof Sir Chris Whitty warned of rising hospital
admission rates in older age groups who are the most vulnerable to becoming ill
with Omicron. The latest data on whoâs going into hospital with Covid in
England shows a steep rise in the over 85s, and a more gentle increase in
people aged 65-84. These groups are most at risk from Covid and if lots of
people are infected â as they are now â then these older age groups are more
likely to contract the virus. They can then end up needing hospital treatment, despite
protection from two vaccines and a booster. Raw admission numbers show there are more people aged 18-64
in hospital with Covid than any other age group, mainly because they make up
the bulk of the population. Children are not being admitted to hospital in large numbers
because of this variant of Covid, although more children are always unwell for
different reasons in winter. One of the key announcements in that press conference from the prime minister was that from next week daily tests will be made available for essential workers in certain industries. Watch what Boris Johnson had to say: This video can not be played PM announces daily tests for essential workers Helen CattPolitical correspondent This feels like the closest the prime minister has come to saying there won't be another lockdown, or even more restrictions, without completely ruling it out. He was clear that he doesn't think such hefty measures are likely to be justified by the Omicron variant, as it stands. It's also pretty clear though that ""riding out"" the Omicron wave has the potential to be a rough experience for everyday services and, particularly, for the NHS. With the other UK nations having chosen to go down the route of restrictions instead, the coming weeks will show whose balancing act has paid off. The UK PM's media
briefing has finished, so here's a reminder of the key things we just heard: The press conference is now over. The Evening Standard had the final questions for Sir Chris and Sir Patrick. Sir Patrick said there was no evidence that Omicron had peaked in London. While rates were flattening in younger age groups - that's not true in older age groups, he said, as we heard earlier. ""It would be very wrong to suggest there's a peak which means it's all over in London,"" said Sir Patrick. Asked what his message would be for people in London returning to pubs and clubs, Sir Chris said that until we've had the peak in the most vulnerable, any measures that slow it down are beneficial and reduce the height of the wave. He added that people had been incredibly responsive - but there remained a need to still be very careful to work from home and to prioritise events. The Sun asks when people will need to have had a booster jab to use vaccine certification. Currently people have to show evidence of two jabs (or a negative lateral flow test) - but ministers have said this will eventually change to require people to have had a third. Boris Johnson does not say when the change will take place, but pledges people will be given ""plenty of time"" before the change is made. But he suggests it will be ""very much to people's advantage"" to get a booster if they want to travel, as other countries are likely to change their rules to require three jabs. The next question comes from the Guardian. Boris Johnson says he won't provide a definition. He thinks different trusts will feel overwhelmed at different moments - and refers to some of those NHS trusts that have already declared incidents. It's people in the hospital, the pressure on A&Es, the ambulances arriving - that's the pressure, he says. He goes on to repeat that there will be a difficult period for the NHS because of Omicron - and we have to get through it as best we can. Repeating another earlier message, he says that in the meantime people have to follow the guidance and get jabbed. Pressed on the availability of high-grade masks and tests for healthcare staff, Johnson says the government is doing ""everything we can"" to ensure staff have what they need. Asked about vaccination, he says it is ""absolutely crazy"" and ""sad"" that there are slots available for booster jabs when most people in intensive care are unjabbed. Asked whether he is frustrated about the number of unvaccinated patients in hospital, Chris Whitty says that he is ""rather saddened"" by it. But he says he is frustrated about vaccine misinformation, which he cites as a reason people are not getting jabbed, along with questions about the effectiveness and side effects of vaccines. Health professionals should be answering these questions, he adds. A question now from ITV for Boris Johnson. He says the NHS is under a lot of pressure, but he's confident it can get through it - and the government will be supporting it in any way it can. He adds we need to remember lockdowns and further restrictions are not cost-free for lives, livelihoods and can have long-term consequences. Omicron is causing lots of hospital admissions, he says, but again stresses that it is resulting in fewer people needing intensive care and less mortality than we've seen from other variants. ""That's why we think this balanced approach is the right one,"" he says. The panel are asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how likely further restrictions are in England and what the threshold for extra curbs would be. Boris Johnson says it depends on whether the Omicron wave mirrors what happened in South Africa - and the government ""can't rule anything out"". But he says there is a currently a ""good chance of getting through the Omicron wave"" without the need for new rules. Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, says pressure on intensive care units is likely to be lower than previous waves but there will still be substantial pressures on A&E departments. Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, says hospitalisations, staff absences and the robustness of testing infrastructure will be key indicators in the coming weeks. A question now from the public for Sir Chris Whitty about what tests should be taken after someone tests positive for Covid. Whitty says the lateral flow tests are a good guide as to whether people are infectious - and they are confident that people who test negative on day six and seven of a period of self-isolation are much less likely to be infectious. He goes on to explain that the PCR tests can remain positive for a long time after someone has had the infection, including beyond the point that they are infectious. There's a question from a member of the public, who asks what number of cases or hospitalisations would justify further restrictions in England. Boris Johnson does not give an answer, saying simply that the current ""balance of measures"" is the ""right approach to take"". But he says the government will continue to monitor the data, and again urges people to come forward for their booster jabs. Sir Chris talks now about how London is in advance of the rest of the UK, saying the number of hospitalisations is still going up. He says it looks as if numbers in younger adults are levelling off but the  rates in older people look as if they are still going up. He says the thing that's likely to reduce that is people getting their booster jabs. Sir Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, talks through the government's slides, saying there's been a substantial increase in cases over the last few weeks. He says about one in 25 people in England had Covid in the last week of data from the ONS - about two million people in total. The expectation is that number will go up, he says. Boris Johnson says the NHS will be put on a ""war footing"" but he will be recommending to the cabinet that the current - plan B - level of restrictions for England remains in place. Adding that 90% of Covid patients in intensive care beds are unvaccinated, he urges people to come forward and get their booster jabs. Â© 2025 BBC.

The boss who duped Silicon Valley,"She was ""the world's youngest self-made female billionaire"", trumpeted Forbes magazine. The ""next Steve Jobs"", said Inc, another business magazine that put her on the cover. In 2014, Elizabeth Holmes, then 30 years old, was on top of the world. A Stanford University drop-out, she had founded a company valued at $9bn (Â£6.5bn) for supposedly bringing about a revolution in diagnosing disease. With a few drops of blood, Theranos promised that its Edison test could detect conditions such as cancer and diabetes quickly without the hassle of needles. Bigwigs from Henry Kissinger to general James Mattis sat on the board. But by 2015, the seams were coming apart, and within a year, Holmes was exposed as a fake. The technology she touted didn't work at all, and by 2018 the company she founded had collapsed. In January, she wasconvicted by a jury in California on four counts of fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The jury found her not guilty on four other charges and failed to reach a verdict on three more. Holmes, who had pleaded not guilty to all charges, sought a new trial but those requests were denied. She was sentenced on Friday to 11 years and three months in prison. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch lost Â£120m he had invested in Theranos During the trial Holmes accused her ex-boyfriend and business partner, Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, of emotional and sexual abuse at the time of the alleged crimes, impairing her mental state. Balwani, 56, who faced the same fraud charges, was convicted in July and is due to be sentenced next month. He had called the claims ""outrageous"". Despite being the subject of a book, HBO documentary, TV series and an upcoming film, it is still unclear why Holmes took such a gamble on technology she knew didn't work. She was raised in a comfortably well-off family in Washington DC, and was a polite but withdrawn child, according to people who knew her. Inventor and businessman Richard Fuisz, 81, speculated there must have been immense pressure on Holmes to succeed. His family lived next door to the Holmes family for years, but they fell out when Theranos sued him over a patent dispute in 2011 (it was later settled). Theranos founder hit with criminal charges When to fire the boss: A tale of three sackings Holmes's parents spent much of their careers as bureaucrats on Capitol Hill, but ""they were very interested in status"" and ""lived for connections"", he told the BBC. Her father's great-great-grandfather founded Fleischmann's Yeast, which changed America's bread industry, and the family was very conscious about its lineage, he said. At age nine, the young Elizabeth wrote a letter to her father declaring that what she ""really want[ed] out of life is to discover something new, something that mankind didn't know was possible to do"". When she got to Stanford University in 2002 to study chemical engineering, she came up with an idea for a patch that could scan the wearer for infections and release antibiotics as needed. Dr Phyllis Gardner told Holmes her idea would not work At 18, she already displayed an intransigence that would apparently continue and drive the company she would found the following year. Phyllis Gardner, an expert in clinical pharmacology at Stanford, recalled discussing Holmes's skin-patch idea and telling her it ""wouldn't work"". ""She just stared through me,"" Dr Gardner told the BBC. ""And she just seemed absolutely confident of her own brilliance. She wasn't interested in my expertise and it was upsetting."" Months later Holmes dropped out of Stanford aged 19 and launched Theranos, this time coming up with an apparently revolutionary way of testing blood from a simple finger prick. Powerful people were enthralled and invested without seeing audited financial accounts. US Treasury Secretary George Schultz, media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and America's richest family, the Waltons, were among her backers. The support lent her credibility, as did her demeanour. ""I knew she'd had this brilliant idea and that she had managed to convince all these investors and scientists,"" said Dr Jeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School, who met her for lunch in 2015. ""She was self-assured, but when I asked her several questions about her technology she didn't look like she understood,"" added Dr Flier, who never formally assessed her technology. ""It seemed a bit odd, but I didn't come away thinking it was a fraud."" On stage with former US President Bill Clinton in 2015. At the time Ms Holmes was said to be the world's youngest self-made female billionaire Dr Flier ended up inviting her to join the medical school's Board of Fellows, which he regrets, although she was removed when the scandal broke. It began to unravel in 2015 when a whistleblower raised concerns about Theranos' flagship testing device, the Edison. The Wall Street Journal wrote a series of damning exposes claiming the results were unreliable and that the firm had been using commercially available machines made by other manufacturers for most of its testing. Lawsuits piled up, partners cut ties and in 2016 US regulators banned Holmes from operating a blood-testing service for two years. In 2018 Theranos was dissolved. In March that year, Holmes settled civil charges from financial regulators that she had fraudulently raised $700m from investors. But three months later she was arrested, along with Mr Balwani, on criminal charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Prosecutors said,externalshe knowingly misled patients about the tests and vastly exaggerated the firm's performance to financial backers. As the Theranos scandal reached trial, commentators said it was remarkable how tightly Holmes clung to her original story, and people who knew her said they doubt she has changed. Since the trial, Holmes has been living in California with partner William ""Billy"" Evans, 27, an heir to the Evans Hotel Group. They had a son in July 2021 and she is pregnant with their second child. Holmes's attorneys had said she should not face prison time on the grounds that she was not a danger to society. They offered testimony from more than 130 people on her behalf, including Senator Cory Booker. But prosecutors argued that she was ""blinded"" by ambition, which put ""and will continue to put people in harm's way"". ""She accepts no responsibility,"" they wrote in court filings. ""Quite the opposite, she insists she is the victim.""

Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes guilty of fraudThe Silicon Valley ex-CEO faces up to 80 years in prison for her failed blood testing technology.US & Canada,"Holmes (centre) remains on bail before sentencing at a later date Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been convicted of defrauding investors after a months-long landmark trial in California. Prosecutors said Holmes knowingly lied about technology she said could detect diseases with a few drops of blood. Jurors found Holmes guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud against investors and three charges of wire fraud. She denied the charges, which carry a maximum prison term of 20 years each. Holmes was not taken into custody, with no date confirmed yet for sentencing and a further hearing scheduled next week. Journalists inside the courtroom said the 37-year-old, who gave birth to her first child last year, showed little emotion when the verdicts were read out, and hugged her husband, Billy Evans, and her parents before leaving the courtroom. Holmes faced 11 charges in total and was found not guilty of four charges relating to defrauding the public. The split verdict came after the judge said the jury, having deliberated for seven days, could deliver a partial verdict after being unable to reach consensus on another three counts. The three wire fraud charges she was found guilty of are tied to specific investors in her failed company. Wire fraud is a relatively wide-ranging federal crime in the US, which involves using electronic communications, such as emails, to make false statements to get something from another person - usually money. Theranos, at one point valued at $9bn (Â£6.5bn), was once the darling of biotech and Silicon Valley. Holmes was able to raise more than $900m from billionaires such as media magnate Rupert Murdoch and tech mogul Larry Ellison. The firm promised it would revolutionise the healthcare industry with a test that could detect conditions such as cancer and diabetes with only a few drops of blood. But these claims began to unravel in 2015 after a Wall Street Journal investigation reported that its core blood-testing technology did not work. For nearly four months at trial, the jury of eight men and four women were presented with two starkly different accounts of the former self-made billionaire, whose downfall shook Silicon Valley. PROFILE:The boss accused of duping Silicon Valley CONTEXT:Has the Theranos scandal changed Silicon Valley? Calling some 30 witnesses, the prosecution sought to prove that Holmes knew the product she was selling to investors - a machine called the Edison - was a sham, but remained hell-bent on the firm's success. Her company secretly relied on commercially available machines to run the tests, prosecutors said. At trial, multiple lab directors testified to telling Holmes about the flaws in Theranos' technology but being instructed to downplay their concerns. At the same time, they added , Holmes told investors the technology was operating as planned. Holmes ""chose fraud over business failure. She chose to be dishonest with investors and patients"", said prosecutor Jeff Schenk in closing arguments. ""That choice was not only callous, it was criminal."" The defence countered with descriptions of a dedicated and driven businesswoman, making waves in a male-dominated industry. This video can not be played The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes Testifying in her own defence, Holmes acknowledged mistakes in Theranos' operation, butmaintained she never knowingly defrauded patients or investors. The defence also laid blame on Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, her former business partner and ex-boyfriend. At trial Holmes accused Mr Balwani, 19 years her senior, of emotional and sexual abuse - allegations he denies. Elizabeth Holmes claimed her diagnostics machines could test hundreds of diseases. They couldn't. Considering she was the founder and CEO of Theranos you might think the case would be an easy win for the prosecution. But for a number of reasons the guilty verdicts were by no means assured. These technical fraud cases are extremely difficult to prosecute. Jurors were asked to consider hundreds of documents and sit through evidence from dozens of witnesses. Holmes has just had a baby and some commentators believed she would strike a sympathetic character. The difficulty in successfully prosecuting Holmes is reflected in the verdicts - a real mixed bag of decisions from the jury. But considering how difficult white-collar fraud cases are to prosecute, the government will be happy with what stuck. Her former partner, Sunny Balwani, will now face trial next month in the same court for similar charges. It's likely Holmes will not be sentenced until after that case has concluded. The verdict sends a clear and frank message to Silicon Valley founders - there are consequences when you say things to investors that aren't true. US Attorney Stephanie Hinds thanked the jurors who, she said, had navigated a ""complex case"" over 15 weeks to reach their verdict. ""The guilty verdicts, in this case, reflect Ms Holmes' culpability in this large-scale investor fraud and she must now face sentencing for her crimes,"" the prosecutor said in a statement read out by an assistant. Holmes was dubbed the ""next Steve Jobs"" by Inc. magazine, trumpeted by Forbes as being ""the world's youngest self-made female billionaire"", and featured in Time magazine's coveted list of the most influential people in 2015. She founded Theranos as a teenager, shortly after dropping out of chemical engineering at Stanford University. The firm officially ceased operations in 2018 following the scandal.

"Cinema flouted court ban to show conspiracy filmCinema & Co was ordered to close after breaking Covid rules, but showed a film by David Icke's son.Wales","Anna Redfern was served with a council closure notice on 18 November A cinema that was ordered to close after breaking Covid rules flouted the ban to premiere a film by the son of conspiracy theorist David Icke. Swansea's Cinema & Co was ordered to shut by a judge after boss Anna Redfernbreached several Covid regulations. Redfern, 45, was also fined Â£15,000 andgiven a suspended prison sentence for contempt of court. But she admitted showing a film making serious unfounded allegations against the NHS after the first court order. Directed and produced by Mr Icke's son Jaymie, it makes several baseless accusations against NHS doctors and nurses, including that they are deliberately killing elderly people in hospitals in order to ""boost the numbers"" of people dying of Covid. The film was described as ""completely false"", ""pernicious"" and ""dangerous"" by the head of research for theCenter for Countering Digital Hate,external(CCDH). Redfern told BBC Wales: ""If the BBC has any concerns regarding the content of the documentary's premiere we screened A Good Death? I suggest that they discuss them with the production company. ""Firstly, Cinema & Co does not practise censorship. ""Secondly, caring for my mother at the end of her life and reflecting upon my own mortality, I have given a great deal of consideration as to what constitutes a 'good death' and found the film very thought provoking."" After this article was first published, the film's director Jaymie Icke contacted BBC Wales to defend the film's content. How my mum became a conspiracy theory influencer How Covid and climate misinformation spread in 2021 David Icke is infamous for his belief that he is the son of God and that the Royal family are shape-shifting lizards. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube suspended his accounts in 2020for posting misleading claims about the pandemic. Facebook said David Icke's official account published ""health misinformation that could cause physical harm"" Before the second court hearing, which ended with her narrowly avoiding Christmas behind bars, Redfern was interviewed by another of Mr Icke's sons, Gareth, on his video streaming service, and said it would be a ""pleasure"" to host the premiere of the ""eye-opening"" film and that she was doing it to ""disseminate real information"". This video can not be played Cinema owner told to close for not requiring Covid passes said the scheme was discriminatory After receiving a court order to close,the cinema reopened on 1 Decemberfor a festive screening of Santa Claus: The Movie. Four nights later, it hosted the ""world premiere"" of the Icke family's conspiracy film. The cinema's media spokeswoman, Jacquelyn Haley, who was at the screening, has shared articles on her Twitter and Facebook accounts - alleging with no evidence - that Covid is caused by 5G phone signals, vaccines have caused more deaths than the virus, and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is responsible for murder due to ""deaths caused by the vaccines"". She also said that if parents allowed their children to be vaccinated then ""you don't deserve your children"". In a video taken at the cinema after the film aired, Ms Haley implored people to ""watch the film and share it far and wide"". The cinema opened a day after a judge ordered it to close Also present at the screening was Wesley Garner, from Morriston, Swansea, who was one of three people fined more than Â£2,000 earlier this year for travelling to Liverpool during lockdown to heckle staff at a school for getting tested for Covid. On his public Facebook page, Mr Garner makes unfounded claims that ""there is no pandemic"", that the vaccine is made of ""5G"" phone signals, and has compared the vaccine roll out to ""genocide"". In a Facebook video filmed and broadcast live from the cinema by Mr Garner, Redfern is seen serving customers while Jaymie Icke explains their ""truth movement"" had been ""crying out"" for people like the Swansea businesswoman who ""refused to back down"". The following week, however, Redfern admitted being in contempt of court and promised the judge her ""stand"" was at an end and that she would comply with the local authority. Callum Hood, head of research at CCDH, said: ""What is really dangerous about the film that the Icke brothers have put together and put on at this cinema in Swansea is that it is painting hardworking NHS doctors and nurses as deliberately setting out to murder patients strictly in order to push up the numbers of the Covid pandemic, which is a complete reversal of what's actually going on in the NHS."" Mr Hood is an expert on the Icke family, having studied David Icke's behaviour for decades. ""I think this is a fairly typical piece of conspiracy theory propaganda about Covid, in that it took real moving stories about people who've lost loved ones during the pandemic, but then tried to turn it to the purpose of conspiracy theories by claiming that they have been deliberately killed in order to push up the numbers of people dying with Covid,"" he said. ""That was what was particularly pernicious and dangerous about it."" Redfern has received more than Â£61,000 in donations since she first received a closure notice after a crowdfunding page was set up by former Brexit Party and Abolish the Welsh Assembly candidate Richard Taylor. Redfern told the BBC she intended to use the funds to ""educate and empower others to claim their universally declared human rights back"" and to take her family on holiday, while the rest would be spent on activities such as ""free film screenings for all schools living in poverty"". At the latest hearing, Redfern's barrister Jonathan Gwyn Mendus Edwards told the court his client did not run the business for profit and was living off Â£30,000 in savings. District Judge Neale Thomas said he was ""sceptical"" of this claim. In May 2019, Cinema & Co went into insolvent liquidation and Companies House records show Redfern then incorporated a new company at the same address named ""Cinema & Go Ltd"". Swansea council said last month that the cinema had also received more than Â£52,000 in Covid-related grants since the start of the pandemic. Officers are assessing whether any of the grant conditions have been breached and ""whether any of the grants should be recovered"". On her public Facebook page, Redfern has previously shared anti-vaccine content, including one post which made unfounded claims that children were being ""coerced"" into being injected with 'an experimental vaccine"", and that children had a ""100% chance of surviving Covid-19"". Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show that up to 10 December there have been two deaths involving Covid in children under 14 - a boy and a girl - out of 9,102 in Wales. There is no evidence that vaccines have contributed to any death in Wales. Cinema refuses to follow law on Covid passes Cinema owner defiant over Covid pass refusal.

Is another storm brewing in Silicon Valley?,"For years Elizabeth Holmes was the darling of Silicon Valley, a woman that could do no wrong. The start-up she founded, Theranos, attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in investments. Yet the company she had built was based on fantasy science. The technology Theranos was producing - supposedly testing for hundreds of diseases with a pin prick of blood - seemed incredible. And it was. Millions of dollars were squandered and some who used the company's tests, including a cancer patient, say they were misdiagnosed. Now, years after Theranos collapsed,Holmes has been found guilty in California on four counts of conspiring to defraud investors. For an outsider to Silicon Valley the story sounds nonsensical. How were so many people taken in? Yet in Silicon Valley, many believe that Theranos - far from being an aberration - speaks of systemic problems with start-up culture. In Silicon Valley, hyping up your product - over-promising - isn't unusual, and Holmes was clearly very good at it. A Stanford University drop-out, she was, by all accounts articulate, confident and good at presenting a vision - a mission as she described it - to revolutionise diagnostics. Sceptical experts told her that her idea was just that - an idea - and wouldn't work. But she projected an unfaltering confidence that the technology would change the world. PROFILE - Who is Elizabeth Holmes? ""It's baked in to the culture"" said Margaret O'Mara, author of The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America. ""If you are a young start-up in development - with a barely existent product - a certain amount of swagger and hustle is expected and encouraged"" she said. Particularly at an early stage, when a start-up is in its infancy, investors are often looking at people and ideas rather than substantive technology anyway. General wisdom holds that the technology will come with the right concept - and the right people to make it work. Ms Holmes was brilliant at selling that dream, exercising a very Silicon Valley practice: 'fake it until you make it'. Her problem was she couldn't make it work. Her lawyers argued that Holmes was merely a businesswoman who failed, but was not a fraudster. The problem in Silicon Valley is that the line between fraud and merely playing into the faking it culture is very thin. ""Theranos was an early warning of a cultural shift in Silicon Valley that has allowed promoters and scoundrels to prosper,"" said tech venture capitalist Roger McNamee, who is critical of big tech and did not invest in Theranos. He believes that a culture of secrets and lies in Silicon Valley, a culture that allowed Theranos' tech to go un-analysed, is ""absolutely endemic"". Ambition can be good. Promising a brighter future, and then trying to realise that vision, brought about computers and smartphones. But for investors, trying to separate the charlatans from the revolutionaries is a constantly evolving challenge. Last August, Silicon Valley phone app start-up HeadSpin's CEO and founder, Manish Lachwani, was arrested forallegedly defrauding investors,external. For people putting money on the line, there are great fortunes to be made and lost. Silicon Valley In Silicon Valley intellectual property is closely guarded. The 'coke' recipe, the secret sauce, is often the thing that gives a company value, and new technology firms are particularly sensitive to having their ideas copied or stolen. Secrecy is important for these companies to succeed - but that culture of secrecy can also be used as a smoke screen, particularly when even employees and investors don't understand or aren't given access to the technology itself. This is what happened at Theranos. Journalists, investors, politicians, you name it, were all told the science was there. Yet when questions were asked they were told the technology was so secret that it could not be fully explained, analysed or tested. Walgreens, a major client of Theranos, became exasperated with the lack of information given by the company about how the system worked. There are many Silicon Valley companies I've reported on that will not fully explain how their tech actually works. They claim to have ""proprietary"" systems that cannot yet be revealed or peer-reviewed. The system is based on trust, yet it is fundamentally at odds with a culture of ""faking it"" and creates the perfect environment for Thernanos-type scandals, where claims that aren't true are left unchallenged. A system that places so much emphasis on secrecy needs lawyers, and lots of them. Companies don't want their employees running off with ideas. Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are endemic in the start-up world - and by no means confined to tech. But Silicon Valley's culture of secrecy makes it notably difficult for whistle-blowers. After the company's collapse, former Theranos employees spoke of intense pressure to withdraw negative public remarks or stay quiet altogether. The company hired aggressive, expensive and very active lawyers to protect Theranos's reputation. This is not uncommon in Silicon Valley, says Cori Crider from Foxglove, a group that helps whistle-blowers come forward. ""I spent more than a decade working in national security and I very often feel like Silicon Valley types play from the playbook of the CIA on this stuff"", she said. ""They have managed to scare people and make them think they don't have the right to raise legitimate issues."" If founders and chief executives aren't being honest, employees need to feel comfortable raising the alarm. All too often they don't. Rupert Murdoch invested in Theranos Amid the hype, it can be easy to forget that many investors looked at Theranos and passed - especially those with a knowledge of healthcare. Among those who were notable investors were people and groups without expertise in health, such as the media mogul Rupert Murdoch. For these investors with capital, often their decision to put in a stake assumes that smaller early stage funders have done their homework on the tech. ""They're kind of taking third party validation at its word,"" said Ms O'Mara. Once again, it's a system based on trust - later investors trusting that earlier ones know what they're doing. The problem here is, with so much money sloshing around, that is not a given. In the end, Theranos got caught. As a health technology company doing real life diagnostics, results and regulators would eventually prove it real or fake. But with many Silicon Valley companies selling the supposedly new and the cutting edge in fields far less tightly regulated, scrutiny is more lax. Today, the 'fake it until you make it' culture is still alive and well - as is the repressive culture of secrecy and the aggressive use of NDAs for employees.  It's a model that has its advantages - and helps churn out extremely valuable and sometimes innovative companies. But it also means the ingredients are still in place for another Theranos scandal.

Cigarettes for cabbage: Xi'an residents trade food,"Some have shared videos on social media of them swapping cigarettes for cabbage, and a Nintendo Switch for instant noodles and steamed buns People quarantined in the Chinese city of Xi'an are bartering supplies amid continuing worries over food shortages. Social posts show locals swapping cigarettes and tech gadgets for food. About 13 million have been confined to their homes since 23 December. The strict measures come ahead of the Lunar New Year and the Winter Olympics due to be held in Beijing next month. Overnight, the city of Yuzhou was shut down after the discovery of just three cases, all of them asymptomatic. Yuzhou, with a population of 1.1 million, has closed its transport system and entertainment venues and banned almost all vehicles from the roads. All but essential food shops are shut, with only workers involved in epidemic prevention allowed out. The outbreak in the much larger city to the west is the worst China has seen in months as it continues a ""zero Covid"" strategy, seeking to stamp out the virus rather than try to live with it. Authorities in Xi'an have been providing free food to households, but there have been numerous complaints on social media. Some residents saidtheir supplies were running lowor that they had yet to receive aid. Videos and photos on social media site Weibo showed people exchanging cigarettes for cabbage, dishwashing liquid for apples, and sanitary pads for a small pile of vegetables. One video showed a resident appearing to trade his Nintendo Switch console for a packet of instant noodles and two steamed buns. Authorities have been providing free food to households, but some have said their supplies are running low ""People are swapping stuff with others in the same building, because they no longer have enough food to eat,"" a resident surnamedWang told Radio Free Asia,external. The news outlet also reported that another man had wanted to trade a smartphone and tablet for rice. ""Helpless citizens have arrived at the era of bartering - potatoes are exchanged for cotton swabs,"" one Weibo user said, while another described it as a ""return to primitive society"". Some were more optimistic though, and commented on how ""touched"" they were by their neighbours' kindness in sharing their supplies with them. Xi'an is at the epicentre of China's current Covid outbreak, and local authorities have enacted drastic measures which have attracted significant criticism online. In a recent incident, residents in the Mingde 8 Yingli housing compound in the south of the city werereportedly told just after midnight on 1 Januarythat they had to leave their homes and go to quarantine facilities. Netizens were also shocked by an unverified post that went viral on Monday. A Xi'an resident said their father had died after he suffered a heart attack and was turned away from a hospital due to the city's Covid situation. The hospital has yet to respond. Covid first appeared in China and up until a few weeks ago the government had managed to contain it to such a level that new cases were negligible and mainly coming from people arriving from abroad. What Beijing calls its ""dynamic zero Covid"" strategy combines mass vaccination with a regime of constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps to prove you don't pose a threat. All of that amounts to hyper vigilance about any new outbreak - if and when one is spotted the reaction is severe. China has been wedded to this approach since the beginning because it's likely the leaders from Xi Jinping down consider anything less would cause illness and death on a scale that would be politically, economically and socially unacceptable. The ruling Communist Party took much of the credit for containing the virus early on - after it had spread beyond China's borders - and diverting from that would undermine its credibility. There is a broad acceptance of this approach, and the stringent restrictions it can bring, among many Chinese who for decades have not felt they can rely much on the public health system. So illness and the prospect of losing your job, let alone your life, are existentially daunting. Add to that the prestige attached to - safely - hosting another Olympic Games in a few weeks' time and the fast approaching Chinese New Year mass migration of millions across this country and there is clearly little doubt the government will remain committed to ""zero Covid"" for the foreseeable future.

Murder victim's family's anger over 'intimidation'A fresh appeal is made for information about the murder of Glenn Quinn in Carrickfergus in January 2020.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Glenn Quinn's family believe the South Antrim UDA murdered the Carrickfergus man The family of a terminally ill man murdered in County Antrim two years ago believe people have been intimidated from passing information to police. Glenn Quinn, 47, was beaten to death at his Ashleigh Park home in Carrickfergus on 4 January 2020. His family believe he was murdered by South East Antrim UDA after he spoke out against an attack on a friend's business. Mr Quinn had no connections to any crime. His murder remains unsolved. As a renewed appeal is made for information, Mr Quinn's mother Ellen Quinn said people know who was responsible for her son's murder but are not coming forward. ""A lot of people have been threatened that if they give information to police they would be sorted out,"" she added. ""Glenn didn't deserve what he gotâ¦ they just hammered him and beat him so badly. ""They shouldn't be walking the streets of Carrickfergus."" Glenn Quinn's death in 2020 shocked the town of Carrickfergus and beyond Mr Quinn's sister, Lesley Murphy, said: ""We know members of South East Antrim UDA murdered my brother. ""And they have then used that organisation's name to instil fear in us and witnesses. ""They thrive on intimidation and fear and that is what they use against people to keep them in line. ""Communities shouldn't have to live like that."" Mr Quinn was suffering from a blood condition when he moved into a flat in Carrickfergus just weeks before Christmas 2019. The police say the involvement of South East Antrim UDA in Mr Quinn's murder is a line of inquiry. He was initially attacked by a gang of men in the communal hallway outside his apartment block. Mr Quinn's sister and mother believe he was murdered by South East Antrim UDA after he spoke out against an attack on a friend's business Ms Murphy said her brother ""had injuries from his feet to the top of his head"". ""Almost every part of his body was injured,"" she added ""They showed him no mercy."" This video can not be played 'Next time it might be your son' The gang is a standalone faction of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Formed in 1971 from a number of loyalist vigilante groups, the UDA's stated aims were to protect unionist communities from attacks by republican paramilitaries, but it went on to kill hundreds of people during the Troubles using a cover name - the Ulster Freedom Fighters. The UDA was only proscribed, or declared illegal, in 1992 and, as the Troubles ended, the group began to fracture. The South East Antrim UDA is one of Northern Ireland's largest paramilitary gangs. According to aMI5-police intelligence assessment shared with BBC's Spotlight programmelast year, the gang ""has access to arms"" and is ""heavily involved in drugs supply, community coercion, intimidation and other criminality"". Last year,Spotlight reported the group was believed to have more than 2,000 members. Former PSNI superintendent Ken Pennington said he considers them to be ""a criminal cartel that have wrapped themselves in a flag"". Police have blamed a number of high-profile drug seizures in Carrickfergus and neighbouring areas to the group. Glenn Quinn's body was found in Ashleigh Park in the Woodburn area of Carrickfergus on 4 January 2020 Det Ch Insp Neil McGuinness believes the Carrickfergus community holds the answers to move the police investigation forward. ""I do believe there are people who are not telling us information, not because they don't want to see justice for Glenn but because they're frightened,"" he said. There is now a renewed appeal for information that could help police solve the murder. 'Break the silence about who killed my brother' Family appeal for information about paramilitary murder ""We're at the point now where we need people to come forward and help us out,"" Det Ch Insp McGuinness added. ""I'm begging the people of Carrickfergus to come forward by whatever means necessary and give me the information."" Police have said they will accept information anonymously through the Crimestoppers charity or via intermediators such as politicians. Det Ch Insp McGuinness said Mr Quinn had ""suffered a death at the hands of individuals who are probably still in the community and I want to bring them before the courts"". A reward of Â£10,000 has been offered by Crimestoppers for anyone who passes on information that leads to the conviction of those responsible for Mr Quinn's murder.

"Channel migrant numbers trebled in 2021The Home Office is âreformingâ its approach to asylum, following 28,400 people crossing the Channel.Kent","A record 28,431 migrants made the journey across the English Channel last year The number of people who crossed the English Channel in small boats last year was treble the number for 2020. Figures compiled by the BBC show at least 28,431 migrants made the journey in 2021, despite huge UK investment in France to prevent crossings. A Home Office minister said the government was ""reforming"" its approach and introducing tougher asylum rules. Refugee charities said the ""dangerous and callous policy"" would lead to more arrivals and drownings. Clare Moseley, founder of charity Care4Calais, which supports refugees living in northern France, said rising numbers of small boat arrivals reflect a shift away from attempts to cross by lorry. She said: ""They are some of the most vulnerable people in the world, having lost family members in bloody conflicts, suffered horrific torture and inhumane persecution. ""The Government tells us that people should travel by legal means, but if this were truly possible why would so many be risking their lives in flimsy boats?"" In 2020, a total of 8,417 people crossed the Channel in small boats. Last year's record number - an increase of about 20,000 - saw arrivals peak in November when, despite falling temperatures, at least 6,869 people reached the UK. The first migrants to arrive in 2022 were brought ashore at Dover on Tuesday morning. The Home Office said 66 people arrived in two small boats, while the French authorities stopped 38 people trying to cross in a single boat. A family with a baby are believed to be among the first to migrants to cross the Channel in 2022 On 24 November at least27 people died as their boat sank. The same month saw a new record for a single day, when1,185 people reached British shores aboard 33 boats. In 2020 the most arrivals on a single day was 416, set in September. Border Force has seen a sharp increase in the number and size of small boats making the crossing The government said its new Nationality and Borders Bill would make it a criminal offence to enter the UK illegally and it would introduce life sentences for people-smugglers. Home Office minister Tom Pursglove said the government was ""making the tough decisions to end the overt exploitation of our laws"". He continued: ""The sooner the House of Lords approves the Nationality and Borders Bill, the sooner these reforms will be delivered."" However, the chief executive at Refugee Action, Tim Naor Hilton, said he believed tougher measures would not deter people from making these journeys, and smugglers would continue to profit ""unless ministers open up more routes for refugees to claim asylum"". He said: ""The government wants to legalise this dangerous and callous policy in its Anti-Refugee Bill, which will only lead to more people drowning."" ""It must wake up and scrap this bill now.""

Apple becomes first firm to hit $3tn market valueThe firm's value more than doubled during the pandemic as people bought more gadgets during lockdowns.,"US technology giant Apple has become the first company to hit a stock market valuation of $3tn (Â£2.2tn). The firm's share price has risen by around 5,800% since co-founder and former chief executive Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone in 2007. However, its value slipped a little from that milestone, to end Monday's trading session in New York at $2.99tn. Apple has been one of the big winners of the pandemic, as coronavirus lockdowns saw spending on gadgets jump. ""Hitting $3 trillion is another historical moment for Apple as the company continues to prove the doubters wrong,"" Dan Ives, an analyst from Wedbush said. It took just over 16 months for Apple's stock market valuation to rise from $2tn to $3tn, as the world's biggest technology companies saw demand soar as people became more reliant on smartphones, tablets and laptops during lockdowns. The company became the first company to hit astock market valuation of $1tnin August 2018. The iPhone typically accounts for around half of the company's sales, while it is also well-known for its iPad tablets and Mac computers. Increasingly important parts of the business are software, sold through the Apple store, storage space via the iCloud and services such as its music, television and fitness subscription platforms. ""The linchpin to Apple's valuation re-rating remains its Services business which we believe is worth $1.5 trillion,"" Mr Ives said. In August, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook received more than five million shares in the firm, as he marked ten years in the job. A company filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed that he sold most of the shares for more than $750m. It was part of a deal he struck when he took over from co-founder Steve Jobs. The award was dependent upon on how well Apple's shares had performed compared to other firms on the S&P 500 stock index. Cupertino, California-based Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and his business partners Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. The company made its stock market debut in 1980 with a market valuation of $1.8bn. In November, theoriginal Apple computerbuilt by Mr Wozniak and Mr Jobs fetched $400,000 at auction in the US.

The page was edited by James Clarke, Chris Clayton and Kevin Ponniah. Do join us again tomorrow. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Under England's guidelines, a school must get in touch with public health officials if five pupils, teachers or staff in close contact test positive for Covid in a 10-day period. Then school management must work with local health officials to mitigate the spread of disease. Measures include:  For more information, head to ourback to school explainer. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Earlier today we were at a school in Stoke-on-Trent where pupils told us how they felt about wearing masks in classrooms. Kaitlin, a year 11 pupil, says she finds wearing a mask ""makes learning more difficult because you canât really tell facial expressions"". ""But at the same time everyoneâs main priority is the safety of each other and protecting everyone. So you have to outweigh the negatives and realise itâs for the greater good,"" she adds. Kian, who is also coming up to his GCSEs, says he finds it ""stressful"" being in a classroom with glasses and a mask on. ""My glasses steam up a lot and I canât see the board. Itâs just a bit stressful because the mask is always on my face and I canât really breathe,"" he says. ""But the positive side is that itâs helping people to stay safe."" Sam thinks it's important that face-to-face teaching continues. ""You canât get the same effect online as in the classroom, with the teachers there for support and technical issues as well,"" he says. King Carl XVI Gustaf (R) and Queen Silvia will isolate for a week And in Sweden which is also reporting record numbers of cases, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia have tested positive for coronavirus and have mild symptoms, the palace says. The royal couple, who are aged 75 and 78 respectively, are isolating at the palace in Drottningholm near the capital Stockholm, according to information officer Daniel Urso. In a statement, the palace says they have both had three doses of Covid vaccine and are feeling well under the circumstances. Other members of the royal family contracted coronavirus earlier on in the pandemic. The king and queen met their children and grandchildren over Christmas and tested positive on Monday evening as a routine measure because of Sweden's high Covid infection rates. A record 11,507 cases were reported on 30 December alone and a total of 42,969 infections over the holiday weekend, according to figures from Sweden's public health agency on Tuesday.  The UK is not alone in facing a surge of cases from the Omicron variant. On Tuesday, 271,686 Covid cases were reported by French health authorities, the country's highest tally on record. Another 293 deaths were also recorded. During the press conference, Prof Sir Chris Whitty warned of rising hospital
admission rates in older age groups who are the most vulnerable to becoming ill
with Omicron. The latest data on whoâs going into hospital with Covid in
England shows a steep rise in the over 85s, and a more gentle increase in
people aged 65-84. These groups are most at risk from Covid and if lots of
people are infected â as they are now â then these older age groups are more
likely to contract the virus. They can then end up needing hospital treatment, despite
protection from two vaccines and a booster. Raw admission numbers show there are more people aged 18-64
in hospital with Covid than any other age group, mainly because they make up
the bulk of the population. Children are not being admitted to hospital in large numbers
because of this variant of Covid, although more children are always unwell for
different reasons in winter. One of the key announcements in that press conference from the prime minister was that from next week daily tests will be made available for essential workers in certain industries. Watch what Boris Johnson had to say: This video can not be played PM announces daily tests for essential workers Helen CattPolitical correspondent This feels like the closest the prime minister has come to saying there won't be another lockdown, or even more restrictions, without completely ruling it out. He was clear that he doesn't think such hefty measures are likely to be justified by the Omicron variant, as it stands. It's also pretty clear though that ""riding out"" the Omicron wave has the potential to be a rough experience for everyday services and, particularly, for the NHS. With the other UK nations having chosen to go down the route of restrictions instead, the coming weeks will show whose balancing act has paid off. The UK PM's media
briefing has finished, so here's a reminder of the key things we just heard: The press conference is now over. The Evening Standard had the final questions for Sir Chris and Sir Patrick. Sir Patrick said there was no evidence that Omicron had peaked in London. While rates were flattening in younger age groups - that's not true in older age groups, he said, as we heard earlier. ""It would be very wrong to suggest there's a peak which means it's all over in London,"" said Sir Patrick. Asked what his message would be for people in London returning to pubs and clubs, Sir Chris said that until we've had the peak in the most vulnerable, any measures that slow it down are beneficial and reduce the height of the wave. He added that people had been incredibly responsive - but there remained a need to still be very careful to work from home and to prioritise events. The Sun asks when people will need to have had a booster jab to use vaccine certification. Currently people have to show evidence of two jabs (or a negative lateral flow test) - but ministers have said this will eventually change to require people to have had a third. Boris Johnson does not say when the change will take place, but pledges people will be given ""plenty of time"" before the change is made. But he suggests it will be ""very much to people's advantage"" to get a booster if they want to travel, as other countries are likely to change their rules to require three jabs. The next question comes from the Guardian. Boris Johnson says he won't provide a definition. He thinks different trusts will feel overwhelmed at different moments - and refers to some of those NHS trusts that have already declared incidents. It's people in the hospital, the pressure on A&Es, the ambulances arriving - that's the pressure, he says. He goes on to repeat that there will be a difficult period for the NHS because of Omicron - and we have to get through it as best we can. Repeating another earlier message, he says that in the meantime people have to follow the guidance and get jabbed. Pressed on the availability of high-grade masks and tests for healthcare staff, Johnson says the government is doing ""everything we can"" to ensure staff have what they need. Asked about vaccination, he says it is ""absolutely crazy"" and ""sad"" that there are slots available for booster jabs when most people in intensive care are unjabbed. Asked whether he is frustrated about the number of unvaccinated patients in hospital, Chris Whitty says that he is ""rather saddened"" by it. But he says he is frustrated about vaccine misinformation, which he cites as a reason people are not getting jabbed, along with questions about the effectiveness and side effects of vaccines. Health professionals should be answering these questions, he adds. A question now from ITV for Boris Johnson. He says the NHS is under a lot of pressure, but he's confident it can get through it - and the government will be supporting it in any way it can. He adds we need to remember lockdowns and further restrictions are not cost-free for lives, livelihoods and can have long-term consequences. Omicron is causing lots of hospital admissions, he says, but again stresses that it is resulting in fewer people needing intensive care and less mortality than we've seen from other variants. ""That's why we think this balanced approach is the right one,"" he says. The panel are asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how likely further restrictions are in England and what the threshold for extra curbs would be. Boris Johnson says it depends on whether the Omicron wave mirrors what happened in South Africa - and the government ""can't rule anything out"". But he says there is a currently a ""good chance of getting through the Omicron wave"" without the need for new rules. Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, says pressure on intensive care units is likely to be lower than previous waves but there will still be substantial pressures on A&E departments. Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, says hospitalisations, staff absences and the robustness of testing infrastructure will be key indicators in the coming weeks. A question now from the public for Sir Chris Whitty about what tests should be taken after someone tests positive for Covid. Whitty says the lateral flow tests are a good guide as to whether people are infectious - and they are confident that people who test negative on day six and seven of a period of self-isolation are much less likely to be infectious. He goes on to explain that the PCR tests can remain positive for a long time after someone has had the infection, including beyond the point that they are infectious. There's a question from a member of the public, who asks what number of cases or hospitalisations would justify further restrictions in England. Boris Johnson does not give an answer, saying simply that the current ""balance of measures"" is the ""right approach to take"". But he says the government will continue to monitor the data, and again urges people to come forward for their booster jabs. Sir Chris talks now about how London is in advance of the rest of the UK, saying the number of hospitalisations is still going up. He says it looks as if numbers in younger adults are levelling off but the  rates in older people look as if they are still going up. He says the thing that's likely to reduce that is people getting their booster jabs. Sir Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, talks through the government's slides, saying there's been a substantial increase in cases over the last few weeks. He says about one in 25 people in England had Covid in the last week of data from the ONS - about two million people in total. The expectation is that number will go up, he says. Boris Johnson says the NHS will be put on a ""war footing"" but he will be recommending to the cabinet that the current - plan B - level of restrictions for England remains in place. Adding that 90% of Covid patients in intensive care beds are unvaccinated, he urges people to come forward and get their booster jabs. Â© 2025 BBC.

More Covid absences expected as UK schools return,"Pupils at a Stoke-on-Trent school were among those returning to school who could head into class only if their result was negative Pupils in England have been taking Covid tests before heading into class, as schools reopen to a different set of rules following the Christmas break. More Covid-related staff and pupil absences are expected this term. Teaching unions say it is likely some classes and year groups will be sent home to learn remotely at times because of staff shortages. But Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi insists face-to-face teaching will remain the norm. He emailed England's schools earlier this week to spell out the new measures and suggested classes could be merged and taught together where absences could not be covered. But Dr Mary Bousted, joint-general secretary of the National Education Union, expressed reservations about the idea. She said: ""Collapsing classes will mix groups of pupils and risks providing the conditions for the virus to spread more rapidly, which will result in greater pupil and staff absence."" Across the UK, staff and secondary pupils are being urged to test themselves regularly, but under the new measures, pupils in England must have their first Covid test in school, while elsewhere, pre-term testing takes place at home. One pupil at a school in Stoke-on-Trent, who had turned up early to a temporary testing station in the school hall, told BBC Breakfast she was glad to be back in school. The Stoke pupils took tests at numbered tables They were asked to wait in a separate room for their test results Another said he was ""pretty nervous"" about forthcoming mock exams, noting that he had ""missed quite a big chunk of learning"". The pupils were asked to wait in a separate room for their results. If they were negative after 15 minutes, they could head into class. If not, they were asked to return home. Face masks to be worn in England's classrooms Will schools in the UK stay open this term? Classroom masks for no longer than needed - Zahawi Doubts that ex-teachers will return by January The government ruled on Sunday that pupils should wear masks in classrooms for the first three weeks of term, bringing England in line with other parts of the UK. It also pledged 7,000 air filters would be available to the 20,000-plus schools in England. Liberal Democrat Education spokeswoman Munira Wilson described the investment as ""pocket change"" compared with what was required to keep schools open. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who has backed mass-testing, said there could not be a return to bubbles or classes going home. On Monday, Mr Zahawi said the government had learned a ""painful lesson"" about the impact of previous school closures, which was why he and the prime minister were determined to keep schools open. Before last term ended, the education secretary appealed to former teachers to come out of retirement and sign up with teacher supply agencies to help cover staff absence. There has been a similar call to retired staff in Northern Ireland. However,supply agencies warnedthat it would take time to get those who responded to the call into classrooms. Tom Quinn said pupils sitting exams this year were his priority. Tom Quinn, chief executive of the Frank Field Education Trust, said the organisation had used up its yearly fund for supply teachers last term. ""The call to arms to have extra funding could help us butâ¦ we can't find supply teachers to come in,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We need high-quality professional teachers to come in to help children learn, and they're not there."" Mr Quinn was hopeful the trust would find the money, but Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said that posed its own challenges. ""If you're going to find that money, you would have to take it away from somewhere else,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Mr Barton has previously said that the likelihood of high levels of staff absence caused by the prevalence of the Omicron variant was the biggest problem. He warned: ""There is a possibility that this will mean that some classes and year groups have to be sent home for short periods of time to learn remotely."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said much of schools' planning depended on the results of teacher and staff testing. ""Only then will school leaders know who they have available and be able to properly plan."" Masks are now compulsory again in classrooms for secondary pupils in England Asked on BBC Breakfast whether she could say how many ex-teachers had come forward, Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup said: ""It's a matter of thousands of people."" On Sunday six trades unions representing teaching staff called for more government support to help keep schools Covid-safe. They want easily accessible funds to cover the cost of the temporary staff who are likely to be needed, support with the testing regime and exemption from Ofsted inspections so they can focus on safety. They warned national exams could be at risk if ""urgent and immediate action"" was not taken to minimise Covid-related disruption. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Omicron wave had not really hit schools before they shut for Christmas, and a rise in cases was now expected. ""We expect to now see quite high infection levels - of mild infection I should emphasise - in school-aged children,"" he said. There is a further push for staff and more young people to get vaccinated. The latest official survey of vaccination rates suggest half of households with children in Great Britain have had their Covid jabs. Louise, a mother of two from Cambridge, told Today on Tuesday that she had had not been able to get an appointment for a second jab for her 15-year-old until February. She also said there were no vaccination sites for 12-to-15-year-olds within 50 miles of her home. Are you a teacher or parent? How do you feel about the return to school?

LiveLiveConcern over teacher shortages as new term starts3 minutes ago,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson says this is a moment for utmost caution and anyone who thinks the battle with Covid is over is wrong At a Downing St briefing he says the weeks ahead will be challenging and again urges people to get their booster vaccinations But he adds that there is a ""good chance"" of getting through the Omicron wave without further restrictions It would not be ""tenable"" to give booster jabs every three to six months in the long-term, adds chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance The UK has recorded more than 200,000 coronavirus cases in a day for the first time But the figure of 218,724 is affected by a backlog in reporting from Wales and Northern Ireland over the New Year period From next week daily tests will be available for essential workers in some sectors such as food processing and the Border Force, the PM says Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says more children should have been vaccinated over the Christmas period to ensure schools can stay open Edited by James Clarke and Chris Clayton As we bring our live coverage to a close for another day, here's a recap of some of today's main stories from the UK and around the world:  Today's updates were written by Francesca Gillett, Marie Jackson, Alexandra Fouche, Doug Faulkner, Nathan Williams, James Harness and George Wright. The page was edited by James Clarke, Chris Clayton and Kevin Ponniah. Do join us again tomorrow. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Under England's guidelines, a school must get in touch with public health officials if five pupils, teachers or staff in close contact test positive for Covid in a 10-day period. Then school management must work with local health officials to mitigate the spread of disease. Measures include:  For more information, head to ourback to school explainer. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Earlier today we were at a school in Stoke-on-Trent where pupils told us how they felt about wearing masks in classrooms. Kaitlin, a year 11 pupil, says she finds wearing a mask ""makes learning more difficult because you canât really tell facial expressions"". ""But at the same time everyoneâs main priority is the safety of each other and protecting everyone. So you have to outweigh the negatives and realise itâs for the greater good,"" she adds. Kian, who is also coming up to his GCSEs, says he finds it ""stressful"" being in a classroom with glasses and a mask on. ""My glasses steam up a lot and I canât see the board. Itâs just a bit stressful because the mask is always on my face and I canât really breathe,"" he says. ""But the positive side is that itâs helping people to stay safe."" Sam thinks it's important that face-to-face teaching continues. ""You canât get the same effect online as in the classroom, with the teachers there for support and technical issues as well,"" he says. King Carl XVI Gustaf (R) and Queen Silvia will isolate for a week And in Sweden which is also reporting record numbers of cases, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia have tested positive for coronavirus and have mild symptoms, the palace says. The royal couple, who are aged 75 and 78 respectively, are isolating at the palace in Drottningholm near the capital Stockholm, according to information officer Daniel Urso. In a statement, the palace says they have both had three doses of Covid vaccine and are feeling well under the circumstances. Other members of the royal family contracted coronavirus earlier on in the pandemic. The king and queen met their children and grandchildren over Christmas and tested positive on Monday evening as a routine measure because of Sweden's high Covid infection rates. A record 11,507 cases were reported on 30 December alone and a total of 42,969 infections over the holiday weekend, according to figures from Sweden's public health agency on Tuesday.  The UK is not alone in facing a surge of cases from the Omicron variant. On Tuesday, 271,686 Covid cases were reported by French health authorities, the country's highest tally on record. Another 293 deaths were also recorded. During the press conference, Prof Sir Chris Whitty warned of rising hospital
admission rates in older age groups who are the most vulnerable to becoming ill
with Omicron. The latest data on whoâs going into hospital with Covid in
England shows a steep rise in the over 85s, and a more gentle increase in
people aged 65-84. These groups are most at risk from Covid and if lots of
people are infected â as they are now â then these older age groups are more
likely to contract the virus. They can then end up needing hospital treatment, despite
protection from two vaccines and a booster. Raw admission numbers show there are more people aged 18-64
in hospital with Covid than any other age group, mainly because they make up
the bulk of the population. Children are not being admitted to hospital in large numbers
because of this variant of Covid, although more children are always unwell for
different reasons in winter. One of the key announcements in that press conference from the prime minister was that from next week daily tests will be made available for essential workers in certain industries. Watch what Boris Johnson had to say: This video can not be played PM announces daily tests for essential workers Helen CattPolitical correspondent This feels like the closest the prime minister has come to saying there won't be another lockdown, or even more restrictions, without completely ruling it out. He was clear that he doesn't think such hefty measures are likely to be justified by the Omicron variant, as it stands. It's also pretty clear though that ""riding out"" the Omicron wave has the potential to be a rough experience for everyday services and, particularly, for the NHS. With the other UK nations having chosen to go down the route of restrictions instead, the coming weeks will show whose balancing act has paid off. The UK PM's media
briefing has finished, so here's a reminder of the key things we just heard: The press conference is now over. The Evening Standard had the final questions for Sir Chris and Sir Patrick. Sir Patrick said there was no evidence that Omicron had peaked in London. While rates were flattening in younger age groups - that's not true in older age groups, he said, as we heard earlier. ""It would be very wrong to suggest there's a peak which means it's all over in London,"" said Sir Patrick. Asked what his message would be for people in London returning to pubs and clubs, Sir Chris said that until we've had the peak in the most vulnerable, any measures that slow it down are beneficial and reduce the height of the wave. He added that people had been incredibly responsive - but there remained a need to still be very careful to work from home and to prioritise events. The Sun asks when people will need to have had a booster jab to use vaccine certification. Currently people have to show evidence of two jabs (or a negative lateral flow test) - but ministers have said this will eventually change to require people to have had a third. Boris Johnson does not say when the change will take place, but pledges people will be given ""plenty of time"" before the change is made. But he suggests it will be ""very much to people's advantage"" to get a booster if they want to travel, as other countries are likely to change their rules to require three jabs. The next question comes from the Guardian. Boris Johnson says he won't provide a definition. He thinks different trusts will feel overwhelmed at different moments - and refers to some of those NHS trusts that have already declared incidents. It's people in the hospital, the pressure on A&Es, the ambulances arriving - that's the pressure, he says. He goes on to repeat that there will be a difficult period for the NHS because of Omicron - and we have to get through it as best we can. Repeating another earlier message, he says that in the meantime people have to follow the guidance and get jabbed. Pressed on the availability of high-grade masks and tests for healthcare staff, Johnson says the government is doing ""everything we can"" to ensure staff have what they need. Asked about vaccination, he says it is ""absolutely crazy"" and ""sad"" that there are slots available for booster jabs when most people in intensive care are unjabbed. Asked whether he is frustrated about the number of unvaccinated patients in hospital, Chris Whitty says that he is ""rather saddened"" by it. But he says he is frustrated about vaccine misinformation, which he cites as a reason people are not getting jabbed, along with questions about the effectiveness and side effects of vaccines. Health professionals should be answering these questions, he adds. A question now from ITV for Boris Johnson. He says the NHS is under a lot of pressure, but he's confident it can get through it - and the government will be supporting it in any way it can. He adds we need to remember lockdowns and further restrictions are not cost-free for lives, livelihoods and can have long-term consequences. Omicron is causing lots of hospital admissions, he says, but again stresses that it is resulting in fewer people needing intensive care and less mortality than we've seen from other variants. ""That's why we think this balanced approach is the right one,"" he says. The panel are asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how likely further restrictions are in England and what the threshold for extra curbs would be. Boris Johnson says it depends on whether the Omicron wave mirrors what happened in South Africa - and the government ""can't rule anything out"". But he says there is a currently a ""good chance of getting through the Omicron wave"" without the need for new rules.

"Bowie estate sells rights to entire body of workWarner Chappell Music say they are ""immensely proud"" to be ""chosen as caretakers"".","David Bowie, pictured in 1992, released 26 studio albums during his lifetime David Bowie's estate has sold the publishing rights to his ""entire body of work"" to Warner Chappell Music, including hundreds of songs such as Space Oddity, Changes and Let's Dance. WCM now has global music publishing rights to his song catalogue, the singer's estate told the BBC. Variety suggested,externalthe deal was worth ""upwards of $250m (Â£185m)"", but the terms of the agreement were not given. WCM head Guy Moot said they were ""proud"" to be ""chosen as caretakers"". Bowiedied of cancerin 2016. He was hailed as an extraordinary artist and genius in a huge global outpouring of tributes from fellow music stars, including Sir Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Brian Eno and Madonna among others. Bowie [L] performed Starman on Top of the Pops in 1972 The agreement with WCM includes the 26 studio albums released during Bowie's lifetime and the posthumous studio album release, Toy, plus the two studio albums from Tin Machine - the rock supergroup fronted by Bowie. Tracks released as singles from soundtracks and other projects are also included. Given the ups and downs of the music industry over the last 20 years, the appeal of a big cheque is, perhaps, unsurprising - especially for 'heritage' acts. Streaming may not quite have replaced the billions lost by the decline of the CD, but it is, for many established artists, proving to be a regular, and largely recession-proof, income stream; and for record labels and a number of new firms who have entered the market, this is, they think, a lucrative asset. With the music industry becoming ever more complicated, with licensing deals over streaming, adverts, films, video games and online video to negotiate, the artists - or their estates and families - have a large and hassle-free deposit in the bank, and the complicated job of turning music into money is left to the experts. With Spotify adding 60,000 songs to its catalogue every day, the chance of a new act making a splash seems tougher than ever - legacy artists with 50 years of fame and proven sales look like a relatively safe bet. Bowie released a total of 111 singles, averaging two per year during his career, and 51 music videos. This deal follows huge names, includingBruce Springsteen,Bob DylanandPaul Simon, recently selling the rights to their music catalogues. Moot, who is WCM's co-chairman and chief executive, said Bowie's was ""one of the most ground-breaking, influential, and enduring catalogues in music history"", adding he had ""inspired millions of fans and countless innovators, not only in music, but across all the arts, fashion, and media"". ""These are not only extraordinary songs, but milestones that have changed the course of modern music forever,"" he said. This video can not be played David Bowie: A life in lyrics He described Bowie's ""vision and creative genius"" driving him to ""push the envelope, lyrically and musically - writing songs that challenged convention, changed the conversation, and have become part of the canon of global culture"". The executive added they were looking forward to ""tending his unparalleled body of songs with passion and care"". WCM said the agreement followedlast year's announcement of a deal,externalbetween Bowie's estate and Warner Music Group [WMG], for it to oversee his full back catalogue of albums between 1968 and 1999. ""Warner Music has licensed worldwide rights to Bowie's recorded music catalogue from 1968. With this new deal with Warner Chappell, WMG is now home to Bowie's body of work as both a songwriter and recording artist,"" WCM added. 'Lost' David Bowie album set for birthday release Warner Chappell Music is the global music publishing company of Warner Music Group.

Bowie's innovation was not just in the recording studio and in front of the camera - he was also involved in the world of finance.

Bowie introduced the bonds in the late 1990s In 1997, Bowie sold asset-backed securities, dubbed ""Bowie bonds"", which awarded investors a share in his future royalties for 10 years. The securities, which were bought by US insurance giant Prudential Financial for $55m, committed him to repay his new creditors out of future income, and gave a fixed annual return of 7.9%.

Apple becomes first firm to hit $3tn market value,"US technology giant Apple has become the first company to hit a stock market valuation of $3tn (Â£2.2tn). The firm's share price has risen by around 5,800% since co-founder and former chief executive Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone in 2007. However, its value slipped a little from that milestone, to end Monday's trading session in New York at $2.99tn. Apple has been one of the big winners of the pandemic, as coronavirus lockdowns saw spending on gadgets jump. ""Hitting $3 trillion is another historical moment for Apple as the company continues to prove the doubters wrong,"" Dan Ives, an analyst from Wedbush said. It took just over 16 months for Apple's stock market valuation to rise from $2tn to $3tn, as the world's biggest technology companies saw demand soar as people became more reliant on smartphones, tablets and laptops during lockdowns. The company became the first company to hit astock market valuation of $1tnin August 2018. The iPhone typically accounts for around half of the company's sales, while it is also well-known for its iPad tablets and Mac computers. Increasingly important parts of the business are software, sold through the Apple store, storage space via the iCloud and services such as its music, television and fitness subscription platforms. ""The linchpin to Apple's valuation re-rating remains its Services business which we believe is worth $1.5 trillion,"" Mr Ives said. In August, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook received more than five million shares in the firm, as he marked ten years in the job. A company filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed that he sold most of the shares for more than $750m. It was part of a deal he struck when he took over from co-founder Steve Jobs. The award was dependent upon on how well Apple's shares had performed compared to other firms on the S&P 500 stock index. Cupertino, California-based Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and his business partners Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. The company made its stock market debut in 1980 with a market valuation of $1.8bn. In November, theoriginal Apple computerbuilt by Mr Wozniak and Mr Jobs fetched $400,000 at auction in the US.

UK steel future uncertain without US tariffs deal,"UK steel companies have been operating at a significant disadvantage compared to their European rivals since the beginning of 2022. The EU has done a deal with the US, which took effect on 1 January, to allow companies to export steel to the US again without any tariffs. The UK is yet to reach a similar agreement though it is hoping for more talks with America this month. It means British companies still face a 25% tariff on exports to the US. And the effect of the change is already being felt. At a foundry in Chesterfield, raw materials are being melted in a furnace to make cast iron bars. Steel and cast iron are no longer a huge chunk of the British economy but they are about to get a little bit smaller. Because of the US tariffs on products from the UK, United Cast Bar Limited (UCB), the company that runs this foundry, is moving some of its production to a factory in Spain. ""60% of the products we can make here we can also make in Spain,"" says James Brand, managing director of foundries at UCB. ""And our customers don't want that extra 25% cost."" UCB's James Brand says if it moves steel production to Spain it is unlikey to return to the UK even with a US deal But if the UK manages to do a deal of its own with the US, will that production come back? ""Probably not,' he says. ""It really depends on how early the deal is done."" Once US importers get used to consignments arriving from Spain, a new trade pattern will have been established and the way the tariffs have been set up means they can't be avoided if any part of a product originates in the UK. ""It is highly likely we will just leave it over there (in Spain),"" Mr Brand says. ""Lost to the UK completely, then."" It was President Donald Trump who signed an order in 2018 to introduce the steel tariffs on national security grounds, which he claimed was to help protect US jobs. Former US President Donald Trump claimed tariffs would protect American jobs If the UK government had hoped that Joe Biden's administration would change course quickly, it has been disappointed. Neither public diplomacy nor private negotiation has yet led to any breakthrough. Following Mr Trump's move, both the UK and the EU retaliated with tariffs of their own against US products. But it is the EU that has got a deal done first, to resolve the dispute. That's partly because in trade, size matters. ""They (the EU) are just bigger so they account for more steel exports to the US, and that means there is more interest from US importers in getting it resolved,"" says Soumaya Keynes, Britain economics editor at The Economist. ""And because there is more trade involved with the EU, the retaliation hurts more."" The EU was also more explicit about how it intended to accelerate retaliation against the American tariffs. The UK was, says Ms Keynes, ""a bit friendlier, a bit chummier, and that could mean the EU had more leverage."" For the UK government, there is an added complication. There is political concern in Washington about British threats to suspend parts of the post-Brexit deal with the EU on Northern Ireland. The two issues are quite separate, but it is possible that one could delay the other. The government argues that the steel dispute could in fact lead to further complications in Northern Ireland, because of its special status as part of the EU single market for goods. But it is an awkward mix. There is also the question of stepping up UK retaliation against the US tariffs. The government's formal response to a public consultation on further counter-measures has already been delayed, and it cannot be put off forever, Trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan issued a careful warning when she spoke to the BBC last month, after returning from a visit to Washington, ""We had a very frank conversation, and I was very clear that the pressures that we are under to use countervailing measures if we can't solve the problem are becoming more and more acute."" The government certainly hopes the dispute can be resolved soon, before it gets worse. A solution later this month would be a great relief, and the message from industry is pretty clear. ""Crack on, please,"" says UCB's James Brand. ""Let's get a deal brokered as soon as possible and put us on a level playing field with the rest of Europe."" It wasn't supposed to be like this. After Brexit, the UK was relying on a closer relationship with the US than it had when it was part of the EU. But in matters of trade, many things are easier said than done.

Cigarettes for cabbage: Xi'an residents barter food,"Some have shared videos on social media of them swapping cigarettes for cabbage, and a Nintendo Switch for instant noodles and steamed buns People quarantined in the Chinese city of Xi'an are bartering supplies amid continuing worries over food shortages. Social posts show locals swapping cigarettes and tech gadgets for food. About 13 million have been confined to their homes since 23 December. The strict measures come ahead of the Lunar New Year and the Winter Olympics due to be held in Beijing next month. Overnight, the city of Yuzhou was shut down after the discovery of just three cases, all of them asymptomatic. Yuzhou, with a population of 1.1 million, has closed its transport system and entertainment venues and banned almost all vehicles from the roads. All but essential food shops are shut, with only workers involved in epidemic prevention allowed out. The outbreak in the much larger city to the west is the worst China has seen in months as it continues a ""zero Covid"" strategy, seeking to stamp out the virus rather than try to live with it. Authorities in Xi'an have been providing free food to households, but there have been numerous complaints on social media. Some residents saidtheir supplies were running lowor that they had yet to receive aid. Videos and photos on social media site Weibo showed people exchanging cigarettes for cabbage, dishwashing liquid for apples, and sanitary pads for a small pile of vegetables. One video showed a resident appearing to trade his Nintendo Switch console for a packet of instant noodles and two steamed buns. Authorities have been providing free food to households, but some have said their supplies are running low ""People are swapping stuff with others in the same building, because they no longer have enough food to eat,"" a resident surnamedWang told Radio Free Asia,external. The news outlet also reported that another man had wanted to trade a smartphone and tablet for rice. ""Helpless citizens have arrived at the era of bartering - potatoes are exchanged for cotton swabs,"" one Weibo user said, while another described it as a ""return to primitive society"". Some were more optimistic though, and commented on how ""touched"" they were by their neighbours' kindness in sharing their supplies with them. Xi'an is at the epicentre of China's current Covid outbreak, and local authorities have enacted drastic measures which have attracted significant criticism online. In a recent incident, residents in the Mingde 8 Yingli housing compound in the south of the city werereportedly told just after midnight on 1 Januarythat they had to leave their homes and go to quarantine facilities. Netizens were also shocked by an unverified post that went viral on Monday. A Xi'an resident said their father had died after he suffered a heart attack and was turned away from a hospital due to the city's Covid situation. The hospital has yet to respond. Covid first appeared in China and up until a few weeks ago the government had managed to contain it to such a level that new cases were negligible and mainly coming from people arriving from abroad. What Beijing calls its ""dynamic zero Covid"" strategy combines mass vaccination with a regime of constant testing, nationwide monitoring of people's movements, temperature-taking and phone apps to prove you don't pose a threat. All of that amounts to hyper vigilance about any new outbreak - if and when one is spotted the reaction is severe. China has been wedded to this approach since the beginning because it's likely the leaders from Xi Jinping down consider anything less would cause illness and death on a scale that would be politically, economically and socially unacceptable. The ruling Communist Party took much of the credit for containing the virus early on - after it had spread beyond China's borders - and diverting from that would undermine its credibility. There is a broad acceptance of this approach, and the stringent restrictions it can bring, among many Chinese who for decades have not felt they can rely much on the public health system. So illness and the prospect of losing your job, let alone your life, are existentially daunting. Add to that the prestige attached to - safely - hosting another Olympic Games in a few weeks' time and the fast approaching Chinese New Year mass migration of millions across this country and there is clearly little doubt the government will remain committed to ""zero Covid"" for the foreseeable future.

French MPs get death threats over Covid-19 passThey report the threats as they consider tougher restrictions on unvaccinated people in France.Europe,"The French government wants to tighten restrictions on unvaccinated people Several French MPs say they have received death threats as they debate a Covid-19 pass that would bar the unvaccinated from much of public life. The government is seeking to pass a law that would require people to show proof of vaccination to access public venues and transport with some exceptions. The legislation is expected to be approved in a vote this week but has angered vaccine opponents. France has one of the highest Covid vaccination rates in the EU. At least 91% of the adult population have been fully jabbed,according to the French government,external. On Sunday AgnÃ¨s Firmin Le Bodo of the centre-right Agir partytweeted an email,externalshe received containing graphic threats to kill her over her support for the vaccination pass. ""Our democracy is in danger,"" wrote Ms Firmin Le Bodo, who is also a pharmacist and vaccinates people against Covid. In an interview with BFM TV, she said she had reported the threats to the police and would not be deterred from supporting the vaccine pass. AgnÃ¨s Firmin Le Bodo tweeted out a screen shot of an emailed threat she received Another MP, NaÃ¯ma Moutchou of the Horizons party,shared a similar tweet,externalwhich included a screenshot of an emailed threat. In parliament on Monday, Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran condemned the death threats and the ""selfishness"" of vaccine opponents. Last week Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said police would strengthen protections for elected officials ahead of the vote on vaccine passes. Barbara Bessot Ballot of the ruling En Marche! party said MPs had received messages threatening to kill them for ""attacking our freedom"". ""Those death threats are unacceptable,""she wrote on Twitter,external. Throughout the pandemic, critics have accused French President Emmanuel Macron's government of violating freedoms by imposing Covid rules. Protests against these rules have been held regularly. For months France has asked people to show either proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test to access many public venues. But the French government has decided to remove the option to show a negative test in response to record increases in infections, driven by the highly contagious Omicron and Delta variants of Covid. Omicron: Good news, bad news and what it all means Covid map: Where are cases the highest?

"Bowie estate sells rights to entire body of workWarner Chappell Music say they are ""immensely proud"" to be ""chosen as caretakers"".Entertainment & Arts","David Bowie, pictured in 1992, released 26 studio albums during his lifetime David Bowie's estate has sold the publishing rights to his ""entire body of work"" to Warner Chappell Music, including hundreds of songs such as Space Oddity, Changes and Let's Dance. WCM now has global music publishing rights to his song catalogue, the singer's estate told the BBC. Variety suggested,externalthe deal was worth ""upwards of $250m (Â£185m)"", but the terms of the agreement were not given. WCM head Guy Moot said they were ""proud"" to be ""chosen as caretakers"". Bowiedied of cancerin 2016. He was hailed as an extraordinary artist and genius in a huge global outpouring of tributes from fellow music stars, including Sir Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Brian Eno and Madonna among others. Bowie [L] performed Starman on Top of the Pops in 1972 The agreement with WCM includes the 26 studio albums released during Bowie's lifetime and the posthumous studio album release, Toy, plus the two studio albums from Tin Machine - the rock supergroup fronted by Bowie. Tracks released as singles from soundtracks and other projects are also included. Given the ups and downs of the music industry over the last 20 years, the appeal of a big cheque is, perhaps, unsurprising - especially for 'heritage' acts. Streaming may not quite have replaced the billions lost by the decline of the CD, but it is, for many established artists, proving to be a regular, and largely recession-proof, income stream; and for record labels and a number of new firms who have entered the market, this is, they think, a lucrative asset. With the music industry becoming ever more complicated, with licensing deals over streaming, adverts, films, video games and online video to negotiate, the artists - or their estates and families - have a large and hassle-free deposit in the bank, and the complicated job of turning music into money is left to the experts. With Spotify adding 60,000 songs to its catalogue every day, the chance of a new act making a splash seems tougher than ever - legacy artists with 50 years of fame and proven sales look like a relatively safe bet. Bowie released a total of 111 singles, averaging two per year during his career, and 51 music videos. This deal follows huge names, includingBruce Springsteen,Bob DylanandPaul Simon, recently selling the rights to their music catalogues. Moot, who is WCM's co-chairman and chief executive, said Bowie's was ""one of the most ground-breaking, influential, and enduring catalogues in music history"", adding he had ""inspired millions of fans and countless innovators, not only in music, but across all the arts, fashion, and media"". ""These are not only extraordinary songs, but milestones that have changed the course of modern music forever,"" he said. This video can not be played David Bowie: A life in lyrics He described Bowie's ""vision and creative genius"" driving him to ""push the envelope, lyrically and musically - writing songs that challenged convention, changed the conversation, and have become part of the canon of global culture"". The executive added they were looking forward to ""tending his unparalleled body of songs with passion and care"". WCM said the agreement followedlast year's announcement of a deal,externalbetween Bowie's estate and Warner Music Group [WMG], for it to oversee his full back catalogue of albums between 1968 and 1999. ""Warner Music has licensed worldwide rights to Bowie's recorded music catalogue from 1968. With this new deal with Warner Chappell, WMG is now home to Bowie's body of work as both a songwriter and recording artist,"" WCM added. 'Lost' David Bowie album set for birthday release Warner Chappell Music is the global music publishing company of Warner Music Group. WCM co-chair and COO Carianne Marshall said they were ""pleased"" the estate felt they had the "" knowledge, experience, and resources to take the reins and continue to promote a collection of this stature"". She called Bowie's music a ""living, breathing collection of timeless songs that are as powerful and resonant today as they were when they were first written"". Obituary: David Bowie David Bowie: A career that shaped modern pop David Bowie: The internet pioneer David Bowie: 69 facts Allen Grubman , speaking on behalf of Bowie's estate, said: ""We are truly gratified that David Bowie's body of music will now be in the capable hands of Warner Chappell Music Publishing. We are sure they will cherish it and take care of it with the greatest level of dignity."" Bowie's innovation was not just in the recording studio and in front of the camera - he was also involved in the world of finance. In the mid-90s, Bowie, his financial manager Bill Zysblat, and banker David Pullmancame up with a new scheme to generate cash from the singer's extensive back catalogue. Bowie introduced the bonds in the late 1990s In 1997, Bowie sold asset-backed securities, dubbed ""Bowie bonds"", which awarded investors a share in his future royalties for 10 years.

Elizabeth Holmes: The boss accused of duping Silicon Valley,"She was ""the world's youngest self-made female billionaire"", trumpeted Forbes magazine. The ""next Steve Jobs"", said Inc, another business magazine that put her on the cover. In 2014, Elizabeth Holmes, then 30 years old, was on top of the world. A Stanford University drop-out, she had founded a company valued at $9bn (Â£6.5bn) for supposedly bringing about a revolution in diagnosing disease. With a few drops of blood, Theranos promised that its Edison test could detect conditions such as cancer and diabetes quickly without the hassle of needles. Bigwigs from Henry Kissinger to general James Mattis sat on the board. But by 2015, the seams were coming apart, and within a year, Holmes was exposed as a fake. The technology she touted didn't work at all, and by 2018 the company she founded had collapsed. In January, she wasconvicted by a jury in California on four counts of fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The jury found her not guilty on four other charges and failed to reach a verdict on three more. Holmes, who had pleaded not guilty to all charges, sought a new trial but those requests were denied. She was sentenced on Friday to 11 years and three months in prison. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch lost Â£120m he had invested in Theranos During the trial Holmes accused her ex-boyfriend and business partner, Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, of emotional and sexual abuse at the time of the alleged crimes, impairing her mental state. Balwani, 56, who faced the same fraud charges, was convicted in July and is due to be sentenced next month. He had called the claims ""outrageous"". Despite being the subject of a book, HBO documentary, TV series and an upcoming film, it is still unclear why Holmes took such a gamble on technology she knew didn't work. She was raised in a comfortably well-off family in Washington DC, and was a polite but withdrawn child, according to people who knew her. Inventor and businessman Richard Fuisz, 81, speculated there must have been immense pressure on Holmes to succeed. His family lived next door to the Holmes family for years, but they fell out when Theranos sued him over a patent dispute in 2011 (it was later settled). Theranos founder hit with criminal charges When to fire the boss: A tale of three sackings Holmes's parents spent much of their careers as bureaucrats on Capitol Hill, but ""they were very interested in status"" and ""lived for connections"", he told the BBC. Her father's great-great-grandfather founded Fleischmann's Yeast, which changed America's bread industry, and the family was very conscious about its lineage, he said. At age nine, the young Elizabeth wrote a letter to her father declaring that what she ""really want[ed] out of life is to discover something new, something that mankind didn't know was possible to do"". When she got to Stanford University in 2002 to study chemical engineering, she came up with an idea for a patch that could scan the wearer for infections and release antibiotics as needed. Dr Phyllis Gardner told Holmes her idea would not work At 18, she already displayed an intransigence that would apparently continue and drive the company she would found the following year. Phyllis Gardner, an expert in clinical pharmacology at Stanford, recalled discussing Holmes's skin-patch idea and telling her it ""wouldn't work"". ""She just stared through me,"" Dr Gardner told the BBC. ""And she just seemed absolutely confident of her own brilliance. She wasn't interested in my expertise and it was upsetting."" Months later Holmes dropped out of Stanford aged 19 and launched Theranos, this time coming up with an apparently revolutionary way of testing blood from a simple finger prick. Powerful people were enthralled and invested without seeing audited financial accounts. US Treasury Secretary George Schultz, media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and America's richest family, the Waltons, were among her backers. The support lent her credibility, as did her demeanour. ""I knew she'd had this brilliant idea and that she had managed to convince all these investors and scientists,"" said Dr Jeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School, who met her for lunch in 2015. ""She was self-assured, but when I asked her several questions about her technology she didn't look like she understood,"" added Dr Flier, who never formally assessed her technology. ""It seemed a bit odd, but I didn't come away thinking it was a fraud."" On stage with former US President Bill Clinton in 2015. At the time Ms Holmes was said to be the world's youngest self-made female billionaire Dr Flier ended up inviting her to join the medical school's Board of Fellows, which he regrets, although she was removed when the scandal broke. It began to unravel in 2015 when a whistleblower raised concerns about Theranos' flagship testing device, the Edison. The Wall Street Journal wrote a series of damning exposes claiming the results were unreliable and that the firm had been using commercially available machines made by other manufacturers for most of its testing. Lawsuits piled up, partners cut ties and in 2016 US regulators banned Holmes from operating a blood-testing service for two years. In 2018 Theranos was dissolved. In March that year, Holmes settled civil charges from financial regulators that she had fraudulently raised $700m from investors. But three months later she was arrested, along with Mr Balwani, on criminal charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Prosecutors said,externalshe knowingly misled patients about the tests and vastly exaggerated the firm's performance to financial backers. As the Theranos scandal reached trial, commentators said it was remarkable how tightly Holmes clung to her original story, and people who knew her said they doubt she has changed. Since the trial, Holmes has been living in California with partner William ""Billy"" Evans, 27, an heir to the Evans Hotel Group. They had a son in July 2021 and she is pregnant with their second child. Holmes's attorneys had said she should not face prison time on the grounds that she was not a danger to society. They offered testimony from more than 130 people on her behalf, including Senator Cory Booker. But prosecutors argued that she was ""blinded"" by ambition, which put ""and will continue to put people in harm's way"". ""She accepts no responsibility,"" they wrote in court filings. ""Quite the opposite, she insists she is the victim.""

There were two call outs on Christmas Day itself, Mr Warren said, adding: ""The Christmas period was absolute chaos."" Richard Warren said volunteers loved helping people Mr Warren said there had been a ""massive increase"" in visitors to the Lake District in 2020 and 2021 due to travel restrictions stopping many people holidaying abroad. The previous record was 650 call outs in 2018, but Mr Warren said 2021 had eclipsed that despite the first three months of the year being ""relatively quiet"". He said there had been a ""very sad end to the year"" when a man died after suffering a medical episode on Skiddaw on New Year's Eve, while the start of 2022 had been ""just as busy"". Mr Warren said he was ""extremely proud"" of the all the volunteers at the 12 rescue teams in Cumbria. ""We do it unpaid,"" he said, adding: ""Mountain rescuers don't want to be paid.

Lake District mountain rescue teams were called out 680 times in 2021 He also praised all those who make donations to keep the teams running, with about Â£750,000 a year needed across all the Cumbria teams. Mr Warren urged people to properly plan their walks by usingservices such as Adventure Smart UK,external.
