NHS waits could rise to 14m in England - analysis,"Those waiting for more than a year for an operation has risen to almost 388,000 compared to 1,600 before the pandemic began, NHS statistics shows Up to 14 million people could be on NHS waiting lists in England by next autumn, new analysis suggests. Currently, some five million are waiting for routine operations and procedures - many of whom are in pain. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned there is a huge hidden backlog of patients who are still yet to come forward for treatment. The government pointed to the Â£1bn it had given to the NHS this year to clear the backlog. There have been repeated warnings over the length of hospital waiting lists in England. A record number of patients are currently waiting for surgery - such as hip or knee replacements - with more than 385,000 patients waiting more than a year, compared to just 1,600 before the pandemic. 'I went to Sri Lanka for my operation' The huge NHS challenge facing Sajid Javid Hospital waiting list tops 5m in England Last monthHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said he had been shockedto learn that waiting lists could rise to 13 million patients. The IFS decided to crunch the numbers to see whether this was likely - it said Mr Javid's warning is ""well within the realms of possibility"". In order to stop numbers getting that high, the NHS needs to treat even more patients than it did before the pandemic, the IFS said. Explaining how it reached its conclusions, the IFS said that after Covid hit in March last year, seven million fewer people joined waiting lists than was normal. It is not yet known how many of these ""missing patients"" will come forward for treatment - but the IFS predicts that their return will increase waiting lists and put the NHS under more pressure. ""Even if only two-thirds of the missing patients return then with capacity at 95% of pre-pandemic levels - much more than the NHS is currently managing - waiting lists could easily exceed 13 million (and keep growing),"" said the IFS. ""Expanding capacity will be the only solution to cutting waiting lists in the future."" And the IFS said the number could even soar to 14 million by autumn 2022 - and continue to increase - if 80% of the missing patients return and the NHS operates at 90% of its capacity levels in 2019. This report argues there are millions of ""missing patients"" from the waiting lists who might have been expected to join it but haven't  - perhaps because they're worried about Covid infections or their conditions haven't been picked up yet. The researchers have looked at different scenarios depending on what happens next to these patients. In one scenario, if the NHS can't treat more patients than it did pre-pandemic, the waiting list could rise to 14 million by next autumn. Even in the most optimistic projection, the IFS says it could rise to nine million by 2025, but that would need the NHS to be able to work at 5% more capacity than it did before the pandemic and would come at a cost of at least Â£2bn. If the NHS can't boost capacity, the IFS warns, longer waiting lists will be with us for years to come. The IFS said it was unlikely that all of the seven million missing patients would return, since some may have died, sought private treatment or chosen to live with their health issues - but they said most will probably come forward at some point. Earlier this year, the doctors' union urged people to remember that the waiting lists were not just ""numbers on a spreadsheet"". They are ""real people in pain"" who are distressed,the British Medical Association said.,external One woman from Hampshiretold the BBCthat her hip pain was unbearable. ""It's like standing on jagged glass. I get so depressed about the pain I'm living with,"" she said. A new chief executive for NHS England was appointed last month - Amanda Pritchard. She acknowledged the NHS had ""big challenges ahead"", including the need to tackle backlogs. The union for nurses said the IFS analysis showed the ""immense task"" that lies ahead - and called on Mr Javid to invest in the workforce. The Royal College of Nursing added: ""A significant pay rise will demonstrate value and help retain experienced nursing staff whom health services can't afford to lose with this challenge ahead."" And Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the modelling should be a ""wake-up call for ministers"". ""Years of underfunding and cuts to healthcare had already left our NHS with ballooning waiting lists before the pandemic hit. ""Given these warnings it's now even more urgent that a long-term rescue plan is put in place to give the NHS the resources and staff it needs to bring down waiting lists and reducing waiting times for treatment."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it was backing the health service with Â£9.6bn to help it recover from Covid. ""This includes dedicated investment of Â£1bn this year to tackle the backlog and reduce waiting lists, including by increasing capacity. The NHS is also trialling innovative ways to accelerate elective recovery and enable more hospitals to go further, faster. ""We will continue to support the NHS to deliver the appointments, operations and treatment people need."" TOKYO OLYMPICS:Can Shauna Coxsey help Radio 1's Jordan North overcome his fear of heights?

Bodies on the streets as fighting traps Afghans,"Thousands of people in Helmand province have been displaced by fighting in recent months ""The Taliban will have no mercy on us and the government won't stop the bombing."" The resident of Lashkar Gah in southern Afghanistan is one of thousands trapped or fleeing for their lives as fighting for control of the city rages between militants and government forces. The BBC is not naming some interviewees in this article for security reasons. ""There are corpses on the roads. We do not know if they are civilians or the Taliban,"" the man told the BBC Afghan service in an interview on Whatsapp. ""Dozens of families have fled their homes and settled near the Helmand river."" Other terrified locals told the BBC they had seen bodies lying in the streets. Capturing the besieged Helmand provincial capital would be of huge symbolic value to the insurgents as they continue theirrapid advance after the pullout of foreign forces. Helmand was the centrepiece of the US and British military campaign. The United Nations and other agencies are warning of a worsening humanitarian crisis. At least 40 civilians have been killed in Lashkar Gah in the past day, the UN said on Tuesday. Afghan government forces are battling the Taliban in three key cities The Afghan army urged civilians to leave Lashkar Gah ahead of a major offensive against the Taliban, the hardline Islamist group that was driven from power by US-led forces 20 years ago. Elsewhere in the south, Taliban are trying to capture Kandahar, their former stronghold, and clashes have also intensified in Herat in the west. Fighting has been continuing in Lashkar Gah for days, with the militants now reportedly in control of most districts. ""We are going through difficult days,"" a student in the city told the BBC. ""The Taliban set fire to the ground and government air forces to the skies."" Another man said on Sunday: ""The Taliban can be seen on the city's roads. The presence of the Taliban has astonished people here. ""Shops are closed, and government military vehicles are lying destroyed in the middle of the road. The war continues within a few metres of the governor's office and the National Security Directorate. ""The central government said recently they had deployed new commandos to Lashkar Gah, but we didn't see them."" Hundreds of Afghan reinforcements have since reportedly been deployed to the city. At the weekend, Attaullah Afghan, the head of Helmand provincial council, admitted that fighting seemed to be ""getting out of our control"". The Taliban have made further advances this week, despite Afghan and US warplanes targeting the insurgents. There are reports that Taliban fighters have taken positions inside homes, shops and the bazaar - people are trapped in their homes while fighting goes on in the streets. The militants generally warn people via loudspeaker to leave but sometimes they enter houses - locals have just minutes to flee or risk being caught in crossfire as their homes become part of the battlefield. ""The Taliban told us if we didn't leave the house in half an hour, we would be counted among the police and Afghan forces,"" said the student the BBC Afghan service spoke to. Who are the Taliban? How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan I was an Afghan interpreter left homeless in US During their rule in the late 1990s, the Taliban publicly executed people and restricted women's access to education and employment. The Taliban say they have changed and would no longer resort to such violence - but many Afghans are sceptical. Human Rights Watch has documented cases of reprisal attacks by the militants against civilians deemed to have supported the government. The UN says civilians are bearing the brunt of the conflict and is urging all parties to do more to protect civilians or the impact will be catastrophic. The thousands who've escaped the fighting now face a lack of food, drinking water and  medicines. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Aid agencies do not have access to most of the displaced, and health centres and hospitals don't have capacity to deal with the number of casualties. Some health facilities have been destroyed, while others are inactive. A doctor in Lashkar Gah, Masood Khan, said an ever-increasing flow of severely wounded patients was arriving at his hospital, and he feared that others were unable to reach it. He said medical supplies were running low. ""We are receiving a lot of war woundedâ¦ There is fighting all around,"" Dr Kahn, an intensive care specialist at a hospital run by the health charity MSF, told the BBC on Monday. This video can not be played General Sami Sadat: ""The battle is very intense in Lashkar Gah"" Videos of reported Taliban atrocities are being shared on social media, deepening fears of their possible return. The United States and Britain say the group may have committed war crimes, accusing them of massacring dozens of civilians in revenge killings in Spin Boldak, on the border with Pakistan. There are also reports that at least 40 Hazaras of the Shia Muslim minority were targeted and killed in Malistan in eastern Ghazni province. The Taliban have dismissed the accusations as baseless, and are posting their own grisly images of civilian casualties in Afghan and US air strikes. A view of a shuttered market in Lashkar Gah on Monday Those trapped in the worsening fighting have few options. ""We have neither bread nor water in the house, and the electricity is completely cut off,"" a local businessman in Laskhar Gah told the BBC. ""I do not know where to go, there are clashes in every corner of the city."" An Afghan interpreter living in the city said his life was under threat from the Taliban because he had worked for the British forces. ""I have changed address three times. My own house has been captured by the Taliban and they are living there and they were asking for me,"" he said. ""We don't know what will happen in the future but they are looking from house to house to find the people who worked for Nato."" Afghan orphan's reunion with British soldier after 19 years.

Greece sees 'nightmarish summer' of forest firesThousands have been evacuated as wildfires continue to ravage parts of the country.,"This video can not be played The coastguard moved 650 people from Limni, in the north of the island of Evia Greece's prime minister has talked of a ""nightmarish summer"" as forest fires continue to ravage the country. Thousands have been evacuated from their homes, and more than 1,000 firefighters have been deployed to bring the flames under control. Greece is experiencing its worst heatwave in more than 30 years. Authorities have warned that the risk of further fires remains high in many regions, including Athens and Crete. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the government's priority has been ""first and foremost , to protect human lives"". In the last 10 days, more than 56,000 hectares (140,000 acres) have been burnt in Greece, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. More than 2,000 people have been evacuated from the island of Evia by ferry Dozens of wildfires have broken out in the last 24 hours with the largest fronts in Evia - Greece's second largest island - and areas in the Peloponnese including Arkadia and Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games. In Evia, more than 2,000 people have been evacuated via ferry. Ten ships are waiting at Pefki, in the north of the island, ready to evacuate more people if needed, a Coast Guard spokesperson told AP news agency. EXPLAINER: The burning issue of wildfires On Saturday, a fire just north of Athens on Mount Parnitha spread smoke across the capital. Authorities set up a hotline for people with breathing difficulties, according to AP news. Thousands of people have been evacuated from the area since Thursday but by Saturday the flames had receded. However with strong winds forecast, there are concerns that the fire could flare again. One resident, who was sitting in a car park with his girlfriend, said they had only spent one night in their newly built house before they had to flee. He had spent four hours trying to use a garden hose to save his property. A number of countries have offered assistance in tackling the fires A number of countries have offered support to Greece. Nations including the UK, France, Romania and Switzerland have sent firefighters to the area. In Turkey, authorities have been struggling to contain a number of blazes, which have been described by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as the country's worst wildfires. Tens of thousands of hectares have been destroyed in Mediterranean and Aegean provinces. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Are you in the area?

German coach thrown out for horse punch,"Saint Boy repeatedly refused to jump, leaving rider Annika Schleu in tears Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. A German coach has been thrown out of the Olympics for appearing to punch a horse who was refusing to jump or trot during the modern pentathlon. Coach Kim Raisner was heard on German TV urging tearful athlete Annika Schleu to ""really hit"" the horse while shestruggled to controlSaint Boy during the showjumping round of Friday's women's event. Schleu had been leading the event before the equestrian, where athletes are given just 20 minutes to bond with a horse they have never ridden. Modern pentathlon's governing body, the UIPM, said it had reviewed video footage that appeared to show Raisner - who competed at the 2004 Olympics in modern pentathlon - striking the horse with her fist. ""Her actions were deemed to be in violation of the UIPM competition rules, which are applied to all recognised modern pentathlon competitions including the Olympic Games,"" the governing body said in a statement. ""The UIPM Executive Board [EB] has given a black card to the Germany team coach Kim Raisner, disqualifying her from the remainder of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. ""The EB decision was made today at the Tokyo Stadium before the resumption of the men's modern pentathlon competition."" This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: 'Her face says it all' - Annika Schleu loses modern pentathlon lead after horse refuses to jump Saint Boy is not among the horses due to be ridden during Saturday's men's modern pentathlon competition. The horse cleared just four fences before crashing into the fifth and then repeatedly refused to jump, eliminating Schleu with zero points as it had done earlier to another competitor, Gulnaz Gubaydullina.

This report argues there are millions of ""missing patients"" from the waiting lists who might have been expected to join it but haven't  - perhaps because they're worried about Covid infections or their conditions haven't been picked up yet. The researchers have looked at different scenarios depending on what happens next to these patients. In one scenario, if the NHS can't treat more patients than it did pre-pandemic, the waiting list could rise to 14 million by next autumn. Even in the most optimistic projection, the IFS says it could rise to nine million by 2025, but that would need the NHS to be able to work at 5% more capacity than it did before the pandemic and would come at a cost of at least Â£2bn. If the NHS can't boost capacity, the IFS warns, longer waiting lists will be with us for years to come. The IFS said it was unlikely that all of the seven million missing patients would return, since some may have died, sought private treatment or chosen to live with their health issues - but they said most will probably come forward at some point. Earlier this year, the doctors' union urged people to remember that the waiting lists were not just ""numbers on a spreadsheet"". They are ""real people in pain"" who are distressed,the British Medical Association said.,external One woman from Hampshiretold the BBCthat her hip pain was unbearable. ""It's like standing on jagged glass. I get so depressed about the pain I'm living with,"" she said. A new chief executive for NHS England was appointed last month - Amanda Pritchard. She acknowledged the NHS had ""big challenges ahead"", including the need to tackle backlogs. The union for nurses said the IFS analysis showed the ""immense task"" that lies ahead - and called on Mr Javid to invest in the workforce. The Royal College of Nursing added: ""A significant pay rise will demonstrate value and help retain experienced nursing staff whom health services can't afford to lose with this challenge ahead."" And Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the modelling should be a ""wake-up call for ministers"". ""Years of underfunding and cuts to healthcare had already left our NHS with ballooning waiting lists before the pandemic hit. ""Given these warnings it's now even more urgent that a long-term rescue plan is put in place to give the NHS the resources and staff it needs to bring down waiting lists and reducing waiting times for treatment."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it was backing the health service with Â£9.6bn to help it recover from Covid. ""This includes dedicated investment of Â£1bn this year to tackle the backlog and reduce waiting lists, including by increasing capacity. The NHS is also trialling innovative ways to accelerate elective recovery and enable more hospitals to go further, faster.

Princess Charlotte joins Big Butterfly CountThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge share a photo to promote the Butterfly Conservation initiative.UK,"Princess Charlotte gently holds a Red Admiral, which she found near her family's home in Norfolk Princess Charlotte and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have joined the Big Butterfly Count - a national conservation survey to track the number of diversity of the insects. A photo taken by the duchess shows her six-year-old daughter with a Red Admiral near their home in Norfolk. The Cambridges said on social media that butterflies were ""vital parts of the ecosystem"". The count, organised by Butterfly Conservation, ends on Sunday. As well as the Red Admiral in Princess Charlotte's hands, the duke and duchess shared images of Peacock butterflies perched on buddleia, spotted during their butterfly count. Public urged to count butterflies after poor spring Backyard moth spotting rises during lockdown How cattle are helping rare butterflies to thrive The Cambridges said,external: ""Butterfly Conservation are encouraging us all to count these incredible creatures because not only are they beautiful creatures to be around but they are also extremely important. ""Butterflies are vital parts of the ecosystem as both pollinators and components of the food chain."" They said ""hopefully"" people taking part in the butterfly count would be able to beat last year's total. Starting on 16 July, participants in the count were urged to pick a spot and spend 15 minutes watching for butterflies - and some moths which fly during the daytime - before submitting their sightings. Butterfly Conservation provides an ID chart and a smartphone app to help identify the butterfly species and record any sightings. The duke and duchess urged people to help count these ""beautiful"" and ""extremely important"" creatures Before the count began, the wildlife charity said many species of butterfly appeared to have been affected by the unusually cold and wet spring this year. Speckled wood butterflies were being seen in particularly low numbers, while small tortoiseshells, commas, green-veined whites, large whites and red admirals were also being spotted in smaller numbers compared with the 10-year average. Conservationists have warned the UK is seeing a rising number of extreme weather events, thought to be the result of climate change, and want to learn about their effects on native butterflies in order to understand the likely long-term impact on wildlife. Some species are being found in new parts of the country, while others are becoming harder to find at all, Butterfly Conservation said. Last year saw the lowest average number of butterflies logged in the 145,000 survey submissions sent to the charity since the count began 12 years ago, and Butterfly Conservation's scientists want to see if that trend continues. Although last year's count was the lowest in 12 years, the duke and duchess said ""hopefully"" numbers will rise ""THIS IS THE BEGINNING, NOT THE END"":The protests following the New Cross house fire of 1981 GOD GOES VIRAL:How the megachurch Hillsong became an international phenomenon Public urged to count butterflies after poor spring Backyard moth spotting rises during lockdown How cattle are helping rare butterflies to thrive Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Thousands watch Peter Kay make live return,"Thousands of comedy fans gave Peter Kay a standing ovation as he made his live return after several years away, with two quickly sold-out charity shows at the Manchester Apollo on Saturday. ""I've never in my life had a standing ovation when I came on,"" he joked. ""I'm going to go away for four more years."" The Bolton comic was taking part in two Q&A sessions, called Doing it for Laura, at the 3,500 capacity venue. It was to raise money for 20-year-old Laura Nuttall's brain cancer treatment. The live gigs, which sold out within 30 minutes on release last week, marked a rare public appearance for one of the nation's best-loved comedians. And Kay said that getting back on stage was like ""getting in a hot bath"". In late 2017, the Phoenix Nights starcancelled his tour and all future work projectsdue to ""unforeseen family circumstances"". He returned the year afterwith the finale of his BBC TV show Car Share, but has not appeared live since. This weekend's matinee and evening shows were staged in aid of Manchester University student Ms Nuttall, who was diagnosed with having an aggressive form of brain cancer - glioblastoma multiforme -  in October 2018, during her first term at King's College London. Brain scans showed six tumours, and she was told she had 12-18 months to live. Since then, Ms Nuttall, who was in the audience on Saturday, has been undergoing immunotherapy in Germany as one of the few avenues of treatment available, alongside a costly complex cell vaccination programme, with each jab costing Â£27,000. Laura Nuttall (left) with her mum Nicola and dad Mark ahead of Saturday's shows At the Apollo, her sister Gracie introduced Kay and told the audience their family was ""eternally grateful"" to them for ""potentially saving my sister's life"". Soon after her initial diagnosis, Laura's mum Nicola said the family received an unexpected call from Kay, who she had previously met nearly 20 years ago when working at Granada television. ""He just called up out of the blue and said, 'How can I help?'"" she said previously. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Those in attendance on Saturday were required to provide either proof of having been double vaccinated, or a negative Covid test. ""People have been bringing them to the gate in bags,"" quipped Kay, about the lateral flow tests. Answering questions submitted by fans, he revealed he had written two Christmas special episodes of one of his shows, Max and Paddy, with Paddy McGuinness, but that they had never got round to making them. Peter Kay, pictured arriving at the Manchester Apollo, said he was ""nervous"" about his return to the stage He also admitted he can no longer buy garlic bread from the supermarket, when quizzed about his famous catchphrase. The first show, which ended as it started with a standing ovation, ran over by an hour, causing the evening crowd to queue in the rain for a later-than-advertised second instalment. Many also paid way over the asking price after tickets had been snapped up by touts. Fans queued outside the venue to see Kay's return Official funds raised from the event will go mostly towards Ms Nuttall's treatment, but with some cash going to the Brain Tumour Charity. She previously posted on her fundraising page: ""I still can't quite believe this is really happening!"" Kay's only other public appearance in recent times was on Cat Deeley's BBC Radio 2 show this year to talk about his love of music, and in particular the Mamma Mia! musical. He announced this week that a string of planned""dance-a-thons"", which ended up being cancelled last year due to the pandemic, had now been rescheduled for 2022.

Pubs busy as most Covid rules end in Wales,"Pubs were busy as rugby fans headed out to watch the Lions face South Africa Towns and cities in Wales are getting busy, with a ""big party"" predicted after the end of most Covid regulations. Wales has moved to Covid alert level zero, meaning social distancing rules and most other restrictions have ended. Nick Newman of the Cardiff Licensees Forum said bars started filling up from 11:00 BST. Masks are still needed in shops, and First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people to be sensible. 'Weâre going out and weâre buzzing' Be sensible, says Wales' top doctor Q&A: What are the new Covid rules in Wales? The UK government said on Saturday a further 103 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, with 28,612 cases confirmed. Case rates in Wales are the lowest of the four nations, but chief medical officer Frank Atherton has said the country remains in a ""third wave of coronavirus infection"". Mr Newman said customers had been ""fantastic"" and ""voted with their feet"" throughout the pandemic when restrictions allowed. ""A lot of people were pinning their hopes on midnight last night [for the end of restrictions] but that got cancelled,"" said Mr Newman, who is part of the Croeso Pubs chain. ""So what you will see tonight is an even bigger party in Cardiff central, which is what we are famous for."" ""At 11am, we saw the bars start to fill up, with it the first day of the football season and then the Lions after."" How will we adjust to life without so many rules? Hospitality rules change after '18 months of hell' However, he said some measures remained in place. At one of his pubs, The Philharmonic, thermal imagining cameras will determine who is allowed in, and there will be hand sanitisers. Tiny Rebel Brewery staff and customers celebrated ""freedom day"" in Newport The first minister said on Friday he wasconfident Wales was on the ""final lap""of emerging from the pandemic, providing there were no ""further unexpected turns in the course of the virus"". However, he warned against a ""free-for-all"" after most restrictions ended. In England,most rules were relaxed on 19 July, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson postponed so-called ""Freedom Day"" by a month when cases of the Delta variant surged. Most restrictions in Scotland will end on Monday NI has highest Covid-19 infection rate in UK The 103 additional coronavirus deaths reported in the UK on Saturday brings the total to 130,281 since the start of the pandemic. Across the UK, 86,207,851 Covid jabs were administered on Friday, with 46,997,495 first doses and 39,210,356 second doses. Bosses at Galeri theatre and cinema in Caernarfon said a questionnaire among customers showed some wanted to keep social distancing in place. ""We feel we need time to talk with staff and our customers and make sure that everyone feels safe moving forwards,"" said team leader Naomi Saunders. ""For the time being we are keeping with social distancing due to the fact that the announcement has come so last minute."" Towns and cities around Wales have been busy with the end of social distancing, including Caernarfon The Three Horseshoes pub in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf, will see live acts, pool and darts return on Saturday for the first time since before the pandemic. Landlord Martin Barron said: ""I think people will look forward to it, you can watch an act, grab a beer and it gives people a reason to come out."" He said it would be operating at about 80% capacity because ""we are trying to get to normal but the risk is still there"". Customers can order at the bar of The Three Horseshoes again, but Mr Barron has put control measures in place to limit any risk The Welsh Beer and Pub Association has welcomed the end of restrictions and said it meant more than 150 pubs in Wales which had yet to reopen could now do so on Saturday. Emma McClarkin, chief executive, said: ""This is the good news our brewers and pubs in Wales have been waiting for. ""A pint on Saturday is going to taste all the sweeter."" Although staff are relieved about easing restrictions, they still want customers to feel safe Staff at a cafe in Newport have also welcomed the relaxation of mask rules, calling it a ""huge relief"". Laura Leach, who owns the Restpoint Cafe, said: ""A lot of our customers come in for the social aspect, so trying to have a conversation while wearing a mask makes it impossible."" She also said it would ease pressures on her and staff to ""challenge non-mask wearers"", after ""hardly anyone was complying"" with the rules after the first lockdown. Ms Leach said staff would be thrilled to remove their masks while in the kitchen but would still wear masks when serving and continue social distancing. Retailer Philip Bottrill has been preparing his stationery shop for fewer restrictions Philip Bottrill, of The Pen & Paper Stationery Co in Cardiff, said everyone needed to move ""steadily"" and ""gently"" toward normality. ""It isn't going to happen overnight,"" he said. ""But we do need to build our trade up because, since we've reopened, we are only taking about 60% of what we took in 2019."" While some are excited to see restrictions eased, for others it is a more daunting prospect. Sasha Robbins, a wheelchair user with cerebral palsy from Pontypridd said she felt ""excited"" about rules relaxing but was ""really cautious"" about the future after shielding throughout the pandemic. Shielding advice was paused on 1 April this year, with no expectation that people would need to shield again in the future,chief medical officer Frank Atherton said,external. ""Prior to it [the pandemic] I had a really active social life but now I've noticed there's things out there that I can't control,"" she said. That became more of a realisation for Ms Robbins, 32, when her father contracted Covid-19 when visiting the hospital for a routine check-up. âWeâve been shut out for quite some time,â Ms Robbins says He ended up in intensive care and lost his leg. She said she was worried about people's attitudes now that almost all social restrictions are being relaxed and has faced some unpleasant experiences during the pandemic. Disabled 'pushed out' of post-lockdown world Blind people in Wales frustrated by vaccine access ""Some venomous things have been said to me just because I'm me and I don't understand it,"" she said. She urged people not to ""forget"" disabled people. Rhian Davies, chief executive of Disability Wales said she feared disabled people would be locked out of society. Ms Davies said the unlocking of restrictions could ""exacerbate a two-tier system of people feeling like a second-class citizen"" without ""strong messaging from public bodies"". ""Just because someone isn't a wheelchair user, hasn't got a white cane or a guide dog, doesn't mean they're not at risk,"" she said. Jessica Leigh, from disability charity Scope, said many disabled people would be anxious about the changes. ""The government's decision to lift restrictions leaves some clinically extremely vulnerable people or those not yet vaccinated at the mercy of others' goodwill,"" she said. The first competitive community rugby matches in Wales since March 2020 are set to take place around Wales on Saturday Crickhowell Rugby Club will play its first competitive community match since February 2020. Bleddyn Carrington, team manager and full-back, said ""everyone is like a coiled spring ready to go"". ""Players are excited, the chats on the WhatsApp group are getting a bit intense,"" he said. ""You get nervous thinking 'am I good enough after 18 months?'"" Six weeks ago the team were not able to do contact drills, train for more than one hour and use showers, but Saturday marks a return to competitive action. The team played its first friendly match on 19 July against Brecon Seconds but Mr Carrington said it would not compare to being in the competitive environment.

Lions suffer agonising late series loss,"The Lions won the first Test, but lost the second to take the series to a decider South Africa v British and Irish Lions - third Test South Africa:(6) 19 Try:Kolbe;Pens:Pollard 2, Steyn 2;Con:Pollard British and Irish Lions:(10) 16 Try:Owens;Pens:Russell 3;Con:Russell The British and Irish Lions lost an agonisingly close series decider to South Africa as Morne Steyn's late penalty sealed a 19-16 victory. Steyn, 37, landed the kick that decided the 2009 series and proved little had changed as he put the Springboks ahead with two minutes left. The Lions led at half-time after Ken Owens' try and composed kicking from replacement fly-half Finn Russell. Cheslin Kolbe crossed and from there it was all down to the goal-kickers. Russell - who came on for an injured Dan Biggar in the 11th minute - landed a long-range effort to tie things at 13-13 with 18 minutes remaining. He and Steyn then traded kicks, before the Springbok 10 dealt the final blow to add a Lions series win to their 2019 World Cup success. The victory capped off an impressive turnaround after South Africa lost the first Test, but there were no fans to celebrate in Cape Town Stadium because of coronavirus restrictions. 'Lions loss rather than Springboks win' - Kearney Listen: The final Test review with Kearney, Williams and Skinstad Reaction to the Lions' defeat It felt as if there was much more than a series on the line coming into the decider, with the build-up focused on the unentertaining style of the first two Tests and complaints from both sides about officiating. The match did at least deliver on late drama, but with just six tries scored across the series questions may remain over the ability of the game to attract new fans in its current form. The early entrance of Russell after Biggar departed with what looked like an injury to his right leg suggested the Lions might be forced to move to a more exciting gameplan than the reliance on physicality and kicking of the first two Tests. The Scotland 10 - often labelled a maverick for his canny kicking for both club Racing 92 and country - looked composed as he took to the field with a smile for each of his team-mates. Russell had not played for five weeks because of an Achilles injury but looked undisturbed as he sent a penalty straight through the middle of the posts. That would be his last kick on goal of the first half as the Lions showed ambition, with Russell sending a kickable penalty to the corner to set up Owens' try in a driving maul before nailing the conversion. The Lions looked confident with the ball in hand and Russell sent two more opportunities for three points to the corner - a good idea at the time that was perhaps proved foolish by the final scoreline. Pollard did no such thing and instead kept his side within four points after a second successful penalty before half-time. Cheslin Kolbe beat Liam Williams and shook off Luke Cowan-Dickie's challenge to score the crucial try The momentum had drastically swung at half-time in both the previous Tests, with the Lions bouncing back for victory in the first and South Africa winning the second. This time, neither side made a move initially as multiple stoppages slowed play and the game began to lose momentum. The Lions had made it clear during the week that they wanted to play with tempo. They were stripped of that ability, but at least remained ahead on the scoreboard as Pollard missed two penalties. The match was eventually revived as South Africa won the high ball once again and Willie le Roux drew Jack Conan in, giving Kolbe all the space he needed to run round Liam Williams and score. A lengthy review proceeded to check whether Springbok eight Jasper Wiese had knocked the ball on in the air, but the try stood. Russell took another step on the road to Test greatness with a nerveless penalty from just inside South Africa's half to level things at 13-13. But the Lions immediately conceded a penalty themselves and Steyn gave the Springboks the lead. The Lions' hopes were high as they again kicked to the corner with 10 minutes remaining, but Mako Vunipola was held up over the line. The tourists gave Steyn another chance to kick with two minutes left and the Springbok 10 once again ended Lions dreams, a defeat made all the more difficult to accept by the sacrifices players had made to complete the tour in a strict coronavirus bubble. For South Africa, whose Test series almost ended before it began when most of the squad tested positive for coronavirus in the build-up and who had only managed one warm-up Test since the 2019 World Cup, it is a remarkable victory.

"Bat killed by cat after record 1,200-mile journey","A stock image of a Nathusius' pipistrelle bat A record-breaking bat that flew more than 1,200 miles (2,018 km) from London to Russia died after being attacked by a cat. The female Nathusius' pipistrelle bat, the size of a human thumb, was discovered in Russia's Pskov region. The bat, whose wing had a ""London Zoo"" marking, was rescued by a bat rehabilitation group but later died. It is the furthest recorded journey by a bat from Britain across Europe, beating all known British records. The pipistrelle bat, which weighed 8g (0.3 oz), was discovered by Russian resident Svetlana Lapina in the small village of Molgino and the finding was reported to the Bat Conservation Trust in the UK. UK bat species 'recovering or stable' Bat found in car after 500-mile journey Lisa Worledge, head of conservation services at the Bat Conservation Trust, said: ""This is a remarkable journey and the longest one we know of any bat from Britain across Europe. What an Olympian. ""Her journey is an exciting scientific finding and another piece in the puzzle of bat migration. The movements of Nathusius' pipistrelles around the UK and between the UK and the continent remain largely mysterious."" Her wing had a marking after being ringed in 2016 in London by bat recorder Brian Briggs. Mr Briggs said: ""This is very exciting. It's great to be able to contribute to the international conservation work to protect these extraordinary animals and learn more about their fascinating lives."" This record is topped by only one other known bat journey in Europe - that of a Nathusius' pipistrelle that migrated from Latvia to Spain in 2019, a record-setting 1,382 miles (2,224km). The expanding range of the Nathusius' pipistrelle's migration is linked to climate change, with future climate change predicted to further impact on the species. There have been more than 2,600 Nathusius' pipistrelles recorded in the UK since the national Nathusius' pipistrelle project launched in 2014 to shed light on their breeding, distribution and migration behaviours. Maternity colonies are known in Kent, Northumberland, Surrey and Greater London.

Princess Charlotte joins Big Butterfly Count,"Princess Charlotte gently holds a Red Admiral, which she found near her family's home in Norfolk Princess Charlotte and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have joined the Big Butterfly Count - a national conservation survey to track the number of diversity of the insects. A photo taken by the duchess shows her six-year-old daughter with a Red Admiral near their home in Norfolk. The Cambridges said on social media that butterflies were ""vital parts of the ecosystem"". The count, organised by Butterfly Conservation, ends on Sunday. As well as the Red Admiral in Princess Charlotte's hands, the duke and duchess shared images of Peacock butterflies perched on buddleia, spotted during their butterfly count. Public urged to count butterflies after poor spring Backyard moth spotting rises during lockdown How cattle are helping rare butterflies to thrive The Cambridges said,external: ""Butterfly Conservation are encouraging us all to count these incredible creatures because not only are they beautiful creatures to be around but they are also extremely important. ""Butterflies are vital parts of the ecosystem as both pollinators and components of the food chain."" They said ""hopefully"" people taking part in the butterfly count would be able to beat last year's total. Starting on 16 July, participants in the count were urged to pick a spot and spend 15 minutes watching for butterflies - and some moths which fly during the daytime - before submitting their sightings. Butterfly Conservation provides an ID chart and a smartphone app to help identify the butterfly species and record any sightings. The duke and duchess urged people to help count these ""beautiful"" and ""extremely important"" creatures Before the count began, the wildlife charity said many species of butterfly appeared to have been affected by the unusually cold and wet spring this year. Speckled wood butterflies were being seen in particularly low numbers, while small tortoiseshells, commas, green-veined whites, large whites and red admirals were also being spotted in smaller numbers compared with the 10-year average. Conservationists have warned the UK is seeing a rising number of extreme weather events, thought to be the result of climate change, and want to learn about their effects on native butterflies in order to understand the likely long-term impact on wildlife. Some species are being found in new parts of the country, while others are becoming harder to find at all, Butterfly Conservation said. Last year saw the lowest average number of butterflies logged in the 145,000 survey submissions sent to the charity since the count began 12 years ago, and Butterfly Conservation's scientists want to see if that trend continues. Although last year's count was the lowest in 12 years, the duke and duchess said ""hopefully"" numbers will rise ""THIS IS THE BEGINNING, NOT THE END"":The protests following the New Cross house fire of 1981 GOD GOES VIRAL:How the megachurch Hillsong became an international phenomenon Public urged to count butterflies after poor spring Backyard moth spotting rises during lockdown How cattle are helping rare butterflies to thrive Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

What happened on day 15 in Tokyo?,"This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB's Galal Yafai beats Carlo Paalam to win boxing flyweight gold Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Pentathlete Joe Choong won Great Britain's 20th gold medal of the Tokyo Games after boxer Galal Yafai became an Olympic flyweight champion on Saturday. Choong followed Kate French's victory on Friday in the women's event by becoming the first British man to win individual modern pentathlon gold. Josh Kerr inthe 1500mand diverTom Daleywon bronzes, with silver for cyclistsMatt Walls and Ethan Hayter. Team GB are fifth in the medal table with one day remaining. They have won 63 medals in total, the same as the Russian Olympic Committee who have won more silvers. Australia are in sixth place. Daley's bronze in the men's 10m platform was hissecond medal in Tokyoand came two hours after Yafai won his gold. Walls, the men's omnium champion in Tokyo, collected another medal in the velodrome - this time alongside madison partner Hayter. Kerr claimed Britain's first men's Olympic 1500m medal since Peter Elliott's silver in Seoul 33 years ago. The United States' victory in the 4x400m women's relay meant Allyson Felix is now the nation's most decorated track and field athlete, an 11th Olympic medal taking her past sprint and long jump great Carl Lewis. Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage All the action as it happened from day 15 Tokyo 2020 medal table Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Nielsen Gracenote: ""Great Britain have ended the penultimate day of Tokyo 2020 with 63 medals, one more than at this stage at London 2012 and three fewer than Rio 2016 after 15 days. The 20 gold medals are seven behind Rio and eight behind London. The final day in Rio delivered Joseph Joyce's boxing silver medal. In London, Anthony Joshua won boxing gold on the last day amongst three medals. ""This year though, there are track cycling events on the last day with Jack Carlin and Laura Kenny as strongest potential medallists. In addition, Team GB have a guaranteed 64th medal from Lauren Price and Callum Hawkins amongst the best marathon runners."" On Great Britain v ROC for fourth place: ""As expected, ROC won three gold medals to overtake Great Britain on the medal table on day 15. Both have 20 gold medals but ROC have won five more silvers. On Sunday, ROC have two opportunities to win golds - in rhythmic gymnastics and handball. Russia won both of these events at the last Olympic Games and are favourites to win both again. To finish fourth on the medal table, Great Britain probably need to win two gold medals on Sunday and hope that ROC do not win both of these events."" This video can not be played Joe Choong becomes GB's first individual male winner of the modern pentathlon Maybe it was written in the stars for Choong as he powered to a historic modern pentathlon triumph. The 2019 world champion led going into the fourth event, equestrian, where riders are randomly paired with horses, and he drew Clntino, just as French had on Friday. Choong maintained his lead, and kept his composure in the final laser run to seal a memorable GB double. ""To be honest, I just didn't want Kate to have all the limelight,"" joked the 26-year-old from Kent, who was 10th at Rio 2016. ""I've always said I wanted to be the best in the world. This is literally a dream come true. ""I pulled myself together and this time I've nailed it."" At Rio 2016, Daley was heartbroken afterbombing out of the men's 10m platform semi-finals. Five years later, he qualified fourth for the final in Tokyo behind Chinese pair Cao Yuan and Yang Jian, and Aleksandr Bondar of the Russian Olympic Committee. The 27-year-old, whowon gold in the synchronised eventwith Matty Lee, led the competition through the halfway point and was guaranteed his second medal of the Games after his final attempt, with the trio who finished above him in the semi-finals still to dive. Bondar was too far behind to challenge, and though Cao and Yang took gold and silver respectively, Daley wrote his name in the history books as the first British diver to secure four Olympic medals. This video can not be played 'You superhero!' - Daley wins 10m platform bronze Daley reached two finals on his Olympic debut, aged 13, at the 2008 Games and won his first Olympic medal at London 2012 - a bronze in the 10m platform. Four years later, it was another bronze, this time in the synchronised event alongside Daniel Goodfellow. Twice an individual world champion, Daley finallyended a long wait for Olympic goldalongside Lee in an emotional and nerve-filled men's synchronised 10m platform final last week. This video can not be played GB's Galal Yafai talks to his brother Kal straight after receiving his boxing gold medal Former car factory worker Yafai was determined to persevere with his Olympic dream after his defeat by Cuba's Joahnys Argilagos in the second round at Rio 2016. Since then, the 28-year-old has enjoyed a steady stream of medals, winning silver at the 2017 Europeans, gold at the 2018 Commonwealths and bronze at the 2019 European Games. The Birmingham fighter, whose brothers Gamal and Kal are both professional boxers, claimed his biggest title of all and Great Britain's fifth boxing medal of a guaranteed six in Tokyo with a 4-1 points decision victory over Paalam at the Kokugikan Arena. Bronze medals have already been secured by Kariss Artingstall and Frazer Clarke, while Pat McCormack and Ben Whittaker won silver. With Lauren Price guaranteed at least a silver and GB's sixth boxing medal of the Games in Sunday's middleweight final, Tokyo 2020 will be Britain's most successful Olympics in the boxing ring since 1920. Matt Walls and Ethan Hayter looked to be battling for bronze before a break in the closing stages gave them silver Matt Walls and Ethan Hayter's madison silver marks a sixth medal on the cycling track for Team GB in Tokyo - more than any other nation. Walls, 23, has finished on the podium for the second time on his Olympic debut aftertaking gold in Friday's omnium, while their efforts produced a second madison medal in two days, after Laura Kenny and Katie Archibald's dominant gold-medal ride on Friday. Walls and Hayter held the gold medal spot after 10 sprints, having made a strong and consistent start but faded in an open race before a breathless final sprint secured silver. It was still not enough to overhaul reigning world champions Denmark, who won gold, with France third.

Superb Root hundred gives England hopeJoe Root strokes a century of the highest class to give England hope of beating India in a see-saw first Test at Trent Bridge.,"This video can not be played Highlights: India chase victory despite Root's superb 109 First LV= Insurance Test, Trent Bridge (day four of five) England 183(Root 64; Bumrah 4-46)& 303(Root 109, Bumrah 5-64) India 278(Rahul 84, Robinson 5-85)& 52-1 India need a further 157 runs to win Scorecard Joe Root stroked a century of the highest class to give England hope of beating India in a see-saw first Test at Trent Bridge. On a compelling, thrilling and competitive fourth day, captain Root was magnificent in making 109. With Sam Curran, Jonny Bairstow, Dom Sibley and Dan Lawrence chipping in, England - who at one stage looked in danger of being beaten with a day to spare - reached 303 in their second innings, setting India 209 to win. Pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah ran through the lower order with the second new ball to take 5-64 and finish with match figures of 9-110. India were given an hour to bat and looked set to come through unscathed before Stuart Broad had KL Rahul caught behind for 26. There was still time for Rohit Sharma to survive a tense England review as India closed on 52-1, needing another 157 for victory. 'So classy James Bond should buck his ideas up' - Root shows why he's England Atlas TMS podcast: I got my rhythm back - Root This video can not be played 'What a fantastic innings!' - Root battles to century on day four There have been times in this match when England looked floored - when they were bowled out for 183 in the first innings, when India reached 205-5 in response and when England found themselves 46-2 on the fourth morning. However, thanks to the sheer brilliance of Root, they are still in the contest going into what could be a grandstand final day. On top of Root's knock, a packed Trent Bridge was treated to the skill of Bumrah and the shots of Curran and Bairstow. Even Sibley's vigil was strangely satisfying. This video can not be played Sharp Pant catch removes Sibley for 28 There were moments of pure theatre. As India burned their final review in a desperate bid to remove Root, Virat Kohli was taunted by the home fans. Curran duelled with Mohammed Siraj, while Kohli went face-to-face with Ollie Robinson. As India began their chase, the growing gloom added to the drama, play seemingly always on the verge of being suspended until the sun appeared for Broad to remove Rahul. Rain is forecast for Sunday, but it was also due to spoil what turned out to be a memorable Saturday. The hope is that this absorbing contest can be played to a conclusion. For much of 2021, Root has almost single-handedly carried England's flimsy batting. This was more of the same, a captain's knock that altered their course from defeat to an outside chance of victory. When Root arrived, England were still 49 behind, yet he instantly changed the tempo with flowing cover drives and urgent running. He added 89 with Sibley, who twice could have been run out and overturned an lbw in his 28 from 133 balls. Bairstow, with 30, Lawrence's 25 and a punchy 32 from Curran provided further support. When Root drove down the ground to reach his 21st Test century, it sparked prolonged and emotional celebrations, with the Yorkshireman signalling to wife Carrie and beating his chest in the direction of the vocal England fans. Root fell in Bumrah's first over with the second new ball, sparking a final England slide of four wickets for 29 runs. He left to a rapturous ovation, with everyone inside Trent Bridge knowing they had witnessed one of the great Test innings. India have only once won the first Test in a series in England - in 1986 - and they remain favourites for a repeat despite Root. They were helped by some loose shots. Sibley drove at a wide one to give an inside edge, Bairstow sloppily pulled straight to deep square leg and Jos Buttler was bowled offering no stroke. This video can not be played 'What a way to go!' - Buttler bowled leaving straight ball And, just as Root and Curran were building momentum and India were feeling the heat from the crowd, Bumrah intervened. Extra bounce induced an edge from Root, Curran shovelled to mid-on and Stuart Broad was bowled first ball off his pads by a searing inswinging yorker. Robinson's slice to third man was the signal for the chase to begin, Rohit and Rahul facing a potentially perilous period against a revved-up England. The openers managed to silence the crowd, only for Broad to change ends and remove Rahul, before Rohit and Cheteshwar Pujara added some late runs on what remains a true pitch. Former England captain Michael Vaughan on BBC Test Match Special:""We have witnessed one of the great innings of all time. We have seen Root play plenty of magnificent innings but that was just pure. ""He would never admit it but he does carry this batting line-up. ""It was a wonderful day of Test cricket. From where England were two days ago to where they are now, they have a glimmer of hope of winning because of their captain."" Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta:""This has been a great advert for Test cricket. It has seemed like every over, maybe even every delivery, has been a key moment. ""Joe Root, what a masterclass. He showed how good he is and how far he is head and shoulders above the rest of England's batters.""

On Thursday, the Catalan club said Messi, a free agent, would not stay at the club. They blamed ""financial and structural obstacles"" for the player leaving after 21 years. On Friday, Barca president Joan Laportasaidkeeping Messi could have put the club at risk for 50 years. Messi, 34, has been a free agent since 1 July when his contract expired. He had agreed a new five-year contract on reduced wages - but the club still had to slash their wage bill to afford him, and were unable to do so.

Heartbreak for Lions as South Africa snatch series - reaction & 5 Live debate,"World champions South Africa beat British and Irish Lions 19-16 to win series 2-1 Morne Steyn, who decided 2009 series, kicks winning penalty with minutes left Cheslin Kolbe beat two defenders to give Springboks lead in second half Lions claim ball went forward at start of move but referee disagrees Finn Russell, on for Dan Biggar after 11 minutes, twice kicked Lions level Ken Owens went over as Lions led 10-6 at half-time in Cape Town Mantej Mann FT: South Africa 19-16 British and Irish Lions That's all from us - thanks for joining our coverage of the Lions' tour to South Africa. It's been a strange tour with no fans inside the stadiums, and it's ultimately ended in defeat for the Lions. The famous red jerseys will be packed away for another four years now, before they remerge in 2025 for the tour to Australia... FT: South Africa 19-16 British and Irish Lions Springbok captain Siya Kolisi said:""It's been a tough series in all shapes and forms. ""It was tough game and I'm grateful and happy how the boys responded. It feels a little weird because the stadium is empty. Both teams were desperate to win but we stuck to our guns."" FT: South Africa 19-16 British and Irish Lions More from Gatland: ""It is a bit of Deja vu [having Morne Steyn score the winning penalty] ""The penalty count was against us 15-12. At this level it is so important. Your aim is to keep your penalties under 10 and if you can do that it makes a big difference ""You get one or two chances at this level and you've got to make the most of it."" FT: South Africa 19-16 British and Irish Lions Gatland was asked whether he would like to be involved in another tour and what the future holds for the Lions. ""In terms of the involvement a lot of things can happen in four years,"" he said. ""The Lions need to go and talk to the clubs and the unions about having that adequate preparation time to go on tour. ""Playing away from home with a lot of travel and a lot of expectation to win a series.... When you are putting the best players together we get less preparation than the national teams when they go on their own tours. ""Hopefully within the next six months they can iron that out or we can get the schedule for four years tidied up so you can get the whole squad together before you go on tour. That would make a significant difference."" FT: South Africa 19-16 British and Irish Lions Warren Gatland added:""If you talk to anyone, the players involved and anyone from the southern hemisphere there are two events on the world calendar. ""One is the World Cup and one is the Lions. Those are the two things that players want to be a part of. ""It holds a lot of players back in the southern hemisphere, who may resign for the national team to be a part of playing against the Lions. ""On normal tours it generates a huge amount of financial reward for the Southern hemisphere teams. It is something we need to preserve because it is a very important part of the rugby cycle."" FT: South Africa 19-16 British and Irish Lions Lions head coach Warren Gatland:""When you are playing against the world champions you know they are going to be really tight contests. It is going to be the bounce of the ball or a call. ""From that point of view, some key moments but it was always going to be a bounce of the ball. It was always going to be tight."" FT: South Africa 19-16 British and Irish Lions Warren Gatland said in his post-match news conference: ""Iâm disappointed but I'm really proud of the effort the boys put in today. ""I thought we were bold and went out there to play some rugby. A couple of 50/50 calls probably didn't go our way. ""You know it's not going to be easy going away and playing the world champions. ""It could have gone any way and our congratulations to South Africa."" FT: South Africa 19-16 British and Irish Lions Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Archbishop: People feel left behind by city elites,"The Archbishop of York has said many people in England feel left behind by ""metropolitan elites in London and the South East"" and are ""patronised as backwardly xenophobic"". Writing in the Telegraph,external, Stephen Cottrell called for ""an expansive vision of what it means to be English"". He added that stronger regional government in England would help the country ""rediscover a national unity"". The government said it was increasing the powers available to local leaders. Archbishop Cottrell is currently the most senior figure in the Church of England, with the Archbishop of Canterbury due to return from a three-month sabbatical in a few weeks. Lamenting the loss of national identity in England, Archbishop Cottrell, who was born in Essex, wrote: ""Many English people feel left behind by metropolitan elites in London and the South East, and by devolved governments and strengthened regional identities in Scotland and Wales. ""Their heartfelt cry to be heard is often disregarded, wilfully misunderstood or patronised as backwardly xenophobic."" ""What we need is an expansive vision of what it means to be English as part of the UK. This will help us rediscover a national unity more fractured than I have ever known it in my lifetime,"" he added. The English question: What is the nation's identity? How proud is your area of being English? Don't let north get 'left behind' Tory MPs warn PM Archbishop Cottrell's comments come after the Euro 2020 football tournament sparked a debate about English patriotism. In his article for the Daily Telegraph, the archbishop suggested the different nations of the UK should sing their own individual anthems when they play each other in sporting events, before singing the national anthem, God Save the Queen, together. England reached the Euro 2020 final last month It comes afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson visited Scotland earlier this weekto promote the benefits of the union - his first trip since a pro-independence majority was returned at the Holyrood election in May. Archbishop Cottrell also argued there should be greater devolution for England, suggesting: ""Westminster would hold on to those big issues to do with our shared sovereignty, while empowering the separate nations and regions to serve their own localities better."" However, last month Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who is responsible for devolution policy and strengthening the union,said the system meaning only English MPs vote on matters that affect England should be scrapped. He said the ""English votes for English laws"" procedure, which was introduced in 2015, had ""not served our Parliament well"". The prime minister has also promised to ""level up"" the country, offering opportunities and investment to communities that felt left behind, such as in the Midlands and northern England. In response to Archbishop Cottrell's comments a spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""We are investing billions of pounds to support and regenerate local communities, empowering people to have more control over their areas."" The spokesperson highlighted plans for new ""county deals"", which would aim to give other local leaders the same powers as metro mayors.

"German coach thrown out for horse punchThe coach, who appeared to strike a horse during the modern pentathlon, has been thrown out of the Olympics.BBC Sport","Saint Boy repeatedly refused to jump, leaving rider Annika Schleu in tears Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. A German coach has been thrown out of the Olympics for appearing to punch a horse who was refusing to jump or trot during the modern pentathlon. Coach Kim Raisner was heard on German TV urging tearful athlete Annika Schleu to ""really hit"" the horse while shestruggled to controlSaint Boy during the showjumping round of Friday's women's event. Schleu had been leading the event before the equestrian, where athletes are given just 20 minutes to bond with a horse they have never ridden. Modern pentathlon's governing body, the UIPM, said it had reviewed video footage that appeared to show Raisner - who competed at the 2004 Olympics in modern pentathlon - striking the horse with her fist. ""Her actions were deemed to be in violation of the UIPM competition rules, which are applied to all recognised modern pentathlon competitions including the Olympic Games,"" the governing body said in a statement. ""The UIPM Executive Board [EB] has given a black card to the Germany team coach Kim Raisner, disqualifying her from the remainder of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. ""The EB decision was made today at the Tokyo Stadium before the resumption of the men's modern pentathlon competition.""

""A lot of people were pinning their hopes on midnight last night [for the end of restrictions] but that got cancelled,"" said Mr Newman, who is part of the Croeso Pubs chain. ""So what you will see tonight is an even bigger party in Cardiff central, which is what we are famous for.""

Choong followed Kate French's victory on Friday in the women's event by becoming the first British man to win individual modern pentathlon gold. Josh Kerr inthe 1500mand diverTom Daleywon bronzes, with silver for cyclistsMatt Walls and Ethan Hayter. Team GB are fifth in the medal table with one day remaining. They have won 63 medals in total, the same as the Russian Olympic Committee who have won more silvers. Australia are in sixth place. Daley's bronze in the men's 10m platform was hissecond medal in Tokyoand came two hours after Yafai won his gold. Walls, the men's omnium champion in Tokyo, collected another medal in the velodrome - this time alongside madison partner Hayter. Kerr claimed Britain's first men's Olympic 1500m medal since Peter Elliott's silver in Seoul 33 years ago. The United States' victory in the 4x400m women's relay meant Allyson Felix is now the nation's most decorated track and field athlete, an 11th Olympic medal taking her past sprint and long jump great Carl Lewis. Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage All the action as it happened from day 15 Tokyo 2020 medal table Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Nielsen Gracenote: ""Great Britain have ended the penultimate day of Tokyo 2020 with 63 medals, one more than at this stage at London 2012 and three fewer than Rio 2016 after 15 days. The 20 gold medals are seven behind Rio and eight behind London. The final day in Rio delivered Joseph Joyce's boxing silver medal. In London, Anthony Joshua won boxing gold on the last day amongst three medals. ""This year though, there are track cycling events on the last day with Jack Carlin and Laura Kenny as strongest potential medallists. In addition, Team GB have a guaranteed 64th medal from Lauren Price and Callum Hawkins amongst the best marathon runners."" On Great Britain v ROC for fourth place: ""As expected, ROC won three gold medals to overtake Great Britain on the medal table on day 15. Both have 20 gold medals but ROC have won five more silvers. On Sunday, ROC have two opportunities to win golds - in rhythmic gymnastics and handball. Russia won both of these events at the last Olympic Games and are favourites to win both again. To finish fourth on the medal table, Great Britain probably need to win two gold medals on Sunday and hope that ROC do not win both of these events.""

The 2019 world champion led going into the fourth event, equestrian, where riders are randomly paired with horses, and he drew Clntino, just as French had on Friday. Choong maintained his lead, and kept his composure in the final laser run to seal a memorable GB double. ""To be honest, I just didn't want Kate to have all the limelight,"" joked the 26-year-old from Kent, who was 10th at Rio 2016. ""I've always said I wanted to be the best in the world. This is literally a dream come true. ""I pulled myself together and this time I've nailed it."" At Rio 2016, Daley was heartbroken afterbombing out of the men's 10m platform semi-finals. Five years later, he qualified fourth for the final in Tokyo behind Chinese pair Cao Yuan and Yang Jian, and Aleksandr Bondar of the Russian Olympic Committee. The 27-year-old, whowon gold in the synchronised eventwith Matty Lee, led the competition through the halfway point and was guaranteed his second medal of the Games after his final attempt, with the trio who finished above him in the semi-finals still to dive. Bondar was too far behind to challenge, and though Cao and Yang took gold and silver respectively, Daley wrote his name in the history books as the first British diver to secure four Olympic medals. This video can not be played 'You superhero!' - Daley wins 10m platform bronze Daley reached two finals on his Olympic debut, aged 13, at the 2008 Games and won his first Olympic medal at London 2012 - a bronze in the 10m platform.

Twice an individual world champion, Daley finallyended a long wait for Olympic goldalongside Lee in an emotional and nerve-filled men's synchronised 10m platform final last week.

Since then, the 28-year-old has enjoyed a steady stream of medals, winning silver at the 2017 Europeans, gold at the 2018 Commonwealths and bronze at the 2019 European Games. The Birmingham fighter, whose brothers Gamal and Kal are both professional boxers, claimed his biggest title of all and Great Britain's fifth boxing medal of a guaranteed six in Tokyo with a 4-1 points decision victory over Paalam at the Kokugikan Arena.

Cash prize jackpot offered for double-jab students,"Sussex medical student Dibon Somarib gets his jab Students who are double-vaccinated against Covid-19 are being offered the chance to win one of 10 Â£5,000 jackpots at an English university. The University of Sussex scheme is the latest incentive on offer to drive up vaccination rates among young people. All students are being entered into the draw, with 10 winners able to claim a Â£5,000 prize each, if they can prove they are double-jabbed or exempt. Ministers are urging universities to be creative in efforts to boost take-up. Professor Adam Tickell, the vice-chancellor at Sussex, said the prize raffle was worth it if the numbers being vaccinated could be boosted even slightly. ""We know take-up among young people is patchy,"" he said. ""We know they're not against the vaccine, they're just not getting round to it."" He added the financial cost to the university of the scheme was small compared to the human and social cost of potential disruption to students. ""We know transmission rates are lower with vaccination, and the risk of serious illness for our staff and students is much lower in people who've been vaccinated."" Malvina says students need to keep each other safe by getting vaccinated Vaccination remains voluntary for students, and there has been growing concern about the relatively low take-up by young adults. Malvina Sakurai Yau, 19, who is going into her third year of an International Relations degree at Sussex, had her first jab in June, and is waiting for her second. She said that although Covid-19 is generally a mild disease for younger people, vaccination is the best option because ""you don't know what would happen if you caught it."" She added: ""Coronavirus is such a big thing at the moment, and it's important we protect our community and the people around us. ""We are all fellow-students. Our lectures are with quite a lot of other people and we don't know about the health background of these other people, or if they're in contact with people at risk. ""A lot of us are just yearning to be back on campus and for the chance to do things in person - this is going to help."" Uni clearing may be 'much more competitive' - Ucas The university says its scheme is designed to provide an incentive for students to have both doses. The prize draw will be in late November, to allow students who have their first dose on arrival at university a chance to win. Some students with their 18th birthday in late August or September, may not have been able to have both doses before starting their first year at university. Winners will be selected randomly and can claim their prize by presenting proof of both doses of a coronavirus vaccine or medical exemption. This video can not be played Covid vaccine: How are young people responding to the jab? Professor Tickell got the idea after hearing on a BBC programme that universities in the US were offering incentives for vaccination. RecentNHS England data revealed those aged 18 -34 now make up more than a fifth of those admitted to hospital with Coronavirus. The government has said proof of vaccination will be required for nightclubs from September. Universities minister Michelle Donelan said: ""Vaccines are the surest way to put Covid behind us and for students to reclaim the freedoms that enrich university life. ""The department is encouraging universities to look at creative ways to boost uptake, and to discuss the possibility of pop-up centres with local health partners - making it quick and easy for students to grab a jab.""

Apple criticised for system that detects child abuse,"Apple announced the new technology on Thursday Apple is facing criticism over a new system that finds child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on US users' devices. The technology will search for matches of known CSAM before the image is stored onto iCloud Photos. But there are concerns that the technology could be expanded and used by authoritarian governments to spy on its own citizens. WhatsApp head Will Cathcart called Apple's move ""very concerning"". Apple said that new versions of iOS and iPadOS - due to be released later this year - will have ""new applications of cryptography to help limit the spread of CSAM online, while designing for user privacy"". The system will report a match which is then manually reviewed by a human. It can then take steps to disable a user's account and report to law enforcement. The company says that the new technology offers ""significant"" privacy benefits over existing techniques - as Apple only learns about users' photos if they have a collection of known child sex abuse material in their iCloud account. But WhatsApp's Mr Cathcart says the system ""could very easily be used to scan private content for anything they or a government decides it wants to control. Countries where iPhones are sold will have different definitions on what is acceptable"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He argues that WhatsApp's system to tackle child sexual abuse material has reported more than 400,000 cases to the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children without breaking encryption. Should encryption be curbed to combat child abuse? Facebook encryption âmust not cause children harmâ The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, has also criticised the move, labelling it ""a fully-built system justwaiting for external pressure to make the slightest change"",external. But some politicians have welcomed Apple's development. Sajid Javid, UK Health Secretary, said it was time for others, especially Facebook, to follow suit. US Senator Richard Blumenthal also praised Apple's move, calling it a ""welcome, innovative and bold step"". ""This shows that we can protect childrenand our fundamental privacy rights,external,"" he added. Facebook and Apple don't like each other. That dislike has come to a head in recent months over privacy Apple's Tim Cook has consistently beaten the drum of ""privacy first"". He has not so subtly criticised Facebook's business model - that it essentially sells peoples' data to advertisers. A recent feature of Apple's new iOS update asked users whether they wanted to be tracked around the internet when they downloaded a new app. Facebook hated the move, and warned shareholders it could hurt their profits. So it's not entirely surprising that Facebook owned WhatsApp has come out so emphatically against Apple's new move. Looking at it cynically, Apple's announcement is a chance for Facebook to tell the world that Apple isn't as keen on privacy as it likes to say. But the WhatsApp chief isn't alone in his criticism. There are some very real concerns that this technology - in the wrong hands - could be used by governments to spy on its citizens. Facebook has said in no uncertain terms that it thinks this vision of online safety is dangerous and should be canned. Not for the first time the two companies have illustrated a totally different philosophical position on of the issues of our age -privacy.

Ten passengers injured in Tokyo train knife attack,"This video can not be played At least 10 people were injured when a man attacked passengers with a knife on a Tokyo commuter train A man attacked fellow passengers with a knife on a Tokyo commuter train late on Friday, injuring 10. The suspect, 36, allegedly told police he became angry when he saw women who ""looked happy"" and wanted to kill them, according to local media reports. One victim, a female student, is said to be seriously injured, while the others suffered less severe injuries. Violent crime is rare in Japan and tight security measures are in place in Tokyo, which is hosting the Olympics. The man attacked passengers on a train near Seijogakuen station at about 20:40 (11:40 BST) on Friday. The train was brought to an emergency stop by the driver after they heard noises coming from inside the carriages. According to investigators, the suspect jumped onto the tracks and fled. Train crew guided the passengers along the tracks to the nearest station. Nine out of the 10 injured were taken to hospital One witness, who was on the train, told NHK news that people suddenly started running towards him,fleeing from one car to another,external. The suspect later walked into a convenience store and told staff that he was ""the suspect in the incident reported by news media"" and was tired of fleeing. Tokyo Metropolitan Police confirmed early on Saturday they had seized a man in his 30s but did not confirm reports of his arrest or give any further details. Nine out of the 10 injured were taken to hospital while the other walked away from the scene. Despite Japan being one of the safest countries in the world, there have been a number of knife attacks in recent years. In 2019, a man attackeda group of schoolchildren waiting for a bus in Kawasaki. Two people were killed and at least 18 were injured. Did you witness what happened?

Top Afghan media officer assassinated in Kabul Indian photojournalist killed in Afghanistan Taliban capture first Afghan regional capital Mr Raab's letter follows a plea from a group of newspapers and broadcasters who wrote to the UK government to urge that Afghan journalists, translators and fixers be treated the same as interpreters who worked for the British armed forces. Since 2013, some Afghan interpreters who had put their lives at risk by working with the British military have been permitted to relocate to the UK, with their families. Mr Raab wrote that the ""freedom"" of global media outlets was a ""priority"" for the government. He added: ""The vibrant Afghan media is one of the greatest successes in Afghanistan in the last 19 years, and it should be celebrated and protected. ""Your letter highlighted the threat faced by Afghan staff who have worked for your media organisations in Afghanistan, in particular the risk of reprisals they face from the Taliban from their association with the UK. ""Under existing schemes, we are able to consider individual cases for relocation on an exceptional basis, where there is evidence they are under imminent threat due to the nature of their engagement with the UK.

Wales prepares for end of most Covid rules,"Pubs were busy as rugby fans headed out to watch the Lions face South Africa Towns and cities in Wales are getting busy, with a ""big party"" predicted after the end of most Covid regulations. Wales has moved to Covid alert level zero, meaning social distancing rules and most other restrictions have ended. Nick Newman of the Cardiff Licensees Forum said bars started filling up from 11:00 BST. Masks are still needed in shops, and First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people to be sensible. 'Weâre going out and weâre buzzing' Be sensible, says Wales' top doctor Q&A: What are the new Covid rules in Wales? The UK government said on Saturday a further 103 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, with 28,612 cases confirmed. Case rates in Wales are the lowest of the four nations, but chief medical officer Frank Atherton has said the country remains in a ""third wave of coronavirus infection"". Mr Newman said customers had been ""fantastic"" and ""voted with their feet"" throughout the pandemic when restrictions allowed. ""A lot of people were pinning their hopes on midnight last night [for the end of restrictions] but that got cancelled,"" said Mr Newman, who is part of the Croeso Pubs chain. ""So what you will see tonight is an even bigger party in Cardiff central, which is what we are famous for."" ""At 11am, we saw the bars start to fill up, with it the first day of the football season and then the Lions after."" How will we adjust to life without so many rules? Hospitality rules change after '18 months of hell' However, he said some measures remained in place. At one of his pubs, The Philharmonic, thermal imagining cameras will determine who is allowed in, and there will be hand sanitisers. Tiny Rebel Brewery staff and customers celebrated ""freedom day"" in Newport The first minister said on Friday he wasconfident Wales was on the ""final lap""of emerging from the pandemic, providing there were no ""further unexpected turns in the course of the virus"". However, he warned against a ""free-for-all"" after most restrictions ended. In England,most rules were relaxed on 19 July, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson postponed so-called ""Freedom Day"" by a month when cases of the Delta variant surged. Most restrictions in Scotland will end on Monday NI has highest Covid-19 infection rate in UK The 103 additional coronavirus deaths reported in the UK on Saturday brings the total to 130,281 since the start of the pandemic. Across the UK, 86,207,851 Covid jabs were administered on Friday, with 46,997,495 first doses and 39,210,356 second doses. Bosses at Galeri theatre and cinema in Caernarfon said a questionnaire among customers showed some wanted to keep social distancing in place. ""We feel we need time to talk with staff and our customers and make sure that everyone feels safe moving forwards,"" said team leader Naomi Saunders. ""For the time being we are keeping with social distancing due to the fact that the announcement has come so last minute."" Towns and cities around Wales have been busy with the end of social distancing, including Caernarfon The Three Horseshoes pub in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf, will see live acts, pool and darts return on Saturday for the first time since before the pandemic. Landlord Martin Barron said: ""I think people will look forward to it, you can watch an act, grab a beer and it gives people a reason to come out."" He said it would be operating at about 80% capacity because ""we are trying to get to normal but the risk is still there"". Customers can order at the bar of The Three Horseshoes again, but Mr Barron has put control measures in place to limit any risk The Welsh Beer and Pub Association has welcomed the end of restrictions and said it meant more than 150 pubs in Wales which had yet to reopen could now do so on Saturday. Emma McClarkin, chief executive, said: ""This is the good news our brewers and pubs in Wales have been waiting for. ""A pint on Saturday is going to taste all the sweeter."" Although staff are relieved about easing restrictions, they still want customers to feel safe Staff at a cafe in Newport have also welcomed the relaxation of mask rules, calling it a ""huge relief"". Laura Leach, who owns the Restpoint Cafe, said: ""A lot of our customers come in for the social aspect, so trying to have a conversation while wearing a mask makes it impossible."" She also said it would ease pressures on her and staff to ""challenge non-mask wearers"", after ""hardly anyone was complying"" with the rules after the first lockdown. Ms Leach said staff would be thrilled to remove their masks while in the kitchen but would still wear masks when serving and continue social distancing. Retailer Philip Bottrill has been preparing his stationery shop for fewer restrictions Philip Bottrill, of The Pen & Paper Stationery Co in Cardiff, said everyone needed to move ""steadily"" and ""gently"" toward normality. ""It isn't going to happen overnight,"" he said. ""But we do need to build our trade up because, since we've reopened, we are only taking about 60% of what we took in 2019."" While some are excited to see restrictions eased, for others it is a more daunting prospect. Sasha Robbins, a wheelchair user with cerebral palsy from Pontypridd said she felt ""excited"" about rules relaxing but was ""really cautious"" about the future after shielding throughout the pandemic. Shielding advice was paused on 1 April this year, with no expectation that people would need to shield again in the future,chief medical officer Frank Atherton said,external. ""Prior to it [the pandemic] I had a really active social life but now I've noticed there's things out there that I can't control,"" she said. That became more of a realisation for Ms Robbins, 32, when her father contracted Covid-19 when visiting the hospital for a routine check-up. âWeâve been shut out for quite some time,â Ms Robbins says He ended up in intensive care and lost his leg. She said she was worried about people's attitudes now that almost all social restrictions are being relaxed and has faced some unpleasant experiences during the pandemic. Disabled 'pushed out' of post-lockdown world Blind people in Wales frustrated by vaccine access ""Some venomous things have been said to me just because I'm me and I don't understand it,"" she said. She urged people not to ""forget"" disabled people. Rhian Davies, chief executive of Disability Wales said she feared disabled people would be locked out of society. Ms Davies said the unlocking of restrictions could ""exacerbate a two-tier system of people feeling like a second-class citizen"" without ""strong messaging from public bodies"". ""Just because someone isn't a wheelchair user, hasn't got a white cane or a guide dog, doesn't mean they're not at risk,"" she said. Jessica Leigh, from disability charity Scope, said many disabled people would be anxious about the changes. ""The government's decision to lift restrictions leaves some clinically extremely vulnerable people or those not yet vaccinated at the mercy of others' goodwill,"" she said. The first competitive community rugby matches in Wales since March 2020 are set to take place around Wales on Saturday Crickhowell Rugby Club will play its first competitive community match since February 2020. Bleddyn Carrington, team manager and full-back, said ""everyone is like a coiled spring ready to go"". ""Players are excited, the chats on the WhatsApp group are getting a bit intense,"" he said. ""You get nervous thinking 'am I good enough after 18 months?'"" Six weeks ago the team were not able to do contact drills, train for more than one hour and use showers, but Saturday marks a return to competitive action. The team played its first friendly match on 19 July against Brecon Seconds but Mr Carrington said it would not compare to being in the competitive environment.
