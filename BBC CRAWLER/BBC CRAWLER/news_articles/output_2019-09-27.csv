Army investigating soldier's 'perish' tweet at MP,"Angela Rayner took a screenshot of the soldier's tweet as an example of ""vile"" abuse The Army and police are investigating after a soldier sent an offensive tweet to Labour MP Angela Rayner. The soldier's Twitter account - which has now been deleted - posted a message swearing at Ms Rayner and saying she ""will perish when civil war comes"". Ms Rayner called it an example of a ""usual vile tweet I get daily"". Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said it was ""unacceptable"", while a senior Army commander apologised and said it ""is being dealt with"". It comes as MPs have spoken more frankly about the abuse they face amid a row over the language used by politicians.

In the tweet, the soldier said: ""17.4 million people are gunning for blood if we don't leave"". Ms Rayner shared the screenshot and later tweeted: ""I have constantly called out abuse publicly against elected MPs including to Tories as I think our democracy is built on mutual respect for difference and the rule of law. ""What's being unleashed is ugly and should be condemned by all."" On Friday,Mr Wallace said:,external""This is an unacceptable tweet from a member of the British Army to Angela Rayner.

Labour promises to scrap universal credit,"Mr Corbyn made the announcement at a rally in the constituency of Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith, who originally implemented the universal credit scheme A future Labour government would scrap universal credit - which merges six benefits into one payment, the party's leader Jeremy Corbyn has announced. He promised an interim benefit payment after two weeks, across the UK, to replace a five-week waiting period. Labour has branded universal credit ""cruel and inhumane"". The government said Labour's plans were ""reckless"" and amounted to ""political point-scoring"", but acknowledged there was work to do to improve the system. Universal credit is being introduced in stages across the UK. What is universal credit? Supporters of the welfare reform say it helps to simplify a complicated benefits system - and ensures no-one would be better off claiming benefits than working. But it has been controversial since its introduction in 2013, with critics saying it has made life harder for those receiving it. Some women have described beingforced into sex workbecause of the failings of the scheme, while landlords have said some tenants haveslipped into rent arrearssince being put on universal credit. A loophole in the online system has been exploited to make fraudulent applicationsand claim advance loans, with millions of pounds stolen as a result. This video can not be played Jade Thomas was left hundreds of pounds out of pocket by a universal credit fraudster Mr Corbyn said the welfare state ideal had been ""sliced apart, cut apart and destroyed"". He promised that a Labour government would introduce ""an emergency package of reforms"" leading up to scrapping universal credit including: ending capability for work assessment tests scrapping the two-child limit, whereby families only receive welfare support for the first two children of a family suspending sanctions whereby a claimant's support can be reduced if they miss appointments Labour also wants to drop the benefit cap which limits the amount of benefit a person can receive. Shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said while the system could not be ""completely replaced overnight"", the announcement was ""more than an aspiration"" and ""the next Labour government will replace universal credit"". Mr Corbyn made his announcement at a rally in Chingford and Woodford Green alongside Faiza Shaheen, Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate for the constituency at the next election. The London seat is currently held by Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith, who originally implemented the universal credit scheme when he was work and pensions secretary. Ahead of the rally, Labour said Mr Corbyn was critical of the welfare project for being ""over-budget"", calling it ""inhumane"" for the way it would ""punish and police"" applicants, and make them wait five weeks for their first payment. In his speech, Mr Corbyn said Labour would bring in 5,000 benefit advisers to help applicants. Officials say claimants can receive payment immediately if an emergency arises Labour also says it would drop the system's ""digital-only"" requirement, arguing that it excludes those who do not have access to the internet. The Department for Work and Pensions argues claimants can get paid urgently if required. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said: ""This is totally irresponsible from Jeremy Corbyn, who now admits he would happily scrap financial support for vulnerable people with no plan as to what Labour would replace it with."" The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said it would welcome significant reform ""but any changes need to avoid further upheaval for those who depend on it"". The charity's director for policy and partnerships, Helen Barnard, said Labour's proposals appeared to ""get rid of some of the worst bits of universal credit which we know are pulling some people into really difficult poverty and debt"", citing sanctions and the five-week wait for the first payment. However, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there were also aspects of the system, including the way it avoids people moving to a different benefit when they begin work, which should be preserved. Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson said while Labour was proposing a series of changes to universal credit, the announcement did not appear to be calling for an end to the idea of merging six benefits into one payment, which he said had simplified the system. Food bank charity the Trussell Trust welcomed the end of the five-week wait - as proposed by Labour - but warned that the party's plans could create further problems. It said that ""scrapping universal credit may only result in further upheaval"". Universal credit combines six ""legacy benefits"" into one monthly, means-tested payment. The legacy benefits are working tax credit, child tax credit, jobseeker's allowance, income support, employment support allowance and housing benefit A single universal credit payment is paid directly into the claimant's bank account each month More than 1.5m people across Great Britain currently receive benefits through universal credit Source:House of Commons Library,external How are universal credit rules changing?

Mums forced into sex work by universal credit,"Women say being left short of money by universal credit is forcing them to make desperate decisions ""I would drop my son off on a Friday and start to get goosebumps thinking, 'I know what I've got to go and do tonight'."" Alison says she became a prostitute as a last resort after being left short of money by universal credit. Her story is becoming familiar to the group of MPs looking into ""survival sex"" - women being forced into sex as a result of the changes to benefits. ""This is something that shouldn't be happening in a wealthy nation,"" says independent MP Heidi Allen, who's on that Work and Pensions Committee. ""I'm shocked, embarrassed and I'm angry."" Universal credithelps with living costs, replacing six benefits including housing benefit and child tax credit. But since its introduction in 2013, it's been accused of making things harder for people receiving it. Alison had her son - who is disabled - when she was 18 years old and has relied on the benefit system to support them both. ""There are some weeks after you've paid your bills, you don't have enough and you think, 'I have to do it'."" An inquiry is looking into claims that women on universal credit are being forced to rely on sex work to survive Alison is matter of fact about the situation. She says making money to support herself and her son was always the priority, but admits the experiences have left her traumatised. ""I always have lots of showers. Once there was this guy, I could smell him on me afterwards - a big, disgusting man. ""He said he deliberately didn't wash for a week because he wanted to be near a woman that's clean. It's disgusting. ""One guy, his mum opened the door and he was in the shed in the back trying to make me do drugs, so I had to escape."" She pauses. ""I do get scared of dying - some men take things to a whole other level."" The Work and Pensions Committee - chaired by independent MP Frank Field - launched an inquiry in March after listening to the concerns of charities. The English Collection of Prostitutes - which campaigns for the safety and decriminalisation of sex workers and has often linked universal credit to sex work - has given evidence to the group. Heidi Allen says she quit the Conservative Party because ""they've got it wrong"" on universal credit Heidi Allen says she quit the Conservative Party earlier in the year because of the party's rollout of universal credit. ""The welfare state should be there to pick you up when you are at your lowest. ""At the moment rather than a net that's holding people up, it's dragging them down and that's the bit we need to change."" Around 700,000 lone parents miss out on an average Â£2,380 per year because of universal credit, the Institute Of Fiscal Studies says. Research economist Tom Waters says it's to do with timing: ""You have to wait at least five weeks now to get your first benefit payment. ""Although the government has made advances available for that period, that can be a difficult time for people that don't have many other resources to draw on."" Many users with computer access say the ""confusing"" online system makes the process even more difficult Alison says having a disabled son to care for makes it harder for her to find a job that fits her schedule. ""The government needs to get a system in where they can put enough money in people's banks. ""They really need to understand we're not like them - we haven't got loads of money."" Mrs Allen and Frank Field have been ""humbled"" by what people have shared with them around the UK. Both will be making recommendations to Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Amber Rudd, but Heidi Allen is worried. ""Amber's the best on this and gets it, but when we have a new Prime Minister [on 23 July] all the ministers will probably change. ""We could be back to the drawing board again."" Women have given anonymous evidence to a committee looking into the scale of the problem ""What changed my mind was hearing the testimony of some of the women in front of the committee,"" says MP Will Quince, a minister for family support at the Department of Work and Pensions. He'd originally dismissed the link between sex work and universal credit as ""anecdotal"" but has now done a U-turn. His job isn't safe either but he says that won't stop him from raising awareness. ""Don't underestimate our determination - even if I'm on the back benches we will continue to be a champion on this and other issues because we feel strongly about it."" Alison has not given evidence to the inquiry over fears of social services being alerted - which the commission has reassured won't happen. However, she says she's stopped doing sex work due to being in a loving relationship. ""I'm still on universal credit and my partner helps to looks after me and my son."" She goes quiet for a bit when asked if she'd ever return to sex work to make ends meet. ""Honestly, I dread thinking about if we ever split up and it's just me and my son.

UK 'planning concrete Brexit proposals',"This video can not be played Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay: ""There's still a long way to go"". The UK government is planning to put out ""concrete proposals"" next week for reaching a Brexit deal with the EU, the BBC understands. Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said it was expected they would be revealed after the Tory conference but in time for scrutiny ahead of the EU summit on 17 October. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the ""moment of truth"" was approaching. The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 31 October. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says this will happen whether or not there is a new deal with Brussels - but adds that he would prefer leaving with a deal. However, MPs have passed a law requiring Mr Johnson to seek an extension to the deadline from the bloc if he is unable to pass a deal in Parliament, or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit, by 19 October. Meanwhile, Scotland's first minister has warned that Mr Johnson could force through a no-deal Brexit unless the opposition acts. Nicola Sturgeon saidshe was ""open-minded"" about who might emerge to lead a temporary governmentif Mr Johnson is removed from office in a vote of no confidence. BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said he had been told by a senior SNP source that the party's MPs were prepared to put Mr Corbyn in 10 Downing Street ""as soon as next week"" to extend the Brexit deadline and call an election. EU leaders consider 'likely' new Brexit extension What are the Brexit backstop options? Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? Why is the Irish border blocking a Brexit deal? Mr Barclay held talks with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Friday, telling the BBC afterwards: ""I think there is still a long way to go. I think we are coming to the moment of truth in these negotiations. ""We are committed to securing a deal. The prime minister has made clear he wants a deal, but there has to be political will on both sides and that's what we are exploring."" The biggest obstacle to a deal is the backstop - the plan to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The policy - agreed to by former PM Theresa May in her withdrawal deal with the EU, which was rejected three times by Parliament - is unacceptable to many Conservative MPs. Stephen Barclay and Michel Barnier met for Brexit talks in Brussels But the European Commission said Mr Barnier had stressed to Mr Barclay during the meeting that it was ""essential"" there was a ""fully operational solution in the withdrawal agreement to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, protect the all-island economy and the integrity of the single market"". ""The EU remains open and willing to examine any workable and legally operative proposals that meet all these objectives,"" a statement issued after the meeting said. If the UK's new proposals prove acceptable to the EU it would trigger a frantic period of treaty-making. The experts at the European Commission would have to assess whether they are legally watertight and politically acceptable. The 27 other member states would have to be consulted and the deal tweaked if they had concerns. Ideally this would all be done a week before the summit of EU leaders of 17 October. That's an incredibly - and I mean incredibly - tight timeline by the standards of the Brexit processâ¦ by any EU process. And Brussels diplomats are very gloomy because they say the ideas tabled so far by the UK do not go in the right direction. Some think that means there's virtually no chance of agreement being reached next month. Although if the prime minister is only going to unveil his plans when Tory party conference has finished, does that mean he has an ace up his sleeve that he knows will satisfy the EU and antagonise his own party?

Farage warns Johnson over 'reheated Brexit deal',"Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has warned Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to return from Brussels with Theresa May's ""reheated deal"". At a rally in London, he said the Tories will ""lose votes to us"" in ""huge numbers"" when voters ""realise nothing has changed"" if they keep that deal. He then criticised Labour's ""policy of uncontrolled mass immigration"". The party also unveiled some policy plans, but little detail, including scrapping HS2 and inheritance tax. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October. Mrs May's deal was rejected three times by MPs, with the Irish backstop - a policy Mr Johnson has said he wants to scrap - proving a major sticking point. The policy is aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. Where do the parties stand on Brexit? No 10 rejects Nigel Farage election pact proposal Labour votes to defend free movement Mr Farage told the crowd of supporters, referring to the prime minister and his senior adviser: ""Mr Johnson, Mr Cummings - if you do get this through, that you can sell this as Brexit, you're in for a big surprise. ""The British people won't swallow it if they realise nothing has changed, they will not put up with it and you will lose votes to us in absolutely huge numbers - heed that warning please."" He reiterated his pledge that if Mr Johnson campaigns in a general election ""for a clean-break Brexit"" then ""far from fighting against him we will work with him with a non-aggression pact"" - something which has already been rejected by Number 10. ""To get this done, we will always put country before party,"" he said. Mr Farage went on to criticise Labour for changing its policy on freedom of movement. The Labour Party's 2017 manifesto vowed to end free movement when the UK leaves the European Union, but delegates at the party conference last week voted overwhelmingly to reject that. Mr Farage said Labour had decided ""to embark upon a policy of uncontrolled mass immigration into Britain"". ""All of us in this party recognise that immigration can be a very good and a very positive thing for our nation, but you have to control it sensibly and selectively,"" he said. He said the Brexit Party would be the ""main challenger"" to the Labour Party in ""many traditional parts of this country, seats they've held for 100 years"". The rally was the final date of the party's ""we are ready"" conference tour, which took place in 10 venues across England and Wales and featured some of the party's prospective parliamentary candidates. The party says it has pledged to invest Â£200bn in transport and digital infrastructure outside London. Party chairman Richard Tice also unveiled some policies at the London event without going into detail, including: Scrapping the ""absurd"" HS2 scheme Abolishing inheritance tax Reducing by 50% the UK's foreign aid budget to fund public services Wifi access on public transport and ""not just the London tube"" Investment in broadband Change the interest on student loans to 0% The Brexit Party's final rally comes after a week of stormy debate in the House of Commons over the use of language. The prime minister was criticised by a number of MPs for - among other remarks - describing one Labour MP's safety concerns as ""humbug"" and repeatedly referring to legislation aimed at blocking no-deal as ""the surrender bill"". Mr Johnson has insisted he ""deplores any threats to anybody"". But Mr Farage said the ""real surrender"" will not be that piece of legislation, ""the real surrender, the real sell-out, will be to sign us up to a dreadful deal that will leave us trapped for year upon year"". ""Do not reheat Mrs May's deal. That would be surrender,"" he said. On the subject of ""the temperature of political debate"", Mr Farage referenced Commons Speaker John Bercow, former Labour PM Tony Blair and former Conservative PM John Major, all of whom were booed. He went on to describe former Tory MP - now Independent Group for Change leader - Anna Soubry as the ""least popular figure with Leave voters"". On a second referendum, Mr Farage said: ""Provided we were given a proper question with a genuine leave on the ballot paper we would vote to leave by a bigger margin."" He said there will ""not be violent riots on our streets because we have got a well-run sensible moderate democratic political party"".

PM's links to businesswoman referred to watchdog,"Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 The police watchdog is to decide whether or not to investigate Boris Johnson for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was London mayor. It is alleged businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Mr Johnson. The prime minister was referred by the Greater London Authority on Friday. Mr Johnson has denied any impropriety, while a government source described the referral as ""politically motivated"". The allegations regarding Mr Johnson's friendship with technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri first emerged last weekend inthe Sunday Times.,external They refer to claims that Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor of London and that her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants. PM defends actions over conflict of interest claims PM will explain Jennifer Arcuri links to City Hall The Greater London Authority's monitoring officer - whose job it is to monitor the conduct of the mayor and other members - said it had written to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). It said it had referred the PM to the IOPC ""so it can assess whether or not it is necessary to investigate the former mayor of London for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office"". It added that it has recorded a ""conduct matter"" against Mr Johnson which happens when there is information that indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed. But it does not mean that a criminal offence is proved in any way, the GLA's monitoring officer added. ""The IOPC will now consider if it is necessary for the matter to be investigated."" The reason the IOPC is involved is because the role of the mayor of London is also London's police and crime commissioner. The IOPC deals with complaints against police forces in England and Wales In a letter to the PM setting out the referral, the monitoring officer says: ""The conduct matter relates to your time as mayor of London between 2008 and 2016. ""During this time it has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits."" Responding to the referral, No 10 said: ""The prime minister, as Mayor of London, did a huge amount of work when selling our capital city around the world, beating the drum for London and the UK. ""Everything was done with propriety and in the normal way."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Everything done in the proper way"" A senior government source said the timing of the referral, coming days before the start of the Conservative Party conference, was ""overtly political"" and ""a politically motivated attack"". ""No evidence of any allegations has been provided by the monitoring officer nor was the PM given any opportunity to respond to the monitoring officer prior to the publishing of a press release late on a Friday night,"" the source said. ""The public and media will rightly see through such a nakedly political put-up job."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnelltweeted:,external""It's important to note that this was a decision by the GLA monitoring officer, who is a completely, independent non political official."" By the BBC's Home Affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford Ms Arcuri appearing on the BBC's Talking Business programme in 2013 The BBC has now spoken to several people who went on the overseas ""trade missions"" with Boris Johnson to Malaysia and Singapore, to New York, and to Tel Aviv. They said that Jennifer Arcuri seemed a bit out of place on the trips, as her companies were much less substantial than those of the other participants, Jennifer Arcuri was originally turned down for the trip to Malaysia and Singapore, but then re-applied using a different company and was accepted. She was told her companies were not relevant for the trip to New York, but she went under her own steam and was allowed into some of the events. She was also turned down for the Tel Aviv trip, but Boris Johnson's office intervened and she was allowed to join the trade mission. She paid for her own flight, and although the organisers of the trip, London & Partners, booked a hotel for her, she settled the bill. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson denied any wrongdoing, telling the BBC's John Pienaar: ""All I can say is I am very proud of what we did as mayor of London... particularly banging the drum for our city and country around the world."" He added: ""I can tell you that absolutely everything was done entirely in the proper way."" On Friday,Mr Johnson saidhe would comply with an order from the London Assembly to explain his links to Ms Arcuri. However he added: ""But on this particular matter, I think they are barking up the wrong tree."" Separately, a junior minister, Matt Warman, has said the government has launched a ""review"" of the Â£100,000 award made in February this year to Ms Arcuri's training company Hacker House.

'Clueless' police force's five key failings,"Cleveland Police has become the first force in England and Wales to be rated inadequate across all areas of performance. The police watchdog went so far as to say it is ""putting the public at risk"" - so what are its key failings? The organisation, which has lurched from one crisis to another in recent years, has had five chief constables since 2012 whenSean Price was sacked after lyingabout his role in the recruitment of the former police authority chairman's daughter. It was effectively put in special measures earlier this year, but Chief Constable Richard Lewis, who was appointed in April, has vowed to turn things around. As he admits,he has a difficult job on his hands. When staff were asked to provide feedback about how they saw the force operating, they described it as ""directionless, rudderless and clueless"". And with the publication of theHM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services report,external, the force's inadequacies have been laid bare for all to see. Inspectors said they had ""serious concerns the force is leaving vulnerable victims at risk"". They noted there were ""too many examples"" of officers not identifying vulnerable people - including children - and either providing a delayed response or failing to respond at all. Such failings led to it missing opportunities to safeguard the vulnerable and exposed them to danger and ""high levels of repeat victimisation"". In the 12 months to April 2019, the number of domestic abuse repeat victims increased by 21% compared with the previous 12 months, inspectors found. Nearly half of the incidents reported involved people who were repeat victims, but in ""too many cases"" officers were not proactively pursuing offenders. Some domestic abuse cases were investigated by officers who were not specially trained Additionally children in domestic abuse households were not classed as vulnerable and therefore exposed to harm. With not enough officers on shift, the force also struggled to respond to missing persons calls quickly. Inspectors found examples of youngsters being reported missing overnight and no-one trying to locate them until the next morning. 'Clueless' police force 'putting people at risk' Yasmin Khan, founder and director of Middlesbrough's Halo Project, which supports victims of honour-based violence, said some victims and survivors had had a ""terrible experience"". But Ms Khan, who is also part of the Cleveland Women's Network, said she had hopes the force's new chief constable would make changes. She added: ""We know of instances where investigations have not been carried out properly and, as a collective of women's charities on Teesside, we have had serious concerns about how some have been let down. ""But we have been encouraged by the responses by the new chief constable and hope that a collection of policy changes will make a difference. ""I believe they want to make positive changes."" Inspectors found there had been a ""significant deterioration"" in the way Cleveland Police prevents offences. Despite a 17.6% rise in crime in the past year and 12 killings, the report made the scathing assessment that ""crime prevention isn't a priority for the force and this is a cause of concern"". A lack of leadership was highlighted alongside issues over the way neighbourhood policing teams are staffed and operated. The way investigations are conducted attracted further criticism, with strategies described as ""ad hoc"" and ""not well co-ordinated"". The force allocated ""limited resources"" to neighbourhood policing teams Those issues mean the force ""doesn't engage well with its communities"" and ""doesn't fully understand local concerns"", the report concluded. Inspectors told the force to improve the quality of investigations, as well as taking immediate steps to ensure more direction is given and resources are properly allocated. The behaviour of high-ranking officers and staff set alarm bells ringing, with many ""not taking responsibility"" and concerns some were ""not acting with honesty, integrity and competence"". The inspectorate's report stated their behaviour was having a ""profoundly negative effect"". Leaders ""knew things were happening that put vulnerable victims at risk but were not taking action"" and made changes to processes without considering what impact they could have on victims and other vulnerable people. When inspectors asked for information about actions being taken by the force, senior officers were ""unable to provide evidence to support some of the things they claimed were happening"" with the watchdog finding a number of ""incorrect"" statements. Key information being passed on by officers to the chief constable was deemed not ""trustworthy"". Glen Teeley, chair of the Cleveland Police Federation, said: ""In the past there has been a lack of leadership and strategic direction, which has meant officers have been forced to deal with difficult circumstances for quite some time. ""This is on top of trying to manage unprecedented levels of demand with hugely diminished resources. ""However, we now have a new chief constable and a new senior management team. ""We will continue to work with him and support our members throughout the changes to ensure their welfare and wellbeing is prioritised so they can serve the public to the very best of their ability. ""Things can only get better from here."" Struggling to deal with all incidents involving vulnerable people, the force leaves over a third of them waiting for a response. In order to help the organisation meet its response time targets, officers frequently downgraded the severity of incidents. ""Priority"" calls requiring a response within 60 minutes were ""inappropriately downgraded"" to a lesser status, meaning victims endured a ""significantly longer wait"". Inspectors said the force was ""intentionally suppressing demand"" by inaccurately recording response figures While data showed the force had a 90% response rate to emergency incidents in April 2019, its actual response rate was 64%. Inspectors had already flagged up the issue to the force in July 2018, but it continued to report inaccurate data until the team visited again in May this year. Although some improvements had been made, the inspection team found the organisation is failing to identify officers and staff ""most at risk"" of corruption. Despite holding some information, it ""doesn't refer to profiling corrupt employees, identifying locations within the force where corruption is more prevalent, or understanding external corruptors"", inspectors said. Additionally, the force's assessment of counter-corruption threats did not match up with national categories. Inspectors reviewed 57 items of corruption intelligence and found 14 required further work. Examples were also found of staff restricting the parameters of corruption investigations and ignoring the possibility of other risks.

Harry crosses minefield and retraces Diana's steps,"Prince Harry sits beneath the Diana Tree, which marks the spot where Diana was pictured in the minefield The Duke of Sussex has visited the former minefield in Angola where his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, walked 22 years ago, shortly before she died. Prince Harry visited the site in Huambo, which has become a ""bustling community"" since Diana's campaign. Wearing body armour, he also visited a partially-cleared minefield nearby and set off a controlled explosion. Diana captured global attention when she walked through the live minefield in 1997. She never lived to see the full impact of her visit - such as the signing of an international treaty to outlaw the weapons - as she died later that year. Retracing his mother's footsteps in central Angola, Prince Harry is being escorted by the British landmine clearance charity the Halo Trust, which also accompanied Diana on her visit. Diana visited the minefield Huambo in Angola in 1997 The site is now a bustling community, and Prince Harry retraced his mother's steps on Princess Diana Street After walking along the suburban street, which was once filled with the explosives, the duke said it was ""quite emotional"" to retrace Diana's steps ""and to see the transformation that has taken place, from an unsafe and desolate place into a vibrant community of local businesses and colleges"". He added: ""Without question if she hadn't campaigned the way that she did, this arguably could still be a minefield. ""I'm incredibly proud of what she's been able to do, and meet these kids here who were born on this street."" The area has become a ""completely different place"" since demining and now is a ""bustling community"" with houses and schools and shops, added Camille Wallen, director of strategy at the Halo Trust. Earlier, Prince Harry visited a minefield near the south-eastern town of Dirico, which is in the process of being cleared. The site was mined by anti-government forces in 2000 when they retreated from their base. In 2005, a 13-year-old girl lost a foot after stepping on one of the explosive devices in the area. This video can not be played Prince Harry: ""Landmines are an unhealed scar of war"" Halo Trust staff have been working to make the minefield safe since August and hope to clear it by the end of October. Prince Harry was given a safety briefing and told not to stray off the cleared lanes, not to touch anything or run. In a speech, the duke said the Halo Trust was helping the community ""find peace"". ""Landmines are an unhealed scar of war. By clearing the landmines we can help this community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity,"" he said. ""Additionally, we can protect the diverse and unique wildlife that relies on the beautiful Kuito river that I slept beside last night."" Why Harry is following Diana's lead on landmines The prince called for an international effort to clear landmines from the Okavango watershed in the Angolan highlands, where the weapons remain 17 years after the end of a civil war. The conflict - between 1975 and 2002 - has left Angola one of the most mined places in the world, with around 1,200 minefields, according to the Halo Trust. The organisation says it has decommissioned almost 100,000 mines since 1994 but it is impossible to know exactly how many remain. There are two main types of mine: anti-personnel landmines, aimed at killing or injuring people, and anti-tank mines, designed to destroy vehicles. The random placement of the explosive devices became part of military strategy in the 1960s. Around 50 years later, about 60 countries and territories are still contaminated with anti-personnel mines. More than 120,000 people were killed or injured by landmines between 1999-2017, according toresearch by Landmine Monitor.,external Civilians made up 87% of casualties, while nearly half of the victims were children. Ms Wallen described Prince Harry's visit as a ""really significant moment"". ""As we saw in 1997, Princess Diana really helped raise awareness of the issue of landmines and the plight that people who live with landmines have every day,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""It effectively transformed what we do, and it transformed it for those people. They really felt they were being heard."" Princess Diana's involvement in the cause involved a call for a global ban on landmines. Three months after her death in 1997, 122 countries signed the Ottawa Treaty, which prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines. Ms Wallen said Prince Harry's visit helped ""remind the world that landmines are not just a thing of the past"". ""Decades after conflict they continue to threaten people's lives,"" she added. Angolan minister Lucio Goncalves Amaral said Diana's anti-mine campaign left a ""humanistic heritage"" that motivated the country's authorities to push to remove all the devices from the country by 2025. ""We will never forget her priceless contribution to the campaign to ban the anti-personnel landmines,"" Angola's deputy minister for social integration said in a speech. ""The Angolan people will be eternally grateful for her performance in the demining process of our territory."" Baby Archie meets Archbishop Tutu on royal tour Prince Harry 'troubled' by climate change deniers I'm your sister, Meghan tells South African girls Prince Harry, who is on a tour of southern Africa, visited Botswana on Thursday, where he helped plant trees. The duke said there was a race against time to stop global warming, adding he was ""troubled"" by climate-change deniers. On Wednesday, Prince Harry visited South Africa, where he and the Duchess of Sussex introduced their baby son to the veteran anti-apartheid campaigner, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The couple also met faith leaders at South Africa's first and oldest mosqueand visited a mental health charity. The duchess told teenage girls in a deprived part of the country she was visiting South Africa not only as a member of the Royal Family, but also ""as a woman of colour and as your sister"".

Trump whistleblower is CIA officer - reports,"This video can not be played Did Trump ask for ""a favour"" in return for aid to Ukraine? The whistleblower whose complaint has led to an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump is a CIA officer, US media report. The unnamed officer once worked at the White House, several US outlets said. The whistleblower says senior White House officials tried to ""lock down"" all details of a phone call between Mr Trump and the Ukrainian president. Mr Trump demanded to know who gave information to the whistleblower, saying the source was ""close to a spy"". In the call on 25 July, Mr Trump pushed Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his leading Democratic political rival, Joe Biden. The complaint, released on Thursday, says the call transcript was not stored in the usual computer system. Instead it was stored in a separate system used for classified information. Impeachment is a two-stage political process, rarely exercised, by which a US president can be removed from office for wrongdoing. Even if President Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives, he is unlikely to be forced out of the White House because Republicans control the Senate. Speaking to BBC's US affiliate CBS News, 2016 Democratic White House candidate Hillary Clinton said she supported an impeachment inquiry into the ""illegitimate president"", whom she also called a ""corrupt human tornado"". Mr Trump's re-election campaign has enjoyed a fundraising bump since the Democratic impeachment inquiry was announced on Tuesday. It has raised $13m (Â£10.5m), campaign officials told AP News. But the Ukraine controversy has also spawned a surge in donations to Mr Biden. His aides said the former vice-president has had his best week of fundraising since his campaign launched. A rough transcript of the conversation, released by the White House this week, shows that the president urged his newly elected Ukrainian counterpart to investigate discredited corruption allegations against Mr Biden and his son Hunter. ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that,"" he told Mr Zelensky. Democrats accuse Mr Trump of illegally seeking foreign help in the hope of smearing Mr Biden - who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election. What's the Trump-Ukraine story about? How easy is it to impeach a president? The US president also called on the Ukrainian leader to talk to US Attorney General William Barr and Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani about investigating Hunter Biden's past business dealings in Ukraine. Mr Trump is also accused of using military aid to Ukraine as a bargaining tool. The package - which has since been released - had been appropriated by Congress to support the interests of US interests in a friendly country. Mr Trump, a Republican, denies any wrongdoing and has dismissed the impeachment proceedings as a ""hoax"" and ""another witch-hunt"". He acknowledged that he had personally blocked nearly $400m (Â£324m) in military aid to Ukraine days before he spoke to Mr Zelensky, but denied that it was to pressure the Ukrainian leader into investigating Mr Biden. Few details are known. A lawyer for the whistleblower warned that trying to identify the person could place them ""in harm's way"". The New York Times, Washington Post, and Reuters news agency identified the whistleblower as a CIA officer. Meanwhile, an audio recording has emerged in which Mr Trump demands to know who provided information to the whistleblower - and describes them as ""close to a spy"". This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims ""I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information. Because that's close to a spy,"" the president said in private remarks to staff at the UN. The recording was provided to the Los Angeles Times. In an apparent reference to the execution of spies by the US in the past, he adds: ""You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right?"" The remarks were condemned by the Democratic chairmen of three House committees in the House of Representatives. In a joint statement they said the comments constituted ""reprehensible witness intimidation"". One Democrat said he wanted the whistleblower to talk to members of the House Intelligence Committee ""at the earliest"". ""I am concerned at some of the statements the president has been making about the whistleblower, and whether he's going to retaliate against the guy,"" said Representative Raja Kirshnamoorthi. The whistleblower's complaint accuses Mr Trump of ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the US 2020 election"". The declassified document characterises the president's conduct as a ""serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law"". This video can not be played US citizens react to the latest developments The whistleblower says they had learned from several sources that senior White House officials had intervened to ""lock down"" all records of the call, particularly an official word-for-word transcript. What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Trump call could embarrass Ukraine's president ""This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call,"" the whistleblower wrote in the complaint. The whistleblower says details of the call had been stored in a ""stand-alone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action"". The complaint makes clear that the whistleblower was ""not a direct witness"" to most of the events described, but found their colleagues' accounts to be credible. The release of the whistleblower complaint on Thursday came as lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee began to question President Trump's top intelligence official on the issue. Acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire had initially refused to share the complaint with Congress. But under questioning by the committee on Thursday, Mr Maguire said he believed the whistleblower had acted in ""good faith"" and ""did the right thing"". Committee chairman Adam Schiff, a Democrat, opened the hearing by accusing President Trump of a ""classic organised crime shakedown"". This video can not be played Mr Maguire said he believed the whistleblower had acted in ""good faith"" But the leading Republican on the committee, Devin Nunes, a Trump supporter, said: ""I want to congratulate the Democrats on their latest informational warfare operation against the president and their extraordinary ability to once again enlist the mainstream media in their campaign."" The president hit back at Mr Schiff on Friday for reading what the lawmaker later described as a ""parody"" version of the phone call, depicting Mr Trump as a mafia boss. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Schiff asked Mr Maguire why he had sought advice from the White House before deciding to release the whistleblower's report. ""It just seemed prudent to check,"" Mr Maguire responded, saying he had sought the advice of White House counsel to determine if the report included information protected by presidential executive privilege. He added: ""I believe everything in this matter is totally unprecedented."" During the call with Mr Zelensky, Mr Trump raised the 2016 removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. He went on to discuss Hunter Biden and the unsubstantiated allegation that his father - then the US vice-president - stopped an investigation of his son by lobbying Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin. The Ukrainian prosecutor general's office had an open inquiry into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Hunter Biden was a board member. No evidence has emerged of any wrongdoing by the Bidens. Mr Biden, along with other Western officials, had called for Mr Shokin to be fired because of the perception that he was soft on corruption. When Mr Shokin was replaced, his successor continued to investigate Burisma for 10 months before the inquiry ended. The US justice department said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had not spoken to the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate Mr Biden. Speaking at a fundraising event in San Marino, California, on Thursday, Mr Biden said: ""It's a tactic that's used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives.""

The complaint makes clear that the whistleblower was ""not a direct witness"" to most of the events described, but found their colleagues' accounts to be credible. The release of the whistleblower complaint on Thursday came as lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee began to question President Trump's top intelligence official on the issue. Acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire had initially refused to share the complaint with Congress. But under questioning by the committee on Thursday, Mr Maguire said he believed the whistleblower had acted in ""good faith"" and ""did the right thing"". Committee chairman Adam Schiff, a Democrat, opened the hearing by accusing President Trump of a ""classic organised crime shakedown"". This video can not be played Mr Maguire said he believed the whistleblower had acted in ""good faith"" But the leading Republican on the committee, Devin Nunes, a Trump supporter, said: ""I want to congratulate the Democrats on their latest informational warfare operation against the president and their extraordinary ability to once again enlist the mainstream media in their campaign."" The president hit back at Mr Schiff on Friday for reading what the lawmaker later described as a ""parody"" version of the phone call, depicting Mr Trump as a mafia boss. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Schiff asked Mr Maguire why he had sought advice from the White House before deciding to release the whistleblower's report. ""It just seemed prudent to check,"" Mr Maguire responded, saying he had sought the advice of White House counsel to determine if the report included information protected by presidential executive privilege. He added: ""I believe everything in this matter is totally unprecedented."" During the call with Mr Zelensky, Mr Trump raised the 2016 removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. He went on to discuss Hunter Biden and the unsubstantiated allegation that his father - then the US vice-president - stopped an investigation of his son by lobbying Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin. The Ukrainian prosecutor general's office had an open inquiry into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Hunter Biden was a board member. No evidence has emerged of any wrongdoing by the Bidens. Mr Biden, along with other Western officials, had called for Mr Shokin to be fired because of the perception that he was soft on corruption. When Mr Shokin was replaced, his successor continued to investigate Burisma for 10 months before the inquiry ended. The US justice department said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had not spoken to the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate Mr Biden. Speaking at a fundraising event in San Marino, California, on Thursday, Mr Biden said: ""It's a tactic that's used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives.""

'Clueless' police force 'putting public at risk',"Cleveland Police has been ""operating without a clear plan or direction"", inspectors said A scandal-hit police force's catalogue of failings has been ""putting the public at risk"", a watchdog has said. Cleveland Police has been ""operating without a clear plan or direction"", HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services said in a report. It is the first force in England or Wales to be rated inadequate across all areas, the inspectorate said. Recently appointed Chief Constable Richard Lewis admitted Cleveland Police was ""letting people down"". The report followed an inspection in May thatled to the force being placed in special measures. Staff told inspectors they found the organisation ""directionless, rudderless and clueless"". This video can not be played Cleveland Police Chief Constable: 'Stop me and talk to me' The inspectorate said senior officers were ""not consistently demonstrating ethical behaviour"", resulting in a ""profoundly negative impact on the force's ability to be effective and efficient"". There were ""too many examples"" of high-ranking officers and staff ""not taking responsibility, not acting with honesty, integrity and competence, and apportioning blame"", it concluded. 'Clueless' police force's five key failings How is your police force doing? Inspectors highlighted senior officers providing ""incorrect"" statements during the inspection and said they were ""unable to provide evidence"" of actions they claimed the force was taking. They said they had ""concerns the chief constable is unable to trust the information he receives"" from those officers. The father of Zac Newton was promised help by the force but he says ""nothing has happened"" Peter Newton said Cleveland Police told him officers would respond to a report about his 10-year-old son Zac being attacked by a gang of youths in Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool. It was almost two weeks ago and Mr Newton says he is still waiting. ""It's a disgrace,"" he said. ""When I called the police they said they would send someone round to talk to Zac and reassure him and also go and find out who had attacked him. ""He has been bullied for a while and when he went out to the park these lads gave him a good kicking and tried to strangle him. ""He had a really rough time and we wanted something done, but absolutely nothing has happened."" Mr Newton, 55, added: ""He's just a child. Surely there should be a priority when a child is the victim of a crime like this? They should take things more seriously. ""We understand they're stretched sometimes, but we asked for help and we got nothing."" While the force acts ""promptly"" on reports of corruption within its ranks, ""it needs to proactively root out corruption and identify those people at risk of it, to try and prevent it from happening"", the report said. Further criticism included crime prevention not being treated as a ""priority"" and the force not having a good enough understanding of local concerns.  1,198Police officers 566,200Population 67,307Crimes recorded 450complaint allegations per 1,000 employees in 2017-18 Almost 450 assessments for people judged to be at high and medium levels of risk were not progressed with some having waited three months, and children were put in danger of domestic abuse after the force failed to class them as vulnerable. Inspectors said their findings were ""so worrying"" they hadchosen to publish the report sooner than originally planned,external. Phil Gormley, Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary, told the BBC: ""The most critical issue is getting stable, competent and capable leadership into Cleveland Police. The workforce needs clarity and leadership. ""What we are seeing is a force that has individual, collective and systemic failings."" Recent years have seen the force engulfed by controversy. It hasadmitted misusing anti-terror legislation to spy on journalistsand there have been numerous scandals centring on officers' behaviour including aninspector who targeted junior colleagues for sex. In April, the force's assistant chief constable Adrian Roberts wasarrested and suspended on suspicion of gross misconduct. The allegations against him have not been made public. The force, which covers areas including Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesbrough, has hadfive chief constables in seven years. Mike Veale resigned from the post in January over allegations he behaved inappropriately towards colleagues. Mr Lewis,who was appointed his successor in April, said the report was ""entirely accurate"" and ""must act as a line in the sand"". ""This must be the basis from which we improve. It is a wake-up call for the organisation and we are now being honest about where our requirements for improvement lie. ""It is a fundamental requirement of a police service to protect the people it serves. ""Our staff have not been well served by the senior leadership of this force."" Cleveland has now achieved official infamy - the first force in the country to be declared as failing by the police inspectorate. In recent years local people could be forgiven for wondering who was in charge. In 2012 the then Chief Constable Sean Price was sacked for gross misconduct. In the years since, four other chiefs have gone through the revolving doors at police HQ. In April, Richard Lewis was appointed. He now has a new top team as he faces the mammoth task of turning the force around. He insists it should not be scrapped and merged with a neighbouring force. If there is no improvement the Home Secretary has the power to step in and decide Cleveland's future. Neighbourhood policing teams were being re-established, Mr Lewis said, while ""every stage of the reporting, investigating and safeguarding process is under review"". Barry Coppinger, who has been Cleveland's Police and Crime Commissioner since 2012, again rejected calls for his resignation. He described the force's performance as ""unacceptable"" and said he had sought assurance from Mr Lewis that ""immediate changes are being made to resolve the most serious issues"".

Talks resume amid EU pessimism,"This video can not be played Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay: ""There's still a long way to go"". The UK government is planning to put out ""concrete proposals"" next week for reaching a Brexit deal with the EU, the BBC understands. Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said it was expected they would be revealed after the Tory conference but in time for scrutiny ahead of the EU summit on 17 October. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the ""moment of truth"" was approaching. The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 31 October. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says this will happen whether or not there is a new deal with Brussels - but adds that he would prefer leaving with a deal. However, MPs have passed a law requiring Mr Johnson to seek an extension to the deadline from the bloc if he is unable to pass a deal in Parliament, or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit, by 19 October. Meanwhile, Scotland's first minister has warned that Mr Johnson could force through a no-deal Brexit unless the opposition acts. Nicola Sturgeon saidshe was ""open-minded"" about who might emerge to lead a temporary governmentif Mr Johnson is removed from office in a vote of no confidence. BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said he had been told by a senior SNP source that the party's MPs were prepared to put Mr Corbyn in 10 Downing Street ""as soon as next week"" to extend the Brexit deadline and call an election. EU leaders consider 'likely' new Brexit extension What are the Brexit backstop options? Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? Why is the Irish border blocking a Brexit deal? Mr Barclay held talks with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Friday, telling the BBC afterwards: ""I think there is still a long way to go. I think we are coming to the moment of truth in these negotiations. ""We are committed to securing a deal. The prime minister has made clear he wants a deal, but there has to be political will on both sides and that's what we are exploring."" The biggest obstacle to a deal is the backstop - the plan to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The policy - agreed to by former PM Theresa May in her withdrawal deal with the EU, which was rejected three times by Parliament - is unacceptable to many Conservative MPs. Stephen Barclay and Michel Barnier met for Brexit talks in Brussels But the European Commission said Mr Barnier had stressed to Mr Barclay during the meeting that it was ""essential"" there was a ""fully operational solution in the withdrawal agreement to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, protect the all-island economy and the integrity of the single market"". ""The EU remains open and willing to examine any workable and legally operative proposals that meet all these objectives,"" a statement issued after the meeting said. If the UK's new proposals prove acceptable to the EU it would trigger a frantic period of treaty-making. The experts at the European Commission would have to assess whether they are legally watertight and politically acceptable. The 27 other member states would have to be consulted and the deal tweaked if they had concerns. Ideally this would all be done a week before the summit of EU leaders of 17 October. That's an incredibly - and I mean incredibly - tight timeline by the standards of the Brexit processâ¦ by any EU process. And Brussels diplomats are very gloomy because they say the ideas tabled so far by the UK do not go in the right direction. Some think that means there's virtually no chance of agreement being reached next month. Although if the prime minister is only going to unveil his plans when Tory party conference has finished, does that mean he has an ace up his sleeve that he knows will satisfy the EU and antagonise his own party?

Harry at Angola minefield 22 years after Diana,"Prince Harry sits beneath the Diana Tree, which marks the spot where Diana was pictured in the minefield The Duke of Sussex has visited the former minefield in Angola where his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, walked 22 years ago, shortly before she died. Prince Harry visited the site in Huambo, which has become a ""bustling community"" since Diana's campaign. Wearing body armour, he also visited a partially-cleared minefield nearby and set off a controlled explosion. Diana captured global attention when she walked through the live minefield in 1997. She never lived to see the full impact of her visit - such as the signing of an international treaty to outlaw the weapons - as she died later that year. Retracing his mother's footsteps in central Angola, Prince Harry is being escorted by the British landmine clearance charity the Halo Trust, which also accompanied Diana on her visit. Diana visited the minefield Huambo in Angola in 1997 The site is now a bustling community, and Prince Harry retraced his mother's steps on Princess Diana Street After walking along the suburban street, which was once filled with the explosives, the duke said it was ""quite emotional"" to retrace Diana's steps ""and to see the transformation that has taken place, from an unsafe and desolate place into a vibrant community of local businesses and colleges"". He added: ""Without question if she hadn't campaigned the way that she did, this arguably could still be a minefield. ""I'm incredibly proud of what she's been able to do, and meet these kids here who were born on this street."" The area has become a ""completely different place"" since demining and now is a ""bustling community"" with houses and schools and shops, added Camille Wallen, director of strategy at the Halo Trust. Earlier, Prince Harry visited a minefield near the south-eastern town of Dirico, which is in the process of being cleared. The site was mined by anti-government forces in 2000 when they retreated from their base. In 2005, a 13-year-old girl lost a foot after stepping on one of the explosive devices in the area. This video can not be played Prince Harry: ""Landmines are an unhealed scar of war"" Halo Trust staff have been working to make the minefield safe since August and hope to clear it by the end of October. Prince Harry was given a safety briefing and told not to stray off the cleared lanes, not to touch anything or run. In a speech, the duke said the Halo Trust was helping the community ""find peace"". ""Landmines are an unhealed scar of war. By clearing the landmines we can help this community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity,"" he said. ""Additionally, we can protect the diverse and unique wildlife that relies on the beautiful Kuito river that I slept beside last night."" Why Harry is following Diana's lead on landmines The prince called for an international effort to clear landmines from the Okavango watershed in the Angolan highlands, where the weapons remain 17 years after the end of a civil war. The conflict - between 1975 and 2002 - has left Angola one of the most mined places in the world, with around 1,200 minefields, according to the Halo Trust. The organisation says it has decommissioned almost 100,000 mines since 1994 but it is impossible to know exactly how many remain. There are two main types of mine: anti-personnel landmines, aimed at killing or injuring people, and anti-tank mines, designed to destroy vehicles. The random placement of the explosive devices became part of military strategy in the 1960s. Around 50 years later, about 60 countries and territories are still contaminated with anti-personnel mines. More than 120,000 people were killed or injured by landmines between 1999-2017, according toresearch by Landmine Monitor.,external Civilians made up 87% of casualties, while nearly half of the victims were children. Ms Wallen described Prince Harry's visit as a ""really significant moment"". ""As we saw in 1997, Princess Diana really helped raise awareness of the issue of landmines and the plight that people who live with landmines have every day,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""It effectively transformed what we do, and it transformed it for those people. They really felt they were being heard."" Princess Diana's involvement in the cause involved a call for a global ban on landmines. Three months after her death in 1997, 122 countries signed the Ottawa Treaty, which prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines. Ms Wallen said Prince Harry's visit helped ""remind the world that landmines are not just a thing of the past"". ""Decades after conflict they continue to threaten people's lives,"" she added. Angolan minister Lucio Goncalves Amaral said Diana's anti-mine campaign left a ""humanistic heritage"" that motivated the country's authorities to push to remove all the devices from the country by 2025. ""We will never forget her priceless contribution to the campaign to ban the anti-personnel landmines,"" Angola's deputy minister for social integration said in a speech. ""The Angolan people will be eternally grateful for her performance in the demining process of our territory."" Baby Archie meets Archbishop Tutu on royal tour Prince Harry 'troubled' by climate change deniers I'm your sister, Meghan tells South African girls Prince Harry, who is on a tour of southern Africa, visited Botswana on Thursday, where he helped plant trees. The duke said there was a race against time to stop global warming, adding he was ""troubled"" by climate-change deniers. On Wednesday, Prince Harry visited South Africa, where he and the Duchess of Sussex introduced their baby son to the veteran anti-apartheid campaigner, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The couple also met faith leaders at South Africa's first and oldest mosqueand visited a mental health charity. The duchess told teenage girls in a deprived part of the country she was visiting South Africa not only as a member of the Royal Family, but also ""as a woman of colour and as your sister"". On Friday, Buckingham Palace confirmed the duchess had paid a private visit to the memorial of a murdered South African student ""after closely following the tragic story"". Meghan made the ""personal gesture"" at the post office where 19-year-old University of Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana was raped and murdered last month.

Saudi Arabia to open up to foreign tourists,"The Qasr al-Farid tomb in Madain Saleh is a Unesco World Heritage site Saudi Arabia will open its doors to international tourists for the first time as part of a broader push to cut its economic dependence on oil. On Friday, the kingdom will launch a visa regime for 49 countries and relax strict dress codes for female visitors. Tourism Minister Ahmad al-Khateeb described it as a ""historic moment"" for the country. Visas have until now largely been restricted to pilgrims, business people and expatriate workers. Saudi Arabia is also hoping to secure foreign investment in the tourism industry. It wants tourism to rise from 3% to 10% of gross domestic product by 2030. Saudi Arabian tourist spots you can now visit Saudi Arabia allows women to travel independently Country profile: Saudi Arabia Saudis announce $64bn entertainment fund ""Visitors will be surprised... by the treasures we have to share - five Unesco World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty,"" Mr Khateeb said. Foreign women visitors will not be required to wear the body-covering abaya robe required to be worn in public by Saudi women, but must still dress modestly. There will also be no restrictions on unaccompanied women visiting the country. This video can not be played Saudi Arabia reforms: Are they good news for women? ""We have a culture. We believe our friends and our guests will respect the culture, but definitely it is modest and it will be very clear,"" Mr Khateeb said. Non-Muslims will still not be allowed to visit the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and the ban on alcohol will be maintained. More details on the scheme, including which countries are eligible, are due to be provided later on Friday. But Mr Khateeb said he did not believe the recent attack on Saudi Arabia's oil industry would put people off visiting. ""Our cities are among the most safest cities globally. Therefore, we don't believe at all it will impact our plans. We have all the expats living in Saudi Arabia, enjoying Saudi Arabia. We're very secure,"" he said. The moves to open up tourism is central to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's wider economic reform programme that aims to reduce the kingdom's focus on oil. Under the plan, Saudi Arabia wants to increase international and domestic visits to 100 million a year by 2030. The government expects to create one million tourism jobs. Still, the push comes as the kingdom faces a tarnished international image amid criticism of its human rights record following last year'smurder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and a recent crackdown on women's rights activists. In 2017 Saudi Arabia announced a massive tourism development project that will turn 50 islands and other sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts. Last year construction began on Qiddiya ""entertainment city"" near Riyadh, which is to include high-end theme parks, motor sport facilities and a safari area. This is not the first time Saudi Arabia has opened its doors to tourism. In the summer of 2000 it hired French Alpine instructors from Chamonix to take visitors rock-climbing and paragliding in the mountainous southwestern province of Asir. I jumped off a cliff with one of them in a tandem flight that had us soaring on thermals for 45 minutes, hundreds of feet above juniper forests where wild Hamadryas baboons foraged amongst the rocks. But everything came to a grinding halt one year later after the 9/11 terrorist attacks involving, amongst others, 15 Saudi nationals. Since then, domestic and religious tourism have continued apace. Up to three million Muslims come to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina each year to make the Hajj pilgrimage. With the country's hot, arid climate, a lot of Saudis like to get away to the over-developed Red Sea coast or to the cool, verdant mountains of Asir. The views here are simply stunning.

Brexit uncertainty 'could lead to UK rate cut',"The Bank of England may need to cut interest rates should Brexit uncertainty persist, one of its policymakers has said. Even if the UK avoids a no-deal Brexit, rates may still need to be cut, Michael Saunders said. Interest rates have been on hold at 0.75% since August 2018, when they were raised from 0.5%. Last week, the Bank said Brexit uncertainty meant the UK economy was performing below its potential. ""If the UK avoids a no-deal Brexit, monetary policy also could go either way and I think it is quite plausible that the next move in Bank Rate would be down rather than up,"" Mr Saunders told local businesses in Barnsley. The pound dropped against the dollar after his comments were reported, trading down about 0.4% at $1.2277, before paring losses. Mr Saunders, who is a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), said that even without a no-deal Brexit, high levels of uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the EU would persist and act as a kind of ""slow puncture"" for the economy. ""In this case, it might well be appropriate to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for an extended period and perhaps to loosen policy at some stage, especially if global growth remains disappointing,"" he said. Brexit talks resume amid growing EU pessimism over new deal Brexit: EU leaders believe new extension is 'likely' Bank of England forecasts low interest rates for longer Passively waiting to see what happened with Brexit risked inappropriate monetary policy, and the cost of reversing a rate cut if the outlook improved would be low, he added at the event at the Barnsley and Rotherham Chamber of Commerce and Institute of Chartered Accountants. ""In general, I would prefer to be nimble, adjusting policy if it appears necessary to keep the economy on track, and accepting that it may be necessary to change course if the outlook changes significantly,"" he said. At its last meeting on interest rates, the MPC unanimously held rates at 0.75%. Mr Saunders said he still agreed with recent Bank guidance that a limited and gradual increase in interest rates would be needed over the medium term, if Brexit uncertainty reduced significantly and global growth speeds up. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Saunders repeated the Bank's position that all policy options would be open, depending on the damage to growth and how much inflation spikes from a further fall in sterling. A disorderly no-deal Brexit could leave the Bank of England's rate setters with an unenviable dilemma. Do they cut interest rates to boost growth  - or raise them to curb inflation caused by a possible fall in the exchange rate, shortages and tariffs? With tackling inflation at the top of its remit, the Bank's economic models assume rates would rise in such circumstances. But rates are set by nine humans, not machines. The governor, Mark Carney, recently indicated he'd be inclined to cut in the event of a no-deal - and the vote usually goes the boss's way. But what is remarkable is that there appears to a change of view on his panel of what to do even in the event of a deal. Just last week, the MPC repeated its mantra that rates would likely go up slowly and gradually in the event of a deal. But now, one of those who had previously warned of the dangers of not raising rates - Michael Saunders - says that a cut is plausible, deal or no deal. The Bank says the economy has lost momentum; Michael Saunders likens the pace to a slow puncture. If he's shifting in his position, it's likely others are too But how much would lower rates help in the event of a disorderly no-deal? A cut aims to put more money in pockets. But if any hit to growth was due to shortages and disruption, a supply shock, boosting demand, may be counterproductive. More money is great - as long as there's things to spend it on. Earlier this month, Bank governor Mark Carney estimated that in a worst-case, chaotic scenario that a no-deal Brexit could reduce the size of the economy by 5.5%. The Paris-based OECD has predicted a 2% hit in the case of a more managed no-deal Brexit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly vowed to take the UK out of the European Union by 31 October, without a deal if necessary, but is in a stand-off with Parliament which has passed a law designed to block a no-deal Brexit.

Thomas Cook: 40% of holidaymakers back in UK,"The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says it has now flown a total of 61,000 Thomas Cook customers back to the UK, taking the total to 40% of passengers. On Thursday it used 69 flights to bring back 15,000 people as part of its repatriation scheme following the collapse of the holiday group. Some 72 flights are due to operate on Friday to return 16,000 people. The CAA says Operation Matterhorn will continue until 6 October with more than 1,000 flights planned in total. The authority said 95% of passengers have been flown home on the planned day of their departure. ""An operation of this scale and complexity will inevitably cause some inconvenience and disruption and I am very grateful to holidaymakers for bearing with us as we work around the clock to bring them home,"" said Richard Moriarty, chief executive of the CAA. Separately, Thomas Cook staff are due to meet at Manchester Airport today. They plan to raise the topic of unpaid wages. The latest data from the Insolvency Service shows that 6,000 Thomas Cook staff in the UK have been made redundant and just over 3,000 employees are currently retained. What went wrong at Thomas Cook? Thomas Cook: Your questions answered Thomas Cook collapsed after it failed to find funding to continue paying its bills. Its appeal to the government for Â£250m was rebuffed.

Harry visits Angola minefield 22 years after Diana,"Prince Harry sits beneath the Diana Tree, which marks the spot where Diana was pictured in the minefield The Duke of Sussex has visited the former minefield in Angola where his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, walked 22 years ago, shortly before she died. Prince Harry visited the site in Huambo, which has become a ""bustling community"" since Diana's campaign. Wearing body armour, he also visited a partially-cleared minefield nearby and set off a controlled explosion. Diana captured global attention when she walked through the live minefield in 1997. She never lived to see the full impact of her visit - such as the signing of an international treaty to outlaw the weapons - as she died later that year. Retracing his mother's footsteps in central Angola, Prince Harry is being escorted by the British landmine clearance charity the Halo Trust, which also accompanied Diana on her visit. Diana visited the minefield Huambo in Angola in 1997 The site is now a bustling community, and Prince Harry retraced his mother's steps on Princess Diana Street After walking along the suburban street, which was once filled with the explosives, the duke said it was ""quite emotional"" to retrace Diana's steps ""and to see the transformation that has taken place, from an unsafe and desolate place into a vibrant community of local businesses and colleges"". He added: ""Without question if she hadn't campaigned the way that she did, this arguably could still be a minefield. ""I'm incredibly proud of what she's been able to do, and meet these kids here who were born on this street."" The area has become a ""completely different place"" since demining and now is a ""bustling community"" with houses and schools and shops, added Camille Wallen, director of strategy at the Halo Trust. Earlier, Prince Harry visited a minefield near the south-eastern town of Dirico, which is in the process of being cleared. The site was mined by anti-government forces in 2000 when they retreated from their base. In 2005, a 13-year-old girl lost a foot after stepping on one of the explosive devices in the area. This video can not be played Prince Harry: ""Landmines are an unhealed scar of war"" Halo Trust staff have been working to make the minefield safe since August and hope to clear it by the end of October. Prince Harry was given a safety briefing and told not to stray off the cleared lanes, not to touch anything or run. In a speech, the duke said the Halo Trust was helping the community ""find peace"". ""Landmines are an unhealed scar of war. By clearing the landmines we can help this community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity,"" he said. ""Additionally, we can protect the diverse and unique wildlife that relies on the beautiful Kuito river that I slept beside last night."" Why Harry is following Diana's lead on landmines The prince called for an international effort to clear landmines from the Okavango watershed in the Angolan highlands, where the weapons remain 17 years after the end of a civil war. The conflict - between 1975 and 2002 - has left Angola one of the most mined places in the world, with around 1,200 minefields, according to the Halo Trust. The organisation says it has decommissioned almost 100,000 mines since 1994 but it is impossible to know exactly how many remain. There are two main types of mine: anti-personnel landmines, aimed at killing or injuring people, and anti-tank mines, designed to destroy vehicles. The random placement of the explosive devices became part of military strategy in the 1960s. Around 50 years later, about 60 countries and territories are still contaminated with anti-personnel mines. More than 120,000 people were killed or injured by landmines between 1999-2017, according toresearch by Landmine Monitor.,external Civilians made up 87% of casualties, while nearly half of the victims were children. Ms Wallen described Prince Harry's visit as a ""really significant moment"". ""As we saw in 1997, Princess Diana really helped raise awareness of the issue of landmines and the plight that people who live with landmines have every day,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""It effectively transformed what we do, and it transformed it for those people. They really felt they were being heard."" Princess Diana's involvement in the cause involved a call for a global ban on landmines. Three months after her death in 1997, 122 countries signed the Ottawa Treaty, which prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines. Ms Wallen said Prince Harry's visit helped ""remind the world that landmines are not just a thing of the past"". ""Decades after conflict they continue to threaten people's lives,"" she added. Angolan minister Lucio Goncalves Amaral said Diana's anti-mine campaign left a ""humanistic heritage"" that motivated the country's authorities to push to remove all the devices from the country by 2025. ""We will never forget her priceless contribution to the campaign to ban the anti-personnel landmines,"" Angola's deputy minister for social integration said in a speech. ""The Angolan people will be eternally grateful for her performance in the demining process of our territory."" Baby Archie meets Archbishop Tutu on royal tour Prince Harry 'troubled' by climate change deniers I'm your sister, Meghan tells South African girls Prince Harry, who is on a tour of southern Africa, visited Botswana on Thursday, where he helped plant trees. The duke said there was a race against time to stop global warming, adding he was ""troubled"" by climate-change deniers. On Wednesday, Prince Harry visited South Africa, where he and the Duchess of Sussex introduced their baby son to the veteran anti-apartheid campaigner, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The couple also met faith leaders at South Africa's first and oldest mosqueand visited a mental health charity. The duchess told teenage girls in a deprived part of the country she was visiting South Africa not only as a member of the Royal Family, but also ""as a woman of colour and as your sister"". On Friday, Buckingham Palace confirmed the duchess had paid a private visit to the memorial of a murdered South African student ""after closely following the tragic story"". Meghan made the ""personal gesture"" at the post office where 19-year-old University of Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana was raped and murdered last month. A spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace said: ""Having closely followed the tragic story, it was a personal gesture she wanted to make.""

Johnson pledges government support for Wrightbus,"This video can not be played The PM says the government will do what it can to help after 1,200 job losses at the firm Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""disappointed"" at what has happened at Wrightbus and that the government will ""do what we can to help"". Efforts are under way to try to help 1,200 workers made redundant after the company entered administration. Just 50 jobs will be retained at the firm - the last UK-owned bus manufacturer. Administrators met unions on Thursday. Wrightbus administrators confirm 1,200 job losses Reaction to Ballymena firm entering administration Wrightbus: From driving seat to financial failure Bus firm faces questions over religious donations There have been calls for Mr Johnson to intervene. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith told BBC NI's The View that he will be speaking to the administrators in the next 24 hours to see what can be done to save Wrightbus jobs. He said he will do everything to ""find somebody to rebuild that business"". The Ballymena-based bus-builder suffered cash flow problems and had sought investment or a new owner. Talks with two potential buyers of the firm, best known for building the New Routemaster, known as the ""Boris Bus"",failed to reach a conclusion last week. This video can not be played Mervyn Wilkinson was among the 1,200 Wrightbus employees made redundant on Wednesday. Mr Johnson described Wrightbus, which built the Routemaster bus when he was the London mayor, as a ""fantastic business"". ""We have been working on it the whole time,"" he told BBC News NI. ""You may know that the negotiations got very close, there was a particular problem that came up to do with the ownership of the land. ""We want to sort it out, we are going to do what we can to help."" Mr Johnson said he thought ""one of the problems"" was that London mayor, Sadiq Khan, should have continued with the London transport contract and that he understood there were ""also problems to do with the management of the company"". In a statement on Thursday evening, a spokesperson for Wrights said that last week there were two ""final bidders in discussions regarding acquisition of Wright Group"". ""A rental agreement for the sites was reached with one bidder, who then pulled out of the deal on Friday 20th,"" the statement added. ""A second bidder discussed purchasing the sites, but no formal letter of offer was made from that bidder. ""Any reports to the contrary are completely inaccurate."" Mr Johnson said Wrightbus was part of a ""big industrial agenda"" in relation to Northern Ireland, including the east Belfast shipyard Harland and Wolff ""where we have big plans"". ""Northern Ireland is a great opportunity area for our country,"" he added. The company had suffered cash flow problems and had sought investment or a new owner TUV councillor Timothy Gaston said Mid and East Antrim Council had contacted the prime minister, the secretary of state and the chairman of the NI Select Affairs Committee ""to again raise how vital Wrightbus is to Ballymena"". He added: ""Our PM has committed previously to do all he can to save Wrightbus. It's now time for action."" Mr Gaston said the council will have a dedicated website to help people access services, support and information and have organised a redundancy clinic for employees âªon Friday. Concern is also mounting for firms in the supply chain which are still owed money. Manufacturing NI chief Stephen Kelly said some had tried to protect themselves by taking out trade credit insurance or working on a basis of cash on delivery with the company. But he added that ""a lot of people are still holding a lot of stock and a lot of people are owed a lot of money"". This video can not be played Government must 'invest in Wrightbus' - Jackie Pollock, Unite regional secretary George Brash, of the Unite union, said that Boris Johnson recently told the House of Commons he would do everything for the future of the company. House sale fears after Wrightbus redundancy ""We are calling him out on that comment and those promises that he made to this workforce, and this Ballymena community,"" Mr Brash said. ""He needs to stand up and intervene as he said he would."" Steven Reynolds, chair of Ballymena Business Improvement District, said that the town was going through ""difficult times"". This video can not be played Staff at the Ballymena bus manufacturer fear for the future as 1,200 lose their jobs. ""It will have an impact, [but] let's remember Wrightbus is in administration not liquidation,"" he said. ""Every day is a new day, a new opportunity to do a deal and that may still be on the table."" Efforts are also under way to bring home former workers based outside Northern Ireland. The company had 20 members of staff working between Hong Kong and Malaysia. It is understood there are also around nine former staff members in England. Administrators are working to secure them transport home. Jonathan McKay from Cullybackey, who has been working for Wrightbus for the past 12 years, is currently in Taunton, in south-west England. He told BBC News NI he was only informed about the collapse at about 18:30 BST on Wednesday in a conference call with other workers.

No-deal Brexit 'still risk to NHS and care sector',"A no-deal Brexit presents risks to the NHS and care homes despite extensive government planning,a watchdog says,external. The National Audit Office praised the government for the ""enormous amount of work"" that had been done but said there were still ""significant"" gaps. The extra shipping capacity government was buying to bring medicines into ports other than Dover may not be completely ready by 31 October. And there was no clear evidence the care sector was ready, the NAO said. The report raises concerns the sector has not received enough government support. UK plans Â£3m no-deal medicine transport UK seeks new no-deal Brexit freight plan The government has arranged the stockpiling of supplies for the NHS. But for the care sector, which is fragmented in that it relies on 24,000 companies to provide services, no central arrangement has been made to stockpile equipment and supplies, such as syringes and needles, most of which come from or via the EU. When it comes to medicines, however, the supply of which has been organised for both the NHS and care sectors, the report acknowledges the work that has been done. This includes stockpiling six weeks' supply of drugs and arranging for emergency supplies to be fast-tracked in - some drugs, including cancer treatments, have a short shelf-life and so cannot be stockpiled. But the report says it is still not known exactly what level of stockpiling is in place. More than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, and about 7,000 come from or via the EU. The publication of the report comes after MPs attempted to block the government leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement. Legislation has been passed requiring the government to ask for an extension if a deal cannot be agreed. Labour MP Meg Hillier,  who chairs the cross-party Public Accounts Committee, said the report was ""deeply concerning"". ""I've seen countless examples of deadlines missed and government failing,"" she said. ""If government gets this wrong, it could have the gravest of consequences."" Dr Layla McCay, of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, said the planning had been detailed but the situation was still concerning. She also warned it was the ""unknowns and unknowables"" that perhaps presented the biggest risk. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We want to reassure patients we are doing everything we can."" He said the government along with industry had ""mounted an unprecedented response in preparing for Brexit"" with stockpiles ""increasing by the day"".

EU considers 'likely' extension,"In a Westminster-clad puff of smoke, any residual ""maybes"" about a new Brexit deal being agreed by mid-October have evaporated in Brussels. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is well-known here for having a coffee mug in his office emblazoned with ""Keep Calm and Negotiate"". But although EU-UK technical talks have been carrying on at a low level this week, a diplomat from a key EU country described as ""pretty much nil"" the chances of getting a new deal done and dusted by the EU leaders' summit in a couple of weeks' time. Mr Barnier repeated again on Thursday that UK ideas to date on how to replace the Irish border backstop have failed - in his opinion - to meet the EU criteria of safeguarding the Northern Ireland peace process and the single market. He said Boris Johnson's proposals might even require the EU to suspend its own rules. This video can not be played Barnier: UK Brexit proposals must protect peace in Ireland While Downing Street insists its Brexit proposals are serious and that the onus is also on the EU to make compromises, Brussels seems demotivated. ""Even if we manage to reach an agreement with [Boris] Johnson - which is an outside chance anyway,"" a diplomat from a southern European country told me, ""do we really think that the angry, divided House of Commons will approve a Johnson-brokered Brexit deal?"" The diplomat clearly didn't. And that's important. It means the EU believes there is no point compromising right now. Brussels is also unconvinced that the prime minister is willing to make what it views as real compromises. They think he wants to keep his hard Brexiteer credentials intact ahead of a general election. So is the EU assuming that a no-deal Brexit is round the corner? Not really. EU politicians now believe a new three-month Brexit extension is the most likely next step. And Boris Johnson is right. That belief does take the pressure off them somewhat. It's yet another factor deterring Brussels from offering significant compromises in current negotiations. Brexit jargon explained What will happen with Brexit in the next month? But the EU is aware that the route to a new extension is neither straightforward nor guaranteed. Parliament may have passed a law instructing the government to request a new extension if a Brexit deal isn't reached by mid-October. But if Boris Johnson refuses - as he insists would be the case - then EU leaders would normally listen to him, their peer, as head of Her Majesty's government. EU sources point at Spain (and the Catalan issue) as to why leaders alone - not parliaments - represent member countries at the EU table. But as so often when it comes to Brexit, this situation is messy. EU diplomats suggest Boris Johnson might refuse an extension and resign after 31 October to stay clear of any political fallout In fact, EU lawyers won't give a definite answer as to what the EU would definitely do if, with a no deal Brexit looming, parliament demands a new Brexit extension while the prime minister says no. EU rules on how to deal with a departing country - the so-called Article 50 text - don't specify that an extension request must come from a government but rather from ""the member state concerned"". The EU could offer an extension unprompted but the decision to trigger one has to be unanimous amongst EU leaders and the UK. This is a real nail-biter for EU leaders. They have so wanted to stay out of UK domestic politics, but if and when it comes to the extension debate, they could find themselves slap bang in the middle of the fight between parliament and the PM. How are the UK's talks with the EU going? 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Always keen to kick the can down the road when agreement can't yet be reached, EU diplomats muse that, with his options dwindling, Boris Johnson could choose to make a big stand at the October summit, ostentatiously refusing to ask for an extension when he meets with EU leaders (to score points with hard-line Brexiteers at home) and then resign. This would allow him to keep his hands clean of any extension, while a caretaker government requests one. EU hopefuls cite this hypothetical scenario as a reason not to give up. A three-month extension, they say, could allow time to agree a compromise Brexit deal with the UK by the end of the year. Or not.

Efforts are under way to try to help 1,200 workers made redundant after the company entered administration. Just 50 jobs will be retained at the firm - the last UK-owned bus manufacturer. Administrators met unions on Thursday. Wrightbus administrators confirm 1,200 job losses Reaction to Ballymena firm entering administration Wrightbus: From driving seat to financial failure Bus firm faces questions over religious donations There have been calls for Mr Johnson to intervene. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith told BBC NI's The View that he will be speaking to the administrators in the next 24 hours to see what can be done to save Wrightbus jobs. He said he will do everything to ""find somebody to rebuild that business"". The Ballymena-based bus-builder suffered cash flow problems and had sought investment or a new owner. Talks with two potential buyers of the firm, best known for building the New Routemaster, known as the ""Boris Bus"",failed to reach a conclusion last week. This video can not be played Mervyn Wilkinson was among the 1,200 Wrightbus employees made redundant on Wednesday. Mr Johnson described Wrightbus, which built the Routemaster bus when he was the London mayor, as a ""fantastic business"". ""We have been working on it the whole time,"" he told BBC News NI. ""You may know that the negotiations got very close, there was a particular problem that came up to do with the ownership of the land. ""We want to sort it out, we are going to do what we can to help."" Mr Johnson said he thought ""one of the problems"" was that London mayor, Sadiq Khan, should have continued with the London transport contract and that he understood there were ""also problems to do with the management of the company"". In a statement on Thursday evening, a spokesperson for Wrights said that last week there were two ""final bidders in discussions regarding acquisition of Wright Group"". ""A rental agreement for the sites was reached with one bidder, who then pulled out of the deal on Friday 20th,"" the statement added. ""A second bidder discussed purchasing the sites, but no formal letter of offer was made from that bidder. ""Any reports to the contrary are completely inaccurate."" Mr Johnson said Wrightbus was part of a ""big industrial agenda"" in relation to Northern Ireland, including the east Belfast shipyard Harland and Wolff ""where we have big plans"". ""Northern Ireland is a great opportunity area for our country,"" he added. The company had suffered cash flow problems and had sought investment or a new owner TUV councillor Timothy Gaston said Mid and East Antrim Council had contacted the prime minister, the secretary of state and the chairman of the NI Select Affairs Committee ""to again raise how vital Wrightbus is to Ballymena"". He added: ""Our PM has committed previously to do all he can to save Wrightbus. It's now time for action."" Mr Gaston said the council will have a dedicated website to help people access services, support and information and have organised a redundancy clinic for employees âªon Friday. Concern is also mounting for firms in the supply chain which are still owed money. Manufacturing NI chief Stephen Kelly said some had tried to protect themselves by taking out trade credit insurance or working on a basis of cash on delivery with the company. But he added that ""a lot of people are still holding a lot of stock and a lot of people are owed a lot of money"". This video can not be played Government must 'invest in Wrightbus' - Jackie Pollock, Unite regional secretary George Brash, of the Unite union, said that Boris Johnson recently told the House of Commons he would do everything for the future of the company. House sale fears after Wrightbus redundancy ""We are calling him out on that comment and those promises that he made to this workforce, and this Ballymena community,"" Mr Brash said. ""He needs to stand up and intervene as he said he would."" Steven Reynolds, chair of Ballymena Business Improvement District, said that the town was going through ""difficult times"". This video can not be played Staff at the Ballymena bus manufacturer fear for the future as 1,200 lose their jobs. ""It will have an impact, [but] let's remember Wrightbus is in administration not liquidation,"" he said. ""Every day is a new day, a new opportunity to do a deal and that may still be on the table."" Efforts are also under way to bring home former workers based outside Northern Ireland. The company had 20 members of staff working between Hong Kong and Malaysia. It is understood there are also around nine former staff members in England. Administrators are working to secure them transport home. Jonathan McKay from Cullybackey, who has been working for Wrightbus for the past 12 years, is currently in Taunton, in south-west England. He told BBC News NI he was only informed about the collapse at about 18:30 BST on Wednesday in a conference call with other workers.

Brexit talks resume amid growing EU pessimism,"This video can not be played Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay: ""There's still a long way to go"". The UK government is planning to put out ""concrete proposals"" next week for reaching a Brexit deal with the EU, the BBC understands. Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said it was expected they would be revealed after the Tory conference but in time for scrutiny ahead of the EU summit on 17 October. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the ""moment of truth"" was approaching. The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 31 October. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says this will happen whether or not there is a new deal with Brussels - but adds that he would prefer leaving with a deal. However, MPs have passed a law requiring Mr Johnson to seek an extension to the deadline from the bloc if he is unable to pass a deal in Parliament, or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit, by 19 October. Meanwhile, Scotland's first minister has warned that Mr Johnson could force through a no-deal Brexit unless the opposition acts. Nicola Sturgeon saidshe was ""open-minded"" about who might emerge to lead a temporary governmentif Mr Johnson is removed from office in a vote of no confidence. BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said he had been told by a senior SNP source that the party's MPs were prepared to put Mr Corbyn in 10 Downing Street ""as soon as next week"" to extend the Brexit deadline and call an election. EU leaders consider 'likely' new Brexit extension What are the Brexit backstop options? Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? Why is the Irish border blocking a Brexit deal? Mr Barclay held talks with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Friday, telling the BBC afterwards: ""I think there is still a long way to go. I think we are coming to the moment of truth in these negotiations. ""We are committed to securing a deal. The prime minister has made clear he wants a deal, but there has to be political will on both sides and that's what we are exploring."" The biggest obstacle to a deal is the backstop - the plan to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The policy - agreed to by former PM Theresa May in her withdrawal deal with the EU, which was rejected three times by Parliament - is unacceptable to many Conservative MPs. Stephen Barclay and Michel Barnier met for Brexit talks in Brussels But the European Commission said Mr Barnier had stressed to Mr Barclay during the meeting that it was ""essential"" there was a ""fully operational solution in the withdrawal agreement to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, protect the all-island economy and the integrity of the single market"". ""The EU remains open and willing to examine any workable and legally operative proposals that meet all these objectives,"" a statement issued after the meeting said. If the UK's new proposals prove acceptable to the EU it would trigger a frantic period of treaty-making. The experts at the European Commission would have to assess whether they are legally watertight and politically acceptable. The 27 other member states would have to be consulted and the deal tweaked if they had concerns. Ideally this would all be done a week before the summit of EU leaders of 17 October. That's an incredibly - and I mean incredibly - tight timeline by the standards of the Brexit processâ¦ by any EU process. And Brussels diplomats are very gloomy because they say the ideas tabled so far by the UK do not go in the right direction. Some think that means there's virtually no chance of agreement being reached next month. Although if the prime minister is only going to unveil his plans when Tory party conference has finished, does that mean he has an ace up his sleeve that he knows will satisfy the EU and antagonise his own party?
