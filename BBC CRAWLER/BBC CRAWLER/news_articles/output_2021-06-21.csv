"19 July looking good for end of lockdown, says PM","Plans to ease Covid restrictions in England on 19 July are ""looking good"", the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said that was based on the efficacy of vaccines against identified variants. But he warned there could be a ""rough winter for all sorts of reasons"", including a resurgence of flu. It comes as the health secretary said he hoped to exempt fully vaccinated people from the requirement to isolate for 10 days when contact-traced. Asked during on a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire whether he could rule out further lockdowns this winter, Mr Johnson said: ""You can never exclude that there will be some new disease, some new horror that we simply haven't budgeted for, or accounted for. ""But looking at where we are, looking at the efficacy of the vaccines against all variants that we can currently see - so Alpha, Delta, the lot of them, Kappa - I think it's looking good for 19 July to be that terminus point."" His comments came after Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the government's advisory committee on vaccination, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that flu ""could be potentially a bigger problem this winter than Covid."" Flu immunity is likely to have dropped in the population as a result of low prevalence because of lockdowns, and it could come ""back to bite us"", he said. Mr Johnson said the risk of a ""rough winter"" was ""all the more reason to reduce the number of Covid cases now, give the NHS the breathing space it needs to get on with dealing with all those other pressures, and we are certainly going to be putting in the investment to make sure that they can"". How does the test-and-trace system work? Who has to self-isolate? What are the rules for travelling abroad? Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that he hoped to bring in a new approach to self-isolation to reflect the changing situation as the country opens up more and more. For the past two months, a pilot study has been under way in which 40,000 people who have been named as contacts of someone who has tested positive for Covid have been allowed to take daily Covid tests and continue with their lives, rather than having to self-isolate. ""We're piloting that now to check that will be effective and it is something that we're working on,"" the health secretary said. ""We're not ready to be able to take that step yet. But it's something that I want to see and we will introduce, subject to clinical advice, as soon as it's reasonable to do so."" The trial is not expected to be completed until later in the summer. This video can not be played Five ways to self-isolate successfully to prevent the spread of coronavirus Currently, anybody who has been told by NHS Test and Trace that they are a contact of somebody who has tested positive for the virus must self-isolate for 10 days. This means not leaving home at all - even to buy food or medicines, or for exercise. The rule applies to people regardless of whether they have received a coronavirus jab. So far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two doses of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose. More than one million jabs were booked on Friday and Saturday in England, after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. There have been a further five deaths within 28 days of testing positive in the UK, according to the government's daily figures - and 10,633 new cases. The prime minister said the government was also looking at using daily tests for travellers. Asked whether ministers were considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UK if they took daily tests, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""When it comes to travel, we'll certainly be looking at that. ""But I want to stress this is going to be, whatever happens, a difficult year for travel - there will be hassle, there will be delays, I'm afraid, because the priority has got to be to keep the country safe and to stop the virus coming back in."" Currently, people arriving in the UK from a country on the government's amber list must quarantine for 10 days - regardless of whether they have had a coronavirus jab. However, in England an individual may be able to end their quarantine period early if they pay for an additional test under the test-to-release scheme. The prime minister has been visiting a laboratory in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""cautiously hopeful"" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. He said the government had always committed to regularly review their international travel plan, with the next ""checkpoint"" taking place on 28 June. He said that the checkpoints would look at whether the ""science would support"" relaxations including people who have received two vaccine doses no longer have to quarantine after returning from certain countries. The original date the government had planned to remove all legal limits on social contact in England was 21 June - but this has been delayed to allow more people to be vaccinated. However, some restrictions have still been eased. The number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue. And in Wales,rules are also being lifted slightly,including capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size. In Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictionshas been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotlandare expected to be extended until mid-July.

"Plan to ban noisy protests 'oppressive', MPs warn","The government should drop its ""disproportionate"" plan to ban noisy protests in England and Wales, a parliamentary committee has warned. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill would also introduce powers to deal with demonstrations involving only one person. The Joint Committee on Human Rights said the legislation could undermine freedom of expression. But the Home Office said it would not ""impinge"" on the right to protest. Existing laws are out of date and ""disruptive and dangerous tactics"" have to be dealt with, a spokeswoman added. The committee's chairwoman, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, said the plans were ""oppressive and wrong"". Government defends protests noise limit plan The bill,externalsays group protests should not be loud enough to cause ""serious unease, alarm or distress"" to people ""in the vicinity"". A noise limit would also apply to a single person if they caused ""serious disruption"" or if they ""may have a relevant impact on"" people nearby. In a report highly critical of the bill, the committee, which advises MPs and peers on the compatibility of all government bills with human rights laws, called for ""statutory protection"" for the right to hold protests to be introduced. It added that councils should be told to ""refrain from interfering unlawfully"" with them and be given ""the duty to facilitate protest"". The report also said the language used in the bill left an ""excessive degree of judgement in the hands of a police officer"". And it described the proposed limits on single-person protests as ""unprecedented"". This legislation comes after repeated city centre occupations by the Extinction Rebellion movement - and last year's toppling of the statue of a Bristol slave trader and municipal benefactor. The committee said allowing police to set noise limits could silence lawful and peaceful chants - and the most popular demonstrations could face restrictions on duration and location, interfering with the right to assembly. It also urges the government not to create powers to interfere with public demonstrations held by a single person and warns that a new crime of causing a public nuisance is too vague to be understood. MPs and peers don't need to act on the report, but the legislation has already triggered its own protests. And there are predictions it could lead to years of legal battles all the way to the Supreme Court. Commenting on the plans, committee chairwoman Ms Harman said: ""One of our most fundamental rights is to protest. It is the essence of our democracy. ""To do that, we need to make ourselves heard. The government proposals to allow police to restrict 'noisy' protests are oppressive and wrong."" Harriet Harman said the right to protest was the essence of democracy MPs have already backed the bill in principle and it is currentlyundergoing detailed scrutiny.,external It also outlines stronger police powers to break up ""unauthorised encampments"" and longer sentences for people convicted of serious crimes. The government said existing public order laws needed updating because ""the use of disruptive and dangerous tactics - including obstructing emergency vehicles or blocking the free press - costs millions to the taxpayer and causes misery to businesses and local communities"". ""The right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy,"" a Home Office spokeswoman said. ""Our proposed measures are in line with human rights legislation and in no way impinge on the right to protest."" The bill would allow police to ""better manage demonstrations so that legitimate protest groups can make their voices heard without disrupting the lives and livelihoods of others"", she added.

All Bumble staff given week off to de-stress,"Founder Whitney Wolfe Herd recently oversaw Bumble's debut on the stock market Bumble, the dating app where women are in charge of making the first move, has temporarily closed all of its offices this week to combat workplace stress. Its 700 staff worldwide have been told to switch off and focus on themselves. One senior executive revealed on Twitter that founder Whitney Wolfe Herd had made the move ""having correctly intuited our collective burnout"". Bumble has had a busier year than most firms, with a stock market debut, and rapid growth in user numbers. The company announced in April ""that all Bumble employees will have a paid, fully offline one-week vacation in June"". A spokeswoman for Bumble said a few customer support staff will be working in case any of the app's users experience issues. These employees will then be given time off to make sure they take a whole week of leave. The spokeswoman confirmed that the majority of Bumble's staff are taking the week off. Bumble has grown in popularity during lockdown as boredom set in and swiping to find a match picked up. The number of paid users across Bumble and Badoo, which Bumble also owns, spiked by 30% in the three months to 31 March, compared with the same period last year,according to its most recent set of results.,external Ms Wolfe Herd also became the youngest woman, at 31, to take a company public in the US when she oversaw Bumble's stock market debut in February. Is Big Tech going off remote working? The tech billionaire who is putting women first She rang the Nasdaq bell with her 18-month-old baby son on her hip and in her speech she said she wanted to make the internet ""a kinder, more accountable place"". By Dearbail Jordan In your face: Bumble's head office is all about positivity Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd's quest to make the internet a ""kinder"" place extends to the company's head office. And then some. Back in 2017, the firm unveiled its new headquarters in Texas. Saturated in Bumble's signature yellow, wall mirrors are emblazoned with messages such as ""you look bee-autiful honey"". Even the light switches have slogans, telling people to ""shine bright like a diamond"". It also boasts a ""Mommy Bar"" - described as a ""private lactation space"" by Ms Wolfe Herd - as well as fortnightly manicures, hair trims and ""blowouts"" which the founder said showed ""appreciation for our busy bees"". Working hours? Not nine to five apparently. Employees can choose the hours they want, just as long as the work gets done. Could the UK see the same sort of office environment here? With many people spending so much time at home recently, perhaps companies will follow through on making changes to working life. Just don't hold out for free manicures though. Workers in other industries have complained about working long hours and the effect on their well-being. Earlier this year, a group of younger bankers at Goldman Sachs warned they would be forced to quit unless conditions improved. They said they were working an average of 95 hours a week and slept five hours a night. A spokeswoman for the investment bank said at the time: ""A year into Covid, people are understandably quite stretched, and that's why we are listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them."" Prior to Covid, one of the most high-profile examples of overwork emerged in when Antonio Horta-Osorio, then the relatively new chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, was forced to take a leave of absence. After joining the bank in January 2011, Mr Horta-Osorio took eight weeks off from November afterprolonged insomnia led to exhaustion. Former Lloyds' Banking boss Antonio Horta-Osorio was forced to take time off due to exhaustion Following his return, Mr Horta-Osorio - now chairman of Credit Suisse - led a re-evaluation at the bank on the importance of mental health. Bumble made its announcement after several tech companies have unveiled their plans for remote working as the economy reopens. Twitter has said that it expects a majority of its staff to spend some time working remotely and some time in the office.That's despite its boss Jack Dorsey initially saying that,externalemployees could work from home ""forever"". And Google rejigged its timetablefor bringing people back to the workplace. As of 1 September, employees wishing to work from home for more than 14 days a year would have to apply to do so. But Apple employees have launched a campaign pushing back against boss Tim Cook's plans for a widespread return to the office, according to media reports earlier in June. It followed an all-staff memo in which the Apple chief executive said workers should be in the office at least three days a week by September. The key to coping with burnout is control, according to experts. ""Not everyone has the option of leaving their job but it's about doing what you can with the things you can control,"" says Siobhan Murray, author of 'The Burnout Solution'. Cary Cooper, president of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester, says it is ""important that individuals take control of their environment to manage the hours they work and ensure that they're socially connected."" He advises: Take control Don't work consistently long hours, engage in activities unrelated to work Connect socially with friends and people you like Have some 'me time' Avoid unhealthy behaviours and negative coping mechanisms Help other people Be positive But companies must play their part too, says Trades Union Congress health and safety officer, Shelly Asquith. Stress is an ""occupational hazard"" she says and it ""requires risk assessment and management to protect the wellbeing of staff"". Other companies, such as accountancy firm KPMG, have introduced new measures to combat the fatigue some workers might feel after more than a year of working in a less-than-ideal home set-up. Voice-only meetings, for example, are now required on Fridays to reduce the need for video calls. It is in stark contrast to comments made by KPMG's UK chairman, Bill Michael, in February when he told colleagues to ""stop moaning"" during a virtual meeting discussing the pandemic and possible cuts to their pay, bonuses and pensions. According to the Financial Times,external, Mr Michael also told employees to stop ""playing the victim card"". Mr Michael has since apologised and resigned.

Liverpool set to lose World Heritage status,"Liverpool received World Heritage status in 2004 A Unesco committee has recommended that Liverpool should lose its World Heritage status. The threat of Liverpool's demotion has rumbled on for more than a decade after modern developments on the city's waterfront. Liverpool City Council said aboutÂ£1.5bn had been invested,externalin upgrading 157 heritage assets. A final decision will be made when Unesco confirms the sites on its World Heritage Listat a meeting next month.,external The newreport by the World Heritage Committee,externalsaid ""with deep regret"" new developments in the city had resulted in ""serious deterioration and irreversible loss of attributes"". It cited theLiverpool Waters projectand the approved plans forEverton FC's new stadium at Bramley Moore Dock. An artist's impression of Everton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock A government spokesperson said: ""The UK is a world leader in cultural heritage protection and Liverpool's World Heritage Status reflects the important role the city has played in our nation's history. ""We are disappointed in this recommendation and will continue to work with Unesco, Historic England and Liverpool City Council to ensure the World Heritage committee can make an informed decision when it meets next month."" Joanne Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool, called on the committee to defer any decision for 12 months and said deletion would be ""hugely unfair"". ""We need [committee members] to see Bramley Moore Dock with their own eyes - physically or virtually,"" she said. Ms Anderson said to strip the city of its World Heritage status would be a ""missed opportunity in demonstrating to the world that heritage and regeneration are not mutually exclusive"". Steve Rotheram, Liverpool City Region mayor, said it was a ""deeply disappointing"" decision and pleaded with the committee to reconsider it. He tweeted: ""We are proud of our history but our heritage is a vital part of our regeneration. ""I'd urge them to take up our invitation to visit rather than taking their decision sat around a table on the other side of the world."" Heritage campaigner Wayne Colquhoun said city officials had ignored repeated warnings about new developments - and the Everton stadium plans look to have been the final straw.

Covid vaccines running out in poorer nations - WHO,"Some countries do not have enough Covid-19 jabs to continue their vaccination programmes A large number of poorer countries receiving Covid-19 vaccines through a global sharing scheme do not have enough doses to continue programmes, the World Health Organization has said. WHO senior adviser Dr Bruce Aylward said the Covax programme had delivered 90 million doses to 131 countries. But he said this was nowhere near enough to protect populations from a virus still spreading worldwide. The shortages come as some nations in Africa see a third wave of infections. On Monday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called for an end to vaccine hoarding by wealthier countries as his government scrambled to curb a steep rise in cases. On a continental level, only 40 million doses have been administered so far in Africa - less than 2% of the population, Mr Ramaphosa said. How are vaccine shortages being tackled in Africa? To address this, he said his government was working with Covax to create a regional hub to produce more vaccines in South Africa. Covax was created last year to ensure Covid-19 doses were made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations. How many Covax vaccines have been pledged? Unicef asks G7 countries to donate vaccines now Why some African states can't use their vaccines This video can not be played Covax vaccine plan: What is it and how will it work? Led by the WHO and other international organisations, Covax initially set a target of providing two billion doses worldwide by the end of 2021. Most of those are being donated to poorer countries, where Covax hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the populations. However, the distribution of these vaccines has been hampered by manufacturing delays and supply disruptions, leading to shortages in countries wholly reliant on Covax. Uganda, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Trinidad and Tobago are just some of the countries that have reported running out of vaccines in recent days. Some countries are battling third waves of Covid-19 as vaccines run out At a WHO briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday, Dr Aylward acknowledged the extent of those shortages in stark terms. Of the 80 low-income countries involved in Covax, ""at least half of them do not have sufficient vaccines to be able to sustain their programmes right now,"" Dr Aylward said. ""If we look at what we're hearing from countries on a day-to-day basis, well over half of countries have run out of stock and are calling for additional vaccine. But in reality it's probably much higher,"" Dr Aylward said. He said some countries had tried to make alternative arrangements to end shortages, with harsh consequences, such as paying above market value for vaccines. Percent of people fully vaccinated Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. Source: Our World in Data Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST As vaccine supplies come under strain, some wealthier countries with spare doses are leading efforts to step up donations through Covax and other means. On Monday the administration of US President Joe Biden announced how it planned to donate 55 million vaccine doses to countries in need. Of those, 41 million would be distributed through Covax, with the remaining 14 million shared with countries deemed to be priorities. These vaccines are not included in the 500 million doses President Biden said the US would donate via Covax. President Biden made that pledge earlier this month at a summit of major economic powers, known as the G7 (Group of Seven). Together,those G7 members committed to donate one billion vaccinesto poorer countries over this year. But campaigners criticised the pledge, saying it lacked ambition, was far too slow and showed Western leaders were not serious about tackling the worst public health crisis in a century. Some health experts believe it could be months - if not years - before enough people are vaccinated globally to declare an end to the pandemic. When asked about global need for vaccines on Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said: ""What we have found to be the biggest challenge is not actually the supply, we have plenty of doses to share with the world, but this is a Herculean logistical challenge.""

Flexible ticket 'will only save me Â£7 a year',"The introduction of flexible rail tickets - aimed at a growing number of commuters who only travel to the office two or three days a week - has had a muted response. The Campaign for Better Transport said commuters will be ""disappointed"", while rail expert Tony Miles, of Modern Railways magazine, also had reservations. But Transport Secretary Grant Shappssaid the new ticketswould offer ""greater freedom and choice about how we travel, simpler ticketing and a fairer fare"". We asked regular train travellers for their first impressions. Steve Allibone commutes from Worthing to London, where he works in financial services. An annual season ticket from West Worthing to London Bridge costs him Â£5,168. The flexible season ticket is Â£397 for 28 days, or Â£5,161 annually - meaning he would save Â£7 annually. ""In principle, it was quite a neat solution, but the cost and the pricing is a bit of a joke,"" he says. Pre-Covid he was commuting five days a week and is currently going in one day a week, which will increase to two days a week after the restrictions ease. ""I could in theory save Â£400 if I only buy 12 of them, but that would require considerable planning when my weeks off are,"" he explains. When I saw the numbers I was disappointed."" He is also unimpressed with current service standards, noticing other passengers often having to stand for over an hour. Also, due to the frequency of train delays Mr Allibone was refunded Â£100 over the course of a year. ""The cost of the tickets has gone up and the quality of the service has gone down,"" he says. For Philippa, a project manager who moved to Bath from close to Stansted, Essex, during the pandemic, the new tickets fail to offer a sufficiently attractive saving. Philippa, who did not want her surname used, works from home and misses the office. She does, though, have a ""lovely work life balance"". ""Before all this I was getting out of bed at 5.30 in the morning, coming back after work and going to bed and doing the same five days a week,"" she adds. At the moment, her company is looking into a hybrid way of working, which would mean a couple of days a week in the office. ""I was hoping that I might be able to move to a couple of days a week in the office, enjoy London life and going out and things,"" Philippa explains. To travel only two days out of seven would save Philippa only Â£17.60 a year, so she is still weighing up other options for reducing costs such as moving back closer to London. ""I was secretly hoping for a much better deal,"" she says. Digital flexi-tickets can be used on any eight days in a 28-day period England without being required to select the days of travel in advance They can be bought on rail websites and apps, as well as at some ticket offices Tickets are paperless, so travellers will have to use a smartphone or smartcard An online calculator will help passengers identify the cheapest option Until the end of this year, passengers who book in advance will be able to change their bookings with no extra charge The tickets are for standard class travel only Kate Morgan, a management consultant in financial services, says her commute from Brighton to London, would be about 11% cheaper - Â£30 a month - with a new flexible ticket. However, this reduction would be less than the cost of one day ticket, so any additional days required in the office would negate those savings. ""Far from it being good news for commuters, it's pretty appalling,"" she says. ""People's point of reference is their annual season ticket, so it's not right for rail companies to compare savings with daily tickets,"" she adds. For Ms Morgan, returning to the office for two days a week is going to cost about the same as it would for five days a week. ""The bit that I'm really disappointed in, is people have been working from home for 18 months and employers are in a difficult position - this really isn't helping that,"" she explains. ""It creates a real barrier in the way of that flexible working becoming a reality."" Niall McGregor, from Norwich, commutes to Canary Wharf to work in a bank. Before Covid he commuted twice a week and worked from home on the other days. ""When you look at the price per journey, the numbers don't make it sufficiently attractive,"" he explains. His annual season ticket costs Â£8,884 for unlimited travel, whereas the Greater Anglia flexi ticket from Norwich to London would cost Â£682.30 - Â£8,187 a year - for only eight tickets a month. ""It doesn't feel like a massive saving for what you're giving up in terms of travel days,"" he says, because it means he would swap 20 days a month travel for eight days a month travel to save Â£697 a year. ""The maths of the new flexible season ticket just don't make much sense,"" he adds. The government estimates commuters could save between Â£60 and Â£350 a year on selected journeys. Ministers say it might not be suitable for every commuter, but is tailored to the growing demand for more flexible working patterns. The Department for Transport said: ""Flexible season tickets will offer most 2 and 3 day per week commuters savings against buying daily tickets or traditional seasons."" ""We have always been clear that passengers should consider which product best suits their journey and travel pattern."" And with the government planning a complete shake-up of the rail network, with the creation of Great British Railways, these changes could be just the start. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators said the rail companies would certainly like to go further in reforming the fares system to help commuters secure the best deal. And the independent watchdog Transport Focus said the changes would help persuade people to choose rail travel again. ""Our research with passengers showed us there was strong demand for a new ticket that suited people who expected to commute less frequently in future,"" the group said.

UK begins talks to join Asia-Pacific trade bloc,"Britain is to start negotiations to join a free trade area which could grant businesses access to ""some of the biggest economies of the present and future"", the government has said. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is made up of 11 nations, including Australia, Canada and Japan. Membership would reduce tariffs on exports such as cars and whisky. The trade area covers a market of around 500 million people. New Zealand, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam are also founder members of the trade agreement, which was established in 2018. The UKapplied to join the bloc in January following Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the trade area was the ""part of the world where Britain's greatest opportunities lie"". Being granted membership would be a ""glittering post-Brexit prize that I want us to seize"", she said. Liz Truss said the deal would benefit farmers in the UK Ms Truss said membership would help ""farmers, makers and innovators sell to some of the biggest economies of the present and future, but without ceding control over our laws, borders or money"". However, there has already been a political backlash against the UK's recently agreed free trade deal with Australia. UK farmers say imports from Australia could undercut them on price and undermine welfare standards. UK wants to join the club - but what is the CPTPP? Scotch whisky tariffs suspended in UK-US deal Australia trade deal won't hit UK farmers - Truss The UK is the first non-founding country to apply to join the CPTPP and would be its second biggest economy after Japan, if negotiations succeed. The free trade agreement aims to reduce trade tariffs - a form of border tax - between member countries and includes a promise to eliminate or reduce 95% of charges on traded goods. In return, countries must cooperate on regulations, such as food standards. However, these standards and regulations do not have to be identical, and member countries can strike their own trade deals. Liz Truss will start the (virtual) talks on Tuesday to join the 11-strong trans-Pacific trading club, and she'll do so from the very room where Winston Churchill oversaw the War effort. The aim is to showcase post-Brexit ambitions. But it is more about strategy than scale. With deals already in place with eight of the CPTPP members, joining may add as little as 0.1% to the size of the UK economy, and it's not clear yet what the UK will have to concede to get the deal, nor how quickly it will happen. The real boost will come if others sign up to this pact. So far, America under President Joe Biden hasn't expressed an interest to do so - nor, as the trade secretary admitted to me, has it set a date to resume talks on a UK-US bilateral deal, paused earlier this year. As trading partners go, the US is twice as important to the UK as all the CPTPP nations put together. Meanwhile, some economists have flagged up that trade with the EU may have been dampened to the tune of several billions of pounds by the new trading arrangements with that bloc, with fresh food particularly hard hit. The Department for International Trade (DFIT) said exports to countries in the Asia-Pacific bloc were set to increase by 65%, around Â£37bn, between now and 2030. ""Joining would boost this growth and support British jobs. These benefits would increase over time, with the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan and the Republic of Korea all having expressed interest in joining,"" a DFIT statement said.

"19 July looking good for end of lockdown, says PMBut Boris Johnson warns there could be a ""rough winter for all sorts of reasons"", including flu.UKComments","Plans to ease Covid restrictions in England on 19 July are ""looking good"", the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said that was based on the efficacy of vaccines against identified variants. But he warned there could be a ""rough winter for all sorts of reasons"", including a resurgence of flu. It comes as the health secretary said he hoped to exempt fully vaccinated people from the requirement to isolate for 10 days when contact-traced. Asked during on a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire whether he could rule out further lockdowns this winter, Mr Johnson said: ""You can never exclude that there will be some new disease, some new horror that we simply haven't budgeted for, or accounted for. ""But looking at where we are, looking at the efficacy of the vaccines against all variants that we can currently see - so Alpha, Delta, the lot of them, Kappa - I think it's looking good for 19 July to be that terminus point."" His comments came after Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the government's advisory committee on vaccination, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that flu ""could be potentially a bigger problem this winter than Covid."" Flu immunity is likely to have dropped in the population as a result of low prevalence because of lockdowns, and it could come ""back to bite us"", he said. Mr Johnson said the risk of a ""rough winter"" was ""all the more reason to reduce the number of Covid cases now, give the NHS the breathing space it needs to get on with dealing with all those other pressures, and we are certainly going to be putting in the investment to make sure that they can"". How does the test-and-trace system work? Who has to self-isolate? What are the rules for travelling abroad? Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that he hoped to bring in a new approach to self-isolation to reflect the changing situation as the country opens up more and more. For the past two months, a pilot study has been under way in which 40,000 people who have been named as contacts of someone who has tested positive for Covid have been allowed to take daily Covid tests and continue with their lives, rather than having to self-isolate. ""We're piloting that now to check that will be effective and it is something that we're working on,"" the health secretary said. ""We're not ready to be able to take that step yet. But it's something that I want to see and we will introduce, subject to clinical advice, as soon as it's reasonable to do so."" The trial is not expected to be completed until later in the summer. This video can not be played Five ways to self-isolate successfully to prevent the spread of coronavirus Currently, anybody who has been told by NHS Test and Trace that they are a contact of somebody who has tested positive for the virus must self-isolate for 10 days. This means not leaving home at all - even to buy food or medicines, or for exercise. The rule applies to people regardless of whether they have received a coronavirus jab. So far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two doses of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose. More than one million jabs were booked on Friday and Saturday in England, after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. There have been a further five deaths within 28 days of testing positive in the UK, according to the government's daily figures - and 10,633 new cases. The prime minister said the government was also looking at using daily tests for travellers. Asked whether ministers were considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UK if they took daily tests, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""When it comes to travel, we'll certainly be looking at that. ""But I want to stress this is going to be, whatever happens, a difficult year for travel - there will be hassle, there will be delays, I'm afraid, because the priority has got to be to keep the country safe and to stop the virus coming back in."" Currently, people arriving in the UK from a country on the government's amber list must quarantine for 10 days - regardless of whether they have had a coronavirus jab. However, in England an individual may be able to end their quarantine period early if they pay for an additional test under the test-to-release scheme. The prime minister has been visiting a laboratory in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""cautiously hopeful"" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. He said the government had always committed to regularly review their international travel plan, with the next ""checkpoint"" taking place on 28 June. He said that the checkpoints would look at whether the ""science would support"" relaxations including people who have received two vaccine doses no longer have to quarantine after returning from certain countries. The original date the government had planned to remove all legal limits on social contact in England was 21 June - but this has been delayed to allow more people to be vaccinated. However, some restrictions have still been eased. The number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue. And in Wales,rules are also being lifted slightly,including capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size. In Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictionshas been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotlandare expected to be extended until mid-July.

The school where dozens died in NHS blood scandalEx-pupils caught up in the infected blood scandal decades ago are giving evidence at an inquiry.,"Ade Goodyear was among the pupils at Treloar's College treated with contaminated blood A public inquiry has begun hearing from former students after more than 120 pupils at a school for disabled children were caught up in what has been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. From 1974 to 1987, those children were offered treatment for haemophilia at Treloar's College. At least 72 died after being given a drug contaminated with HIV and viral hepatitis. ""We've lost so many friends from Treloar's and it's absolutely heartbreaking,"" Richard Warwick, a pupil at the Hampshire school in the late 1970s who was later diagnosed with HIV, told the BBC ahead of the hearing. The inquiry into the use of infected blood began taking evidence from people connected to the school on Monday. Former headmaster, Alec Macpherson, is one of those due to answer questions. ""It caused those boys a lot of anxiety and a lot of upset,"" he told the BBC. ""It put a rage inside them - why me, why has this happened to me, why have I got this dreadful disease?"" Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood The secret in my blood Liz Hooper: The woman who lost two husbands to the scandal Lord Mayor's Treloar's College was a boarding school for physically disabled children with a specialist NHS haemophilia centre on site, run by a dedicated medical team. Treloar's College By the mid 1970s, a new treatment for haemophilia, known as factor VIII/IX, became available for the first time. It meant those with a serious form of the blood disorder could live a normal life without the risk of a bleed. The NHS was not self-sufficient in the blood plasma used to make the drug so it was imported from overseas, most notably the US. Batches were widely contaminated with hepatitis A, B, C and later HIV, infecting thousands of haemophiliacs across the UK. Ade Goodyear joined Treloar's in 1980 at the age of 10. He described life as ""wonderful"" with supportive teachers, nurses and good friends. Like dozens of other boys at the school, he was given factor VIII to help control his bleeding. Ade Goodyear received treatment for haemophilia, along with his two older brothers ""With one of my very first shots, I got hepatitis and was placed in isolation for two weeks,"" he said. In 1985 he was taken into a small office with a group of boys to be told he had tested positive for HIV - then a newly discovered virus with no known treatment and a short life expectancy. ""The doctor was upset and pointed at us and said, you have it, and you haven't. And I was back in science by 1.50pm. I didn't even get the afternoon off,"" he said. ""A friend of mine picked up a pot plant and threw it against the wall of the haemophilia centre. It was a beautiful summer's day and I remember thinking, how many more sunrises like this am I going to see?"" Ade's two older brothers died after treatment with factor VIII - Jason from Aids in 1997 and Gary from health problems linked to hepatitis C in 2015. For pupils like Ade and Richard it meant living with the stigma of what was then a little-known disease. Students were followed by newspaper reporters outside the school gates and shouted questions about their HIV status. Just 32 of the 122 haemophiliacs who attended the school from 1974 to 1987 are still alive today. Most died after contracting HIV or viral hepatitis. It's hoped the public inquiry will be able to answer questions about what happened at Treloar's and the NHS haemophiliac centre run from the site. Ex-pupils Stephen Nicholls and Richard Warwick wear ties with the colours they use to support those who died - red for HIV, yellow for hepatitis, black for death Families want to know why they were not told about the potential risks of Factor VIII earlier and why it took many years until the drug was heat treated to kill viruses and other contaminants. ""What happened at the school comes back to haunt us every day,"" said Stephen Nicholls, a former pupil who was infected with hepatitis C after his treatment. ""We will never forget the Treloar's story and those memories of what happened here."" It is a rare genetic condition in which the blood does not clot properly. It mostly affects men. People with the condition produce lower amounts of the essential blood-clotting protein known as factor VIII and IX. Former students are giving evidence this week, some anonymously, along with the parents of children who lost their lives. The haemophilia centre on the site was run by NHS doctors and nurses and not staff directly employed by the school, which still cares for physically disabled children today. ""Although no-one has at any point suggested that Treloar's was at fault, it is a tragic part of our past,"" the school said in a statement. ""It was, and still is, a very difficult time for our affected alumni, their families and staff who were here at the point. ""We are completely supportive of the campaign for truth, answers and justice by our former pupils."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Poorer white pupils neglected for decades, say MPs","White working class pupils have been failed by decades of neglect in England's education system, a report by MPs says. The Education Select Committee accused the government of a lack of targeted support for disadvantaged white pupils. It says use of the term ""white privilege"", suggesting white pupils are at an advantage, is the ""opposite"" of the reality for poor white pupils. The government says it is committed to making sure no child is left behind. The report warns that white pupils on free school meals underachieve from early years in school through to GCSE, A-levels and university entry, compared with pupils on free meals from other ethnic groups. Committee chairman Robert Halfon said it was a ""major social injustice"" that so little had been done to address this gap in attainment - and accused the government of ""muddled thinking"" in suggesting it could be explained by poverty. ""If you think it's about poverty, then it doesn't explain why most other ethnic groups do much better,"" he said. Poorer white pupils are falling behind ""every step of the way"", he warned, and with almost a million young people being affected, it could not be ""swept under the carpet"". At GCSE, in 2019, 18% of white British pupils on free meals achieved grade 5 in English and maths, compared with 23% for the average for pupils on free meals For university entry, 16% of white British pupils on free meals get places, compared with 59% of black African pupils on free meals, 59% of Bangladeshi pupils on free meals and 32% of black Caribbean pupils on free meals. The places where people live and their local challenges were part of the bigger picture of achievement, MPs reported Mr Halfon warned against using the term ""white privilege"" in education, saying it was divisive and likely to ""promote disharmony"" and ""pits one group against another"". The committee described white privilege, which has been used in a wider social context, as the idea of ""societal privilege that benefits white people over other ethnic groups"". The committee said that in education ""privilege is the very opposite to what disadvantaged white children"" experience - and questioned whether under equality legislation schools should use that terminology. But a Labour MP on the committee, Kim Johnson, rejected the reference to white privilege as a red herring which was trying to ""stoke the culture war"" and avoid scrutiny of the ""lack of investment"" in schools and local communities. The report highlighted a mix of challenges about the local areas where many poor white pupils lived - and also ""cultural factors"" that could limit how much support they got from their families. These underlying social problems included: Poor local jobs market and lack of opportunity Lack of community assets and social organisations, poor local services and transport Families with ""multi-generational poverty"" Disengaged parents with a poor experience of education In response, the committee proposed more targeted funding and making the education system feel more relevant for these communities. Using pupil premium funding to provide more support ""Family hubs"" to get parents involved with children's learning Attract teachers to areas that can struggle to retain staff Ensure that work-related, vocational education is available ""Find a better way to talk about racial disparities"" Oliver is planning to go to university - and warns about stereotypes being created about white working class teenagers ""There's this nagging feeling that it's not for me,"" says 18-year-old Oliver Jones-Lyons, describing the ""suspicions"" about the value of education that he thinks hold back some white working class communities. He has been a pupil on free meals at a school near Newcastle and says there is still a concern about the education system harbouring snobbery and class prejudice, even down to stereotypes about regional accents which ""mark you out as different"". There's an inclination to turn away from exams and instead say ""my dad can get us a job"". ""There's a lack of explanation of how education is helping you,"" Oliver says. But he argues ""the biggest barriers to education are outside education"" - in places with limited job opportunities, bad housing, poor public transport and families not able to support their children in school. And he says that while he describes himself as a ""white working class boy"" he doesn't like the way that the label is being used to ""create more stereotypes"". ""It shouldn't be about putting people against each other"" or about ""culture wars"", he says, and rejects the white working class identity being caricatured as being bigoted or narrow minded. A better description would be people ""more likely to undersell ourselves"" and to dislike showing off, says Oliver. But his own ambition has been supported by working with the Social Mobility Foundation charity - and he is waiting to see if he gets the A-levels grades needed to get into Oxford University next year. The underachievement is down to a ""poisonous mix of place, family and local culture"", said Chris Zarraga, director of Schools North East, a regional network of head teachers in one of the areas with the biggest concentrations of disadvantaged white pupils. He said it meant tackling the consequences of ""long-term deprivation"", where there might be fifth and sixth generations of workless families. What is 'white privilege'? White working class boys least likely to go to university The left-behind towns with lowest university take-up Half of universities have fewer than 5% disadvantaged white students ""Schools can't do it alone,"" he said, warning that already the pandemic had seen schools having to cope with feeding and clothing pupils. ""We need a cross-party sense of urgency about solving these problems,"" he said. Mr Zarraga backed the targeted use of pupil premium funding and called for better ways of retaining teaching staff in the most challenging areas. Kerry would like her sons to be able to go to college and get an apprenticeship The report argues that vocational routes in education need to be clearly available - showing the connection between qualifications and work. This chimes with the concerns of Kerry, a mother in Mansfield who is thinking about what jobs will be available for her sons, Bailey and Finley, in the years ahead. Her own parents stepped from school into factory work, which she says offered secure jobs. The current world of employment seems more precarious, she says. ""I don't see good jobs arising, I don't think there's much opportunity out there,"" says Kerry. ""I want them to go to college, then get apprenticeships."" The aim is ""guaranteed work"" and she is worried about the cost of university. ""As a parent, I wouldn't be able to fund them to go,"" Kerry adds. Without tackling the underachievement of white working class pupils the wider aim of narrowing the attainment gap between rich and poor will fail, warned former Ofsted chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw ""Two thirds of children on free school meals live in these communities. We will never reduce educational inequality unless we urgently address this longstanding issue,"" he said. Labour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the MPs' report showed the Conservative Party has ""turned its back on these pupils who need most support, from knowingly underfunded free childcare places in early years to cutting the pupil premium"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""This government is focused on levelling up opportunity so that no young person is left behind. ""That's why we are providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade,"" added the DfE spokesman, with Â£3bn in recovery funding and existing plans to increase school budgets. ""The pupil premium is expected to increase to more than Â£2.5bn this year, through which schools can support pupils with extra teaching, academic support or activities like breakfast clubs or educational trips.""

The âtabooâ about who doesnât go to university,"John-Russell Barnes says many of his friends in Hastings remain uncertain about going to university John-Russell Barnes has three part-time jobs to help support his mother and sisters. But that's not what makes the 18-year-old from Hastings unusual. He's a white working-class boy who is going to university. More than half a million new students will be heading off to start at universities across the UK this term, with record numbers set to enter despite all the Covid complications. But white males from low-income families are the ""least likely"" group to be going, according to the most recent figures from the Department for Education. Among state school youngsters not on free school meals, 45% go on to higher education by the age of 19. Those more disadvantaged students, eligible for free school meals, have a lower entry rate of 26%. But for ""male, white British, free school meals"" pupils, the figure is 13% - even lower than the year before, and to put it in context, it's below ""looked after"" children who have been in council care and far below those speaking English as a second language. Coastal towns often have lower rates of young people going to university This figure of 13% is stuck in another era compared with the success stories of other groups, such as black students, with 59% progressing to higher education, and 64% of Asian students. For sixth formers in independent schools, 85% make the step forward into higher education. More than half of universities have fewer than 5% poor white students Why do white working-class children underachieve in school? Inequality 'undermining trust in democracy' The gap is so wide that the chairman of the House of Commons education select committee, Robert Halfon, says there has almost been a ""taboo"" talking about it. But why are young white males from poorer backgrounds so less likely to go to university? ""At the beginning of college a lot of my mates were saying they were going to go to university - and then at the end, they're like 'maybe not,'"" says John-Russell Barnes. ""People started to drift off on to different paths."" John-Russell is taking the plunge to go to university in Swansea to study law That might be a positive alternative, such as an apprenticeship or a good job - but it might also be insecure, temporary work they can pick up in the East Sussex seaside town. He thinks boys are particularly susceptible to short-term incentives, taking the quick cash available and putting off going to university in a way that means it will never really happen. ""Whereas I feel girls are probably more mature. They're prepared to just go to uni and not worry about it, whereas men are: 'Oh, you know, I'll see how I am in a couple of years and then maybe I'll go.' And they don't end up going."" And in practice it's often easier for men to get better-paid casual labour than women, he says. John-Russell's own focus has been on studying law, the subject he's going to take at Swansea University after getting the A-level grades he needed at a further education college. He wants it to be a different future from his round of temporary jobs in a bakery, corner shop and pub. ""I've always been quite set on it,"" he says, and he's been supported by the Villiers Park trust, a charity which works with bright disadvantaged youngsters trying to get into university. The view from Hastings beach: John-Russell has been working with the Villiers Trust on raising horizons He's been on projects run by Villiers Park, which provide information, advice and opportunities to meet other young people who are thinking about going to university. And for John-Russell, the biggest deciding factor has been seeing university as the route for his ambition to become a lawyer. For those of his friends not going to university, he says it's not necessarily the tuition fees that are the main deterrent, but the lack of certainty about getting a career to make the expense worthwhile. Seaside towns can see holidaymakers, second-homers and deprivation all side by side There's also the ""fear of the unknown"", he says, that it's ""intimidating"" to move into something very different and away from home and family, with no guarantee of a good job at the end. ""Personally I don't really like change that much. It's like going to a restaurant - I always order the same sort of things, rather than trying something new,"" he says. It's a big step for him - but he's confident that it's the right decision. But why has this group been so often left behind while others have taken big strides in getting into higher education? There is nothing inevitable about deprivation being a barrier. Inner London is the most stellar illustration of this, with 49% of pupils on free meals going on to higher education - and overall numbers of disadvantaged students have been rising. The big factor for John-Russell was seeing university as a path to his ambition to be a lawyer Women have continued to get more places and accelerated further ahead of men - and boys from middle-class families are able to stay on the conveyor belt that takes them seamlessly from school to university. And the biggest single increase in university entry over the past decade has been among black youngsters, with black African families doing particularly well. For boys on free school meals from black African families, 52% progress to higher education, compared with 24% for black Caribbean boys on free school meals. Anne-Marie Canning, chief executive of the Brilliant Club, which campaigns to widen access to university, says there remains a ""real issue"" about the lack of a similar breakthrough for white working-class boys. ""We need to be more mature about what diversity means,"" says Ms Canning, a former director of social mobility at King's College London. She says too often projects to engage this demographic have reverted to stereotypes - with links to things like boxing or other sports  which from the outside might seem gritty and male, but which in practice fail to land a punch. Have changes in jobs and industries dented the confidence of communities? There are much deeper issues at play with young white males from ""post-industrial towns"", she suggests. These are places where the confidence, status and identity of communities have been badly dented by changes in jobs and the economy. She points to the ""collapse of local institutions"" - whether it's social clubs, work-based societies, church groups, adult education or trade union organisations, which might once have raised horizons. ""Parental attitudes really matter,"" she says - and too often such disadvantaged youngsters thinking about applying to university can suffer badly from ""imposter syndrome"". There is a strong overlapping regional dimension. The areas of England with a high concentration of white disadvantaged youngsters, such as the north-east, east, south-west and coastal towns, are also where university entry rates are lower. Sir David Bell, vice chancellor of the University of Sunderland, says universities need to think more about how to present courses to their local community - such as showing clear links into employment and appealing to students who want to carry on living at home. There are record numbers of students this year - but big regional differences in entry rates ""Social mobility too often is thought of as a relatively small number going away to study and never coming back,"" said Sir David, a former head of Ofsted. There have been arguments from the government against getting 50% of young people into university - but in the north-east, where the entry rate for those on free school meals is 21% - he sees this as missing the point. ""It's a nice argument to have in the salons of London that too many people are going to university,"" said Sir David. But what's being done to close the gap? Graeme Atherton, director of the National Education Opportunities Network, produced research last year revealing that more than half of England's universities had fewer than 5% of poor white students in their intakes. Instead of this being a call to arms, he says there has been a ""perfect storm of inaction"". Only 2% of white low-income males get places in the top group of universities He has carried out research, so far unpublished, which will show that the numbers of universities with targets for disadvantaged white students are going down rather than up - from 27 institutions to four. Universities find this a ""difficult conversation"", he says, and without pressure from policymakers, it's one they often seem to prefer to leave alone. The low entry rate is in some ways easy to explain. Boys get worse exam results than girls, white students are among the lowest achievers and poor pupils tend to do worse than the wealthy. It's been been a success story in improving access to universities for students from ethnic minorities When those factors are combined, white boys from low-income families have among the lowest exam results and are the least well-equipped to get university places. But Dr Atherton says there are other dimensions. ""We use the term social mobility, but it also means you're leaving something behind, physically and culturally,"" he says. Going away to university is a big social departure - and if the rest of the family are ambivalent about its benefits and didn't go themselves, the idea can soon be abandoned. Even in terms of qualifications, this group can be facing an uphill struggle. They are disproportionately more likely to be taking BTecs rather than the A-levels that will be the more typical path into higher-ranking universities. Only 2% of white working class boys get into more selective, ""high tariff"" universities. MPs warned that delays in BTec grades this summer could have caused even more disruption for students wanting to use the results for university places. Mary Curnock Cook was previously in charge of Ucas, the admissions system for universities, and she says there has been a reluctance to engage with this issue - which gets left in the ""too difficult to handle box"". But she says it's a ""double discrimination"" if disadvantaged white males not only are under-represented in university, but then have the problem ignored. Robert Halfon, whose select committee is investigating the achievement gap for these ""left behind"" young people, says it's important that it's no longer ""swept under the carpet"".

Sir Jeffrey Donaldson confirms DUP leadership bidThe MP previously said he would leave Westminster to become NI's first minister if he became leader.Northern Ireland,"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would leave Westminster and become NI's first minister, if he becomes DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has confirmed his candidacy for the leadership of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). In May, the Lagan Valley MPwas defeated by Edwin Poots, who is to resign following internal divisions. Sir Jeffrey has previously said he would leave Westminster and become NI's first minister if he became leader. He warned that Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive would be at risk if the UK government fails to take ""decisive action"" over the protocol. Nominations for the leadership will close at midday on Tuesday but Sir Jeffrey is likely to take the top job unopposed. ""Now, more than ever, we need to unite in the face of the threats posed to Northern Ireland by the protocol,"" he said in a statement. ""Make no mistake, this is the number one issue facing our country, our people and our place within the United Kingdom. ""If elected, I will ensure that the government doesn't just listen, but recognises the need to take decisive action to deal quickly with the protocol. ""A failure to act will undoubtedly have consequences for the stability of our political institutions and the prosperity of our economy."" Edwin Poots resigned as DUP leader last Thursday, after 21 days in the post The decision by Mr Poots to stand down followed a revolt over his decision to nominate Paul Givan as first minister. Section of DUP 'struggled' with Poots' leadership Mr Givan became first minister on Thursday, however, has since been told by DUP officers that he mustresign from the post when a new party leader takes over. As it stands, it very much feels like this is going to be a one-horse race. Come 12:00 BST on Tuesday, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is expected to be declared the leader-designate of the DUP. Then we're expecting a ratification process which we understand will happen at some stage next week. Sir Jeffrey, if he does indeed become the next DUP leader, has to find a pathway back to Stormont. He has made it clear he wants to lead the party here as first minister. To do that, he has to find a seat and get himself co-opted. The number one priority for Sir Jeffrey is to get back among the MLAs at Stormont. Sinn FÃ©in had refused to nominate a deputy first minister to the joint office unless there was a commitment to implement the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement, which contained provisions for the Irish language. The UK government said it would introduce legislation in October if the assembly had failed to do so. 'No Sinn FÃ©in shopping list' over top Stormont jobs Likely plotlines if Donaldson writes DUP script Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? Sir Jeffrey has previously said he will not nominate a first minister unless there is ""significant change in the plans to bring in Irish language laws"". He has also expressed opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit deal which keeps NI aligned to the EU single market, but has caused disruption in trade with Great Britain. This video can not be played 'Jeffrey Donaldson will have my full support' Earlier, outgoing First Minister Paul Givan said Sir Jeffrey would have his ""full support"" should he decide to run for leader of the DUP. ""Jeffrey is a formidable politician, one that has a lot to offer Northern Ireland,"" said Mr Givan. ""I have spoken to Jeffrey Donaldson over the weekend, I have encouraged him to put his name forward, if he does, he'll have my full support."" Mr Givan was speaking following his first official event in Belfast since becoming first minister last week. He described Sir Jeffrey as ""a close, personal friend"" and a ""constituency colleague"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson shares an office with both Mr Givan and outgoing DUP leader Edwin Poots. Sir Jeffrey, born in Kilkeel, County Down, first became politically active as a constituency agent for the South Down MP Enoch Powell in the mid-1980s, before working as a personal assistant to the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader James Molyneaux. After Lord Molyneaux retired as an MP in 1997, Mr Donaldson was voted as his successor as MP for Lagan Valley, retaining the seat through six subsequent elections. He is a member of the Orange Order and also served as a corporal in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during The Troubles. In 2003, following long-standing opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and the leadership of David Trimble, Mr Donaldson announced he would leave the UUP, later joining the DUP, along with Arlene Foster and Norah Beare. Jeffrey Donaldson was appointed to the UK Privy Council, a body which advises the monarchy, in 2007, and stood down as an MLA for Lagan Valley in 2010. He was awarded a knighthood in 2016 for political service. Sir Jeffrey was defeated by 19 votes to 17 in the DUP leadership election to succeed Arlene Foster in May 2021. On Monday, Stormont finance minister and Sinn FÃ©in MLA Conor Murphy accused the DUP of having ""no intention"" of delivering on commitments in NDNA. This agreement brokered the return of power-sharing after three years of deadlock. Mr Murphy told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that his party did not ""want to box anybody in"" but questioned the DUP's ""credibility"" if it could not deliver on the commitments. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also said the next leader of the DUP cannot be allowed to ""choreograph the collapse of the institutions at Stormont"". Paul Givan looks set to be the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland When Paul Givan resigns it will trigger a seven-day period for new nominations to the posts of first and deputy first minister, or the possibility of a fresh election. Mr Eastwood said the ""imminent resignation"" of the DUP's first minister showed that the party intended to ""manufacture another political crisis that will once again threaten our local institutions"". ""In a desperate attempt to stabilise their own party, they are recklessly prepared to destabilise devolution,"" he said. Potential new leaders must submit their nomination in writing, supported by a proposer and a seconder, to DUP chairman Lord Morrow by midday on Tuesday, with a result confirmed on Saturday. Only Stormont assembly members (MLAs) and members of parliament (MPs) are entitled to take part if there is a vote. In May's contest, Sir Jeffrey, who has been the MP for Lagan Valley since 1997, lost by 19 votes to 17 in the first DUP leadership election in its 50-year history. Among the first tasks for a new leader will be a decision over the ministerial team appointed by Edwin Poots. Paul Givan is likely to become the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland when he is removed, while a new leader could have other plans for the education, economy and agriculture portfolios.

Sturgeon defends Scotland-Manchester travel ban,"This video can not be played ""If Andy Burnham wants a grown-up conversation, he only has to pick up the phone"" â  Nicola Sturgeon Scotland's first minister has defended the ban on non-essential travel with Manchester and Salford after an angry reaction from the area's mayor. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has nowwritten to Nicola Sturgeon,externalasking her to explain the move. Ms Sturgeon earlier said the decision was a public health measure, based on Covid levels in the area. Opposition politicians in Scotland said there had been a lack of consistency and a lack of consultation. However, Ms Sturgeon - who received her second vaccination in Glasgow on Monday - said she had a ""duty"" to keep Scotland as safe as possible. Mayor's anger at Manchester-Scotland travel ban Salford woman cancels Scotland honeymoon over travel ban What are the rules in your area? ""I have always got on well with Andy Burnham. If he wants a grown-up conversation he only has to pick up the phone,"" she said. ""But if, as I suspect might be the case, this is more about getting into a spat with me as part of a some positioning in a Labour leadership contest of the future, then I am not interested."" The first minister said she was ""confused"" by Mr Burnham's position. Covid rates in Manchester and Salford are among the highest in England ""Back in May we imposed travel restrictions on Bolton for exactly the same reasons we are now doing it on Manchester,"" she said. ""Andy Burnham is mayor of Bolton as well and he did not raise any of these issues then."" Ms Sturgeon said the restrictions would not be enforced differently to previous travel rules, and would be in place ""no longer than is absolutely necessary"". Mr Burnham acknowledged the first minister has faced ""difficult decisions"" during the pandemic but condemned the fact he was given no advance warning of the travel ban. He told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime: ""The UK government has called me when they were making changes affecting Greater Manchester.  I think the first minister should have extended us the same courtesy. ""If Westminster had, without notice, imposed a travel ban on Scotland on Friday, I feel pretty certain in saying the first minister would have expressed publicly her concern in exactly the same way I am doing that on behalf of the people of Greater Manchester."" Mr Burnham's letter to the first minister also asks why residents of Bolton are still subject to a travel ban while residents of Dundee, which he said has a higher case rate, are not. In Dundee the latest seven-day positive test rate per 100,000 population, up to 18 June, was 303.4. On Monday the seven-day figure in Bolton was 257. Mr Burnham also called on the Scottish government to compensate those who are now out of pocket and described the suggestion he was playing politics as ""fairly insulting"". Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has accused the Scottish government of ""hypocrisy"" Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Conservatives' spokesman for Covid recovery, said Mr Burnham was ""absolutely correct"" to express concern about the ban and the ""lack of consultation"". Mr Fraser toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethere was a ""lack of consistency"" in the Scottish government's approach. ""We know that the city of Dundee, for example, has case rates very similar to Manchester,"" he said. ""So why is there a travel ban being introduced for Scots going to Manchester, but there are no similar restrictions put in, in relation to Dundee?"" Dundee, which has the highest Covid case rate in Scotland, recorded 487 new cases in the week up to 18 June,according to UK government figures,external. Manchester recorded 1,928 cases and Salford 880 in the same period, but the rate per 100,000 people for all three areas is very similar. Jackie Baillie, deputy leader of Scottish Labour, said people would find the ban hard to understand. ""This has just been put in place without any consultation, without any dialogue and without any concern for either the people of Manchester or the tourism industry in Scotland,"" she said. ""Are we consistent in saying it's OK to travel in and out of areas of Scotland where the rates of infection are higher than they are in Manchester? That's the inconsistency that people just do not understand."" Are you affected by the ban on non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford? Have you had to change your plans?

Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the provisions that had been put in place were ""consistent"" with approaches taken in the area previously. Non-essential travel was banned between Scotland and Bolton in Greater Manchester, and Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, on 24 May. Mr Burnham said he would be writing to the Scottish government to ask how it would compensate businesses in Manchester who could lose bookings. But Mr Swinney said that would not be ""appropriate"". Asked whether similar travel restrictions should be introduced in Dundee, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government would need to look ""very carefully"" at ""localised situations"". Renu Bhardwaj has had to cancel her plans to travel from Glasgow to Manchester this weekend Mother-of-two Renu Bhardwaj had been due to travel to Manchester this weekend. ""The children are finishing school in four days and we had plans to go down and meet my family again and enjoy the summer holidays, or make the most of what we can,"" she said. The lifestyle blogger, who moved to Glasgow 13 years ago, used to make regular trips south to visit her relatives before the pandemic. She said she could understand the reasoning behind the decision, but that the timing, so close to the school holidays, was ""the worst for everybody"". Police Scotland said its approach throughout the pandemic remains the same. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs said: ""Officers will engage with the public, explain the legislation and encourage compliance, but will not hesitate to use enforcement as a last resort. ""The Chief Constable has said publicly on numerous occasions that we will not be routinely stopping vehicles or setting up road blocks, and that will not change."" On Monday, the UK recorded another 10,633 Covid cases - including 8,766 cases for England and 1,250 for Scotland. Both nations have seen rising seven-day infection rates, with the Scottish rate at 131.7 per 100,000 people and 92.7 per 100,000 people in England on 18 June. Scotland, which has one of the highest infection rates in Europe but also one of the highest vaccination rates, haspaused the lifting of Covid restrictions this summerbecause of rising cases.

"Liverpool set to lose World Heritage statusA Unesco committee recommends ""with deep regret"" Liverpool should be demoted due to development.","Liverpool received World Heritage status in 2004 A Unesco committee has recommended that Liverpool should lose its World Heritage status.

An artist's impression of Everton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock A government spokesperson said: ""The UK is a world leader in cultural heritage protection and Liverpool's World Heritage Status reflects the important role the city has played in our nation's history. ""We are disappointed in this recommendation and will continue to work with Unesco, Historic England and Liverpool City Council to ensure the World Heritage committee can make an informed decision when it meets next month."" Joanne Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool, called on the committee to defer any decision for 12 months and said deletion would be ""hugely unfair"". ""We need [committee members] to see Bramley Moore Dock with their own eyes - physically or virtually,"" she said. Ms Anderson said to strip the city of its World Heritage status would be a ""missed opportunity in demonstrating to the world that heritage and regeneration are not mutually exclusive"". Steve Rotheram, Liverpool City Region mayor, said it was a ""deeply disappointing"" decision and pleaded with the committee to reconsider it. He tweeted: ""We are proud of our history but our heritage is a vital part of our regeneration. ""I'd urge them to take up our invitation to visit rather than taking their decision sat around a table on the other side of the world."" Heritage campaigner Wayne Colquhoun said city officials had ignored repeated warnings about new developments - and the Everton stadium plans look to have been the final straw.

Sir Jeffrey Donaldson confirms DUP leadership bidThe MP previously said he would leave Westminster to become NI's first minister if he became leader.,"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would leave Westminster and become NI's first minister, if he becomes DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has confirmed his candidacy for the leadership of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). In May, the Lagan Valley MPwas defeated by Edwin Poots, who is to resign following internal divisions. Sir Jeffrey has previously said he would leave Westminster and become NI's first minister if he became leader. He warned that Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive would be at risk if the UK government fails to take ""decisive action"" over the protocol. Nominations for the leadership will close at midday on Tuesday but Sir Jeffrey is likely to take the top job unopposed. ""Now, more than ever, we need to unite in the face of the threats posed to Northern Ireland by the protocol,"" he said in a statement. ""Make no mistake, this is the number one issue facing our country, our people and our place within the United Kingdom. ""If elected, I will ensure that the government doesn't just listen, but recognises the need to take decisive action to deal quickly with the protocol. ""A failure to act will undoubtedly have consequences for the stability of our political institutions and the prosperity of our economy."" Edwin Poots resigned as DUP leader last Thursday, after 21 days in the post The decision by Mr Poots to stand down followed a revolt over his decision to nominate Paul Givan as first minister. Section of DUP 'struggled' with Poots' leadership Mr Givan became first minister on Thursday, however, has since been told by DUP officers that he mustresign from the post when a new party leader takes over. As it stands, it very much feels like this is going to be a one-horse race. Come 12:00 BST on Tuesday, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is expected to be declared the leader-designate of the DUP. Then we're expecting a ratification process which we understand will happen at some stage next week. Sir Jeffrey, if he does indeed become the next DUP leader, has to find a pathway back to Stormont. He has made it clear he wants to lead the party here as first minister. To do that, he has to find a seat and get himself co-opted. The number one priority for Sir Jeffrey is to get back among the MLAs at Stormont. Sinn FÃ©in had refused to nominate a deputy first minister to the joint office unless there was a commitment to implement the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement, which contained provisions for the Irish language. The UK government said it would introduce legislation in October if the assembly had failed to do so. 'No Sinn FÃ©in shopping list' over top Stormont jobs Likely plotlines if Donaldson writes DUP script Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? Sir Jeffrey has previously said he will not nominate a first minister unless there is ""significant change in the plans to bring in Irish language laws"". He has also expressed opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit deal which keeps NI aligned to the EU single market, but has caused disruption in trade with Great Britain. This video can not be played 'Jeffrey Donaldson will have my full support' Earlier, outgoing First Minister Paul Givan said Sir Jeffrey would have his ""full support"" should he decide to run for leader of the DUP. ""Jeffrey is a formidable politician, one that has a lot to offer Northern Ireland,"" said Mr Givan. ""I have spoken to Jeffrey Donaldson over the weekend, I have encouraged him to put his name forward, if he does, he'll have my full support."" Mr Givan was speaking following his first official event in Belfast since becoming first minister last week. He described Sir Jeffrey as ""a close, personal friend"" and a ""constituency colleague"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson shares an office with both Mr Givan and outgoing DUP leader Edwin Poots. Sir Jeffrey, born in Kilkeel, County Down, first became politically active as a constituency agent for the South Down MP Enoch Powell in the mid-1980s, before working as a personal assistant to the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader James Molyneaux. After Lord Molyneaux retired as an MP in 1997, Mr Donaldson was voted as his successor as MP for Lagan Valley, retaining the seat through six subsequent elections. He is a member of the Orange Order and also served as a corporal in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during The Troubles. In 2003, following long-standing opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and the leadership of David Trimble, Mr Donaldson announced he would leave the UUP, later joining the DUP, along with Arlene Foster and Norah Beare. Jeffrey Donaldson was appointed to the UK Privy Council, a body which advises the monarchy, in 2007, and stood down as an MLA for Lagan Valley in 2010. He was awarded a knighthood in 2016 for political service. Sir Jeffrey was defeated by 19 votes to 17 in the DUP leadership election to succeed Arlene Foster in May 2021. On Monday, Stormont finance minister and Sinn FÃ©in MLA Conor Murphy accused the DUP of having ""no intention"" of delivering on commitments in NDNA. This agreement brokered the return of power-sharing after three years of deadlock. Mr Murphy told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that his party did not ""want to box anybody in"" but questioned the DUP's ""credibility"" if it could not deliver on the commitments. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also said the next leader of the DUP cannot be allowed to ""choreograph the collapse of the institutions at Stormont"". Paul Givan looks set to be the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland When Paul Givan resigns it will trigger a seven-day period for new nominations to the posts of first and deputy first minister, or the possibility of a fresh election. Mr Eastwood said the ""imminent resignation"" of the DUP's first minister showed that the party intended to ""manufacture another political crisis that will once again threaten our local institutions"". ""In a desperate attempt to stabilise their own party, they are recklessly prepared to destabilise devolution,"" he said. Potential new leaders must submit their nomination in writing, supported by a proposer and a seconder, to DUP chairman Lord Morrow by midday on Tuesday, with a result confirmed on Saturday. Only Stormont assembly members (MLAs) and members of parliament (MPs) are entitled to take part if there is a vote. In May's contest, Sir Jeffrey, who has been the MP for Lagan Valley since 1997, lost by 19 votes to 17 in the first DUP leadership election in its 50-year history. Among the first tasks for a new leader will be a decision over the ministerial team appointed by Edwin Poots. Paul Givan is likely to become the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland when he is removed, while a new leader could have other plans for the education, economy and agriculture portfolios.

Hotel Chocolat pays Â£4 to gobble up beauty firm,"Luxury confectioner Hotel Chocolat has just concluded a sweet deal - by gobbling up a cosmetics business that specialises in ""cacao-powered beauty"". The firm paid just Â£4 to take full control of Rabot 1745, which it set up five years ago in partnership with businessman Andrew Gerrie. The amount is less than Hotel Chocolat's cheapest selection box, which costs Â£5. Rabot lost Â£400,000 last year but Hotel Chocolat says it can turn it around. The beauty business, founded in 2016, is described as having a range of products ""inspired by the wild beauty of the group's St Lucian cacao farm and rainforest spa"". Its range includes a variety of chocolate-themed products, from Almond Chocolat lip balm to Cacao, Almond and Coconut Three Shell Scrub. It calls itself a ""responsible, engaged business"" and pledges that by the end of this year, 100% of its packaging will be compostable, reusable or recyclable. âVirtual beauty tests used to be gimmicky but now they are usefulâ The farmers eyeing sweet success from chocolate Hotel Chocolat chief executive and co-founder Angus Thirlwell told the BBC that Rabot was ""Hotel Chocolat's best-kept secret"", since not many buyers of its chocolates knew about it as yet. ""We've been incubating a beauty business,"" he said. ""We're not interested in quick wins, we like to build things up from a solid foundation."" He said Hotel Chocolat had always intended to make Rabot a part of its main business, but the catalyst had been the opening two weeks ago of a massive 5,000-sq-ft Hotel Chocolat outlet in the Japanese city of Oita, with a large dedicated space given over to beauty products. ""Sales have been very encouraging,"" he said. ""Japanese consumers love our take on the natural power of cacao."" Mr Thirlwell said Japan was a great market to experiment in, because Japanese consumers were ""very demanding"". ""If we can meet those demands in Japan, we stand a great chance of being successful in other markets,"" he added. It's all about the power of cacao, says Angus Thirlwell Other chocolate makers are unlikely to follow him into the beauty market any time soon, but that doesn't worry Mr Thirlwell. ""We've always been a contemporary version of luxury chocolate and the companies we compete against are more heritage European brands,"" he said. ""We're younger in our outlook."" Hotel Chocolat owns several cacao plantations on the island of St Lucia and a luxury hotel, where it started using cacao-based beauty products at the spa. They expanded the range and it's been in store and online for the last three years. Despite the losses, the products are said to have been selling well as we treated ourselves during lockdown. Hotel Chocolat has branched out into selling all sorts of cacao-based products, from cacao gin and salted caramel vodka to posh chocolate ice cream and hot drinks.  Diversifying your product offering can be a risky distraction for any business, but it's also a way to boost sales and profits. Hotel Chocolat thinks it's a recipe for success and will hopefully lure new customers, as well as add value to the brand. The Hotel Chocolat group already owns 47% of Rabot, while Mr Gerrie, who is also the group's non-executive chairman, owns 40.5%. Mr Gerrie will receive Â£3 in exchange for his stake, while the remaining investors will share the other Â£1 between them. After it buys his stake in Rabot, Hotel Chocolat will pay back a Â£744,000 loan that Mr Gerrie provided to the beauty business. It will give him more than 200,000 newly issued Hotel Chocolat shares, increasing his stake in the group by about 40%. Wayne Brown, an analyst at Liberum, said the deal would help Hotel Chocolat to differentiate itself from other chocolate brands. He also added that it would allow operations to be integrated, which should eventually ""see Rabot begin to turn a profit versus the current slight loss"". âVirtual beauty tests used to be gimmicky but now they are usefulâ The farmers eyeing sweet success from chocolate 'It was the place to get that Willy Wonka feeling' Hotel Chocolat 'in mourning' after van found burnt out Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump sentencing hearing in New York hush-money case begins What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Ministry of Defence to pay for 'national yacht',"The government has put out a mocked-up image of what the new flagship might look like A UK business-promoting ""national yacht"", reportedly costing up to Â£200m, is to be paid for by the Ministry of Defence, Downing Street has said. A spokesman added that Boris Johnson wanted the vessel to be built in the UK if possible. It will be the successor to the Royal Yacht Britannia, which was retired in 1997 after 44 years in service. The yacht, whose name has yet to be announced, will sail the globe, hosting trade fairs and talks. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This is a national flagship which will drive investment into the economy and boost trade."" He added that it would be ""funded through the Ministry of Defence (MoD)"". New national ship to showcase best of British - PM Asked why the funding was set to come out of the MoD's budget - when the yacht will be classified as a trade ship rather than a military vessel - the spokesman replied that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace had responsibility for UK shipbuilding. He added that Mr Johnson wanted the yacht to be built in the UK but would ensure the process was compliant with all international rules on procurement. Defence procurement minister Jeremy Quin, questioned on a trip to Odessa, Ukraine, about whether the MoD was funding the scheme, said: ""It'll be paid for by the government, and what we have is a capability to help project the UK around the world, project global Britain."" The project was ""still at the early stages"", he added. The Royal Yacht Britannia became a tourist attraction in Edinburgh after it was decommissioned Labour has said the government must demonstrate clearly how the ship is expected to boost trade. Shadow Treasury minister Bridget Phillipson said it should be built in the UK to support jobs in shipyards and called for ""a real focus on value for money at every stage"". Business Secretary Kwarsi Kwarteng told Sky News the yacht would cost a ""huge amount of money"" but would act a ""symbol of Britain"". It would, he added, be ""something which would really enhance what we call our soft power"" and was a ""good idea"". The yacht, which is set to be in service for about 30 years, will be part of the Royal Navy and crewed by it. Earlier this year, the prime minister said it would be ""the first vessel of its kind in the world"" and would reflect ""the UK's burgeoning status as a great, independent maritime trading nation"".

"Sturgeon defends Scotland-Manchester travel banScotland's first minister says she is ""confused"" by the criticism from Greater Manchester's mayor.ScotlandComments","This video can not be played ""If Andy Burnham wants a grown-up conversation, he only has to pick up the phone"" â  Nicola Sturgeon Scotland's first minister has defended the ban on non-essential travel with Manchester and Salford after an angry reaction from the area's mayor. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has nowwritten to Nicola Sturgeon,externalasking her to explain the move. Ms Sturgeon earlier said the decision was a public health measure, based on Covid levels in the area. Opposition politicians in Scotland said there had been a lack of consistency and a lack of consultation. However, Ms Sturgeon - who received her second vaccination in Glasgow on Monday - said she had a ""duty"" to keep Scotland as safe as possible. Mayor's anger at Manchester-Scotland travel ban Salford woman cancels Scotland honeymoon over travel ban What are the rules in your area? ""I have always got on well with Andy Burnham. If he wants a grown-up conversation he only has to pick up the phone,"" she said. ""But if, as I suspect might be the case, this is more about getting into a spat with me as part of a some positioning in a Labour leadership contest of the future, then I am not interested."" The first minister said she was ""confused"" by Mr Burnham's position. Covid rates in Manchester and Salford are among the highest in England ""Back in May we imposed travel restrictions on Bolton for exactly the same reasons we are now doing it on Manchester,"" she said. ""Andy Burnham is mayor of Bolton as well and he did not raise any of these issues then."" Ms Sturgeon said the restrictions would not be enforced differently to previous travel rules, and would be in place ""no longer than is absolutely necessary"". Mr Burnham acknowledged the first minister has faced ""difficult decisions"" during the pandemic but condemned the fact he was given no advance warning of the travel ban. He told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime: ""The UK government has called me when they were making changes affecting Greater Manchester.  I think the first minister should have extended us the same courtesy. ""If Westminster had, without notice, imposed a travel ban on Scotland on Friday, I feel pretty certain in saying the first minister would have expressed publicly her concern in exactly the same way I am doing that on behalf of the people of Greater Manchester."" Mr Burnham's letter to the first minister also asks why residents of Bolton are still subject to a travel ban while residents of Dundee, which he said has a higher case rate, are not. In Dundee the latest seven-day positive test rate per 100,000 population, up to 18 June, was 303.4. On Monday the seven-day figure in Bolton was 257. Mr Burnham also called on the Scottish government to compensate those who are now out of pocket and described the suggestion he was playing politics as ""fairly insulting"". Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has accused the Scottish government of ""hypocrisy"" Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Conservatives' spokesman for Covid recovery, said Mr Burnham was ""absolutely correct"" to express concern about the ban and the ""lack of consultation"". Mr Fraser toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethere was a ""lack of consistency"" in the Scottish government's approach. ""We know that the city of Dundee, for example, has case rates very similar to Manchester,"" he said. ""So why is there a travel ban being introduced for Scots going to Manchester, but there are no similar restrictions put in, in relation to Dundee?"" Dundee, which has the highest Covid case rate in Scotland, recorded 487 new cases in the week up to 18 June,according to UK government figures,external. Manchester recorded 1,928 cases and Salford 880 in the same period, but the rate per 100,000 people for all three areas is very similar. Jackie Baillie, deputy leader of Scottish Labour, said people would find the ban hard to understand. ""This has just been put in place without any consultation, without any dialogue and without any concern for either the people of Manchester or the tourism industry in Scotland,"" she said. ""Are we consistent in saying it's OK to travel in and out of areas of Scotland where the rates of infection are higher than they are in Manchester? That's the inconsistency that people just do not understand."" Are you affected by the ban on non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford? Have you had to change your plans?

Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the provisions that had been put in place were ""consistent"" with approaches taken in the area previously. Non-essential travel was banned between Scotland and Bolton in Greater Manchester, and Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, on 24 May. Mr Burnham said he would be writing to the Scottish government to ask how it would compensate businesses in Manchester who could lose bookings. But Mr Swinney said that would not be ""appropriate"". Asked whether similar travel restrictions should be introduced in Dundee, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government would need to look ""very carefully"" at ""localised situations"". Renu Bhardwaj has had to cancel her plans to travel from Glasgow to Manchester this weekend Mother-of-two Renu Bhardwaj had been due to travel to Manchester this weekend. ""The children are finishing school in four days and we had plans to go down and meet my family again and enjoy the summer holidays, or make the most of what we can,"" she said. The lifestyle blogger, who moved to Glasgow 13 years ago, used to make regular trips south to visit her relatives before the pandemic. She said she could understand the reasoning behind the decision, but that the timing, so close to the school holidays, was ""the worst for everybody"". Police Scotland said its approach throughout the pandemic remains the same. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs said: ""Officers will engage with the public, explain the legislation and encourage compliance, but will not hesitate to use enforcement as a last resort. ""The Chief Constable has said publicly on numerous occasions that we will not be routinely stopping vehicles or setting up road blocks, and that will not change."" On Monday, the UK recorded another 10,633 Covid cases - including 8,766 cases for England and 1,250 for Scotland. Both nations have seen rising seven-day infection rates, with the Scottish rate at 131.7 per 100,000 people and 92.7 per 100,000 people in England on 18 June. Scotland, which has one of the highest infection rates in Europe but also one of the highest vaccination rates, haspaused the lifting of Covid restrictions this summerbecause of rising cases.

"19 July 'looking good' for end of lockdown, says PM","Plans to ease Covid restrictions in England on 19 July are ""looking good"", the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said that was based on the efficacy of vaccines against identified variants. But he warned there could be a ""rough winter for all sorts of reasons"", including a resurgence of flu. It comes as the health secretary said he hoped to exempt fully vaccinated people from the requirement to isolate for 10 days when contact-traced. Asked during on a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire whether he could rule out further lockdowns this winter, Mr Johnson said: ""You can never exclude that there will be some new disease, some new horror that we simply haven't budgeted for, or accounted for. ""But looking at where we are, looking at the efficacy of the vaccines against all variants that we can currently see - so Alpha, Delta, the lot of them, Kappa - I think it's looking good for 19 July to be that terminus point."" His comments came after Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the government's advisory committee on vaccination, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that flu ""could be potentially a bigger problem this winter than Covid."" Flu immunity is likely to have dropped in the population as a result of low prevalence because of lockdowns, and it could come ""back to bite us"", he said. Mr Johnson said the risk of a ""rough winter"" was ""all the more reason to reduce the number of Covid cases now, give the NHS the breathing space it needs to get on with dealing with all those other pressures, and we are certainly going to be putting in the investment to make sure that they can"". How does the test-and-trace system work? Who has to self-isolate? What are the rules for travelling abroad? Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that he hoped to bring in a new approach to self-isolation to reflect the changing situation as the country opens up more and more. For the past two months, a pilot study has been under way in which 40,000 people who have been named as contacts of someone who has tested positive for Covid have been allowed to take daily Covid tests and continue with their lives, rather than having to self-isolate. ""We're piloting that now to check that will be effective and it is something that we're working on,"" the health secretary said. ""We're not ready to be able to take that step yet.

This video can not be played Five ways to self-isolate successfully to prevent the spread of coronavirus Currently, anybody who has been told by NHS Test and Trace that they are a contact of somebody who has tested positive for the virus must self-isolate for 10 days. This means not leaving home at all - even to buy food or medicines, or for exercise. The rule applies to people regardless of whether they have received a coronavirus jab. So far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two doses of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose. More than one million jabs were booked on Friday and Saturday in England, after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. There have been a further five deaths within 28 days of testing positive in the UK, according to the government's daily figures - and 10,633 new cases. The prime minister said the government was also looking at using daily tests for travellers. Asked whether ministers were considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UK if they took daily tests, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""When it comes to travel, we'll certainly be looking at that. ""But I want to stress this is going to be, whatever happens, a difficult year for travel - there will be hassle, there will be delays, I'm afraid, because the priority has got to be to keep the country safe and to stop the virus coming back in."" Currently, people arriving in the UK from a country on the government's amber list must quarantine for 10 days - regardless of whether they have had a coronavirus jab. However, in England an individual may be able to end their quarantine period early if they pay for an additional test under the test-to-release scheme. The prime minister has been visiting a laboratory in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""cautiously hopeful"" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. He said the government had always committed to regularly review their international travel plan, with the next ""checkpoint"" taking place on 28 June. He said that the checkpoints would look at whether the ""science would support"" relaxations including people who have received two vaccine doses no longer have to quarantine after returning from certain countries. The original date the government had planned to remove all legal limits on social contact in England was 21 June - but this has been delayed to allow more people to be vaccinated. However, some restrictions have still been eased. The number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue. And in Wales,rules are also being lifted slightly,including capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size.

LiveLive19 July 'looking good' for lockdown end - JohnsonLess than a minute ago,"19 July still 'looking good' to be terminus point for restrictions in England, Boris Johnson says But he says Delta variant cases are still rising and the priority is to keep more variants out of the UK Several people have been arrested at an anti-lockdown protest in Westminster - on what would have been the end date of England's restrictions Flu could be a bigger problem than Covid this winter, expert warns, with immunity levels 'likely to have dropped' Venues for the delayed Tokyo Olympics will be allowed up to 10,000 spectators - half their normal capacity A ban on non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford has come into force Edited by Martha Buckley Thank you for following our coronavirus updates, we are closing the page shortly. Today's writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jennifer Meierhans, Joseph Lee and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Martha Buckley and Rob Corp. From all of us, have a good evening. This video can not be played We'll leave you with this group of teachers dancing to a song from the hit musical The Greatest Showman, which has been watched more than 900,000 times in three weeks. Staff and pupils at Ormiston Sudbury Academy in Suffolk performed From Now On as a way to say goodbye to their year 11 students. The school has been using its TikTok channel as a way of connecting with students and the wider community, especially during the pandemic. Head of performing arts Leo Cox said: ""Weâve had so much fun as an academy experimenting with ourTikTok account,external, and itâs been a great way for students to get creative and work together as a team to make some brilliant videos."" We are going to be winding down our live page soon so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus news: The transport secretary says he is âcautiously hopefulâ about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. Grant Shapps says the government had always committed to regularly reviewing its international travel plan with the first âcheckpointâ taking place on 28 June. He says the checkpoints will look at whether the âscience would supportâ relaxations - including letting people who have received two vaccine doses return from certain countries without quarantining. âWeâll have to see what science leads us to be able to do and when, but that's why we've got these checkpoints in place,"" he says. On domestic travel, Shapps said the governmentâs new flexible season tickets for rail travel would guarantee a âa 20% saving for peopleâ. He says the tickets ârecognise the world has changedâ and that âpeople are not necessarily travelling to the office every single dayâ. We've got more from the protests in Westminster on what would have been the end date of all coronavirus restrictions in England. The Metropolitan Policetweeted,external: ""We've made 14 arrests while policing a demonstration in Westminster today.

Three police officers were injured, thankfully their injuries are not serious."" A demonstration in Parliament Square included people holding signs against vaccines and lockdowns. This video can not be played ""Long Covid"" is affecting a significant number of people in the UK, Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist, has said. She toldBBC World Newslong Covid was not just limited to patients who were very ill or hospitalised. About 13% of people with just mild symptoms went on to develop long Covid with symptoms for 12 weeks or more. ""It is not something that lasts for a short period of time. Among the million people in the UK who we think are impacted now, about 400,000 are people who have had symptoms for one year or more. And that is how debilitating it can be,"" she said. Dr Gurdasani, who has been researching long Covid at Queen Mary University of London, said younger people and women were more at risk, but anyone could get long Covid. Some women have reportedthe pattern of their periods changing as a result of getting the jab. But changes in patterns could have occurred ""by chance"", leading gynaecologists say. It comes after data suggested almost 4,000 women had reported changes
after they received a vaccine,according to Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) figures quoted by the Sunday Times,external. ""We're aware some women have been reporting a
change to their period cycle or symptoms during the pandemic,"" Dr Sue Ward, vice-president for education at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), said. ""The degree to which changing hormone levels will affect someone is often
informed by her psychological well-being at that time. ""We know that life events can make PMS [pre-menstrual syndrome] symptoms feel worse, and something
as all-consuming and life-changing as a global pandemic could result in women
experiencing their periods differently."" The RCOG says anecdotally some women report heavier periods after receiving the vaccine and that it would support more data collection in the area. They also recommend contacting a doctor if women notice any unusual bleeding.  A total of74,577,678coronavirus vaccines have been given in the UK,according to government's daily figures.,external That's43,127,763first doses and31,449,915second doses total. Yesterday163,750first jabs and109,408second jabs were given. It is the lowest number of second jabs since 5 April but the number of people seen by vaccine clinics on a Sunday tends to be lower. A County Durham technology firm which is developing a machine to detect coronavirus in the air is testing it at a Darlington primary school. Sedegfield-based Kromek says its system is designed to be used in areas of high footfall, such as airports, cinemas and schools. Machines have already been installed at Newcastle and Teesside airports. Kromek chief executive officer, Arnab Basu said: ""We sample a lot of air and filter out all the particles we're not interested in, like skin particles and pollen, and we look at the virus and use a very accurate analytical technique inside the machine which tells if Covid is there."" The head of the World Trade Organization says Africa is working with the European Union and other partners to create regional hubs to produce vaccines. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said facilities would be established in South Africa, Senegal and Rwanda. Nigeria is also being considered. She said the over-centralisation of vaccine production was incompatible with equitable access, especially during a health crisis. Africa is facing a major shortage of coronavirus jabs. The United Nations has urged countries that can to donate surplus supplies to the continent. Here are some of the scenes from a protest in Parliament Square in London on what would have been so-called Freedom Day - when all coronavirus restrictions in England were due to end. Demonstrators are holding signs against coronavirus measures such as lockdowns, vaccines and vaccine passports. The photographs show a large police presence and a number of people being detained. We will bring you more as we have it. Rail passengers have expressed their anger after discovering that new flexible season tickets will not save them money on their journeys. The tickets, which went on sale earlier,allow travel in England on any eight days in a 28-day period. The Department for Transport says part-time commuters on some routes will save hundreds of pounds a year through the scheme. But larger savings can be made if some journeys are made at off-peak times, or using railcards. Trudie Thompson, 59, from Dover, Kent, told the PA news agency she planned to return to the office two days a week from September, but that using weekly season tickets will be Â£190 cheaper per month than the new Flexi Season ticket. Graeme Douglas, who commutes from Faversham, Kent, into London, says: ""It won't save me any money. It's better to try and travel off-peak and use a Network Rail card where possible. There's zero real incentive here."" Does it add up? According to an online season ticket price calculator: A passenger commuting three days a week fromCambridge to LondonKing's Cross via any permitted route will payÂ£5,745.60if they use the new tickets. That is more expensive than an annual ticket atÂ£5,388, but cheaper than using weeklies,Â£6,999.01, or monthliesÂ£6,207.60. For a two-days-a-week commuter, the new flexible tickets are the cheapest option over a year. Commuters travelling three days per week fromYork to Leedswill payÂ£2,419.20using Flexi Season tickets, compared withÂ£2,516for an annual ticket. Monthly tickets would costÂ£2,899.20over a year. There have been a further five Covid-related deaths in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures.,external It brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test to 127,981. A total of 10,633 new cases were also reported. Eight people have been arrested in protests again coronavirus lockdowns and vaccines near the House of Commons on what would have been the end date of all restrictions in England. The Metropolitan Police tweeted,external: ""We are engaging with a crowd gathering on Bridge Street, Westminster, who are blocking traffic and being obstructive and hostile to officers.

Eight arrests have been made so far. We are working to keep traffic moving and minimise disruption to the local community."" The Metro is reporting,externaltennis balls were thrown towards Downing Street as protesters express their anger about so-calledFreedom Day being pushed back to 19 July. One protester held an umbrella painted with the words ""Don't take the vaccine"" and ""No more lockdowns"". Ellie Morgan's Covid jab appointment took just 20 minutes but getting there almost took her all day as she had to rely on public transport. The 26-year-old is in theunder-40 age range advised againsthaving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, so she had to get to her local mass vaccination centre wheresub-zero temperature freezers are storing the Pfizer doses. But she lives in Monmouth, south Wales, and with no car and her friends and family all at work she had to take one of only seven buses a day to Newport. She says: ""It was an hour there by bus but I also had to arrive two hours before my allotted time, as the next bus from Monmouth would've made me miss my appointment."" After leaving her house at about 10:00 BST to make the trip for her jab, she arrived home after 17:00, because the next bus back to Monmouth was a few hours after her vaccine. ""It was all fine, however it ended up being a whole day's activity and meant that any other plans were off the table. Also if I had missed that one bus, then there would have been no way for me to get there other than taxi, which I dread to think how much that would cost."" It comes as a GP says more should be done to help some young people in rural areas get to their vaccine appointment. Rachel Godiff has to cancel her honeymoon in Edinburgh after Scotland imposed travel restrictions In his criticism of Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's ban on travel to and from Manchester and Salford, Mayor Andy Burnham stressed the impact on individuals in the region. One of them is Rachel Godiff, from Salford, who had previously cancelled her honeymoon in Greece due to travel restrictions andnow has to cancel her alternative plans in Edinburgh. The bride-to-be, 31, tells BBC Radio Manchester: ""We are getting married in Salford on Saturday and we have nowhere to go. ""It's just one thing after another. It feels like nothing is going to plan. ""Everything we want to do is being changed. We were really excited about it and then suddenly find out we are not able to go."" She says it seems unfair, especially when she has had both vaccine doses and her partner has had his first. Here's a little more from Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan, who has pledged thatpeople aged 40 and over will get their second Covid jab within eight weeks of their first. She told Monday's Welsh government press conference: ""Between now and mid-July, we will be putting an extra half a million vaccines into the system, focusing on second doses and getting people fully protected."" A health official said there was good evidence that two doses was helping to reduce the risk of needing hospital treatment from the Delta variant. It comes as the number of Delta cases rises to 579, up from 490 last week. First Minister Mark Drakeford has previously warned that Wales was at the start of a third wave of coronavirus. People over 40 in England and Scotland have already been invited to get their second Covid jab within eight weeks. In Northern Ireland, the interval between doses has been reduced from 10 weeks to six weeks for appointments scheduled after 14 June 2021. Find out more about when you will get a vaccinehere. We reported earlier that Kendal Calling in Cumbria has becomethe latest casualty of a summer filled with cancelled music festivals. The festival - due to take place between 29 July and 2 August with headliners including Stereophonics, Supergrass, The Streets and Dizzee Rascal  - was called off due to a ""complete absence of any guidance"" from the government. However, some concerts, summer festivals and gigs are able to go ahead if they can ensure social distancing between groups, and limit attendance.  We've explained the rules for festivals as well as pubs and restaurantshere. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon ""confused"" by Andy Burnham Covid position Following criticism from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham about the decision to ban travel between the city and Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has defended her decision. She said if Burnham wants ""a grown-up conversation, he only has to pick up the phone"". But the decision was taken for serious public health reasons, Sturgeon said. Burnham had earlier said the decision was taken on Friday without any warning, and he has called for travellers forced to cancel plans and businesses losing out on custom to be compensated. Speaking after Sturgeon's comments, the Greater Manchester mayor said he found them ""insulting, not for me, but for people here who are directly affected by what she announced"". He said the decision has a real affect on people and businesses so it was wrong to suggest it was political posturing. Booster jabs could be given along with the usual autumn flu jabs Earlier we heard Health Secretary Matt Hancock saying he expecteda decision to be made about booster vaccines in the next few weeks, once the trial data is in. The lead investigator for the trials, Prof Saul Faust, has just been on BBC Radio 4's World at One with some more detail. He says they were operating on ""very tight timelines"" and the results would be available by the end of August. âThat is incredibly quick in terms of the fact we are still recruiting â the recruitment for this trial, giving people their third dose, is happening right now in June,â he says. But he says this timing for an autumn booster programme was not a concern for the UK's vaccine advisory committee, the Vaccine Task Force or the health secretary as it had all been planned for some time. Prof Faust says NHS planning for giving boosters alongside flu jabs and planning over vaccine supply had all been taking place at the same time.  Â© 2025 BBC.

How does the test-and-trace system work? Who has to self-isolate? What are the rules for travelling abroad? Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that he hoped to bring in a new approach to self-isolation to reflect the changing situation as the country opens up more and more. For the past two months, a pilot study has been under way in which 40,000 people who have been named as contacts of someone who has tested positive for Covid have been allowed to take daily Covid tests and continue with their lives, rather than having to self-isolate. ""We're piloting that now to check that will be effective and it is something that we're working on,"" the health secretary said. ""We're not ready to be able to take that step yet. But it's something that I want to see and we will introduce, subject to clinical advice, as soon as it's reasonable to do so."" The trial is not expected to be completed until later in the summer. This video can not be played Five ways to self-isolate successfully to prevent the spread of coronavirus Currently, anybody who has been told by NHS Test and Trace that they are a contact of somebody who has tested positive for the virus must self-isolate for 10 days. This means not leaving home at all - even to buy food or medicines, or for exercise. The rule applies to people regardless of whether they have received a coronavirus jab. So far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two doses of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose. More than one million jabs were booked on Friday and Saturday in England, after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. There have been a further five deaths within 28 days of testing positive in the UK, according to the government's daily figures - and 10,633 new cases. The prime minister said the government was also looking at using daily tests for travellers. Asked whether ministers were considering allowing double-vaccinated travellers to be exempt from quarantine on their return to the UK if they took daily tests, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""When it comes to travel, we'll certainly be looking at that. ""But I want to stress this is going to be, whatever happens, a difficult year for travel - there will be hassle, there will be delays, I'm afraid, because the priority has got to be to keep the country safe and to stop the virus coming back in."" Currently, people arriving in the UK from a country on the government's amber list must quarantine for 10 days - regardless of whether they have had a coronavirus jab. However, in England an individual may be able to end their quarantine period early if they pay for an additional test under the test-to-release scheme. The prime minister has been visiting a laboratory in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was ""cautiously hopeful"" about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. He said the government had always committed to regularly review their international travel plan, with the next ""checkpoint"" taking place on 28 June. He said that the checkpoints would look at whether the ""science would support"" relaxations including people who have received two vaccine doses no longer have to quarantine after returning from certain countries. The original date the government had planned to remove all legal limits on social contact in England was 21 June - but this has been delayed to allow more people to be vaccinated. However, some restrictions have still been eased. The number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue. And in Wales,rules are also being lifted slightly,including capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size. In Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictionshas been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotlandare expected to be extended until mid-July.

School inspections in Wales off until 2022,"School inspections were suspended in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic School inspections are to stay suspended until 2022, the Welsh government has announced. Schools will also not be subject to the traffic light system for rating schools for the next academic year, as part of moves to ease pressures on teachers. Both were suspended in 2020 because of the Covid pandemic. Teaching unions welcomed the decision, saying it would have been a mistake if inspections had resumed in September. The Conservatives said schools had to have ""some form of scrutiny"", while Plaid Cymru said more investment was needed to ensure children were not left behind. Education minister Jeremy Miles said schools wanted to help pupils progress ""but there are pressures that are affecting their ability to do this"". ""I have listened and am taking action to support them,"" he added. Measures requiring schools to report on metrics such as attainment and attendance are also being relaxed, with less data on school performance published. Call to delay school inspections until 2022 Wales eases music and comedy venue Covid rules There had been plans for inspections to resume this September, and there were calls for a delay so schools could focus on catch-up work. Pilot inspections will take place in the spring term, but otherwise inspections will not happen before Easter 2022. The Welsh government said Wales' inspection body Estyn will ""pilot a new approach to inspections with schools' agreement in the spring term"". Jeremy Miles was appointed education minister in the Welsh government cabinet reshuffle Laura Doel, of headteachers' union NAHT, welcomed the announcement. ""Schools in Wales were promised an inspection-free year to allow them to concentrate on new curriculum development,"" she said. ""For inspections to resume in September would have been a mistake and a distraction to the priority of Covid-19 recovery in schools."" The NEU teaching union said its members would be ""heartened"" by the decision - but also called for the new curriculum to be delayed to 2022. ""Although our members do welcome the new curriculum in principle, we need time to get this right,"" David Evans, the union's Wales secretary, said. Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said there still needed to be ""some form of scrutiny of attainment levels, just so we have a clearer picture as to how much the pandemic has impacted on learners, which is an important tool in forming future policy decisions"". ""Potentially there are going to be underperforming schools going under the radar due to the suspension of inspections,"" she said. ""I understand the need to help manage teachers' workload, but parents do need reassurances that schools are doing all they can to support pupils."" Plaid's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: ""The suspension of Estyn inspections and other measures announced is a welcome move but further details of the education minister's wider priorities need clarification. ""The Welsh government's spending on targeted support for pupils has been far lower than in other countries across the UK, and so more measures and more investment is needed to ensure a whole generation of children aren't left behind as a result of the pandemic,"" she said.

Booster jab plan to come in a few weeks - Hancock,"This video can not be played Covid booster jabs planned for autumn, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock Plans for a Covid booster jab programme in the autumn will be set out in the next few weeks, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary said ministers were waiting for results from trials of different combinations of vaccines. It comes after doctors and NHS trusts said planning for a booster rollout must start now as it will involve bigger challenges. They said many questions needed answering, including how long immunity from the original Covid jab lasts. The issue of whether children will be vaccinated also still remains, health leaders said. Will vaccines affect my fertility? And other questions How can I get my second jab sooner? The people feeling vaccine guilt ""We are currently trialling which combinations of jabs are the most effective,"" Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast. ""In the next few weeks, when we get the clinical data through on what's the most effective combinations to haveâ¦ then we'll set out all the details for the booster programme for the autumn."" Among the ongoing trials isthe UK's Cov-Boost trial,external, which is testing different combinations of third doses. A senior government source said the UK would also benefit from new vaccines from Novavax and Valneva, which are awaiting approval from the UK's medicines regulator. So far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two jabs of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose. People have been rushing to get their vaccines in recent days, with more than one million jabs booked on Friday and Saturday in England after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. Rosi Stamp, 25, was one of those who received their Pfizer jab at Tottenham Hotspur's stadium on Sunday Ministers have repeatedly said that vaccination is the way out of lockdown, and the delay to England's lockdown ending from 21 June until 19 July was partly to allow more people to get vaccinated. Some restrictions have been eased on Monday though, the original date for lockdown ending - and what some had dubbed Freedom Day. The number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue. And in Wales,rules are also being lifted slightly,including Covid capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size. In Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictionshas been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotlandare expected to be extended until mid-July. The average number of daily confirmed cases of coronavirus is now rising in the UK, with a further 9,284announced by the government on Sunday.,externalA further six deaths were announced. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? On Monday, Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, which represents NHS hospitals and trusts in England, and Royal College of GPs chairman Martin Marshall said the 19 July target to offer a first dose to all adults was ""not so much a finishing line as a staging post"". The government has previously promised there will be a booster programme for the Covid jab - but the health leaders said the prospect of a yearly Covid vaccine would bring ""arguably greater challenges"", and it was important to know: How long will protection from the original double doses last - and will boosters be needed? Will people get the same vaccine as the original one they got? How will tweaking the vaccines for new variants work? Will Covid vaccines be tweaked every year, like the flu vaccine, or will it be more frequently? Will children be vaccinated and if so, when, where and how, because of the need to get consent? This video can not be played Margaret Keenan, 91, talks to the BBC about becoming the first person in the world to get the Pfizer-BioNTech jab last December They also said combining the Covid and flu vaccine rollouts - for example a Covid jab in one arm and a flu jab in the other - needed to be explored, but that would make the rollout more complex. And they said there needed to be investment in proper vaccination venues rather than relying on sports stadiums or community facilities. ""Since flu jabs start in September we need ministers and the JCVI - the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - to really answer those questions as quickly as possible, so we're ready to administer the jabs we need to in the autumn,"" Mr Hopson told the BBC. Mr Hopson and Mr Marshall said there needed to be a sustainable approach to vaccination, which meant the NHS could carry on vaccinating while also doing its other work. ""We cannot just carry on as we are, with an emergency response largely delivered by an overstretched workforce,"" they said. They are asking questions rather than coming up with solutions but health leaders have identified a major challenge for the coming winter. Offering a first dose to all adults by 19 July is seen as just a first step in a long haul with Covid. Given that booster vaccines will be needed, GPs and NHS trusts want to know the logistics of what will be a complex process on top of the usual winter pressures and dealing with the backlog of non-urgent work. Doctors and their practice teams have gone the extra mile to help deliver the Covid vaccination programme but they want to ensure day-to-day patient care is not compromised. The flu season might seem some way off but the normal vaccination campaigns and rollout start in September each year. Hence the call for ministers to come with some answers and longer term plans soon. Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, which advises UK health departments on vaccination, said decisions on booster jabs would be ""based on the best available evidence"" but the committee was also conscious of the need for the programme to be planned by the NHS. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme data on how flu and Covid vaccines could react to each other if given together would be available ""very soon"". Prof Harnden added that flu could be ""potentially a bigger problem"" than Covid this winter because of the low prevalence in the last few years, particularly during lockdown, meaning the level of immunity in the population had dropped. On whether under-18s could be offered a Covid vaccine, he said ""we need to think very carefully what the benefits are to children themselves"", and the JCVI would be considering this in the next few weeks. The committee has not yet made a formal recommendation on the matter. The World Health Organizationhas previously urged rich countrieslike the UK to donate doses to poorer countries before organising booster jabs.

Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood,"The government has confirmed it has set aside Â£11.8bn to compensate victims of the infected blood scandal. More than 30,000 people in the UK were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s. A public inquiry described the scale of the scandal as ""horrifying"", and accused doctors, the government and NHS of repeatedly failing patients. Two main groups of NHS patients were affected by what has been called the biggest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Firstly, haemophiliacs - and those with similar disorders -who have a rare genetic condition which means their blood does not clot properly.,external People with haemophilia A have a shortage of a clotting agent called Factor VIII, while people with haemophilia B do not have enough Factor IX. In the 1970s, a new treatment using donated human blood plasma was developed to replace these clotting agents. But whole batches were contaminated with deadly viruses. After being given the infected treatments, about 1,250 people in the UK with bleeding disorders developed both HIV and hepatitis C,including 380 children. This video can not be played Colin Smith, who died aged seven, was one of 380 children now thought to have been infected with HIV through contaminated blood products. About two-thirds later died of Aids-related illnesses. Some unintentionally gave HIV to their partners. Another 2,400 to 5,000 people developed hepatitis C on its own, which can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is difficult to know the exact number of people infected with hepatitis C, partly because it can take decades for symptoms to appear. A second group of patients were given contaminated blood transfusions after childbirth, surgery or other medical treatment between 1970 and 1991. The inquiry estimates between 80 and 100 of these people were infected with HIV, and about 27,000 with hepatitis C. In total, it is thought about 2,900 people have died. The victims, families and what happened I lost mum, dad and sister to HIV in blood scandal The school where dozens died in NHS blood scandal Announcing its findings in May 2024,the inquiry said victims had been failed ""not once, but repeatedly"",and that the risk of viral infections in blood products had been known since 1948. Inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff said there had been a lack of openness from the authorities and elements of ""downright deception"", including the destruction of documents. He said half-truths were also told, so people did not know about the risk of their treatment, the availability of alternatives, or even whether they were infected. ""This disaster was not an accident,"" said Sir Brian. ""The infections happened because those in authority - doctors, the blood services and successive governments - did not put patient safety first."" The report said,external: too little was done to stop importing blood products from abroad, which used blood from high-risk donors such as prisoners and drug addicts in the UK, blood donations were accepted from high-risk groups such as prisoners until 1986 blood products were not heat-treated to eliminate HIV until the end of 1985, although the risks were known in 1982 there was too little testing to reduce the risk of hepatitis, from the 1970s onwards Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the Â£11.8bn total compensation figure during the Budget on 30 October. The government had previously said that thefirst compensation payments would be made to victimsbefore the end of 2024. Family members and loved ones of those infected will also be entitled to compensation from 2025. Payments will be exempt from tax, and will not affect benefits. The final amounts for individuals are being assessed against five criteria: harm caused, social impact from stigma and isolation, impact on autonomy and private life, care costs and financial loss. Outlining the compensation scheme after the inquiry reported in May 2024, the then-Conservative governmentsuggested how much people might receive,external: a person infected with HIV could expect to get compensation of between Â£2.2m and Â£2.6m those with a chronic hepatitis C infection, defined as lasting more than six months, could expect to receive between Â£665,000 and Â£810,000 the partner of someone infected with HIV who is still alive today could expect to receive about Â£110,000, while a child could get Â£55,000 Annual payments will be available for relatives who had been financially dependent on the loved one who died. In cases wherepeople who would be entitled to compensation have themselves died,the money will go to their estate. In late 2022, followingadvice from the inquiry,the Conservative government made interim payments of Â£100,000 each to about 4,000 surviving victims and bereaved partners. In June 2024, a second interim payment of Â£210,000 was paid to those infected. In October 2024 the government said more relatives of those who died could also apply for Â£100,000 interim payments if the money had not already been claimed. In the 1970s, the UK was struggling to meet the demand for blood-clotting treatments, so imported supplies from the US. But much of the blood was bought from high-risk donors such as prison inmates and drug-users. Factor VIII was made by pooling plasma from tens of thousands of donors. If just one was carrying a virus, the entire batch could be contaminated. UK blood donations were not routinely screened for hepatitis C until 1991, 18 months after the virus was first identified. Jackie Britton, from Portsmouth, was infected with hepatitis C through a transfusion after the birth of her daughter in 1983 By the mid-1970s, there were repeated warnings that imported US Factor VIII carried a greater risk of infection. However, attempts to make the UK more self-sufficient in blood products failed, so the NHS continued using foreign supplies. Campaigners say haemophiliacs could have been offered an alternative treatment called Cryoprecipitate. This was much harder to administer, but was made from the blood plasma of a single donor, lowering the infection risk. BBC News has also uncovered evidencechildren were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being placed on clinical trials of new treatments- often, without their family's consent. As late as November 1983, the government insisted there was no ""conclusive proof"" that HIV could be transmitted in blood, a linerobustly defended by former health minister Ken Clarkewhen he appeared before the inquiry. This video can not be played Carolyn Challis: ""I got through two life-threatening rounds of cancer only to be given another life-threatening illness"" Many other countries were affected, although some - including Finland - used older treatments until much later rather than switch to Factor VIII,which minimised HIV infections.,external Delivering the findings of the inquiry, Sir Brian criticised UK government claims in the 1990s that screening for hepatitis C began as soon as the technology was available. He said that 23 other countries - including Japan, Finland and Spain - introduced the screening before the UK. In the US, companies that supplied infected products have paid out millions in out-of-court settlements. Politicians and drug companies have been convicted of negligence in countries including France and Japan. In his evidence to the inquiry, former health secretary Andy Burnham suggested there maybe grounds for charges of corporate manslaughter,externalin the UK.

Today's writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jennifer Meierhans, Joseph Lee and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Martha Buckley and Rob Corp. From all of us, have a good evening. This video can not be played We'll leave you with this group of teachers dancing to a song from the hit musical The Greatest Showman, which has been watched more than 900,000 times in three weeks. Staff and pupils at Ormiston Sudbury Academy in Suffolk performed From Now On as a way to say goodbye to their year 11 students. The school has been using its TikTok channel as a way of connecting with students and the wider community, especially during the pandemic. Head of performing arts Leo Cox said: ""Weâve had so much fun as an academy experimenting with ourTikTok account,external, and itâs been a great way for students to get creative and work together as a team to make some brilliant videos."" We are going to be winding down our live page soon so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus news: The transport secretary says he is âcautiously hopefulâ about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. Grant Shapps says the government had always committed to regularly reviewing its international travel plan with the first âcheckpointâ taking place on 28 June. He says the checkpoints will look at whether the âscience would supportâ relaxations - including letting people who have received two vaccine doses return from certain countries without quarantining. âWeâll have to see what science leads us to be able to do and when, but that's why we've got these checkpoints in place,"" he says. On domestic travel, Shapps said the governmentâs new flexible season tickets for rail travel would guarantee a âa 20% saving for peopleâ. He says the tickets ârecognise the world has changedâ and that âpeople are not necessarily travelling to the office every single dayâ. We've got more from the protests in Westminster on what would have been the end date of all coronavirus restrictions in England. The Metropolitan Policetweeted,external: ""We've made 14 arrests while policing a demonstration in Westminster today.

Three police officers were injured, thankfully their injuries are not serious."" A demonstration in Parliament Square included people holding signs against vaccines and lockdowns. This video can not be played ""Long Covid"" is affecting a significant number of people in the UK, Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist, has said. She toldBBC World Newslong Covid was not just limited to patients who were very ill or hospitalised. About 13% of people with just mild symptoms went on to develop long Covid with symptoms for 12 weeks or more. ""It is not something that lasts for a short period of time. Among the million people in the UK who we think are impacted now, about 400,000 are people who have had symptoms for one year or more. And that is how debilitating it can be,"" she said. Dr Gurdasani, who has been researching long Covid at Queen Mary University of London, said younger people and women were more at risk, but anyone could get long Covid. Some women have reportedthe pattern of their periods changing as a result of getting the jab. But changes in patterns could have occurred ""by chance"", leading gynaecologists say. It comes after data suggested almost 4,000 women had reported changes
after they received a vaccine,according to Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) figures quoted by the Sunday Times,external. ""We're aware some women have been reporting a
change to their period cycle or symptoms during the pandemic,"" Dr Sue Ward, vice-president for education at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), said. ""The degree to which changing hormone levels will affect someone is often
informed by her psychological well-being at that time. ""We know that life events can make PMS [pre-menstrual syndrome] symptoms feel worse, and something
as all-consuming and life-changing as a global pandemic could result in women
experiencing their periods differently."" The RCOG says anecdotally some women report heavier periods after receiving the vaccine and that it would support more data collection in the area. They also recommend contacting a doctor if women notice any unusual bleeding.  A total of74,577,678coronavirus vaccines have been given in the UK,according to government's daily figures.,external That's43,127,763first doses and31,449,915second doses total. Yesterday163,750first jabs and109,408second jabs were given. It is the lowest number of second jabs since 5 April but the number of people seen by vaccine clinics on a Sunday tends to be lower. A County Durham technology firm which is developing a machine to detect coronavirus in the air is testing it at a Darlington primary school. Sedegfield-based Kromek says its system is designed to be used in areas of high footfall, such as airports, cinemas and schools. Machines have already been installed at Newcastle and Teesside airports. Kromek chief executive officer, Arnab Basu said: ""We sample a lot of air and filter out all the particles we're not interested in, like skin particles and pollen, and we look at the virus and use a very accurate analytical technique inside the machine which tells if Covid is there."" The head of the World Trade Organization says Africa is working with the European Union and other partners to create regional hubs to produce vaccines. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said facilities would be established in South Africa, Senegal and Rwanda. Nigeria is also being considered. She said the over-centralisation of vaccine production was incompatible with equitable access, especially during a health crisis. Africa is facing a major shortage of coronavirus jabs. The United Nations has urged countries that can to donate surplus supplies to the continent. Here are some of the scenes from a protest in Parliament Square in London on what would have been so-called Freedom Day - when all coronavirus restrictions in England were due to end. Demonstrators are holding signs against coronavirus measures such as lockdowns, vaccines and vaccine passports. The photographs show a large police presence and a number of people being detained. We will bring you more as we have it. Rail passengers have expressed their anger after discovering that new flexible season tickets will not save them money on their journeys. The tickets, which went on sale earlier,allow travel in England on any eight days in a 28-day period. The Department for Transport says part-time commuters on some routes will save hundreds of pounds a year through the scheme. But larger savings can be made if some journeys are made at off-peak times, or using railcards. Trudie Thompson, 59, from Dover, Kent, told the PA news agency she planned to return to the office two days a week from September, but that using weekly season tickets will be Â£190 cheaper per month than the new Flexi Season ticket. Graeme Douglas, who commutes from Faversham, Kent, into London, says: ""It won't save me any money. It's better to try and travel off-peak and use a Network Rail card where possible. There's zero real incentive here."" Does it add up? According to an online season ticket price calculator: A passenger commuting three days a week fromCambridge to LondonKing's Cross via any permitted route will payÂ£5,745.60if they use the new tickets. That is more expensive than an annual ticket atÂ£5,388, but cheaper than using weeklies,Â£6,999.01, or monthliesÂ£6,207.60. For a two-days-a-week commuter, the new flexible tickets are the cheapest option over a year. Commuters travelling three days per week fromYork to Leedswill payÂ£2,419.20using Flexi Season tickets, compared withÂ£2,516for an annual ticket. Monthly tickets would costÂ£2,899.20over a year. There have been a further five Covid-related deaths in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures.,external It brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test to 127,981. A total of 10,633 new cases were also reported. Eight people have been arrested in protests again coronavirus lockdowns and vaccines near the House of Commons on what would have been the end date of all restrictions in England. The Metropolitan Police tweeted,external: ""We are engaging with a crowd gathering on Bridge Street, Westminster, who are blocking traffic and being obstructive and hostile to officers.

Eight arrests have been made so far. We are working to keep traffic moving and minimise disruption to the local community."" The Metro is reporting,externaltennis balls were thrown towards Downing Street as protesters express their anger about so-calledFreedom Day being pushed back to 19 July. One protester held an umbrella painted with the words ""Don't take the vaccine"" and ""No more lockdowns"". Ellie Morgan's Covid jab appointment took just 20 minutes but getting there almost took her all day as she had to rely on public transport. The 26-year-old is in theunder-40 age range advised againsthaving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, so she had to get to her local mass vaccination centre wheresub-zero temperature freezers are storing the Pfizer doses. But she lives in Monmouth, south Wales, and with no car and her friends and family all at work she had to take one of only seven buses a day to Newport. She says: ""It was an hour there by bus but I also had to arrive two hours before my allotted time, as the next bus from Monmouth would've made me miss my appointment."" After leaving her house at about 10:00 BST to make the trip for her jab, she arrived home after 17:00, because the next bus back to Monmouth was a few hours after her vaccine. ""It was all fine, however it ended up being a whole day's activity and meant that any other plans were off the table. Also if I had missed that one bus, then there would have been no way for me to get there other than taxi, which I dread to think how much that would cost."" It comes as a GP says more should be done to help some young people in rural areas get to their vaccine appointment. Rachel Godiff has to cancel her honeymoon in Edinburgh after Scotland imposed travel restrictions In his criticism of Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's ban on travel to and from Manchester and Salford, Mayor Andy Burnham stressed the impact on individuals in the region. One of them is Rachel Godiff, from Salford, who had previously cancelled her honeymoon in Greece due to travel restrictions andnow has to cancel her alternative plans in Edinburgh. The bride-to-be, 31, tells BBC Radio Manchester: ""We are getting married in Salford on Saturday and we have nowhere to go. ""It's just one thing after another. It feels like nothing is going to plan. ""Everything we want to do is being changed. We were really excited about it and then suddenly find out we are not able to go."" She says it seems unfair, especially when she has had both vaccine doses and her partner has had his first. Here's a little more from Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan, who has pledged thatpeople aged 40 and over will get their second Covid jab within eight weeks of their first. She told Monday's Welsh government press conference: ""Between now and mid-July, we will be putting an extra half a million vaccines into the system, focusing on second doses and getting people fully protected."" A health official said there was good evidence that two doses was helping to reduce the risk of needing hospital treatment from the Delta variant. It comes as the number of Delta cases rises to 579, up from 490 last week. First Minister Mark Drakeford has previously warned that Wales was at the start of a third wave of coronavirus. People over 40 in England and Scotland have already been invited to get their second Covid jab within eight weeks. In Northern Ireland, the interval between doses has been reduced from 10 weeks to six weeks for appointments scheduled after 14 June 2021. Find out more about when you will get a vaccinehere. We reported earlier that Kendal Calling in Cumbria has becomethe latest casualty of a summer filled with cancelled music festivals. The festival - due to take place between 29 July and 2 August with headliners including Stereophonics, Supergrass, The Streets and Dizzee Rascal  - was called off due to a ""complete absence of any guidance"" from the government. However, some concerts, summer festivals and gigs are able to go ahead if they can ensure social distancing between groups, and limit attendance.  We've explained the rules for festivals as well as pubs and restaurantshere. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon ""confused"" by Andy Burnham Covid position Following criticism from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham about the decision to ban travel between the city and Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has defended her decision. She said if Burnham wants ""a grown-up conversation, he only has to pick up the phone"". But the decision was taken for serious public health reasons, Sturgeon said. Burnham had earlier said the decision was taken on Friday without any warning, and he has called for travellers forced to cancel plans and businesses losing out on custom to be compensated. Speaking after Sturgeon's comments, the Greater Manchester mayor said he found them ""insulting, not for me, but for people here who are directly affected by what she announced"". He said the decision has a real affect on people and businesses so it was wrong to suggest it was political posturing. Booster jabs could be given along with the usual autumn flu jabs Earlier we heard Health Secretary Matt Hancock saying he expecteda decision to be made about booster vaccines in the next few weeks, once the trial data is in. The lead investigator for the trials, Prof Saul Faust, has just been on BBC Radio 4's World at One with some more detail. He says they were operating on ""very tight timelines"" and the results would be available by the end of August. âThat is incredibly quick in terms of the fact we are still recruiting â the recruitment for this trial, giving people their third dose, is happening right now in June,â he says. But he says this timing for an autumn booster programme was not a concern for the UK's vaccine advisory committee, the Vaccine Task Force or the health secretary as it had all been planned for some time. Prof Faust says NHS planning for giving boosters alongside flu jabs and planning over vaccine supply had all been taking place at the same time.  Â© 2025 BBC.

The school where dozens died in NHS blood scandalEx-pupils caught up in the infected blood scandal decades ago will give evidence at an inquiry.UK,"Ade Goodyear was among the pupils at Treloar's College treated with contaminated blood A public inquiry has begun hearing from former students after more than 120 pupils at a school for disabled children were caught up in what has been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. From 1974 to 1987, those children were offered treatment for haemophilia at Treloar's College. At least 72 died after being given a drug contaminated with HIV and viral hepatitis. ""We've lost so many friends from Treloar's and it's absolutely heartbreaking,"" Richard Warwick, a pupil at the Hampshire school in the late 1970s who was later diagnosed with HIV, told the BBC ahead of the hearing. The inquiry into the use of infected blood began taking evidence from people connected to the school on Monday. Former headmaster, Alec Macpherson, is one of those due to answer questions. ""It caused those boys a lot of anxiety and a lot of upset,"" he told the BBC. ""It put a rage inside them - why me, why has this happened to me, why have I got this dreadful disease?"" Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood The secret in my blood Liz Hooper: The woman who lost two husbands to the scandal Lord Mayor's Treloar's College was a boarding school for physically disabled children with a specialist NHS haemophilia centre on site, run by a dedicated medical team. Treloar's College By the mid 1970s, a new treatment for haemophilia, known as factor VIII/IX, became available for the first time. It meant those with a serious form of the blood disorder could live a normal life without the risk of a bleed. The NHS was not self-sufficient in the blood plasma used to make the drug so it was imported from overseas, most notably the US. Batches were widely contaminated with hepatitis A, B, C and later HIV, infecting thousands of haemophiliacs across the UK. Ade Goodyear joined Treloar's in 1980 at the age of 10. He described life as ""wonderful"" with supportive teachers, nurses and good friends. Like dozens of other boys at the school, he was given factor VIII to help control his bleeding. Ade Goodyear received treatment for haemophilia, along with his two older brothers ""With one of my very first shots, I got hepatitis and was placed in isolation for two weeks,"" he said. In 1985 he was taken into a small office with a group of boys to be told he had tested positive for HIV - then a newly discovered virus with no known treatment and a short life expectancy. ""The doctor was upset and pointed at us and said, you have it, and you haven't. And I was back in science by 1.50pm. I didn't even get the afternoon off,"" he said. ""A friend of mine picked up a pot plant and threw it against the wall of the haemophilia centre. It was a beautiful summer's day and I remember thinking, how many more sunrises like this am I going to see?"" Ade's two older brothers died after treatment with factor VIII - Jason from Aids in 1997 and Gary from health problems linked to hepatitis C in 2015. For pupils like Ade and Richard it meant living with the stigma of what was then a little-known disease. Students were followed by newspaper reporters outside the school gates and shouted questions about their HIV status. Just 32 of the 122 haemophiliacs who attended the school from 1974 to 1987 are still alive today. Most died after contracting HIV or viral hepatitis. It's hoped the public inquiry will be able to answer questions about what happened at Treloar's and the NHS haemophiliac centre run from the site. Ex-pupils Stephen Nicholls and Richard Warwick wear ties with the colours they use to support those who died - red for HIV, yellow for hepatitis, black for death Families want to know why they were not told about the potential risks of Factor VIII earlier and why it took many years until the drug was heat treated to kill viruses and other contaminants. ""What happened at the school comes back to haunt us every day,"" said Stephen Nicholls, a former pupil who was infected with hepatitis C after his treatment. ""We will never forget the Treloar's story and those memories of what happened here."" It is a rare genetic condition in which the blood does not clot properly. It mostly affects men. People with the condition produce lower amounts of the essential blood-clotting protein known as factor VIII and IX. Former students are giving evidence this week, some anonymously, along with the parents of children who lost their lives. The haemophilia centre on the site was run by NHS doctors and nurses and not staff directly employed by the school, which still cares for physically disabled children today. ""Although no-one has at any point suggested that Treloar's was at fault, it is a tragic part of our past,"" the school said in a statement. ""It was, and still is, a very difficult time for our affected alumni, their families and staff who were here at the point. ""We are completely supportive of the campaign for truth, answers and justice by our former pupils."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Donaldson due to announce new DUP leadership bid,"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would leave Westminster and become NI's first minister, if he becomes DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has confirmed his candidacy for the leadership of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). In May, the Lagan Valley MPwas defeated by Edwin Poots, who is to resign following internal divisions. Sir Jeffrey has previously said he would leave Westminster and become NI's first minister if he became leader. He warned that Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive would be at risk if the UK government fails to take ""decisive action"" over the protocol. Nominations for the leadership will close at midday on Tuesday but Sir Jeffrey is likely to take the top job unopposed. ""Now, more than ever, we need to unite in the face of the threats posed to Northern Ireland by the protocol,"" he said in a statement. ""Make no mistake, this is the number one issue facing our country, our people and our place within the United Kingdom. ""If elected, I will ensure that the government doesn't just listen, but recognises the need to take decisive action to deal quickly with the protocol. ""A failure to act will undoubtedly have consequences for the stability of our political institutions and the prosperity of our economy."" Edwin Poots resigned as DUP leader last Thursday, after 21 days in the post The decision by Mr Poots to stand down followed a revolt over his decision to nominate Paul Givan as first minister. Section of DUP 'struggled' with Poots' leadership Mr Givan became first minister on Thursday, however, has since been told by DUP officers that he mustresign from the post when a new party leader takes over. As it stands, it very much feels like this is going to be a one-horse race. Come 12:00 BST on Tuesday, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is expected to be declared the leader-designate of the DUP. Then we're expecting a ratification process which we understand will happen at some stage next week. Sir Jeffrey, if he does indeed become the next DUP leader, has to find a pathway back to Stormont. He has made it clear he wants to lead the party here as first minister. To do that, he has to find a seat and get himself co-opted. The number one priority for Sir Jeffrey is to get back among the MLAs at Stormont. Sinn FÃ©in had refused to nominate a deputy first minister to the joint office unless there was a commitment to implement the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement, which contained provisions for the Irish language. The UK government said it would introduce legislation in October if the assembly had failed to do so. 'No Sinn FÃ©in shopping list' over top Stormont jobs Likely plotlines if Donaldson writes DUP script Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? Sir Jeffrey has previously said he will not nominate a first minister unless there is ""significant change in the plans to bring in Irish language laws"". He has also expressed opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit deal which keeps NI aligned to the EU single market, but has caused disruption in trade with Great Britain. This video can not be played 'Jeffrey Donaldson will have my full support' Earlier, outgoing First Minister Paul Givan said Sir Jeffrey would have his ""full support"" should he decide to run for leader of the DUP. ""Jeffrey is a formidable politician, one that has a lot to offer Northern Ireland,"" said Mr Givan. ""I have spoken to Jeffrey Donaldson over the weekend, I have encouraged him to put his name forward, if he does, he'll have my full support."" Mr Givan was speaking following his first official event in Belfast since becoming first minister last week. He described Sir Jeffrey as ""a close, personal friend"" and a ""constituency colleague"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson shares an office with both Mr Givan and outgoing DUP leader Edwin Poots. Sir Jeffrey, born in Kilkeel, County Down, first became politically active as a constituency agent for the South Down MP Enoch Powell in the mid-1980s, before working as a personal assistant to the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader James Molyneaux. After Lord Molyneaux retired as an MP in 1997, Mr Donaldson was voted as his successor as MP for Lagan Valley, retaining the seat through six subsequent elections. He is a member of the Orange Order and also served as a corporal in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during The Troubles. In 2003, following long-standing opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and the leadership of David Trimble, Mr Donaldson announced he would leave the UUP, later joining the DUP, along with Arlene Foster and Norah Beare. Jeffrey Donaldson was appointed to the UK Privy Council, a body which advises the monarchy, in 2007, and stood down as an MLA for Lagan Valley in 2010. He was awarded a knighthood in 2016 for political service. Sir Jeffrey was defeated by 19 votes to 17 in the DUP leadership election to succeed Arlene Foster in May 2021. On Monday, Stormont finance minister and Sinn FÃ©in MLA Conor Murphy accused the DUP of having ""no intention"" of delivering on commitments in NDNA. This agreement brokered the return of power-sharing after three years of deadlock. Mr Murphy told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that his party did not ""want to box anybody in"" but questioned the DUP's ""credibility"" if it could not deliver on the commitments. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also said the next leader of the DUP cannot be allowed to ""choreograph the collapse of the institutions at Stormont"". Paul Givan looks set to be the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland When Paul Givan resigns it will trigger a seven-day period for new nominations to the posts of first and deputy first minister, or the possibility of a fresh election. Mr Eastwood said the ""imminent resignation"" of the DUP's first minister showed that the party intended to ""manufacture another political crisis that will once again threaten our local institutions"". ""In a desperate attempt to stabilise their own party, they are recklessly prepared to destabilise devolution,"" he said. Potential new leaders must submit their nomination in writing, supported by a proposer and a seconder, to DUP chairman Lord Morrow by midday on Tuesday, with a result confirmed on Saturday. Only Stormont assembly members (MLAs) and members of parliament (MPs) are entitled to take part if there is a vote. In May's contest, Sir Jeffrey, who has been the MP for Lagan Valley since 1997, lost by 19 votes to 17 in the first DUP leadership election in its 50-year history. Among the first tasks for a new leader will be a decision over the ministerial team appointed by Edwin Poots. Paul Givan is likely to become the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland when he is removed, while a new leader could have other plans for the education, economy and agriculture portfolios.

We are going to be winding down our live page soon so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus news: The transport secretary says he is âcautiously hopefulâ about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. Grant Shapps says the government had always committed to regularly reviewing its international travel plan with the first âcheckpointâ taking place on 28 June. He says the checkpoints will look at whether the âscience would supportâ relaxations - including letting people who have received two vaccine doses return from certain countries without quarantining. âWeâll have to see what science leads us to be able to do and when, but that's why we've got these checkpoints in place,"" he says. On domestic travel, Shapps said the governmentâs new flexible season tickets for rail travel would guarantee a âa 20% saving for peopleâ. He says the tickets ârecognise the world has changedâ and that âpeople are not necessarily travelling to the office every single dayâ. We've got more from the protests in Westminster on what would have been the end date of all coronavirus restrictions in England. The Metropolitan Policetweeted,external: ""We've made 14 arrests while policing a demonstration in Westminster today.

Three police officers were injured, thankfully their injuries are not serious."" A demonstration in Parliament Square included people holding signs against vaccines and lockdowns. This video can not be played ""Long Covid"" is affecting a significant number of people in the UK, Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist, has said. She toldBBC World Newslong Covid was not just limited to patients who were very ill or hospitalised. About 13% of people with just mild symptoms went on to develop long Covid with symptoms for 12 weeks or more. ""It is not something that lasts for a short period of time. Among the million people in the UK who we think are impacted now, about 400,000 are people who have had symptoms for one year or more. And that is how debilitating it can be,"" she said. Dr Gurdasani, who has been researching long Covid at Queen Mary University of London, said younger people and women were more at risk, but anyone could get long Covid. Some women have reportedthe pattern of their periods changing as a result of getting the jab. But changes in patterns could have occurred ""by chance"", leading gynaecologists say. It comes after data suggested almost 4,000 women had reported changes
after they received a vaccine,according to Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) figures quoted by the Sunday Times,external. ""We're aware some women have been reporting a
change to their period cycle or symptoms during the pandemic,"" Dr Sue Ward, vice-president for education at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), said. ""The degree to which changing hormone levels will affect someone is often
informed by her psychological well-being at that time. ""We know that life events can make PMS [pre-menstrual syndrome] symptoms feel worse, and something
as all-consuming and life-changing as a global pandemic could result in women
experiencing their periods differently."" The RCOG says anecdotally some women report heavier periods after receiving the vaccine and that it would support more data collection in the area. They also recommend contacting a doctor if women notice any unusual bleeding.

A County Durham technology firm which is developing a machine to detect coronavirus in the air is testing it at a Darlington primary school. Sedegfield-based Kromek says its system is designed to be used in areas of high footfall, such as airports, cinemas and schools. Machines have already been installed at Newcastle and Teesside airports. Kromek chief executive officer, Arnab Basu said: ""We sample a lot of air and filter out all the particles we're not interested in, like skin particles and pollen, and we look at the virus and use a very accurate analytical technique inside the machine which tells if Covid is there."" The head of the World Trade Organization says Africa is working with the European Union and other partners to create regional hubs to produce vaccines. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said facilities would be established in South Africa, Senegal and Rwanda. Nigeria is also being considered. She said the over-centralisation of vaccine production was incompatible with equitable access, especially during a health crisis. Africa is facing a major shortage of coronavirus jabs.

We will bring you more as we have it. Rail passengers have expressed their anger after discovering that new flexible season tickets will not save them money on their journeys. The tickets, which went on sale earlier,allow travel in England on any eight days in a 28-day period. The Department for Transport says part-time commuters on some routes will save hundreds of pounds a year through the scheme. But larger savings can be made if some journeys are made at off-peak times, or using railcards. Trudie Thompson, 59, from Dover, Kent, told the PA news agency she planned to return to the office two days a week from September, but that using weekly season tickets will be Â£190 cheaper per month than the new Flexi Season ticket. Graeme Douglas, who commutes from Faversham, Kent, into London, says: ""It won't save me any money. It's better to try and travel off-peak and use a Network Rail card where possible. There's zero real incentive here."" Does it add up? According to an online season ticket price calculator: A passenger commuting three days a week fromCambridge to LondonKing's Cross via any permitted route will payÂ£5,745.60if they use the new tickets. That is more expensive than an annual ticket atÂ£5,388, but cheaper than using weeklies,Â£6,999.01, or monthliesÂ£6,207.60. For a two-days-a-week commuter, the new flexible tickets are the cheapest option over a year. Commuters travelling three days per week fromYork to Leedswill payÂ£2,419.20using Flexi Season tickets, compared withÂ£2,516for an annual ticket. Monthly tickets would costÂ£2,899.20over a year. There have been a further five Covid-related deaths in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures.,external It brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test to 127,981. A total of 10,633 new cases were also reported. Eight people have been arrested in protests again coronavirus lockdowns and vaccines near the House of Commons on what would have been the end date of all restrictions in England. The Metropolitan Police tweeted,external: ""We are engaging with a crowd gathering on Bridge Street, Westminster, who are blocking traffic and being obstructive and hostile to officers.

One protester held an umbrella painted with the words ""Don't take the vaccine"" and ""No more lockdowns"". Ellie Morgan's Covid jab appointment took just 20 minutes but getting there almost took her all day as she had to rely on public transport. The 26-year-old is in theunder-40 age range advised againsthaving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, so she had to get to her local mass vaccination centre wheresub-zero temperature freezers are storing the Pfizer doses. But she lives in Monmouth, south Wales, and with no car and her friends and family all at work she had to take one of only seven buses a day to Newport. She says: ""It was an hour there by bus but I also had to arrive two hours before my allotted time, as the next bus from Monmouth would've made me miss my appointment."" After leaving her house at about 10:00 BST to make the trip for her jab, she arrived home after 17:00, because the next bus back to Monmouth was a few hours after her vaccine. ""It was all fine, however it ended up being a whole day's activity and meant that any other plans were off the table. Also if I had missed that one bus, then there would have been no way for me to get there other than taxi, which I dread to think how much that would cost."" It comes as a GP says more should be done to help some young people in rural areas get to their vaccine appointment. Rachel Godiff has to cancel her honeymoon in Edinburgh after Scotland imposed travel restrictions In his criticism of Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's ban on travel to and from Manchester and Salford, Mayor Andy Burnham stressed the impact on individuals in the region. One of them is Rachel Godiff, from Salford, who had previously cancelled her honeymoon in Greece due to travel restrictions andnow has to cancel her alternative plans in Edinburgh. The bride-to-be, 31, tells BBC Radio Manchester: ""We are getting married in Salford on Saturday and we have nowhere to go. ""It's just one thing after another. It feels like nothing is going to plan. ""Everything we want to do is being changed. We were really excited about it and then suddenly find out we are not able to go."" She says it seems unfair, especially when she has had both vaccine doses and her partner has had his first. Here's a little more from Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan, who has pledged thatpeople aged 40 and over will get their second Covid jab within eight weeks of their first. She told Monday's Welsh government press conference: ""Between now and mid-July, we will be putting an extra half a million vaccines into the system, focusing on second doses and getting people fully protected."" A health official said there was good evidence that two doses was helping to reduce the risk of needing hospital treatment from the Delta variant. It comes as the number of Delta cases rises to 579, up from 490 last week. First Minister Mark Drakeford has previously warned that Wales was at the start of a third wave of coronavirus. People over 40 in England and Scotland have already been invited to get their second Covid jab within eight weeks. In Northern Ireland, the interval between doses has been reduced from 10 weeks to six weeks for appointments scheduled after 14 June 2021. Find out more about when you will get a vaccinehere. We reported earlier that Kendal Calling in Cumbria has becomethe latest casualty of a summer filled with cancelled music festivals. The festival - due to take place between 29 July and 2 August with headliners including Stereophonics, Supergrass, The Streets and Dizzee Rascal  - was called off due to a ""complete absence of any guidance"" from the government. However, some concerts, summer festivals and gigs are able to go ahead if they can ensure social distancing between groups, and limit attendance.  We've explained the rules for festivals as well as pubs and restaurantshere. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon ""confused"" by Andy Burnham Covid position Following criticism from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham about the decision to ban travel between the city and Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has defended her decision. She said if Burnham wants ""a grown-up conversation, he only has to pick up the phone"". But the decision was taken for serious public health reasons, Sturgeon said. Burnham had earlier said the decision was taken on Friday without any warning, and he has called for travellers forced to cancel plans and businesses losing out on custom to be compensated. Speaking after Sturgeon's comments, the Greater Manchester mayor said he found them ""insulting, not for me, but for people here who are directly affected by what she announced"". He said the decision has a real affect on people and businesses so it was wrong to suggest it was political posturing. Booster jabs could be given along with the usual autumn flu jabs Earlier we heard Health Secretary Matt Hancock saying he expecteda decision to be made about booster vaccines in the next few weeks, once the trial data is in. The lead investigator for the trials, Prof Saul Faust, has just been on BBC Radio 4's World at One with some more detail. He says they were operating on ""very tight timelines"" and the results would be available by the end of August. âThat is incredibly quick in terms of the fact we are still recruiting â the recruitment for this trial, giving people their third dose, is happening right now in June,â he says. But he says this timing for an autumn booster programme was not a concern for the UK's vaccine advisory committee, the Vaccine Task Force or the health secretary as it had all been planned for some time. Prof Faust says NHS planning for giving boosters alongside flu jabs and planning over vaccine supply had all been taking place at the same time.  Â© 2025 BBC.

The school where dozens died in NHS blood scandalEx-pupils caught up in the infected blood scandal decades ago will give evidence at an inquiry.,"Ade Goodyear was among the pupils at Treloar's College treated with contaminated blood A public inquiry has begun hearing from former students after more than 120 pupils at a school for disabled children were caught up in what has been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. From 1974 to 1987, those children were offered treatment for haemophilia at Treloar's College. At least 72 died after being given a drug contaminated with HIV and viral hepatitis. ""We've lost so many friends from Treloar's and it's absolutely heartbreaking,"" Richard Warwick, a pupil at the Hampshire school in the late 1970s who was later diagnosed with HIV, told the BBC ahead of the hearing. The inquiry into the use of infected blood began taking evidence from people connected to the school on Monday. Former headmaster, Alec Macpherson, is one of those due to answer questions. ""It caused those boys a lot of anxiety and a lot of upset,"" he told the BBC. ""It put a rage inside them - why me, why has this happened to me, why have I got this dreadful disease?"" Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood The secret in my blood Liz Hooper: The woman who lost two husbands to the scandal Lord Mayor's Treloar's College was a boarding school for physically disabled children with a specialist NHS haemophilia centre on site, run by a dedicated medical team. Treloar's College By the mid 1970s, a new treatment for haemophilia, known as factor VIII/IX, became available for the first time. It meant those with a serious form of the blood disorder could live a normal life without the risk of a bleed. The NHS was not self-sufficient in the blood plasma used to make the drug so it was imported from overseas, most notably the US. Batches were widely contaminated with hepatitis A, B, C and later HIV, infecting thousands of haemophiliacs across the UK. Ade Goodyear joined Treloar's in 1980 at the age of 10. He described life as ""wonderful"" with supportive teachers, nurses and good friends. Like dozens of other boys at the school, he was given factor VIII to help control his bleeding. Ade Goodyear received treatment for haemophilia, along with his two older brothers ""With one of my very first shots, I got hepatitis and was placed in isolation for two weeks,"" he said. In 1985 he was taken into a small office with a group of boys to be told he had tested positive for HIV - then a newly discovered virus with no known treatment and a short life expectancy. ""The doctor was upset and pointed at us and said, you have it, and you haven't. And I was back in science by 1.50pm. I didn't even get the afternoon off,"" he said. ""A friend of mine picked up a pot plant and threw it against the wall of the haemophilia centre. It was a beautiful summer's day and I remember thinking, how many more sunrises like this am I going to see?"" Ade's two older brothers died after treatment with factor VIII - Jason from Aids in 1997 and Gary from health problems linked to hepatitis C in 2015. For pupils like Ade and Richard it meant living with the stigma of what was then a little-known disease. Students were followed by newspaper reporters outside the school gates and shouted questions about their HIV status. Just 32 of the 122 haemophiliacs who attended the school from 1974 to 1987 are still alive today. Most died after contracting HIV or viral hepatitis. It's hoped the public inquiry will be able to answer questions about what happened at Treloar's and the NHS haemophiliac centre run from the site. Ex-pupils Stephen Nicholls and Richard Warwick wear ties with the colours they use to support those who died - red for HIV, yellow for hepatitis, black for death Families want to know why they were not told about the potential risks of Factor VIII earlier and why it took many years until the drug was heat treated to kill viruses and other contaminants. ""What happened at the school comes back to haunt us every day,"" said Stephen Nicholls, a former pupil who was infected with hepatitis C after his treatment. ""We will never forget the Treloar's story and those memories of what happened here."" It is a rare genetic condition in which the blood does not clot properly. It mostly affects men. People with the condition produce lower amounts of the essential blood-clotting protein known as factor VIII and IX. Former students are giving evidence this week, some anonymously, along with the parents of children who lost their lives. The haemophilia centre on the site was run by NHS doctors and nurses and not staff directly employed by the school, which still cares for physically disabled children today. ""Although no-one has at any point suggested that Treloar's was at fault, it is a tragic part of our past,"" the school said in a statement. ""It was, and still is, a very difficult time for our affected alumni, their families and staff who were here at the point. ""We are completely supportive of the campaign for truth, answers and justice by our former pupils."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

She says it seems unfair, especially when she has had both vaccine doses and her partner has had his first. Here's a little more from Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan, who has pledged thatpeople aged 40 and over will get their second Covid jab within eight weeks of their first. She told Monday's Welsh government press conference: ""Between now and mid-July, we will be putting an extra half a million vaccines into the system, focusing on second doses and getting people fully protected."" A health official said there was good evidence that two doses was helping to reduce the risk of needing hospital treatment from the Delta variant. It comes as the number of Delta cases rises to 579, up from 490 last week. First Minister Mark Drakeford has previously warned that Wales was at the start of a third wave of coronavirus. People over 40 in England and Scotland have already been invited to get their second Covid jab within eight weeks. In Northern Ireland, the interval between doses has been reduced from 10 weeks to six weeks for appointments scheduled after 14 June 2021. Find out more about when you will get a vaccinehere. We reported earlier that Kendal Calling in Cumbria has becomethe latest casualty of a summer filled with cancelled music festivals. The festival - due to take place between 29 July and 2 August with headliners including Stereophonics, Supergrass, The Streets and Dizzee Rascal  - was called off due to a ""complete absence of any guidance"" from the government. However, some concerts, summer festivals and gigs are able to go ahead if they can ensure social distancing between groups, and limit attendance.  We've explained the rules for festivals as well as pubs and restaurantshere. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon ""confused"" by Andy Burnham Covid position Following criticism from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham about the decision to ban travel between the city and Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has defended her decision. She said if Burnham wants ""a grown-up conversation, he only has to pick up the phone"". But the decision was taken for serious public health reasons, Sturgeon said. Burnham had earlier said the decision was taken on Friday without any warning, and he has called for travellers forced to cancel plans and businesses losing out on custom to be compensated. Speaking after Sturgeon's comments, the Greater Manchester mayor said he found them ""insulting, not for me, but for people here who are directly affected by what she announced"". He said the decision has a real affect on people and businesses so it was wrong to suggest it was political posturing. Booster jabs could be given along with the usual autumn flu jabs Earlier we heard Health Secretary Matt Hancock saying he expecteda decision to be made about booster vaccines in the next few weeks, once the trial data is in. The lead investigator for the trials, Prof Saul Faust, has just been on BBC Radio 4's World at One with some more detail. He says they were operating on ""very tight timelines"" and the results would be available by the end of August. âThat is incredibly quick in terms of the fact we are still recruiting â the recruitment for this trial, giving people their third dose, is happening right now in June,â he says. But he says this timing for an autumn booster programme was not a concern for the UK's vaccine advisory committee, the Vaccine Task Force or the health secretary as it had all been planned for some time. Prof Faust says NHS planning for giving boosters alongside flu jabs and planning over vaccine supply had all been taking place at the same time.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Donaldson due to announce new DUP leadership bidThe party's nomination process is set to open on Monday and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is the favourite.Northern Ireland,"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would leave Westminster and become NI's first minister, if he becomes DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has confirmed his candidacy for the leadership of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). In May, the Lagan Valley MPwas defeated by Edwin Poots, who is to resign following internal divisions. Sir Jeffrey has previously said he would leave Westminster and become NI's first minister if he became leader. He warned that Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive would be at risk if the UK government fails to take ""decisive action"" over the protocol. Nominations for the leadership will close at midday on Tuesday but Sir Jeffrey is likely to take the top job unopposed. ""Now, more than ever, we need to unite in the face of the threats posed to Northern Ireland by the protocol,"" he said in a statement. ""Make no mistake, this is the number one issue facing our country, our people and our place within the United Kingdom. ""If elected, I will ensure that the government doesn't just listen, but recognises the need to take decisive action to deal quickly with the protocol. ""A failure to act will undoubtedly have consequences for the stability of our political institutions and the prosperity of our economy."" Edwin Poots resigned as DUP leader last Thursday, after 21 days in the post The decision by Mr Poots to stand down followed a revolt over his decision to nominate Paul Givan as first minister. Section of DUP 'struggled' with Poots' leadership Mr Givan became first minister on Thursday, however, has since been told by DUP officers that he mustresign from the post when a new party leader takes over. As it stands, it very much feels like this is going to be a one-horse race. Come 12:00 BST on Tuesday, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is expected to be declared the leader-designate of the DUP. Then we're expecting a ratification process which we understand will happen at some stage next week. Sir Jeffrey, if he does indeed become the next DUP leader, has to find a pathway back to Stormont. He has made it clear he wants to lead the party here as first minister. To do that, he has to find a seat and get himself co-opted. The number one priority for Sir Jeffrey is to get back among the MLAs at Stormont. Sinn FÃ©in had refused to nominate a deputy first minister to the joint office unless there was a commitment to implement the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement, which contained provisions for the Irish language. The UK government said it would introduce legislation in October if the assembly had failed to do so. 'No Sinn FÃ©in shopping list' over top Stormont jobs Likely plotlines if Donaldson writes DUP script Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? Sir Jeffrey has previously said he will not nominate a first minister unless there is ""significant change in the plans to bring in Irish language laws"". He has also expressed opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit deal which keeps NI aligned to the EU single market, but has caused disruption in trade with Great Britain. This video can not be played 'Jeffrey Donaldson will have my full support' Earlier, outgoing First Minister Paul Givan said Sir Jeffrey would have his ""full support"" should he decide to run for leader of the DUP. ""Jeffrey is a formidable politician, one that has a lot to offer Northern Ireland,"" said Mr Givan. ""I have spoken to Jeffrey Donaldson over the weekend, I have encouraged him to put his name forward, if he does, he'll have my full support."" Mr Givan was speaking following his first official event in Belfast since becoming first minister last week. He described Sir Jeffrey as ""a close, personal friend"" and a ""constituency colleague"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson shares an office with both Mr Givan and outgoing DUP leader Edwin Poots. Sir Jeffrey, born in Kilkeel, County Down, first became politically active as a constituency agent for the South Down MP Enoch Powell in the mid-1980s, before working as a personal assistant to the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader James Molyneaux. After Lord Molyneaux retired as an MP in 1997, Mr Donaldson was voted as his successor as MP for Lagan Valley, retaining the seat through six subsequent elections. He is a member of the Orange Order and also served as a corporal in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during The Troubles. In 2003, following long-standing opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and the leadership of David Trimble, Mr Donaldson announced he would leave the UUP, later joining the DUP, along with Arlene Foster and Norah Beare. Jeffrey Donaldson was appointed to the UK Privy Council, a body which advises the monarchy, in 2007, and stood down as an MLA for Lagan Valley in 2010. He was awarded a knighthood in 2016 for political service. Sir Jeffrey was defeated by 19 votes to 17 in the DUP leadership election to succeed Arlene Foster in May 2021. On Monday, Stormont finance minister and Sinn FÃ©in MLA Conor Murphy accused the DUP of having ""no intention"" of delivering on commitments in NDNA. This agreement brokered the return of power-sharing after three years of deadlock. Mr Murphy told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that his party did not ""want to box anybody in"" but questioned the DUP's ""credibility"" if it could not deliver on the commitments. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also said the next leader of the DUP cannot be allowed to ""choreograph the collapse of the institutions at Stormont"". Paul Givan looks set to be the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland When Paul Givan resigns it will trigger a seven-day period for new nominations to the posts of first and deputy first minister, or the possibility of a fresh election. Mr Eastwood said the ""imminent resignation"" of the DUP's first minister showed that the party intended to ""manufacture another political crisis that will once again threaten our local institutions"". ""In a desperate attempt to stabilise their own party, they are recklessly prepared to destabilise devolution,"" he said. Potential new leaders must submit their nomination in writing, supported by a proposer and a seconder, to DUP chairman Lord Morrow by midday on Tuesday, with a result confirmed on Saturday. Only Stormont assembly members (MLAs) and members of parliament (MPs) are entitled to take part if there is a vote. In May's contest, Sir Jeffrey, who has been the MP for Lagan Valley since 1997, lost by 19 votes to 17 in the first DUP leadership election in its 50-year history. Among the first tasks for a new leader will be a decision over the ministerial team appointed by Edwin Poots. Paul Givan is likely to become the shortest-serving first minister of Northern Ireland when he is removed, while a new leader could have other plans for the education, economy and agriculture portfolios.

New season tickets on sale for part-time commuters,"New flexible tickets go on sale from Monday aimed at commuters in England who only travel to work two or three days a week. The new tickets can be used for eight days in any month-long period. TheNational Rail website,externalwill allow passengers to calculate savings and book the new tickets. It is part of the government'splanned shake-up of rail services, but is being introduced immediately to cater to the trend for more home-working. From 2023 a new state-owned body, Great British Railways (GBR), will set rail timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure. The flexible season tickets are being introduced separately, ahead of the structural changes, and can be used from 28 June. Seven ways the rail shake-up will affect you 'I pay more than Â£9,000 a year for my season ticket' Is it safe to use public transport? Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the new tickets would offer ""greater freedom and choice about how we travel, simpler ticketing and a fairer fare"". The government estimates commuters could save between Â£60 and Â£350 a year on selected journeys. However, Tony Miles, rail expert and contributor to Modern Railways magazine, said people needed to be cautious because the new system offers a finite number of journeys whereas a season ticket allows people to use the train as much as they want. ""These really aren't season tickets,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""This is a bulk purchase of tickets. ""A season ticket effectively gives you unlimited travel,"" he said. ""The big difference with this is you're buying a fixed number of journeys at a discount price but if you decide at a weekend to do some extra journeys that will start ticking off your credit."" Digital flexi-tickets can be used on any eight days in a 28-day period England without being required to select the days of travel in advance They can be bought on rail websites and apps, as well as at some ticket offices Tickets are paperless, so travellers will have to use a smartphone or smartcard An online calculator will help passengers identify the cheapest option Until the end of this year, passengers who book in advance will be able to change their bookings with no extra charge The tickets are for standard class travel only There was already reduced demand for traditional season tickets before the pandemic struck, but the enforced period of working from home has accelerated the trend. Dozens of employers have announced staff will be given the option to work from home at least part of the week after pandemic restrictions are removed. Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said the changes would help persuade people to choose rail travel again. ""Our research with passengers showed us there was strong demand for a new ticket that suited people who expected to commute less frequently in future,"" said Mr Smith. ""This is a positive step towards much-needed longer-term reform of how rail tickets are sold. We also welcome the waiving of admin fees for changing tickets, which will help rebuild passenger confidence."" However, Transport Focus said it was important that passengers used the calculator to check the costs, as the new flexible tickets would not be the best option for everyone. Mr Miles said commuters needed to do some ""real heavy thinking"" about whether the new system would offer them value for money. ""If you are definitely going to travel two days a week to work and no more, then these probably will be a good thing for you,"" he said. ""If you think you are going to travel three days a week, you'd be very careful, and if you think your work will summon you randomly to pop in for extra days during the month, you need to be really careful because you will be using up that credit."" The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) which represents train operators said the rail companies would like to go further in reforming the fare system, if given the go ahead. For example they would like to see more use of the tap-in, tap-out technology, used on the London Underground, which allows travellers to accumulate journeys and pay the price for a season ticket if they reach the threshold, without having to know their plans in advance and pre-purchase a season ticket. Although the new flexible season tickets apply to National Rail operations in England, with rail operations devolved in other nations, they are available on cross border commuter routes, for example Bristol to Cardiff, or Berwick to Edinburgh.

Manchester-Scotland travel ban comes into force,"This video can not be played ""If Andy Burnham wants a grown-up conversation, he only has to pick up the phone"" â  Nicola Sturgeon Scotland's first minister has defended the ban on non-essential travel with Manchester and Salford after an angry reaction from the area's mayor. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has nowwritten to Nicola Sturgeon,externalasking her to explain the move. Ms Sturgeon earlier said the decision was a public health measure, based on Covid levels in the area.

""But if, as I suspect might be the case, this is more about getting into a spat with me as part of a some positioning in a Labour leadership contest of the future, then I am not interested."" The first minister said she was ""confused"" by Mr Burnham's position. Covid rates in Manchester and Salford are among the highest in England ""Back in May we imposed travel restrictions on Bolton for exactly the same reasons we are now doing it on Manchester,"" she said. ""Andy Burnham is mayor of Bolton as well and he did not raise any of these issues then."" Ms Sturgeon said the restrictions would not be enforced differently to previous travel rules, and would be in place ""no longer than is absolutely necessary"". Mr Burnham acknowledged the first minister has faced ""difficult decisions"" during the pandemic but condemned the fact he was given no advance warning of the travel ban. He told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime: ""The UK government has called me when they were making changes affecting Greater Manchester.

""If Westminster had, without notice, imposed a travel ban on Scotland on Friday, I feel pretty certain in saying the first minister would have expressed publicly her concern in exactly the same way I am doing that on behalf of the people of Greater Manchester.""

Mr Fraser toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethere was a ""lack of consistency"" in the Scottish government's approach.

PM sets out plan to make UK 'science superpower',"Boris Johnson said he would provide direction on how research is harnessed for the ""public good"". The prime minister has set out plans to cement the UK's place as a ""science superpower"". Boris Johnson announced how increases in the research budget would be spent. And Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, will lead a new Office for Science and Technology Strategy. An expert on research policy said the move risked taking decision-making out of scientists' hands; Labour said government cuts had damaged research. The prime minister is said to want to build on the success of the UK's coronavirus vaccine programme and apply it to other areas. These include developing technology to reach net zero carbon emissions and curing cancer rather than simply treating it. ""There can't have been a time in modern memory where every family has owed so much to British scientists (in developing a vaccine),"" Mr Johnson said during a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire on Monday. Calling science ''the great liberator'', he added: ""I've long believed that we can invest more in science as a country. And we want to use that public investment to trigger waves of private investment."" This government plans to put its money where its mouth is as it talks about plans to reinforce the UK's position as a global science leader. It aims to increase research spending from nearly Â£15bn a year to Â£22bn by 2025. The stated aim is to use the extra money to tackle societal challenges, such as the impact of climate change, level up across the country and boost prosperity around the world. As ever though, with greater budgets, comes greater ministerial supervision - in the form of a new committee chaired by the prime minister. On the one hand, it puts science at the heart of government, but on the other there's concern that there will be more political control on research budgets that could mean money being diverted toward pet projects - rather than spent on what is independently judged by experts to be the best science - as is currently the case. The stated aim of the new Office for Science and Technology Strategy will be to push forward the government's research priorities. It will also identify resources needed to secure the UK's science capability. Sir Patrick will take up the position of the new national technology adviser, alongside his other roles. These will include chairing a new National Science and Technology Council to help harness research for the ""public good"". He said the changes would put science and technology ""right at the heart of policy making"" and said he looked forward to helping identify ""cutting-edge research and technologies"". But James Wilsdon, who is digital science professor of research policy at Sheffield University, said the reorganisation carried risks: ""Ministers and civil servants might have a bigger say over direction and priorities, at the expense of researchers themselves, who are typically better-placed to know where opportunities lie.

LiveLiveFlu this winter could be worse than Covid - expert3 minutes ago,"19 July still 'looking good' to be terminus point for restrictions in England, Boris Johnson says But he says Delta variant cases are still rising and the priority is to keep more variants out of the UK Several people have been arrested at an anti-lockdown protest in Westminster - on what would have been the end date of England's restrictions Flu could be a bigger problem than Covid this winter, expert warns, with immunity levels 'likely to have dropped' Venues for the delayed Tokyo Olympics will be allowed up to 10,000 spectators - half their normal capacity A ban on non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford has come into force Edited by Martha Buckley Thank you for following our coronavirus updates, we are closing the page shortly. Today's writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jennifer Meierhans, Joseph Lee and Katie Wright. The page was edited by Martha Buckley and Rob Corp. From all of us, have a good evening. This video can not be played We'll leave you with this group of teachers dancing to a song from the hit musical The Greatest Showman, which has been watched more than 900,000 times in three weeks. Staff and pupils at Ormiston Sudbury Academy in Suffolk performed From Now On as a way to say goodbye to their year 11 students. The school has been using its TikTok channel as a way of connecting with students and the wider community, especially during the pandemic. Head of performing arts Leo Cox said: ""Weâve had so much fun as an academy experimenting with ourTikTok account,external, and itâs been a great way for students to get creative and work together as a team to make some brilliant videos."" We are going to be winding down our live page soon so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus news: The transport secretary says he is âcautiously hopefulâ about being able to lift some restrictions on international travel as a result of the vaccine programme. Grant Shapps says the government had always committed to regularly reviewing its international travel plan with the first âcheckpointâ taking place on 28 June. He says the checkpoints will look at whether the âscience would supportâ relaxations - including letting people who have received two vaccine doses return from certain countries without quarantining. âWeâll have to see what science leads us to be able to do and when, but that's why we've got these checkpoints in place,"" he says. On domestic travel, Shapps said the governmentâs new flexible season tickets for rail travel would guarantee a âa 20% saving for peopleâ. He says the tickets ârecognise the world has changedâ and that âpeople are not necessarily travelling to the office every single dayâ. We've got more from the protests in Westminster on what would have been the end date of all coronavirus restrictions in England. The Metropolitan Policetweeted,external: ""We've made 14 arrests while policing a demonstration in Westminster today.

Three police officers were injured, thankfully their injuries are not serious."" A demonstration in Parliament Square included people holding signs against vaccines and lockdowns. This video can not be played ""Long Covid"" is affecting a significant number of people in the UK, Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist, has said. She toldBBC World Newslong Covid was not just limited to patients who were very ill or hospitalised. About 13% of people with just mild symptoms went on to develop long Covid with symptoms for 12 weeks or more. ""It is not something that lasts for a short period of time. Among the million people in the UK who we think are impacted now, about 400,000 are people who have had symptoms for one year or more. And that is how debilitating it can be,"" she said. Dr Gurdasani, who has been researching long Covid at Queen Mary University of London, said younger people and women were more at risk, but anyone could get long Covid. Some women have reportedthe pattern of their periods changing as a result of getting the jab. But changes in patterns could have occurred ""by chance"", leading gynaecologists say. It comes after data suggested almost 4,000 women had reported changes
after they received a vaccine,according to Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) figures quoted by the Sunday Times,external. ""We're aware some women have been reporting a
change to their period cycle or symptoms during the pandemic,"" Dr Sue Ward, vice-president for education at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), said. ""The degree to which changing hormone levels will affect someone is often
informed by her psychological well-being at that time. ""We know that life events can make PMS [pre-menstrual syndrome] symptoms feel worse, and something
as all-consuming and life-changing as a global pandemic could result in women
experiencing their periods differently."" The RCOG says anecdotally some women report heavier periods after receiving the vaccine and that it would support more data collection in the area. They also recommend contacting a doctor if women notice any unusual bleeding.  A total of74,577,678coronavirus vaccines have been given in the UK,according to government's daily figures.,external That's43,127,763first doses and31,449,915second doses total. Yesterday163,750first jabs and109,408second jabs were given. It is the lowest number of second jabs since 5 April but the number of people seen by vaccine clinics on a Sunday tends to be lower. A County Durham technology firm which is developing a machine to detect coronavirus in the air is testing it at a Darlington primary school. Sedegfield-based Kromek says its system is designed to be used in areas of high footfall, such as airports, cinemas and schools. Machines have already been installed at Newcastle and Teesside airports. Kromek chief executive officer, Arnab Basu said: ""We sample a lot of air and filter out all the particles we're not interested in, like skin particles and pollen, and we look at the virus and use a very accurate analytical technique inside the machine which tells if Covid is there."" The head of the World Trade Organization says Africa is working with the European Union and other partners to create regional hubs to produce vaccines. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said facilities would be established in South Africa, Senegal and Rwanda. Nigeria is also being considered. She said the over-centralisation of vaccine production was incompatible with equitable access, especially during a health crisis. Africa is facing a major shortage of coronavirus jabs. The United Nations has urged countries that can to donate surplus supplies to the continent. Here are some of the scenes from a protest in Parliament Square in London on what would have been so-called Freedom Day - when all coronavirus restrictions in England were due to end. Demonstrators are holding signs against coronavirus measures such as lockdowns, vaccines and vaccine passports. The photographs show a large police presence and a number of people being detained. We will bring you more as we have it. Rail passengers have expressed their anger after discovering that new flexible season tickets will not save them money on their journeys. The tickets, which went on sale earlier,allow travel in England on any eight days in a 28-day period. The Department for Transport says part-time commuters on some routes will save hundreds of pounds a year through the scheme. But larger savings can be made if some journeys are made at off-peak times, or using railcards. Trudie Thompson, 59, from Dover, Kent, told the PA news agency she planned to return to the office two days a week from September, but that using weekly season tickets will be Â£190 cheaper per month than the new Flexi Season ticket. Graeme Douglas, who commutes from Faversham, Kent, into London, says: ""It won't save me any money. It's better to try and travel off-peak and use a Network Rail card where possible. There's zero real incentive here."" Does it add up? According to an online season ticket price calculator: A passenger commuting three days a week fromCambridge to LondonKing's Cross via any permitted route will payÂ£5,745.60if they use the new tickets. That is more expensive than an annual ticket atÂ£5,388, but cheaper than using weeklies,Â£6,999.01, or monthliesÂ£6,207.60. For a two-days-a-week commuter, the new flexible tickets are the cheapest option over a year. Commuters travelling three days per week fromYork to Leedswill payÂ£2,419.20using Flexi Season tickets, compared withÂ£2,516for an annual ticket. Monthly tickets would costÂ£2,899.20over a year. There have been a further five Covid-related deaths in the UK, according to thegovernment's daily figures.,external It brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test to 127,981. A total of 10,633 new cases were also reported. Eight people have been arrested in protests again coronavirus lockdowns and vaccines near the House of Commons on what would have been the end date of all restrictions in England. The Metropolitan Police tweeted,external: ""We are engaging with a crowd gathering on Bridge Street, Westminster, who are blocking traffic and being obstructive and hostile to officers.

Eight arrests have been made so far. We are working to keep traffic moving and minimise disruption to the local community."" The Metro is reporting,externaltennis balls were thrown towards Downing Street as protesters express their anger about so-calledFreedom Day being pushed back to 19 July. One protester held an umbrella painted with the words ""Don't take the vaccine"" and ""No more lockdowns"". Ellie Morgan's Covid jab appointment took just 20 minutes but getting there almost took her all day as she had to rely on public transport. The 26-year-old is in theunder-40 age range advised againsthaving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, so she had to get to her local mass vaccination centre wheresub-zero temperature freezers are storing the Pfizer doses. But she lives in Monmouth, south Wales, and with no car and her friends and family all at work she had to take one of only seven buses a day to Newport. She says: ""It was an hour there by bus but I also had to arrive two hours before my allotted time, as the next bus from Monmouth would've made me miss my appointment."" After leaving her house at about 10:00 BST to make the trip for her jab, she arrived home after 17:00, because the next bus back to Monmouth was a few hours after her vaccine. ""It was all fine, however it ended up being a whole day's activity and meant that any other plans were off the table. Also if I had missed that one bus, then there would have been no way for me to get there other than taxi, which I dread to think how much that would cost."" It comes as a GP says more should be done to help some young people in rural areas get to their vaccine appointment. Rachel Godiff has to cancel her honeymoon in Edinburgh after Scotland imposed travel restrictions In his criticism of Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's ban on travel to and from Manchester and Salford, Mayor Andy Burnham stressed the impact on individuals in the region. One of them is Rachel Godiff, from Salford, who had previously cancelled her honeymoon in Greece due to travel restrictions andnow has to cancel her alternative plans in Edinburgh. The bride-to-be, 31, tells BBC Radio Manchester: ""We are getting married in Salford on Saturday and we have nowhere to go. ""It's just one thing after another. It feels like nothing is going to plan. ""Everything we want to do is being changed. We were really excited about it and then suddenly find out we are not able to go."" She says it seems unfair, especially when she has had both vaccine doses and her partner has had his first. Here's a little more from Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan, who has pledged thatpeople aged 40 and over will get their second Covid jab within eight weeks of their first. She told Monday's Welsh government press conference: ""Between now and mid-July, we will be putting an extra half a million vaccines into the system, focusing on second doses and getting people fully protected."" A health official said there was good evidence that two doses was helping to reduce the risk of needing hospital treatment from the Delta variant. It comes as the number of Delta cases rises to 579, up from 490 last week. First Minister Mark Drakeford has previously warned that Wales was at the start of a third wave of coronavirus. People over 40 in England and Scotland have already been invited to get their second Covid jab within eight weeks. In Northern Ireland, the interval between doses has been reduced from 10 weeks to six weeks for appointments scheduled after 14 June 2021. Find out more about when you will get a vaccinehere. We reported earlier that Kendal Calling in Cumbria has becomethe latest casualty of a summer filled with cancelled music festivals. The festival - due to take place between 29 July and 2 August with headliners including Stereophonics, Supergrass, The Streets and Dizzee Rascal  - was called off due to a ""complete absence of any guidance"" from the government. However, some concerts, summer festivals and gigs are able to go ahead if they can ensure social distancing between groups, and limit attendance.  We've explained the rules for festivals as well as pubs and restaurantshere. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon ""confused"" by Andy Burnham Covid position Following criticism from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham about the decision to ban travel between the city and Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has defended her decision. She said if Burnham wants ""a grown-up conversation, he only has to pick up the phone"". But the decision was taken for serious public health reasons, Sturgeon said. Burnham had earlier said the decision was taken on Friday without any warning, and he has called for travellers forced to cancel plans and businesses losing out on custom to be compensated. Speaking after Sturgeon's comments, the Greater Manchester mayor said he found them ""insulting, not for me, but for people here who are directly affected by what she announced"". He said the decision has a real affect on people and businesses so it was wrong to suggest it was political posturing. Booster jabs could be given along with the usual autumn flu jabs Earlier we heard Health Secretary Matt Hancock saying he expecteda decision to be made about booster vaccines in the next few weeks, once the trial data is in. The lead investigator for the trials, Prof Saul Faust, has just been on BBC Radio 4's World at One with some more detail. He says they were operating on ""very tight timelines"" and the results would be available by the end of August. âThat is incredibly quick in terms of the fact we are still recruiting â the recruitment for this trial, giving people their third dose, is happening right now in June,â he says. But he says this timing for an autumn booster programme was not a concern for the UK's vaccine advisory committee, the Vaccine Task Force or the health secretary as it had all been planned for some time. Prof Faust says NHS planning for giving boosters alongside flu jabs and planning over vaccine supply had all been taking place at the same time.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Booster jab plan to come in due course - sourceHealth leaders say planning for an autumn rollout must start now as it will involve bigger challenges.,"This video can not be played Covid booster jabs planned for autumn, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock Plans for a Covid booster jab programme in the autumn will be set out in the next few weeks, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary said ministers were waiting for results from trials of different combinations of vaccines. It comes after doctors and NHS trusts said planning for a booster rollout must start now as it will involve bigger challenges. They said many questions needed answering, including how long immunity from the original Covid jab lasts. The issue of whether children will be vaccinated also still remains, health leaders said. Will vaccines affect my fertility? And other questions How can I get my second jab sooner? The people feeling vaccine guilt ""We are currently trialling which combinations of jabs are the most effective,"" Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast. ""In the next few weeks, when we get the clinical data through on what's the most effective combinations to haveâ¦ then we'll set out all the details for the booster programme for the autumn."" Among the ongoing trials isthe UK's Cov-Boost trial,external, which is testing different combinations of third doses. A senior government source said the UK would also benefit from new vaccines from Novavax and Valneva, which are awaiting approval from the UK's medicines regulator. So far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two jabs of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose. People have been rushing to get their vaccines in recent days, with more than one million jabs booked on Friday and Saturday in England after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. Rosi Stamp, 25, was one of those who received their Pfizer jab at Tottenham Hotspur's stadium on Sunday Ministers have repeatedly said that vaccination is the way out of lockdown, and the delay to England's lockdown ending from 21 June until 19 July was partly to allow more people to get vaccinated. Some restrictions have been eased on Monday though, the original date for lockdown ending - and what some had dubbed Freedom Day. The number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue. And in Wales,rules are also being lifted slightly,including Covid capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size. In Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictionshas been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotlandare expected to be extended until mid-July. The average number of daily confirmed cases of coronavirus is now rising in the UK, with a further 9,284announced by the government on Sunday.,externalA further six deaths were announced. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? On Monday, Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, which represents NHS hospitals and trusts in England, and Royal College of GPs chairman Martin Marshall said the 19 July target to offer a first dose to all adults was ""not so much a finishing line as a staging post"". The government has previously promised there will be a booster programme for the Covid jab - but the health leaders said the prospect of a yearly Covid vaccine would bring ""arguably greater challenges"", and it was important to know: How long will protection from the original double doses last - and will boosters be needed? Will people get the same vaccine as the original one they got? How will tweaking the vaccines for new variants work? Will Covid vaccines be tweaked every year, like the flu vaccine, or will it be more frequently? Will children be vaccinated and if so, when, where and how, because of the need to get consent? This video can not be played Margaret Keenan, 91, talks to the BBC about becoming the first person in the world to get the Pfizer-BioNTech jab last December They also said combining the Covid and flu vaccine rollouts - for example a Covid jab in one arm and a flu jab in the other - needed to be explored, but that would make the rollout more complex. And they said there needed to be investment in proper vaccination venues rather than relying on sports stadiums or community facilities. ""Since flu jabs start in September we need ministers and the JCVI - the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - to really answer those questions as quickly as possible, so we're ready to administer the jabs we need to in the autumn,"" Mr Hopson told the BBC. Mr Hopson and Mr Marshall said there needed to be a sustainable approach to vaccination, which meant the NHS could carry on vaccinating while also doing its other work. ""We cannot just carry on as we are, with an emergency response largely delivered by an overstretched workforce,"" they said. They are asking questions rather than coming up with solutions but health leaders have identified a major challenge for the coming winter. Offering a first dose to all adults by 19 July is seen as just a first step in a long haul with Covid. Given that booster vaccines will be needed, GPs and NHS trusts want to know the logistics of what will be a complex process on top of the usual winter pressures and dealing with the backlog of non-urgent work. Doctors and their practice teams have gone the extra mile to help deliver the Covid vaccination programme but they want to ensure day-to-day patient care is not compromised. The flu season might seem some way off but the normal vaccination campaigns and rollout start in September each year. Hence the call for ministers to come with some answers and longer term plans soon. Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, which advises UK health departments on vaccination, said decisions on booster jabs would be ""based on the best available evidence"" but the committee was also conscious of the need for the programme to be planned by the NHS. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme data on how flu and Covid vaccines could react to each other if given together would be available ""very soon"". Prof Harnden added that flu could be ""potentially a bigger problem"" than Covid this winter because of the low prevalence in the last few years, particularly during lockdown, meaning the level of immunity in the population had dropped. On whether under-18s could be offered a Covid vaccine, he said ""we need to think very carefully what the benefits are to children themselves"", and the JCVI would be considering this in the next few weeks. The committee has not yet made a formal recommendation on the matter. The World Health Organizationhas previously urged rich countrieslike the UK to donate doses to poorer countries before organising booster jabs.

Booster jab plan to come in due course - source,"This video can not be played Covid booster jabs planned for autumn, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock Plans for a Covid booster jab programme in the autumn will be set out in the next few weeks, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary said ministers were waiting for results from trials of different combinations of vaccines. It comes after doctors and NHS trusts said planning for a booster rollout must start now as it will involve bigger challenges. They said many questions needed answering, including how long immunity from the original Covid jab lasts. The issue of whether children will be vaccinated also still remains, health leaders said. Will vaccines affect my fertility? And other questions How can I get my second jab sooner? The people feeling vaccine guilt ""We are currently trialling which combinations of jabs are the most effective,"" Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast. ""In the next few weeks, when we get the clinical data through on what's the most effective combinations to haveâ¦ then we'll set out all the details for the booster programme for the autumn."" Among the ongoing trials isthe UK's Cov-Boost trial,external, which is testing different combinations of third doses. A senior government source said the UK would also benefit from new vaccines from Novavax and Valneva, which are awaiting approval from the UK's medicines regulator. So far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two jabs of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose. People have been rushing to get their vaccines in recent days, with more than one million jabs booked on Friday and Saturday in England after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. Rosi Stamp, 25, was one of those who received their Pfizer jab at Tottenham Hotspur's stadium on Sunday Ministers have repeatedly said that vaccination is the way out of lockdown, and the delay to England's lockdown ending from 21 June until 19 July was partly to allow more people to get vaccinated. Some restrictions have been eased on Monday though, the original date for lockdown ending - and what some had dubbed Freedom Day. The number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue. And in Wales,rules are also being lifted slightly,including Covid capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size. In Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictionshas been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotlandare expected to be extended until mid-July. The average number of daily confirmed cases of coronavirus is now rising in the UK, with a further 9,284announced by the government on Sunday.,externalA further six deaths were announced. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? On Monday, Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, which represents NHS hospitals and trusts in England, and Royal College of GPs chairman Martin Marshall said the 19 July target to offer a first dose to all adults was ""not so much a finishing line as a staging post"". The government has previously promised there will be a booster programme for the Covid jab - but the health leaders said the prospect of a yearly Covid vaccine would bring ""arguably greater challenges"", and it was important to know: How long will protection from the original double doses last - and will boosters be needed? Will people get the same vaccine as the original one they got? How will tweaking the vaccines for new variants work? Will Covid vaccines be tweaked every year, like the flu vaccine, or will it be more frequently? Will children be vaccinated and if so, when, where and how, because of the need to get consent? This video can not be played Margaret Keenan, 91, talks to the BBC about becoming the first person in the world to get the Pfizer-BioNTech jab last December They also said combining the Covid and flu vaccine rollouts - for example a Covid jab in one arm and a flu jab in the other - needed to be explored, but that would make the rollout more complex. And they said there needed to be investment in proper vaccination venues rather than relying on sports stadiums or community facilities. ""Since flu jabs start in September we need ministers and the JCVI - the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - to really answer those questions as quickly as possible, so we're ready to administer the jabs we need to in the autumn,"" Mr Hopson told the BBC. Mr Hopson and Mr Marshall said there needed to be a sustainable approach to vaccination, which meant the NHS could carry on vaccinating while also doing its other work. ""We cannot just carry on as we are, with an emergency response largely delivered by an overstretched workforce,"" they said. They are asking questions rather than coming up with solutions but health leaders have identified a major challenge for the coming winter. Offering a first dose to all adults by 19 July is seen as just a first step in a long haul with Covid. Given that booster vaccines will be needed, GPs and NHS trusts want to know the logistics of what will be a complex process on top of the usual winter pressures and dealing with the backlog of non-urgent work. Doctors and their practice teams have gone the extra mile to help deliver the Covid vaccination programme but they want to ensure day-to-day patient care is not compromised. The flu season might seem some way off but the normal vaccination campaigns and rollout start in September each year. Hence the call for ministers to come with some answers and longer term plans soon. Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, which advises UK health departments on vaccination, said decisions on booster jabs would be ""based on the best available evidence"" but the committee was also conscious of the need for the programme to be planned by the NHS. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme data on how flu and Covid vaccines could react to each other if given together would be available ""very soon"". Prof Harnden added that flu could be ""potentially a bigger problem"" than Covid this winter because of the low prevalence in the last few years, particularly during lockdown, meaning the level of immunity in the population had dropped. On whether under-18s could be offered a Covid vaccine, he said ""we need to think very carefully what the benefits are to children themselves"", and the JCVI would be considering this in the next few weeks. The committee has not yet made a formal recommendation on the matter. The World Health Organizationhas previously urged rich countrieslike the UK to donate doses to poorer countries before organising booster jabs.

Rahm wins first major at US Open,"This video can not be played Back-to-back birdies put Jon Rahm into US Open lead US Open final leaderboard -6J Rahm (Spa);-5L Oosthuizen (SA);-3H English (US);-2G Migliozzi (Ita), B Koepka (US), C Morikawa (US) Selected others:-1P Casey (Eng), R McIlroy (NI);levelF Molinari (Ita);+2J Spieth (US), J Thomas (US), D Johnson (US);+3B DeChambeau (US);+5R MacIntyre (Sco);+6I Poulter (Eng) Spain's Jon Rahm claimed an incredible first major after finishing with back-to-back birdies on a breathless final day of the US Open at Torrey Pines. Rahm, 26, roared at a wall of fans after his putt on the 18th took him to six under and gave him a one-shot lead over South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen. Oosthuizen then bogeyed the 17th, meaning he needed to eagle the last to force a play-off but could only birdie. Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau challenged but faded late on. Both players held a share of the lead early in the round but were among many to struggle on the back nine, while Rahm was the only contender to not drop a shot in the closing holes. The victory comes two weeks after he wasforced to withdraw from a PGA Tour eventhe was leading by six shots after three rounds because of a positive coronavirus test. The world number three said his main concern at that time was for his wife and two-month-old baby and it was them he celebrated with - on his first Father's Day no less - after the nerveless birdie putt saw him close out a four-under-par 67, the joint lowest score of the day. ""You have no idea what this means right now,"" he said to his son Kepa after hearing of Oosthuizen's closing birdie. ""You will soon enough."" Jon Rahm's previous best major result was when he finished tied for third at the 2019 US Open The leaderboard was congested after a flurry of birdies on the front nine, but players were fighting to avoid bogeys on the back nine. Oosthuizen was the last to fall when he dropped a shot on the 17th and he could not repeat the sensational eagle he made on the 18th on Saturday, which had given him a share of the overnight lead. The 38-year-old, who won the 2010 Open Championship, also shot a closing 67 but has now finished runner-up in a major on six occasions, including last month's US PGA Championship. ""It's frustrating. It's disappointing,"" Oosthuizen said. ""I'm playing good golf, but winning a major championship is not just going to happen. You need to go out and play good golf."" Rahm played the back nine in two under par, carding seven pars before the grandstand finish saw him become the first Spaniard to win the US Open. ""I'm a big believer in karma and after what happened a couple of weeks ago, I stayed really positive knowing that big things were coming,"" said Rahm, who won his first PGA Tour event at Torrey Pines in 2017. ""I didn't know what it was going to be but I knew we were coming to a special place. I got my breakthrough win here and it's a very special place for my family. ""The fact my parents were able to come, I got out of Covid protocol early, I just felt like the stars were aligning."" Rahm dedicated his win to Spanish legend Seve Ballesteros, who claimed five major titles but died 10 years ago of brain cancer at the age of 54. ""I knew my best golf was to come and I have a hard time explaining what just happened because I can't believe I made the last two putts and I'm the first Spanish player to win the US Open,"" Rahm continued. ""This is definitely for Seve - I know he tried a lot, I know he wanted to win this one most of all."" This video can not be played 'Shake that tree' - Mackenzie Hughes' ball gets stuck in branches at US Open A memorable final day began with numerous major winners crowding the top of the leaderboard and 17 players within five shots of Oosthuizen, Mackenzie Hughes and Russell Henley's five-under overnight lead. McIlroy started two shots off the lead, hoping to win a second US Open title 10 years after his first, but the Northern Irishman's double bogey on the 12th put paid to his chances as he closed with a 73 to finish joint seventh on one under, alongside leading Englishman Paul Casey (70). ""I feel close. It's the first time in a while,"" said McIlroy, who won the last of his four majors at the 2014 PGA Championship.""I felt way more comfortable with what I was doing out there [today] which is a huge positive.""It was better, for the week as a whole it was a positive and I can take a lot from it and kick on."" At the start of the week, defending champion DeChambeau had vowed to use the ""bomb and gouge"" tactics that propelled him to the title at Winged Foot last September. They had worked to a degree over the first three days and he too was just two back at the start of play. But he floundered on Sunday and suffered an even worse fate than McIlroy, dropping four shots in three holes from the 11th and then taking eight shots on the par-four 17th as he signed for a six-over 77 and three over total. ""I've had plenty of times where I hit it way worse and won,"" he said. ""A lot of it is luck. I caught the bad lies on the back nine. It's frustrating in the moment when it's happening, but afterwards I don't really care as much. I've already won it."" Unheralded Henley had held the lead throughout much of the first three rounds but failed to move away from a dangerous-looking chasing pack and a run of three bogeys starting on the sixth hole were enough to put him out of the running on Sunday as he closed with a 76 to finish level par. England's Richard Bland, 48, had provided the fairy-tale opening to the tournament, becoming the oldest man to lead at the halfway stage but he too fell foul of the challenging course, with rounds of 77 and 78 over the weekend. Conversely, Rahm bided his time with opening rounds of 69 and 70 before slipping to two under with a one-over 72 on Saturday but brought his best golf when it counted. With the title wide open for most of Sunday and the lead changing hands numerous times, the Spaniard got off to a promising start as he began the final round of a major with two birdies for the first time. That put him one off the lead and he managed to rectify a wayward tee shot with a classy chip on to the third green but he could not avoid a bogey on the fourth. Two-time US Open winner Koepka and McIlroy moved ominously up the leaderboard, but like many others faded on the back nine. In a sign that perhaps Rahm was always destined to win, he got a free drop after his tee shot on the ninth flew perilously close to a boundary fence and he took advantage to card a birdie to get back to four under, one off the lead. Then, Oosthuizen left a group of six players tied for second to join DeChambeau - who had moved top of the leaderboard after coming within inches of holing his tee shot on the par-three eighth - in the lead with a birdie on the ninth. Down the back nine, tee shots became increasingly wayward and birdies evermore scarce as a series of errors by those near the top of the leaderboard changed the scene dramatically. After a DeChambeau bogey, Oosthuizen extended his lead to two shots with an excellent birdie putt on the 10th but immediately fell foul of a cursed 11th to drop a shot. As McIlroy and DeChambeau fell back, Oosthuizen tried to cling onto his lead with Rahm chasing and the clubhouse target of three under set by Harris English suddenly looked promising. Rahm missed birdie chances on the 14th and 15th and his tee shot into a fairway bunker on the 17th seemed unnerving, but the Spaniard hit his approach to 25ft and raucously celebrated after holing the birdie putt to join Oosthuizen as tournament leader. After another trip into the sand on the par-five last, Rahm chipped onto the green and made another challenging 18ft putt to earn his victory.

Ethiopian PM faces first election amid conflict,"Some 37 million people registered to vote in the election Ethiopians have been voting in key elections amid rising tensions and a conflict in the northern Tigray region. This pandemic-delayed poll is Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's first electoral test since coming to power in 2018. But the vote was postponed in Tigray, where the army has been fighting a local force since November. Insecurity and logistical problems have hit other parts of the country as well, so overall there was no voting in about a fifth of constituencies. The Tigray conflict has sparked a humanitarian crisis, with 350,000 peopleliving in famine conditions, according to a recent assessment. Live updates on the election Ethiopia election: A sham or democratic rebirth? A quick guide to Ethiopia's election The Nobel Peace Prize winner who went to war The head of the electoral commission, Birtukan Mideksa, said that while things had gone mostly smoothly she was worried about the intimidation of opposition party agents in some places - particularly in the Amhara region and the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region. ""Some complain they have been beaten or denied access to voting stations,"" she told journalists. ""If this issue is not resolved immediately the outcome of the election might be compromised."" The former prisoner in charge of Ethiopiaâs elections Voting was due to end at 18:00 local time (15:00 GMT) but has been extended by three hours in some areas because election materials arrived late. In the capital, Addis Ababa, BBC reporters saw long queues of voters during the day. It is one area where Mr Abiy is expected to face a stiff challenge and where the opposition has succeeded in the past. ""I came here to contribute to the election which I believe could be a great milestone for democracy,"" Demiss Beyene, who started queuing two hours before polls opened, told the BBC. ""I believe the election will bring in peace... I really wish this election brings back our unity, instead of dividing us over ethnicity,"" Tadelech Benti, another voter in Addis Ababa, said. The general election, the first since 2015, was originally slated for August 2020 but was rescheduled because of coronavirus. Results are expected within five days. Mr Abiy came to power in 2018 as the nominee of the then-ruling coalition but he has never faced the electorate. He became prime minister on the back of protests against the government dominated by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and introduced a series of reforms. In the last election, the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition and its allies won all the seats but Mr Abiy has dissolved the coalition and created a new party - the Prosperity Party - in an attempt to reduce ethnic division. The TPLF, however, did not join. This video can not be played Abiy Ahmed: I hope it will be the best election in our history Mr Abiy will keep his post if the party wins a majority of the 547 seats in the national assembly. He says the polls will be ""the nation's first attempt at free and fair elections"". His reformist zeal saw him win the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, but just a year later, he launched a military operation in his own country. He deployed troops to Tigray to oust the TPLF as the region's ruling party after it seized military bases in what Mr Abiy saw as a bid to overthrow him. It resulted in a conflict that has killed thousands of people and has led to mass hunger and reports of a famine in the region. More than 40 parties have fielded candidates but most of them are regional parties. Opposition parties have complained that a government crackdown against their officials disrupted their plans to prepare for the polls. Opposition leader Berhanu Nega cast his vote in Addis Ababa Casting his vote, Berhanu Nega the leader of one of the main opposition parties, Ethiopian Citizens for Social Justice, said he hoped the result would reflect the popular will. ""This doesn't mean there will not be problems. But the problems would not be significant enough to overturn or reflect what the public actually voted,"" he told journalists at the polling station. In some pivotal regions, such as Oromia, opposition parties are boycotting the election, alleging government intimidation. The TPLF has been designated a terrorist organisation. Some of its leaders have been arrested, while others are on the run or are continuing to wage a guerrilla war in Tigray. Catherine Byaruhanga, BBC News, Beshasha village, Ethiopia In the valley between rolling hills the local market in Beshasha village has been turned into a polling station for the day. This is where Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was born and grew up and he is hugely popular. But there are two candidates running against Mr Abiy and they tell me that local officials have harassed their supporters and made it hard for them to campaign. Yet they're careful about how much they criticise the prime minister. Some of the country's biggest political parties have boycotted this election citing intimidation from the state. And some of Mr Abiy's biggest opponents on the national stage are in detention accused of trying to destabilise the country. Despite the fact that 20% of constituencies will not vote today the government is standing by today's vote and says it will be a genuine reflection of the will of Ethiopians. Why Ethiopiaâs 'alphabet generation' feel betrayed Ethiopian elections prompt online misinformation How Ethiopia has changed over the last 50 years Fact-checking Abiy Ahmed Despite being billed as a national contest, elections will not be held in around one-fifth of the country's 547 constituencies, including all 38 seats in Tigray and 64 others across Ethiopia. Voting is not taking place in the war-torn Tigray region Most of the delayed votes are scheduled for 6 September though no date has been set yet for Tigray. There are election observers from the African Union as well as a number of Ethiopian groups but the EU will not be sending a team. In May, the EU accused Ethiopia of failing to guarantee the independence of its mission. Mr Abiy has dismissed international concern and has insisted the election will be free and fair. ""When the entire world is saying we will fight on election day, we will instead teach them a lesson,"" he told supporters at a rally last week.

Two-time US Open winner Koepka and McIlroy moved ominously up the leaderboard, but like many others faded on the back nine. In a sign that perhaps Rahm was always destined to win, he got a free drop after his tee shot on the ninth flew perilously close to a boundary fence and he took advantage to card a birdie to get back to four under, one off the lead. Then, Oosthuizen left a group of six players tied for second to join DeChambeau - who had moved top of the leaderboard after coming within inches of holing his tee shot on the par-three eighth - in the lead with a birdie on the ninth. Down the back nine, tee shots became increasingly wayward and birdies evermore scarce as a series of errors by those near the top of the leaderboard changed the scene dramatically. After a DeChambeau bogey, Oosthuizen extended his lead to two shots with an excellent birdie putt on the 10th but immediately fell foul of a cursed 11th to drop a shot. As McIlroy and DeChambeau fell back, Oosthuizen tried to cling onto his lead with Rahm chasing and the clubhouse target of three under set by Harris English suddenly looked promising. Rahm missed birdie chances on the 14th and 15th and his tee shot into a fairway bunker on the 17th seemed unnerving, but the Spaniard hit his approach to 25ft and raucously celebrated after holing the birdie putt to join Oosthuizen as tournament leader. After another trip into the sand on the par-five last, Rahm chipped onto the green and made another challenging 18ft putt to earn his victory.

Autumn booster jab plan needed now - NHS leaders,"This video can not be played Covid booster jabs planned for autumn, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock Plans for a Covid booster jab programme in the autumn will be set out in the next few weeks, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary said ministers were waiting for results from trials of different combinations of vaccines. It comes after doctors and NHS trusts said planning for a booster rollout must start now as it will involve bigger challenges. They said many questions needed answering, including how long immunity from the original Covid jab lasts. The issue of whether children will be vaccinated also still remains, health leaders said. Will vaccines affect my fertility? And other questions How can I get my second jab sooner? The people feeling vaccine guilt ""We are currently trialling which combinations of jabs are the most effective,"" Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast. ""In the next few weeks, when we get the clinical data through on what's the most effective combinations to haveâ¦ then we'll set out all the details for the booster programme for the autumn."" Among the ongoing trials isthe UK's Cov-Boost trial,external, which is testing different combinations of third doses. A senior government source said the UK would also benefit from new vaccines from Novavax and Valneva, which are awaiting approval from the UK's medicines regulator. So far, nearly 60% of UK adults have had two jabs of the vaccine, meaning they are fully vaccinated, and more than four in five adults have had their first dose. People have been rushing to get their vaccines in recent days, with more than one million jabs booked on Friday and Saturday in England after vaccinations opened to all over-18s. Rosi Stamp, 25, was one of those who received their Pfizer jab at Tottenham Hotspur's stadium on Sunday Ministers have repeatedly said that vaccination is the way out of lockdown, and the delay to England's lockdown ending from 21 June until 19 July was partly to allow more people to get vaccinated. Some restrictions have been eased on Monday though, the original date for lockdown ending - and what some had dubbed Freedom Day. The number of guests at a wedding is no longer limited to 30 (although there are capacity rules depending on a venue's size), visiting arrangements for care homes are changing, children can go on overnight trips in groups of 30, and pilots of large events like Euro 2020 games will continue. And in Wales,rules are also being lifted slightly,including Covid capacity restrictions for music and comedy and the limits on weddings changing in line with a venue's size. In Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictionshas been pushed back to at least 5 July, and current rules in Scotlandare expected to be extended until mid-July. The average number of daily confirmed cases of coronavirus is now rising in the UK, with a further 9,284announced by the government on Sunday.,externalA further six deaths were announced. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? On Monday, Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, which represents NHS hospitals and trusts in England, and Royal College of GPs chairman Martin Marshall said the 19 July target to offer a first dose to all adults was ""not so much a finishing line as a staging post"". The government has previously promised there will be a booster programme for the Covid jab - but the health leaders said the prospect of a yearly Covid vaccine would bring ""arguably greater challenges"", and it was important to know: How long will protection from the original double doses last - and will boosters be needed? Will people get the same vaccine as the original one they got? How will tweaking the vaccines for new variants work? Will Covid vaccines be tweaked every year, like the flu vaccine, or will it be more frequently? Will children be vaccinated and if so, when, where and how, because of the need to get consent? This video can not be played Margaret Keenan, 91, talks to the BBC about becoming the first person in the world to get the Pfizer-BioNTech jab last December They also said combining the Covid and flu vaccine rollouts - for example a Covid jab in one arm and a flu jab in the other - needed to be explored, but that would make the rollout more complex. And they said there needed to be investment in proper vaccination venues rather than relying on sports stadiums or community facilities. ""Since flu jabs start in September we need ministers and the JCVI - the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation - to really answer those questions as quickly as possible, so we're ready to administer the jabs we need to in the autumn,"" Mr Hopson told the BBC. Mr Hopson and Mr Marshall said there needed to be a sustainable approach to vaccination, which meant the NHS could carry on vaccinating while also doing its other work. ""We cannot just carry on as we are, with an emergency response largely delivered by an overstretched workforce,"" they said. They are asking questions rather than coming up with solutions but health leaders have identified a major challenge for the coming winter. Offering a first dose to all adults by 19 July is seen as just a first step in a long haul with Covid. Given that booster vaccines will be needed, GPs and NHS trusts want to know the logistics of what will be a complex process on top of the usual winter pressures and dealing with the backlog of non-urgent work. Doctors and their practice teams have gone the extra mile to help deliver the Covid vaccination programme but they want to ensure day-to-day patient care is not compromised. The flu season might seem some way off but the normal vaccination campaigns and rollout start in September each year. Hence the call for ministers to come with some answers and longer term plans soon. Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, which advises UK health departments on vaccination, said decisions on booster jabs would be ""based on the best available evidence"" but the committee was also conscious of the need for the programme to be planned by the NHS. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme data on how flu and Covid vaccines could react to each other if given together would be available ""very soon"". Prof Harnden added that flu could be ""potentially a bigger problem"" than Covid this winter because of the low prevalence in the last few years, particularly during lockdown, meaning the level of immunity in the population had dropped. On whether under-18s could be offered a Covid vaccine, he said ""we need to think very carefully what the benefits are to children themselves"", and the JCVI would be considering this in the next few weeks. The committee has not yet made a formal recommendation on the matter. The World Health Organizationhas previously urged rich countrieslike the UK to donate doses to poorer countries before organising booster jabs.

New season tickets on sale for part-time commutersPassengers who travel to work two or three days a week now have the option of a flexible monthly ticket.Business,"New flexible tickets go on sale from Monday aimed at commuters in England who only travel to work two or three days a week. The new tickets can be used for eight days in any month-long period. TheNational Rail website,externalwill allow passengers to calculate savings and book the new tickets. It is part of the government'splanned shake-up of rail services, but is being introduced immediately to cater to the trend for more home-working. From 2023 a new state-owned body, Great British Railways (GBR), will set rail timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure. The flexible season tickets are being introduced separately, ahead of the structural changes, and can be used from 28 June. Seven ways the rail shake-up will affect you 'I pay more than Â£9,000 a year for my season ticket' Is it safe to use public transport? Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the new tickets would offer ""greater freedom and choice about how we travel, simpler ticketing and a fairer fare"". The government estimates commuters could save between Â£60 and Â£350 a year on selected journeys. However, Tony Miles, rail expert and contributor to Modern Railways magazine, said people needed to be cautious because the new system offers a finite number of journeys whereas a season ticket allows people to use the train as much as they want. ""These really aren't season tickets,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""This is a bulk purchase of tickets. ""A season ticket effectively gives you unlimited travel,"" he said. ""The big difference with this is you're buying a fixed number of journeys at a discount price but if you decide at a weekend to do some extra journeys that will start ticking off your credit."" Digital flexi-tickets can be used on any eight days in a 28-day period England without being required to select the days of travel in advance They can be bought on rail websites and apps, as well as at some ticket offices Tickets are paperless, so travellers will have to use a smartphone or smartcard An online calculator will help passengers identify the cheapest option Until the end of this year, passengers who book in advance will be able to change their bookings with no extra charge The tickets are for standard class travel only There was already reduced demand for traditional season tickets before the pandemic struck, but the enforced period of working from home has accelerated the trend. Dozens of employers have announced staff will be given the option to work from home at least part of the week after pandemic restrictions are removed. Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said the changes would help persuade people to choose rail travel again. ""Our research with passengers showed us there was strong demand for a new ticket that suited people who expected to commute less frequently in future,"" said Mr Smith. ""This is a positive step towards much-needed longer-term reform of how rail tickets are sold. We also welcome the waiving of admin fees for changing tickets, which will help rebuild passenger confidence."" However, Transport Focus said it was important that passengers used the calculator to check the costs, as the new flexible tickets would not be the best option for everyone. Mr Miles said commuters needed to do some ""real heavy thinking"" about whether the new system would offer them value for money. ""If you are definitely going to travel two days a week to work and no more, then these probably will be a good thing for you,"" he said. ""If you think you are going to travel three days a week, you'd be very careful, and if you think your work will summon you randomly to pop in for extra days during the month, you need to be really careful because you will be using up that credit."" The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) which represents train operators said the rail companies would like to go further in reforming the fare system, if given the go ahead. For example they would like to see more use of the tap-in, tap-out technology, used on the London Underground, which allows travellers to accumulate journeys and pay the price for a season ticket if they reach the threshold, without having to know their plans in advance and pre-purchase a season ticket. Although the new flexible season tickets apply to National Rail operations in England, with rail operations devolved in other nations, they are available on cross border commuter routes, for example Bristol to Cardiff, or Berwick to Edinburgh.
