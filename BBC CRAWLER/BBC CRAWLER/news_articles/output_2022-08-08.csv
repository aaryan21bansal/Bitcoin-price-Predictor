Ryan Giggs headbutted ex-girlfriend - court hears,"Ex-Manchester Utd and Wales star Ryan Giggs ""deliberately headbutted"" his ex-girlfriend, a court has heard. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, told the court Mr Giggs' private life involved a ""litany of abuse, both physical and psychological"". Mr Giggs, 48, denies a charge of coercive behaviour and assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her sister. His defence counsel said the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies"". Ryan Giggs charged with assaulting two women Giggs resigns as Wales manager Mr Giggs is charged with controlling and coercive behaviour against his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville, 38, between August 2017 and November 2020. He is also charged with assaulting Ms Greville, causing her actual bodily harm, and common assault of her younger sister, Emma Greville, at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, on 1 November 2020. Opening his case against Mr Giggs at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court, Mr Wright said this was a story of ""control and coercion"" of a woman who thought she was ""loved and respected"". He said his relationship with Ms Greville, 36, was ""punctuated by acts of violence and volatility"". He added Mr Giggs was ""idolised"" for his skills on the pitch but behind closed doors had ""a much uglier and more sinister side to his character"". He told the jury they will hear the relationship had ""ups and downs"" and that Mr Giggs was seeing someone else when he was with Ms Greville. ""Eventually, after years of turbulence, when the scales fell from her eyes, she realised she needed to remove herself from his sphere of influence,"" he said. Ryan Giggs in front of Judge Hilary Manley Mr Wright said this decision to break away led to the incident on 1 November 2020. Mr Giggs is said to have ""lost control"" that evening and headbutted Ms Greville. While both out with friends at Manchester's Stock Exchange Hotel, Ms Greville decided to terminate their relationship, said Mr Wright. He added Ms Greville knew Mr Giggs had ""once again"" been cheating on her, and informed her sister of her plan to end the relationship before leaving the hotel. ""She intended to make her departure before [Mr Giggs] got back from the hotel. The plan did not work. ""As she was vacating the defendant's home address, he came back and began arguing with her and trying to stop her leaving."" In the altercation that followed, in which Ms Greville took Mr Giggs phone as a ""bargaining chip"", they grappled together on the floor before Ms Greville's sister stepped in, the court heard. Mr Wright said Emma Greville then tried to pull Mr Giggs off her sister, but he ""deliberately elbowed her in the jaw"", before the argument moved to the kitchen. ""At that stage, we say, the defendant entirely lost self-control and he deliberately headbutted Kate, thereby causing swelling to her lips and bruising. Emma then called the police, who attended the premises."" Ryan Giggs' former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, and teammate Gary Neville will be witnesses in the case, the jury was told Mr Giggs' defence team challenged the prosecution's version of events. Addressing the jury, Chris Daw QC for the defence said on a ""moral level"" his behaviour was ""far from perfect"". He told the jury some of his messages and emails were ""marked by immaturity and inappropriate language"", but this was the case for both him and Ms Greville. ""They behaved like squabbling children, playing on the insecurities of the other."" But, Mr Daw said ""no matter how rude, unpleasant and mean"" they were, there were ""lines Mr Giggs would never cross"". ""He never once used unlawful violence against Ms Greville,"" he said, adding that the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies."" He said it was ""clear"" Ms Greville's injuries were not consistent with a head butt from ""a strong and physically fit man"". Referring to the incident on 1 November 2020, Mr Daw said Mr Giggs and Ms Greville both tripped and fell to the floor in the kitchen of his home and that she kicked him in the face as he tried to disentangle himself. Mr Daw added Mr Giggs was not aware the complainant's sister was in the house at the time and did not elbow her, as alleged. The alleged headbutt was ""not only a nasty lie but a ridiculous one,"" he said, as evidence in the trial will show there was ""minor and accidental contact"" between their faces. Mr Daw said in the weeks before, Ms Greville told friends she was determined not to walk away from the relationship with nothing. He added Mr Giggs had encouraged Ms Greville's career ambitions in PR, backed her with his own company, and introduced clients. She was always financially independent, free to travel and see her friends as much as she wanted, he told the court. ""Both could be childish,"" he said. On nights out, they would often block each other's numbers. ""Immaturity is not a crime,"" he added, and when it comes to law and morality, ""law is what matters"". The trial is expected to last 10 days Mr Wright, QC for the prosecution, also told the jury the abuse from Mr Giggs was ""interspersed with acts of kindness and contrition"". He said Mr Giggs would say she had misunderstood him, had jumped to the wrong conclusion and that he was the victim. ""We say this was controlling and coercive behaviour,"" he added. ""This was a behaviour to gaslight her, and make her pliant and compliant."" He said the behaviour was ""calculated"", and was ""conduct that would have an obvious and serious effect on her emotionally and physically"". Standing in the dock, wearing a dark grey suit, Mr Giggs listened to the opening statements and watched as the jury of seven women and five men was selected and sworn in for the trial. The jury was told witnesses in the case will include former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and former player Gary Neville. The trial - expected to last around 10 days - will relocate to Manchester Crown Court from Tuesday and remain there for the duration. Mr Giggs has denied all charges - the trial continues.

Obituary: Olivia Newton-John,"The singer and campaigner became Dame Olivia in 2020 in recognition of her music and charity work Olivia Newton-John, who has died aged 73, began her career as the sweetheart of country-flavoured pop. It all changed when she donned black spandex for Grease, one of the most successful film musicals of all time. Her new raunchy image found its peak in her 1981 album, Physical. But a diagnosis of breast cancer saw her move to an introspective style and she devoted more time to humanitarian causes. Actress and singer Olivia Newton-John dies aged 73 Olivia Newton-John was born in Cambridge on 26 September 1948. Her Welsh father had been an MI5 agent during World War II attached to the Enigma project at Bletchley Park. Her fresh outdoor-girl look saw her appear in a number of advertisements Her mother was the daughter of the German Nobel laureate, Max Born, and had fled with her family when the Nazis came to power in 1933. In 1954 her father took up a post as a professor of German at the University of Melbourne and the family moved to Australia. As a child Newton-John had developed a fascination with animals and harboured ambitions to be a vet but she found science a struggle at school and abandoned the idea. Instead, she turned to music. She formed a short-lived girl group with three school friends and began performing in a coffee shop run by her sister's boyfriend. A meeting with local singer-songwriter Ian Turpie saw the pair form a professional and romantic relationship. When Turpie was recruited to present The Go!! Show on ATV 10 in Melbourne, Newton-John became a regular guest, miming to pre-recorded covers of British and US pop hits. Her rendition of Anyone Who Had a Heart won her the top prize in another talent show, which included a trip to the UK. She was initially reluctant to leave Australia, but her mother saw it as a chance to build her daughter's career and flew with her to London in 1966. A move to London opened up new possibilities Appearances in various clubs saw her offered a one-off record deal with Decca but her first single, a cover of  'Till You Say You'll Be Mine, failed to chart. She teamed up with an old friend from Australia, Pat Carroll, and the two toured Europe as a duo, including a gig at Paul Raymond's Revue which, she later recalled, they hadn't realised was a strip club until they arrived. Her breakthrough came in 1971 when she released a Bob Dylan-penned track, If Not For You, which reached number seven in the UK charts and featured on an album of the same name. Another track from the album, Banks of the Ohio, also charted, its country sound heralding the future direction of her music. There was disappointment when her second album, Olivia, failed to make an impact, although a single, What is Life, made the UK Top 20. She came fourth in the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest It was the country-flavoured album Let Me Be There that finally broke her in the lucrative US market. The eponymous single won her a Grammy for Best Female Country Vocalist. Back in the UK she sang the country's Eurovision entry, Long Live Love, in the 1974 song contest - she came fourth in the year Abba won with Waterloo. The album If You Love Me, Let Me Know established her credentials across the Atlantic. Released only in the US and Canada, it brought her first US number one single, I Honestly Love You. It was the first of seven US number one hits she would have between 1974 and 1977, either in the Billboard Hot 100 or its Adult Contemporary chart. In 1974 she was named Country Music Association Female Vocalist of the Year, seeing off competition from Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tanya Tucker. There was a backlash from US country fans, annoyed at her pop-style music being considered on a par with Nashville's finest but, with the support of established country stars, she was eventually accepted. By 1977 her career was faltering. She failed to find chart success with new material although a compilation album, Olivia Newton-John's Greatest Hits, made number seven in the country charts. Grease sparked a change in image and musical direction A meeting with producer Alan Carr saw her offered the part of Sandy in a film version of the musical, Grease. Worried that at 28 she was too old for the teenage role, she insisted on a screen test with John Travolta before accepting the part. The character of Sandy was recast as an expat Australian to accommodate Newton-John's accent. The film was the biggest box-office hit of 1978, and gave Newton-John three hit singles, You're The One That I Want, Hopelessly Devoted to You and Summer Nights as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. It was a catalyst for change in both her image and her musical direction. She appeared on the cover of her next album, Totally Hot, dressed in black leather. It  was her first US Top 10 album since 1975. The follow-up, Physical, was her most overtly sexual record, and was hailed by many critics as her best album. The title track held the Billboard number one spot for 10 weeks. She met her first husband Matt Lattanzi on the set of Xanadu The album was dedicated to her then boyfriend,  Matt Lattanzi, whom she married in 1984. The couple had met while filming the rock fantasy - and box-office flop - Xanadu, in which Newton-John had played the lead role. After taking three years off to raise her daughter, Chloe, she struggled to get her career back on track. There was a further blow when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Her illness, and subsequent recovery, marked another change of musical direction as she returned to more mainstream pop material. She also spent more of her time as an advocate of humanitarian and health issues. She had already established herself as a campaigner for animal welfare, cancelling a tour of Japan in 1978 as a protest against the slaughter of dolphins caught in tuna nets. She was a supporter of cancer charities, something that led to the opening of the Olivia Newton-John Cancer & Wellness Centre in Melbourne. She continued to record although many of her subsequent albums were only released in Australia where she performed at the opening of the Sydney Olympics in 2000 Her longevity came from a process of musical reinvention In 2008 she secretly married John Easterling, the boss of a natural remedy company, in an Incan spiritual ceremony in Peru. In May 2017 it was announced that her breast cancer had returned and spread to her back resulting in a cancellation of a planned tour in the US and Canada. She publicly campaigned for the legalisation of medicinal cannabis to ease the pain. Several years later she became Dame Olivia, honoured for her music and charity work. Olivia Newton-John will be remembered for her ability to re-invent herself. The pop princess of the late 1960s morphed first into a country star, got raunchy in Grease, and then glided into an ambassadorial role on behalf of a number of worthy causes. In 2019 her legendary spandex-pants and leather jacket from Grease were auctioned for $405,000 - as two billionaires fought for the right to own a piece of one of cinema's most famous scenes. In line with Dame Olivia's wishes, the proceeds were donated to Australian cancer research.

""Eventually, after years of turbulence, when the scales fell from her eyes, she realised she needed to remove herself from his sphere of influence,"" he said. Ryan Giggs in front of Judge Hilary Manley Mr Wright said this decision to break away led to the incident on 1 November 2020. Mr Giggs is said to have ""lost control"" that evening and headbutted Ms Greville. While both out with friends at Manchester's Stock Exchange Hotel, Ms Greville decided to terminate their relationship, said Mr Wright. He added Ms Greville knew Mr Giggs had ""once again"" been cheating on her, and informed her sister of her plan to end the relationship before leaving the hotel. ""She intended to make her departure before [Mr Giggs] got back from the hotel. The plan did not work. ""As she was vacating the defendant's home address, he came back and began arguing with her and trying to stop her leaving."" In the altercation that followed, in which Ms Greville took Mr Giggs phone as a ""bargaining chip"", they grappled together on the floor before Ms Greville's sister stepped in, the court heard. Mr Wright said Emma Greville then tried to pull Mr Giggs off her sister, but he ""deliberately elbowed her in the jaw"", before the argument moved to the kitchen. ""At that stage, we say, the defendant entirely lost self-control and he deliberately headbutted Kate, thereby causing swelling to her lips and bruising. Emma then called the police, who attended the premises."" Ryan Giggs' former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, and teammate Gary Neville will be witnesses in the case, the jury was told Mr Giggs' defence team challenged the prosecution's version of events. Addressing the jury, Chris Daw QC for the defence said on a ""moral level"" his behaviour was ""far from perfect"". He told the jury some of his messages and emails were ""marked by immaturity and inappropriate language"", but this was the case for both him and Ms Greville. ""They behaved like squabbling children, playing on the insecurities of the other."" But, Mr Daw said ""no matter how rude, unpleasant and mean"" they were, there were ""lines Mr Giggs would never cross"". ""He never once used unlawful violence against Ms Greville,"" he said, adding that the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies."" He said it was ""clear"" Ms Greville's injuries were not consistent with a head butt from ""a strong and physically fit man"". Referring to the incident on 1 November 2020, Mr Daw said Mr Giggs and Ms Greville both tripped and fell to the floor in the kitchen of his home and that she kicked him in the face as he tried to disentangle himself. Mr Daw added Mr Giggs was not aware the complainant's sister was in the house at the time and did not elbow her, as alleged. The alleged headbutt was ""not only a nasty lie but a ridiculous one,"" he said, as evidence in the trial will show there was ""minor and accidental contact"" between their faces. Mr Daw said in the weeks before, Ms Greville told friends she was determined not to walk away from the relationship with nothing. He added Mr Giggs had encouraged Ms Greville's career ambitions in PR, backed her with his own company, and introduced clients. She was always financially independent, free to travel and see her friends as much as she wanted, he told the court. ""Both could be childish,"" he said. On nights out, they would often block each other's numbers. ""Immaturity is not a crime,"" he added, and when it comes to law and morality, ""law is what matters"". The trial is expected to last 10 days Mr Wright, QC for the prosecution, also told the jury the abuse from Mr Giggs was ""interspersed with acts of kindness and contrition"". He said Mr Giggs would say she had misunderstood him, had jumped to the wrong conclusion and that he was the victim. ""We say this was controlling and coercive behaviour,"" he added. ""This was a behaviour to gaslight her, and make her pliant and compliant."" He said the behaviour was ""calculated"", and was ""conduct that would have an obvious and serious effect on her emotionally and physically"". Standing in the dock, wearing a dark grey suit, Mr Giggs listened to the opening statements and watched as the jury of seven women and five men was selected and sworn in for the trial. The jury was told witnesses in the case will include former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and former player Gary Neville. The trial - expected to last around 10 days - will relocate to Manchester Crown Court from Tuesday and remain there for the duration. Mr Giggs has denied all charges - the trial continues.

PM rules out immediate cost-of-living action,"Boris Johnson has no plans to introduce big tax and spending measures before he leaves office to ease the cost-of-living crisis, Downing Street has said. Business group leader Tony Danker has urged ministers to ""grip the emerging crisis"", arguing it ""made no sense to wait"" for the next PM to arrive. And Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, has called for an urgent meeting with the devolved governments. Downing Street said it recognised the public were facing ""challenging times"". However, Mr Johnson's spokesman argued it would be up to his successor to make any decisions on further help. Mr Johnson is due to leave office in early September, and No 10 said ""by convention it is not for this prime minister to make major fiscal interventions during this period"". Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse said the government had already and was continuing to do work on cost-of-living problems. Cost of living crisis focus for Tory leader contest What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? ""My job is to make sure that when the new prime minister arrives, the plan is in place for them to put their foot on the accelerator,"" he told the BBC's PM programme. He also dismissed calls from ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown for the government to hold a meeting of the government's emergency response committee Cobra, arguing that would be ""a performative political act"". Earlier this year,the government announceda Â£15bn package of support to ease the cost-of-living crisis. This included giving households a Â£400 discount on energy bills and Â£650 for the poorest households to help with wider living costs. However, the government has come under pressure to do more, following worsening economic warnings. Last week, the Bank of England forecast that the UK was heading into a recession, with inflation set to hit 13%. Meanwhile, the energy price cap will go up in October, withindustry analysts estimatingaverage domestic energy bills could hit more than Â£3,600 a year. Mr Danker, head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI),said,externalthe prime minister and the candidates for the Tory leadership, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, ""should come together to agree a common pledge to support people and help quell fears"". The Conservative leadership race is taking place amid grim economic forecasts ""The economic situation people and businesses are facing requires all hands to the pump this summer,"" he said. ""We simply cannot afford a summer of government inactivity while the leadership contest plays out followed by a slow start from a new prime minister and cabinet."" And on Tuesday morning he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the prime minister and the Tory leadership candidates should ""agree on the principles"" of support for energy bills. He said civil servants should be ""working with the candidates now"" to draw up options for helping vulnerable people as soon as one of them took office. ""I just don't think it's responsible government for a prime minister or future prime ministers not to give the country reassurance,"" Mr Danker said. The CBI - which represents British businesses - said the prime minister should direct the civil service to draw up options on helping the most vulnerable people - and that these options should be made available to both leadership candidates. The organisation also said Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak and Ms Truss should agree ""a way forward to support people and businesses with energy bills"" ahead of 26 August, when Ofgem is due to announce the next energy price cap. Elsewhere, Ms Sturgeon has called for an emergency meeting with Mr Johnson and the leaders of devolved governments, to agree steps to help people. In a letter to the prime minister, she said the SNP-led government was ""committed to doing all we can"" but added: ""We cannot respond on the scale required without action by your government."" Writing in the Daily Record,,externalMr Brown - who was the Labour prime minister between 2007 and 2010 - said the UK faced ""a financial timebomb"" and urged Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak and Ms Truss to agree ""an immediate Budget to prevent a winter heating catastrophe"". Set budget before financial timebomb, says Brown 'Energy bills are bad now, but worse is to come' He also said the emergency committee Cobra should be in ""permanent session to deal with the coming fuel and energy crisis"". Speaking to the BBC's World This Weekend programme on Sunday, Mr Brown said there was ""a vacuum"" in government because ""the prime minister is on holiday, the chancellor is on holiday, the two leadership candidates for prime minister are on the campaign trail."" Boris Johnson is due to leave Downing Street in early September Asked if Mr Johnson - who has returned from a holiday in Slovenia - would summon a meeting of Cobra, No 10 said it would be up to Mr Johnson's successor to make any decisions on further support for households. The spokesman also said there were no plans to recall Parliament, but that Mr Johnson and his Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi are meeting this week to discuss progress on the support measures already announced. Responding to No 10's comments, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said ""people are worried sick about how they'll pay their bills... and all this Tory prime minister does is shrug his shoulders"". She said the two leadership candidates could only ""offer more of the same"", adding: ""Labour would start by scrapping tax breaks on oil and gas producers and providing more help to people who are struggling to pay their energy bills."" Meanwhile, the two MPs hoping to take over the leadership have beencriticisingeach other's plans to address mounting living costs. Mr Sunak has warned that the plans of his rival Ms Truss ""won't touch the sides"". Supporters of Ms Truss say her proposed tax cuts would help people, but did not rule out offering further support.

UK set for new heatwave as temperatures head to 35C,"An aerial view of the parched lawns of Leeds Castle in Kent The UK is set for another heatwave this week with highs of up to 35C (95F) in some parts, forecasters have said. The Met Office said while conditions would be belowthe 40.3C recorded last month, the hot weather could last for a longer period. More parts of England are also facing hosepipe bans amid very dry conditions, as fire crews warn of wildfires. Heat health-alerts have been put in place across England by the UK Health Security Agency. A level three warning will cover southern and central England from midday on Tuesday until 18:00 BST on Saturday, with a level two alert in place for northern England for the same period. Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said a ""fairly widespread heatwave"" was developing across the UK this week with the peak of the temperatures likely to be on Friday or Saturday. ""It does look like a prolonged period of dry weather and obviously that's bad news for southern England where some rain would really be useful now,"" he said. Temperatures will build from 28C or 29C on Tuesday and reach the low to mid-30s from Thursday, Mr Morgan said. He said the West Midlands and West Country could see the highest temperatures with a maximum of around 35C, but this is uncertain. A heatwave is defined as above average temperatures seen for three days or more. Is the UK getting hotter? How to keep pets safe as temperatures rise Six ways to keep your home cool What does hot weather do to the body? England had itsdriest July since 1935, said the Met Office. For some parts - south-east and central southern England - last month was the driest since records began in 1836. There have also been calls for more hosepipe bans to be brought in ,including from Environment Secretary George Eustice. Southern Water already has in place a hosepipe ban for customers in Hampshire and on the Isle of Wight, and from Friday South East Water will do the same in Kent and Sussex. A ban has also been in place in the Isle of Man since 29 July, where customers could face a Â£2,000 fine if they break the rules. Welsh Water will bring in a ban for Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire later this month. In France, the government has set up a crisis team to tackle a drought that has leftmore than 100 municipalities short of drinking water. Will there be a hosepipe ban in my area? Last month's record temperatures saw a series of wildfires across the country and Riccardo la Torre, from the Fire Brigades Union, described them as ""brutal"". ""They burn at extremely high temperatures, they spread faster than firefighters can move and they are very labour intensive,"" he said. He said fire services were under strain and claimed the reason blazes ""spread with regularity is because we do not have resources to get there quickly enough"". The government said spending for fire services had been increased by around Â£141m to Â£1.37bn over the last six years, ""demonstrating our commitment to ensuring fire services have the resources they need"". Essex County Fire and Rescue Service has urged people not to light bonfires or barbecues, or let off fireworks or sky lanterns, after a large blaze which damaged gardens, sheds and trees was started by a chiminea. Mark Hardingham, chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council said: ""I have not seen a distinction between the two heatwaves - it has remained hot between then and now and equally there's been no rainfall."" He said crews were expecting the busiest time of day to be between 13:00 and 19:00 BST every day and said fire chiefs would aim to maximise on-call firefighters in rural areas to help cope with demand. A combine harvester and the surrounding field caught fire in Gloucestershire on Monday, following a weekend of fires in the West which sawthousands of square metres of farmland destroyed. Fire destroys acres of corn in farmland M&S stops selling disposable barbecues across UK Sir John Armitt, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) said water companies who have not called for a hosepipe ban ""will be keeping it under constant review"". ""The advantage of doing it [a hosepipe ban] right now would be that it relieves pressure on their rivers,"" he said. Speaking on the BBC's The World at One programme he said there were simple steps people could take to help such as ""reducing the number of minutes we spend in the shower"". He said there was no doubt climate change was affecting our infrastructure and said water was something we took for granted. The National Farmers Union warned the heatwave was compounding problems already caused by months of dry weather - grass not growing and irrigation water running out are two. Deputy president Tom Bradshaw told the BBC: ""The biggest concern is always animal health and welfare and trying to make sure the animals are well looked after. ""There's also an impact on crops, particularly some vegetable crops - once they get over the mid-20s in temperature they stop growing"". Keith Stones, who farms in Swaledale, North Yorkshire, has been struggling to find grass to feed his livestock. He told the BBC: ""The ewes producing the milk for the lambs are thin because they're not picking up enough nutrition from the forage. ""The lambs are becoming pot-bellied and thin because they're not getting nutrition from the grass or from the milk because the mums aren't supplying."" The dry weather has also caused staff at Kew Gardens, in south-west London, to prioritise which plants that have high conservation value, historic importance or which are extinct in the wild. Director of gardens Richard Barley said this included not irrigating wider lawns and natural habitats. The heat-health alerts, which are designed to help healthcare professionals manage periods of extreme temperatures, mean care homes will be monitoring residents closely. David Lewis, manager of Cwmbran House Care Home in Cwmbran, Wales, said they were encouraging drinking as ""much as possible"" and offering ice creams and lollies if residents get warm. ""We're ventilating the rooms and have got fans in the lounges"", he said. Additional reporting by Charley Adams.

Tap water turns brown amid unprecedented demand,"Brown coloured water in the Morgan family's paddling pool Discoloured water has been flowing from taps of some households following increased demand amid the hot weather. Families noticed it was brown in colour after allowing water time to settle. Some have started using bottled water until the issue is resolved.

Lib Dems call to scrap energy price cap rise,"""We simply cannot afford more inaction,"" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said The Lib Dems have called for October's expected energy price cap rise to be scrapped, with the cost covered by a windfall tax on energy company profits. Experts expect the energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge their customers in England, Scotland and Wales - to hit Â£3,615. The average bill was Â£1,400 a year in October 2021. All households in England, Scotland and Waleswill receive Â£400 to help pay rising fuel billsthis autumn. The scheme is part funded by a windfall tax which has added a25% surchargeon the profits of the oil and gas sector since the end of May. Responding to the Liberal Democrat's proposal, a UK government spokesperson said: ""We know the pressures people are facing with rising costs, which is why we are providing Â£37 billion of help for households."" Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? The energy price cap is designed to protect consumers from short-term price changes. It is adjusted every three months and is based on the price energy suppliers pay producers for electricity and gas. The cap is expected to go up again to Â£3,615 a year from January next year. The Liberal Democrats estimate keeping the price cap at its current level of Â£1,971 will save the average household Â£1,400 a year. Without raising the price cap, suppliers will have an estimated shortfall of Â£36bn. This Lib Dems said this should be met by expanding the windfall tax on oil and gas company profits, and using the higher-than-expected VAT revenues ""as a result of soaring inflation"". The current windfall tax is time-limited and is expected to raise Â£5bn in 12 months. But the Liberal Democrats estimate a windfall tax could raise Â£20bn, if it is raised to 30% and backdated to October 2021. The Liberal Democrats have also proposed: Doubling the Warm Homes Discount to take Â£300 a year off the heating bills for pensioners and those on a low income, and extending it to all those on universal credit and pension credit Doubling the Winter Fuel Allowance, giving up to Â£600 a year to 11.3m pensioners to help with their heating bills. Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey said: ""This is an emergency, and the government must step in now. ""Energy bills have already gone up by Â£700 this year, and Conservative ministers have barely lifted a finger to help. ""We simply cannot afford more inaction in the face of another even bigger rise in October."" Energy consultancy Cornwall Insights expects the cap to rise to Â£3,582 a year in October: Â£1,518 for electricity and Â£1,840 for gas. The Lib Dems have multiplied these figures by the total number of meters: 29m electricity meters and 29m gas meters, according to the official government data. They then arrived at a figure just short of Â£36bn, which would be partially paid for by a higher windfall tax of 30% instead of 25%, which would be backdated to October. The party would also tax the global profits of British energy companies. The rest would be paid for by the extra VAT revenues the government is collecting due to inflation, with the Office for Budgetary Responsibility expects to total Â£30bn. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who standing to become the next prime minister, has pledged not to impose more windfall taxes on energy companies. Ms Truss told the Financial Times that she would ""look at what more can be done"" to help families facing spiralling fuel bills. But she added: ""The way I would do things is in a Conservative way of lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts."" A senior ally of Ms Trusslater qualified thatshe had not ruled out giving direct support to families struggling with the cost of living crisis. Ms Truss has called for green levies to be temporarily halted to help drive down energy bills. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak, said Ms Truss' original call to rule out emergency payments was ""simply wrong"" and that her tax cutting plans would further stoke inflation. Mr Sunak, who is also in the running to be the next prime minister, said he would cut an average of Â£160 off bills by temporarily scrapping VAT. He promised to ""go further"" than plans he launched as chancellor to help families through the cost of living crisis, including a one-off Â£650 cost of living payment to 8 million vulnerable households.

"Britney Spears returns with Elton John duetLittle is known about the new track, but it will be called Hold Me Closer.","The US pop singer was recently freed from a conservatorship Britney Spears is to return to the music scene with a collaboration with Sir Elton John, it has been confirmed. Few details are known about the new track - called Hold Me Closer. There had been speculation that the pair were working on a new version of Sir Elton's hit Tiny Dancer. It is the first new music from Spears since she was freed from a 13-year conservatorship, during which aspects of her finances and personal life were controlled by her father and others. More information is expected in the coming week, a spokesperson has told PA news agency. Teasing the collaboration, Sir Elton shared a picture of a rose and rocket emoji on Instagram on Monday, alongside the words ""hold me closer"". Allow Instagram content?

A US judge denied a motion by Mr Spears last month that the singer should return to court to face further questioning over the legal agreement. Britney Spears and Elton John at the 21st annual Elton John Aids Foundation Academy awards in 2013 Spears' conservatorship was set up in 2008 after the US pop star, known for hits like Oops I Did It Again! and Toxic, faced a public mental health crisis.

"Full extent of NHS dentist shortage revealedNine in 10 UK dentists are not accepting new adult patients, while eight in 10 are refusing children.HealthComments","Nine in 10 NHS dental practices across the UK are not accepting new adult patients for treatment under the health service, a BBC investigation has found. In a third of the UK's more than 200 council areas, we found no dentists taking on adult NHS patients. And eight in 10 NHS practices are not taking on children. The Department of Health said it had made an extra Â£50m available ""to help bust the Covid backlogs"" and that improving NHS access was a priority. Patients in pain amid struggle to find dental care Are cut-price reality TV teeth worth it? BBC News contacted nearly 7,000 NHS practices - believed to be almost all those offering general treatment to the public. The British Dental Association (BDA) called it ""the most comprehensive and granular assessment of patient access in the history of the service"". While NHS dental treatment is not free for most adults, it is subsidised. The BBC heard from people across the UK who could not afford private fees and said the subsidised rates were crucial to getting care. The lack of NHS appointments has led people to drive hundreds of miles in search of treatment, pull out their own teeth without anaesthesia, resort to making their own improvised dentures and restrict their long-term diets to little more than soup. Disappearing Dentists Some people are going to extraordinary measure to do DIY dentistry as they struggle to find affordable dental care. Are we witnessing the death of NHS dentistry? Watch now on BBC iPlayer The investigation also found: The problem was worst in thesouth-west of England,Yorkshire and the Humberand theNorth West, where 98% of practices were not accepting new adult NHS patients Access was best inLondon, where almost a quarter of practices were taking on new adult NHS patients One in 10 local authorities did not have any practices taking on under-16s for NHS treatment, despite children in full-time education being entitled to completely free care on the health service About 200 practices said they would take on a child under the NHS only if a parent signed up as a private patient Not only did we find that in many places routine dental care was difficult to access quickly, most practices did not even have waiting lists. For those that did, the majority told us the waiting time was a year or longer, or were unable to say how long people might have to wait. One practice inNorfolktold the BBC it had more than 1,700 people on its list, while another, inCornwall, warned that it would take five years to be taken on as a patient. The British Dental Association, which represents high-street NHS dentists in the UK, said NHS dentistry was at a ""tipping point"" after a decade of under-investment. Caroline Young, fromBlackpool, had crowns fitted to her damaged teeth by an NHS dentist, but when her practice stopped treating patients on the health service four years ago, she was unable to find a new one. Almost every week she goes through the dentists in the phonebook to ask whether they are taking on new patients. This video can not be played Watch: Caroline Young makes her own dentures ""I've even called dental practices as far as 20 miles away, in Preston. I've re-called all my local ones many times.

""It was supposed to be temporary, but my temporary became twice a week,"" said Ms Young. Dentists warn that these homemade dentures are not only a dangerous choking hazard, but also food traps that can lead to worse tooth decay and gum damage. ""There are times when I've tried to fit it, and it's not worked, and I'll sit in floods of tears because I can't go out,"" she says. ""It's demoralising.

Ryan Giggs headbutted ex-girlfriend - court,"Ex-Manchester Utd and Wales star Ryan Giggs ""deliberately headbutted"" his ex-girlfriend, a court has heard. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, told the court Mr Giggs' private life involved a ""litany of abuse, both physical and psychological"". Mr Giggs, 48, denies a charge of coercive behaviour and assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her sister. His defence counsel said the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies"". Ryan Giggs charged with assaulting two women Giggs resigns as Wales manager Mr Giggs is charged with controlling and coercive behaviour against his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville, 38, between August 2017 and November 2020. He is also charged with assaulting Ms Greville, causing her actual bodily harm, and common assault of her younger sister, Emma Greville, at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, on 1 November 2020. Opening his case against Mr Giggs at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court, Mr Wright said this was a story of ""control and coercion"" of a woman who thought she was ""loved and respected"". He said his relationship with Ms Greville, 36, was ""punctuated by acts of violence and volatility"". He added Mr Giggs was ""idolised"" for his skills on the pitch but behind closed doors had ""a much uglier and more sinister side to his character"". He told the jury they will hear the relationship had ""ups and downs"" and that Mr Giggs was seeing someone else when he was with Ms Greville. ""Eventually, after years of turbulence, when the scales fell from her eyes, she realised she needed to remove herself from his sphere of influence,"" he said. Ryan Giggs in front of Judge Hilary Manley Mr Wright said this decision to break away led to the incident on 1 November 2020. Mr Giggs is said to have ""lost control"" that evening and headbutted Ms Greville. While both out with friends at Manchester's Stock Exchange Hotel, Ms Greville decided to terminate their relationship, said Mr Wright. He added Ms Greville knew Mr Giggs had ""once again"" been cheating on her, and informed her sister of her plan to end the relationship before leaving the hotel. ""She intended to make her departure before [Mr Giggs] got back from the hotel. The plan did not work. ""As she was vacating the defendant's home address, he came back and began arguing with her and trying to stop her leaving."" In the altercation that followed, in which Ms Greville took Mr Giggs phone as a ""bargaining chip"", they grappled together on the floor before Ms Greville's sister stepped in, the court heard. Mr Wright said Emma Greville then tried to pull Mr Giggs off her sister, but he ""deliberately elbowed her in the jaw"", before the argument moved to the kitchen. ""At that stage, we say, the defendant entirely lost self-control and he deliberately headbutted Kate, thereby causing swelling to her lips and bruising. Emma then called the police, who attended the premises."" Ryan Giggs' former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, and teammate Gary Neville will be witnesses in the case, the jury was told Mr Giggs' defence team challenged the prosecution's version of events. Addressing the jury, Chris Daw QC for the defence said on a ""moral level"" his behaviour was ""far from perfect"". He told the jury some of his messages and emails were ""marked by immaturity and inappropriate language"", but this was the case for both him and Ms Greville. ""They behaved like squabbling children, playing on the insecurities of the other."" But, Mr Daw said ""no matter how rude, unpleasant and mean"" they were, there were ""lines Mr Giggs would never cross"". ""He never once used unlawful violence against Ms Greville,"" he said, adding that the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies."" He said it was ""clear"" Ms Greville's injuries were not consistent with a head butt from ""a strong and physically fit man"". Referring to the incident on 1 November 2020, Mr Daw said Mr Giggs and Ms Greville both tripped and fell to the floor in the kitchen of his home and that she kicked him in the face as he tried to disentangle himself. Mr Daw added Mr Giggs was not aware the complainant's sister was in the house at the time and did not elbow her, as alleged. The alleged headbutt was ""not only a nasty lie but a ridiculous one,"" he said, as evidence in the trial will show there was ""minor and accidental contact"" between their faces. Mr Daw said in the weeks before, Ms Greville told friends she was determined not to walk away from the relationship with nothing. He added Mr Giggs had encouraged Ms Greville's career ambitions in PR, backed her with his own company, and introduced clients. She was always financially independent, free to travel and see her friends as much as she wanted, he told the court. ""Both could be childish,"" he said. On nights out, they would often block each other's numbers. ""Immaturity is not a crime,"" he added, and when it comes to law and morality, ""law is what matters"". The trial is expected to last 10 days Mr Wright, QC for the prosecution, also told the jury the abuse from Mr Giggs was ""interspersed with acts of kindness and contrition"". He said Mr Giggs would say she had misunderstood him, had jumped to the wrong conclusion and that he was the victim. ""We say this was controlling and coercive behaviour,"" he added. ""This was a behaviour to gaslight her, and make her pliant and compliant."" He said the behaviour was ""calculated"", and was ""conduct that would have an obvious and serious effect on her emotionally and physically"". Standing in the dock, wearing a dark grey suit, Mr Giggs listened to the opening statements and watched as the jury of seven women and five men was selected and sworn in for the trial. The jury was told witnesses in the case will include former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and former player Gary Neville. The trial - expected to last around 10 days - will relocate to Manchester Crown Court from Tuesday and remain there for the duration. Mr Giggs has denied all charges - the trial continues.

"PM rules out immediate cost-of-living actionIt comes as business boss Tony Danker warns the UK cannot ""afford a summer of government inactivity"".","Boris Johnson has no plans to introduce big tax and spending measures before he leaves office to ease the cost-of-living crisis, Downing Street has said. Business group leader Tony Danker has urged ministers to ""grip the emerging crisis"", arguing it ""made no sense to wait"" for the next PM to arrive. And Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, has called for an urgent meeting with the devolved governments. Downing Street said it recognised the public were facing ""challenging times"". However, Mr Johnson's spokesman argued it would be up to his successor to make any decisions on further help. Mr Johnson is due to leave office in early September, and No 10 said ""by convention it is not for this prime minister to make major fiscal interventions during this period"". Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse said the government had already and was continuing to do work on cost-of-living problems. Cost of living crisis focus for Tory leader contest What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? ""My job is to make sure that when the new prime minister arrives, the plan is in place for them to put their foot on the accelerator,"" he told the BBC's PM programme. He also dismissed calls from ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown for the government to hold a meeting of the government's emergency response committee Cobra, arguing that would be ""a performative political act"". Earlier this year,the government announceda Â£15bn package of support to ease the cost-of-living crisis. This included giving households a Â£400 discount on energy bills and Â£650 for the poorest households to help with wider living costs. However, the government has come under pressure to do more, following worsening economic warnings. Last week, the Bank of England forecast that the UK was heading into a recession, with inflation set to hit 13%. Meanwhile, the energy price cap will go up in October, withindustry analysts estimatingaverage domestic energy bills could hit more than Â£3,600 a year. Mr Danker, head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI),said,externalthe prime minister and the candidates for the Tory leadership, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, ""should come together to agree a common pledge to support people and help quell fears"". The Conservative leadership race is taking place amid grim economic forecasts ""The economic situation people and businesses are facing requires all hands to the pump this summer,"" he said. ""We simply cannot afford a summer of government inactivity while the leadership contest plays out followed by a slow start from a new prime minister and cabinet."" And on Tuesday morning he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the prime minister and the Tory leadership candidates should ""agree on the principles"" of support for energy bills. He said civil servants should be ""working with the candidates now"" to draw up options for helping vulnerable people as soon as one of them took office. ""I just don't think it's responsible government for a prime minister or future prime ministers not to give the country reassurance,"" Mr Danker said. The CBI - which represents British businesses - said the prime minister should direct the civil service to draw up options on helping the most vulnerable people - and that these options should be made available to both leadership candidates. The organisation also said Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak and Ms Truss should agree ""a way forward to support people and businesses with energy bills"" ahead of 26 August, when Ofgem is due to announce the next energy price cap. Elsewhere, Ms Sturgeon has called for an emergency meeting with Mr Johnson and the leaders of devolved governments, to agree steps to help people. In a letter to the prime minister, she said the SNP-led government was ""committed to doing all we can"" but added: ""We cannot respond on the scale required without action by your government."" Writing in the Daily Record,,externalMr Brown - who was the Labour prime minister between 2007 and 2010 - said the UK faced ""a financial timebomb"" and urged Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak and Ms Truss to agree ""an immediate Budget to prevent a winter heating catastrophe"". Set budget before financial timebomb, says Brown 'Energy bills are bad now, but worse is to come' He also said the emergency committee Cobra should be in ""permanent session to deal with the coming fuel and energy crisis"". Speaking to the BBC's World This Weekend programme on Sunday, Mr Brown said there was ""a vacuum"" in government because ""the prime minister is on holiday, the chancellor is on holiday, the two leadership candidates for prime minister are on the campaign trail."" Boris Johnson is due to leave Downing Street in early September Asked if Mr Johnson - who has returned from a holiday in Slovenia - would summon a meeting of Cobra, No 10 said it would be up to Mr Johnson's successor to make any decisions on further support for households. The spokesman also said there were no plans to recall Parliament, but that Mr Johnson and his Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi are meeting this week to discuss progress on the support measures already announced. Responding to No 10's comments, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said ""people are worried sick about how they'll pay their bills... and all this Tory prime minister does is shrug his shoulders"". She said the two leadership candidates could only ""offer more of the same"", adding: ""Labour would start by scrapping tax breaks on oil and gas producers and providing more help to people who are struggling to pay their energy bills."" Meanwhile, the two MPs hoping to take over the leadership have beencriticisingeach other's plans to address mounting living costs. Mr Sunak has warned that the plans of his rival Ms Truss ""won't touch the sides"". Supporters of Ms Truss say her proposed tax cuts would help people, but did not rule out offering further support.

"Breaking|Breaking newsActress and singer Olivia Newton-John dies aged 73Olivia Newton-John, star of Grease and multi-platinum selling singer, dies aged 73, her official Facebook page announces","This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Tributes have been paid from around the world to Olivia Newton-John, who has died from cancer aged 73. The British-born Australian singer and actress was best known for playing Sandy in Grease, one of the most successful film musicals ever made. Her Grease co-star John Travolta said she ""made all of our lives so much better"" while its director said: ""What you see is what you get with her."" She died peacefully at her California ranch surrounded by family and friends. An actress and musician, Newton-John achieved commercial success as a country singer and sold millions of records globally. But it was her role as high school student Sandy in the film Grease that catapulted her to worldwide fame. The musical was the biggest box-office hit of 1978, and gave Newton-John three huge hit singles, including You're The One That I Want and Summer Nights, both performed with co-star John Travolta. And it was a catalyst for change in both her image and her musical direction - shedding her innocent, country-pop image. Obituary: Olivia Newton-John Australia mourns a national sweetheart Following the news of her death, scores of fans, as well as famous figures from the world of entertainment, shared heartfelt messages and memories. Actress Stockard Channing - who played Rizzo in Grease - said: ""I don't know if I've known a lovelier human being. Newton-John soared to global fame playing girl-next-door Sandy in smash-hit musical Grease ""Olivia was the essence of summer - her sunniness, her warmth and her grace are what always come to mind when I think of her. I will miss her enormously."" Singer Rod Stewart called her ""the perfect lady, gorgeous, with great poise and with a certain Aussie sophistication"". ""Her spandex trousers in Grease were my inspiration for my 'Da ya think I'm Sexy' era,"" he added, referencing the iconic tight black outfit that she wore at the film's finale. US television host Oprah Winfrey said her ""positivity was just infectious"". ""You'll be missed, Olivia,"" she wrote. ""Here's to the good times."" Travoltawrote on Instagram:,external""Your impact was incredible. I love you so much. We will see you down the road and we will all be together again."" ""Yours from the first moment I saw you and forever!"" he added, signing off: ""Your Danny, your John!"" The film's director Randal Kleiser said he had been friends with Newton-John for 40 years and ""she never changed, she was always exactly the way everyone imagines her"". ""She was charming, lovely, warm... There are so many clichÃ©s you can say about her, but in her case it was all true."" Asked what his everlasting memory of her will be, he told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Hanging out with her at her ranch. Seeing the real Olivia which was exactly like the Olivia she projected. No cameras around, no people around... she was exactly the same and as loving as ever."" Didi Conn, who played Frenchy in Grease, told BBC's Newsnight: ""She was such a humungous, big, big pop star and her persona was of this beauty... pure and sweet. In the movie we would call her Miss Goody Two Shoes, you know,  but simmering under that faÃ§ade of innocence was a hot mama ready to come out."" Other tributes came from singers Kylie Minogue, who called her an inspiration, and Dionne Warwick, who called Newton-John ""one of the nicest people I had the pleasure of recording and performing with"". Australian rock legend John Farnham, a long-time friend and with whom Newton-John released her final studio album, said she would be ""greatly missed"" and ""behind that iconic smile was a tenacious fighter"". Olivia Moore, who is currently playing Sandy in Grease in London's West End, broke the news to a shocked audience at the end of Monday evening's performance. Allow Twitter content?

Newton-John was first diagnosed with cancer in 1992 and went on to become a leading advocate of cancer research. Her charity, the Olivia Newton-John Foundation, has raised millions of pounds to support research. In a statement, the hospital that runs the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne - which was opened after the star's campaigning - said she ""encouraged, inspired and supported"" staff and patients every day. ""We are incredibly grateful for the special relationship we had with Olivia for many years. Her generous support and gift provided hope and changed the lives of thousands of cancer patients... She was the light at the end of the tunnel for many, many people."" Her efforts in the field were recognised by the Queen, who honoured her with a damehood in the 2020 New Year's Honours list. In a statement posted to her social media channels, Newton-John's husband John Easterling said she had died on Monday, hailing her ""a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years, sharing her journey with breast cancer"". ""Her healing inspiration and pioneering experience with plant medicine continues with the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, dedicated to researching plant medicine and cancer."" In later years, Newton-John became a cancer campaigner which led to the opening of an institute named after her in Melbourne Newton-John was born in Cambridge on 26 September 1948. Her father had been a British spy during World War Two. Her mother was the daughter of the German Nobel laureate, Max Born, and had fled with her family when the Nazis came to power in 1933. The family moved to Australia in 1954, where she was raised. Her breakthrough came in 1971 when she released a Bob Dylan-penned track, If Not For You, which reached number seven in the UK charts and featured on an album of the same name. She won four Grammy awards and scored seven US number one hits between 1974 and 1977. While critics never warmed to her audience-friendly style of music, the star forthrightly dismissed the reviews. ""It annoys me when people think because it's commercial, it's bad,"" she told Rolling Stone. ""It's completely opposite. If people like it, that's what it's supposed to be."" In 1978 she became a global star with the release of Grease. The film, set in the 1950s, told the story of Sandy's summer fling with John Travolta's Danny and the difficulties the relationship encounters. In the end the pair reconcile, with Sandy having transformed her appearance. In 2019, after being diagnosed with breast cancer for the third time, she was asked by CBS News how she coped. ""It was consuming my day and after a time I went 'you know what', I need to enjoy my life so I'm going to eat a cookie if I want it,"" she said. ""Because the joy of life and everyday living has to be a part of that healing process as well. So I've chosen that path to be grateful and to feel good about things because the other side's not so good.""

Cost of living crisis focus for Tory leader contest,"The cost of living crisis is perhaps the biggest issue the next prime minister will face. When Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak get the keys to Number 10 in just under month, they will have to answer the question: what can the government do to help people struggling with rising bills as winter approaches? At the moment, the candidates are trying to appeal to 160,000 or so Conservative members, who are choosing their next leader and our next prime minister. But as the wider electorate watches on, what have the candidates actually promised on the cost of living? Will they be forced to set out more detail about what they are prepared to do? And what does Rishi Sunak's record tell us about his plans? But let's take the frontrunner first. Sunak: Truss living costs plan won't touch sides What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Set budget before financial timebomb, says Brown Liz Truss's big plan is an emergency budget as soon as she takes office. She wants to immediately reverse the rise in National Insurance contributions and suspend green levies on energy bills. Her allies say this will give people more money in their pockets. But the foreign secretary faced pressure over the weekend when she said she wanted to help people by reducing the tax burden - and ""not giving handouts"". Did that mean there would be no more payments to help with energy bills? Not quite. Ms Truss's team say she is not ruling anything in or out. She will, they say, look at what is needed and what is possible in her emergency budget. Liz Truss wants to see an emergency budget if she's elected leader There is an important political context here. Lower taxes and a smaller state (with fewer ""handouts"") are popular with many Tories. But what about the wider electorate? In particular, what about those former Labour voters who backed the Conservatives at the last election for the first time? There are also criticisms that her tax cut plans will benefit the wealthy more than those on the breadline. Pensioners don't pay national insurance - nor do unemployed people or those earning under Â£12,500. They  will feel the impact of rising bills more than most, but they won't feel the benefits of the tax cut. The way national insurance works, the more you earn, the more a cut will benefit you. Some will ask: is that the best way of targeting support? Team Sunak don't think so. Rishi Sunak has promised to step in to help people on lower incomes this winter He hasn't pulled any punches in an article for The Sun newspaper, saying that Ms Truss's plans (including a plan to cancel an increase in corporation tax) are ""a big bung to large businesses and the well-off, leaving those who most need help out in the cold"". He writes that bolder action is needed. So what is he planning in his first weeks as prime minister? He has said he will scrap VAT on energy bills. But beyond that, he hasn't offered much in the way of specifics. Mr Sunak's supporters say it will depend on what happens with energy bills in the coming days. They have said he can be trusted based on his record as chancellor. But remember - Mr Sunak often faced a lot of pressure to act before he took decisions to help those on the lowest incomes. He was criticised after the Spring Statement earlier this year for not doing enough to help people with increasing prices. Many Tory MPs urged him to act - and within weeks he announced further new cost of living support. Mr Sunak initially resisted Labour's calls for a Windfall Tax to help pay for help - before eventually agreeing to one. He has also used furlough as an example of decisive action. But remember he was criticised for being too slow to extend it towards the end of 2020. In fact, Mr Sunak resisted extending the scheme at first. And then there's this campaign. Mr Sunak has been criticised for saying he'll scrap VAT on energy bills - given that he didn't do it when he was in the Treasury. There are four weeks to go in this leadership contest. There will be pressure on both candidates to give more details on what they will do to help with rising bills - and to spell out how they'll pay for it.

"'Energy bills are bad now, but worse is to come'","Ministers must offer bigger cost-of-living support payments as energy bills are expected to soar further this winter, a committee of MPs has said. Financial help for the vulnerable and poor needed to be ""updated"" to reflect higher bills in October, they said. Witnesses told the Business Committee: ""If you think things are bad now, you've not seen anything yet."" Its report also called energy regulator Ofgem ""incompetent"". Ofgem said it was working hard to reform the market. In recent days, millions of low-income households on benefits have been receiving the first Â£326 instalment of payments to assist with the rising cost of living. Further payments will come later in the year, including extra support for pensioners and people with disabilities, and a Â£400 discount on everyone's domestic energy bill. Those payments were set when the typical energy bill was anticipated to rise by Â£800 - a prediction Ofgem says is now too low. Influential industry analyst Cornwall Insight has predicted a rise of more than Â£1,200 a year in October, pushing the typical bill to Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January.

Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy A normal bill at present is about Â£2,000 a year, which follows a Â£700 a year rise in April. The Business Committee's report said the government's support package was ""no longer sufficient"" ""The impact of the energy price crisis on households is likely to cause an unacceptable rise in fuel poverty and hardship this winter,"" the report said. ""The government must immediately update its support, targeting this at customers who are on low incomes, fuel poor, and in vulnerable circumstances, and develop a scheme to support vulnerable customers to accelerate the repayment of energy debt resulting from this crisis."" How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Fuel, milk and eggs push inflation to 40-year high How high will my energy bill go? The committee has been hearing from experts, ministers and industry insiders for months. ""We were told by a number of witnesses, 'if you think things are bad now, you've not seen anything yet,'"" said Darren Jones, who chairs the committee. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""No national government can control global inflationary pressures; however, we have introduced an extraordinary package of support to help households."" The wide-ranging report made a series of other recommendations, including: consideration of the introduction of cheap, social tariffs for the most vulnerable allowing prepayment meter customers to pay for energy after they have used it, rather than before bringing in a ""far-reaching"" insulation programme in UK homes Members of the Business Committeefollow the Public Accounts Committee of MPsin heavily criticising regulator Ofgem for its role in allowing suppliers to set up and operate without sufficient oversight. It said there was too much focus on competition instead. Owing to the failure of 29 companies, 2.4 million customers were moved to other suppliers, and often to more expensive tariffs, and one large supplier - Bulb - is in special administration. ""Ofgem has proved incompetent as the regulatory authority of the energy retail market over the last decade,"" the report said. ""It allowed suppliers to enter the market without ensuring they had access to sufficient capital, acceptable business plans, and were run by individuals with relevant expertise."" A spokesman for Ofgem said the regulator had been ""clear and transparent"" that suppliers and its own regime had not been robust enough. ""No regulator can, or should, guarantee companies will not fail in a competitive market but we are working hard to reform the entire market, as well as closely scrutinising and holding individual energy suppliers to account, to further strengthen the regulatory regime,"" he said. The committee also questioned the future of the price cap, which sets a limit on the cost of each unit of energy and the standing charge for domestic customers in England, Wales and Scotland. It said the government should consider a social tariff instead for the most vulnerable, and then a relative tariff for everyone else. Social tariffs were phased out by suppliers about a decade ago. Prepayment meter customers, who pay for their energy in advance, have a different - slightly more expensive - price cap. Citizens Advice has warned that the number of people seeking help because they cannot afford to top up their meter has reached a new record. This is known as self-disconnections and the committee said that Ofgem and suppliers should identify those at risk and allow them to pay for energy after they have used it. The MPs also called for an ""urgent, far-reaching, and long-term"" insulation programme for UK homes. How can better insulation cut energy bills? ""Ultimately, the UK needs to reduce its dependence on imported gas. Energy efficiency is the quickest and most cost-effective way to reduce gas demand and lower energy bills,"" the report said. The Ofgem spokesman said: ""We are also working with all parts of government and industry on the long-term solution to the energy crisis by moving us away from imports of expensive gas towards a more secure, reliable, home-grown energy system.""

"Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000?","Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

Boutique owner wins trademark row with Zara,"Amber Kotrri said winning the battle against Zara was a ""genuine weight off my shoulders"" The owner of a small boutique says she is ""over the moon"" after winning a trademark battle with High Street fashion giant Zara. Amber Kotrri, who runs Darlington-based House of Zana, had been told by the retailer her businesswas ""conceptually identical"". Zara had argued there was a ""high degree of visual and aural similarities"" between the two brands. But a tribunal found the link was ""too insubstantial"". Mum-of-three Mrs Kotrri says dealing with lawyers has cost her time with her children She said the judgement was a ""genuine weight off my shoulders"". ""It's been well over a year and very stressful on my home life, as a mum of three young children, as well as on the business as there's been hours and hours of preparing documents of evidence,"" she said. ""My daughter's due date coincided with the time the last evidence was due so it hasn't been easy."" Mrs Kotrri said she had received an email informing her of the tribunal's decision while on a visit to the theatre with her three children - but took several days to build up the courage to open it. ""It was quite a long document and I couldn't really understand a lot of it as I had butterflies,"" she said. However, she said she saw the words ""the opposition is unsuccessful"" and was relieved she would be able to continue growing the business. ""It's been so stressful - but we won,"" she added. Inditex is one of the world's largest fashion retailers, with seven brands, including Zara In May Mrs Kotrri, who represented herself at the tribunal, told the hearing there was ""no likelihood"" of confusing the brands. Zara had argued the House of Zana trademark application should be refused because it was too similar in name, which could result in customers confusing one trademark for another. Julia King, representing Zara, said the name Zana was ""one small brush mark"" away from her client's, adding the County Durham-based brand was ""not distinctive and only descriptive"". She said it could pose a""serious threat"" to Zaraif the market was crowded with brands that looked and sounded similar. However, tribunal registrar Matthew Williams ruled he was satisfied any ""mental link"" made by customers between House of Zana and Zara would be ""too insubstantial and fleeting"" to result in an ""exploitation"" of Zara's reputation. He said the two brands were ""visually and aurally similar to a degree between low and medium"". Mrs Kotrri, whose husband is Albanian, set up and named her company in 2019 after the Balkan country's word for ""fairies"". She said she was contacted by Zara's lawyers last year after trying to trademark her brand. Mrs Kotrri said she had also been in contact with more than 10 other small business owners who had been contacted by the fashion company asking them to rebrand because of similarities with their names. Mrs Kotrri, who represented herself throughout the tribunal, said she hoped its outcome would empower others She has previously accused Zara of""very intimidating"" conductin its dealings with her. Mrs Kotrri said: ""To anyone in a similar position I would say, 'keep fighting it'll be worth it in the end - be brave and ignore the threatening way the legal letters are worded'. ""You know your business the most, you know the meaning behind any name, and if you've built it up then fight for it,  I couldn't tell my children that I closed down my business because someone bigger told me to."" Inditex, the parent company of Zara - is one of the world's largest fashion distribution groups with 6,477 stores, including Bershka, Pull & Bear and Massimo Dutti. A Zara spokesperson said while they did not want to comment on the judgement itself, the company ""continue to wish"" Mrs Kotrri and her business ""success in the future"".

Full extent of NHS dentist shortage revealed,"Nine in 10 NHS dental practices across the UK are not accepting new adult patients for treatment under the health service, a BBC investigation has found. In a third of the UK's more than 200 council areas, we found no dentists taking on adult NHS patients. And eight in 10 NHS practices are not taking on children. The Department of Health said it had made an extra Â£50m available ""to help bust the Covid backlogs"" and that improving NHS access was a priority. Patients in pain amid struggle to find dental care Are cut-price reality TV teeth worth it? BBC News contacted nearly 7,000 NHS practices - believed to be almost all those offering general treatment to the public. The British Dental Association (BDA) called it ""the most comprehensive and granular assessment of patient access in the history of the service"". While NHS dental treatment is not free for most adults, it is subsidised. The BBC heard from people across the UK who could not afford private fees and said the subsidised rates were crucial to getting care. The lack of NHS appointments has led people to drive hundreds of miles in search of treatment, pull out their own teeth without anaesthesia, resort to making their own improvised dentures and restrict their long-term diets to little more than soup. Disappearing Dentists Some people are going to extraordinary measure to do DIY dentistry as they struggle to find affordable dental care. Are we witnessing the death of NHS dentistry? Watch now on BBC iPlayer The investigation also found: The problem was worst in thesouth-west of England,Yorkshire and the Humberand theNorth West, where 98% of practices were not accepting new adult NHS patients Access was best inLondon, where almost a quarter of practices were taking on new adult NHS patients One in 10 local authorities did not have any practices taking on under-16s for NHS treatment, despite children in full-time education being entitled to completely free care on the health service About 200 practices said they would take on a child under the NHS only if a parent signed up as a private patient Not only did we find that in many places routine dental care was difficult to access quickly, most practices did not even have waiting lists. For those that did, the majority told us the waiting time was a year or longer, or were unable to say how long people might have to wait. One practice inNorfolktold the BBC it had more than 1,700 people on its list, while another, inCornwall, warned that it would take five years to be taken on as a patient. The British Dental Association, which represents high-street NHS dentists in the UK, said NHS dentistry was at a ""tipping point"" after a decade of under-investment. Caroline Young, fromBlackpool, had crowns fitted to her damaged teeth by an NHS dentist, but when her practice stopped treating patients on the health service four years ago, she was unable to find a new one. Almost every week she goes through the dentists in the phonebook to ask whether they are taking on new patients. This video can not be played Watch: Caroline Young makes her own dentures ""I've even called dental practices as far as 20 miles away, in Preston. I've re-called all my local ones many times. I can't even get on a waiting list,"" she said. Ms Young's crowns gradually fell out and she has now resorted to improvised solutions involving a form of plastic, which she found on social media. ""It was supposed to be temporary, but my temporary became twice a week,"" said Ms Young. Dentists warn that these homemade dentures are not only a dangerous choking hazard, but also food traps that can lead to worse tooth decay and gum damage. ""There are times when I've tried to fit it, and it's not worked, and I'll sit in floods of tears because I can't go out,"" she says. ""It's demoralising. I shouldn't feel that this holds me back, but it does. If I could afford private dentistry, I'd be there tomorrow."" Read more here. Scotlandhad significantly better access to NHS dentistry for adults than the other UK nations, with 18% of practices taking on new health-service patients. Wales,EnglandandNorthern Irelandhad broadly similar rates of access, at 7%, 9% and 10% respectively. Among the areas where BBC News researchers could not find a single practice accepting new adult patients wereLancashire,Norfolk,DevonandLeeds. Your device may not support this visualisation Most of the UK's NHS dentists are independent businesses and are not employed by the health service directly. If they fail to fulfil their NHS contract, the money that they have been paid is taken back. NHS England said it had recently made changes to the dentistry contract and would ""support practices to improve access, including giving high-performing practices the opportunity to increase their activity and treat more patients"". It said discussions on further changes were ""still ongoing"". The Welsh government also said it was working on reforming the dental system to improve access and quality of dental care. Wales announced in July thatmost adults would be offered dental check-ups once a yearinstead of every six months. Meanwhile, the Scottish government said more than 95% of the population of Scotland were registered with an NHS dentist and it was ""in a position of relative strength in terms of workforce numbers and capacity"". All the devolved governments pointed out that the coronavirus pandemic had affected the availability of NHS dental care. Northern Ireland's Department of Health said it was ""inevitable that access levels are not as favourable today as they were before Covid"". ""Patients who are currently not registered with a health-service dentist, and wish to become registered may unfortunately have to contact multiple practices and consider travelling further than normal,"" it added. Access to NHS dentistry has been a problem ever since the health service was created. Free treatment ended in 1951, just three years after the NHS was formed, because it was deemed unaffordable. Ever since, a subsidised system - where some patients pay towards the cost - has been in place. Alongside this, a strong private market has developed. An estimated one in seven adults relies on it. It leaves dentists with a real choice about how much NHS work they do. Over recent years NHS access has been getting harder. The current NHS contract in England and Wales, which dates back to 2006, is unpopular with dentists, who feel unrewarded for the work they do. Austerity also squeezed budgets and then the pandemic hit, creating a backlog of patients with worsening oral health. This combination of factors appears to have prompted more dentists to walk away - the numbers doing NHS work dropped by 10% last year. It's fair to say the difficulties patients are facing are unprecedented. The dentists' union blamed the current NHS contract for the lack of accessible dental care. ""There doesn't appear to be a commitment, really, from the Treasury to actually invest in [dentistry],"" said BDA chairman Eddie Crouch. ""Patients are having teeth removed because it's a cheaper option than actually saving the teeth. The whole system is set up for health inequalities, and that significantly needs to change. ""Many of my colleagues do not see enough emphasis on improving the situation in the short term."" Save my tooth or heat my house - carer Dentistry cash 'a drop in the ocean', MP says Paul Woodhouse, dentist and BDA board member, told BBC Breakfast emergency appointments at his practice were filled within five minutes of being open. He said the government was only providing 50% of the funding the UK needed to care for every patient, meaning half of the population were being left without an NHS dentist. ""If you said that about GPs or cancer screening, there would be riots on the street,"" he said. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of health think-tank the Nuffield Trust, said NHS dentistry was ""on life-support"" in some areas of the country. But he added: ""I think it's premature to say we're witnessing the death of it. ""There doesn't seem to be any real appetite for the sort of big structural and investment decisions that are required to fix NHS dentistry."" BBC researchers aimed to contact every dental practice with an NHS contract in the four nations to ask whether they were taking on new patients. Using lists from NHS organisations, we identified 8,523 dental practices across the UK that were believed to hold NHS contracts and tried to call them all during May, June and July. We then narrowed down this list, excluding practices that were not contactable by telephone or were permanently closed were not available to the public for general and routine dental treatment, including hospitals weren't an NHS practice We were left with a list of 6,880 practices. For our analysis, we looked at the distribution of the practices across the UK's 217 upper-tier local authorities. We classified a practice as accepting new child NHS patients if they would take on those under the age of 16. A practice that required a referral to take on a patient was not treated as accepting new NHS patients, since a referral requires an initial appointment with a dentist, which is a barrier to entry.

LiveLiveRussia using nuclear plant like a shield - Ukrainian energy head4 minutes ago,"Russia is accused of using Europe's largest nuclear power plant as a military base, launching attacks against Ukraine Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company, says Russia is using the plant in Zaporizhzhia ""like a shield"" Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the plant, in the south-east of Ukraine, over the weekend UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has called for inspectors to be given access to the site, saying to attack it is a ""suicidal thingâ The fighting there has prompted the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of ""the very real risk of a nuclear disaster"" Meanwhile, two more ships loaded with grain have set sail from Ukraine's Black Sea ports as part of a deal reached with Russia Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Chris Giles We're now wrapping up our coverage of the war in Ukraine for the day, here's a round-up of today's main headlines:  Thank you for joining us. Today's writers were Jack Burgess, Catherine Evans, Anna Boyd, Krystyna Gajda, Malu Cursino, James Harness and Sam Hancock. And our editors were James Clarke, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jeremy Gahagan and Chris Giles. An expert from Imperial College, London, has been giving some reassurance
about the danger of a nuclear accident at the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. Dr Mark Wenman  says it is ""a relatively modern and robust reactor design,"" unlike the reactor in Chernobyl, where an explosion and fire in 1986 threw clouds of
radioactive material over the surrounding area. ""I do not believe there would be a high probability of a breach of the
containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell
and even less likely, the reactor itself could be damaged by such,"" he said. â""This
means the radioactive material is well protected.â"" ""Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would
be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear
release is still small."" Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine The US is to give Ukraine a further $4.5bn (Â£3.7bn). That'll bring its total budgetary support, since Russia launched its invasion back in February, to $8.5bn (Â£7bn). The package includes $1bn for weapons - including munitions for long-range weapons and armored medical
transport vehicles, according to acting Pentagon spokesman Todd Breasseale. The World Bank estimates that 55% of Ukrainians will be living in poverty by the end of 2023 as a result of the war - compared with 2.5% at the start of this year. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) said the money will help Ukrainian government to maintain infrastructure such as schools and hospitals and to deliver humanitarian supplies. USAID added that robust safeguards had been put in place to make sure the money is  properly used.

A former leading officer in the UK's armed forces thinks Russia is going to âformally annexâ as much of the Donbas area of
Ukraine as it can on 11 September. General Sir Richard Barrons, Joint Forces Command from 2013-2016, tells the BBC's World at One programme that Ukraine will need âour will, our money, our industry, and our inventoryâ to help
take back its country. He says if Ukraine is successful,
it could end up pushing into territory that âRussia has declared is Russiaâ. And that could see Moscow âreaching
for... its small nuclear weaponsâ. He says this would involve âquite
smallâ nuclear weapons that would be dangerous within a

Now the Ukrainian representative to the agency, Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, condemned Russia's accusation that Ukraine shelled the nuclear power plant as a strategy of ""disinformation and propaganda"". Speaking in Vienna, Tsymbaliuk called the claim ""absolute nonsense"". Hugo BachegaReporting from Kyiv Tensions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have alarmed the world. For days, Ukrainian and Russian officials have blamed each other for attacking the site, although who has done what remains unclear. Itâs hard to independently confirm whatâs happening there. Russian forces captured the complex in early March, although Ukrainian technicians are still operating it. Itâs not clear why Russia would attack a site it already controls. Observers have said it could be a strategy to play on Western fears of a nuclear disaster, and degrade the military support for Ukraine. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company Enerhoatom, told me the workers are under pressure and in danger, and some had been captured, beaten and tortured. Again, these are allegations that canât be independently verified, but will certainly add to the concerns about the conditions at the plant. Kotin said the Russian plan was to eventually disconnect the plant from Ukraineâs grid and link it to the Russian system, a claim we canât verify. Calls are growing for Russia to allow international inspectors to visit the site. For now, though, the plant is safe, Kotin said. Civilians flee fighting on westbound trains from Donetsk The war in Ukraine has now been raging for more than five months. Here's a quick recap of where things stand and how we got here: What's the big picture? Russia invaded Ukraine in February, but failed in its advance on the capital Kyiv. By April it had pulled back to focus on gaining control of the whole eastern Donbas region, where separatists supported by Moscow have been fighting since 2014. The war has created a humanitarian crisis - the latest figures from UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, show that over 6.3 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. Ukraine is usually the world's fourth-largest grain exporter but disruption to harvests and shipping have caused steep price hikes - in Nigeria, for example, the cost of staples such as pasta and bread has increased by as much as 50%. Meanwhile, European gas prices are climbing as Russia restricts supplies. What's happening at Zaporizhzhia? Russia seized the nuclear plant, the biggest in Europe, in March but kept its Ukrainian employees. Ukraine said parts of the facility have been ""seriously damaged"" by Russian military strikes and accused them of ""blackmailing the entire world"". Russia has blamed Ukraine for the attacks. The UN's nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to any military action in its vicinity, warning of a ""very real risk of a nuclear disaster"". Latest fighting on the ground Ukraine says it is planning a counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied south of the country, and its forces have been shelling a key bridge in the city of Kherson. The Antonivskyi crossing is one of only two points where Russian troops can gain access to territory they have occupied west of the Dnipro river. In the north-eastern city of  Kharkiv, it's reported that one person's been killed and another injured in a Russian rocket attack. We've been reporting on the situation in Zaporizhzhia, where Ukraine and Russia have both accused each other of shelling the city's nuclear site. Now let's hear from a Ukrainian nuclear watchdog official about why Russia may want to focus its efforts on the area. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, Ukraine's ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says Russian forces want to cause electricity
blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling the Zaporizhzhia
nuclear complex. He also calls for an international mission to
the plant this month. ""We will use all possible channels of diplomacy to bring the
IAEA and UN closer to conducting this mission,"" Tsymbaliuk tells reporters in Vienna, insisting the visit must happen ""no later than the end of this month"". Svyatoslav KhomenkoBBC World Service, Kyiv One of Ukraineâs most influential presidential advisers, Mykhailo Podolyak, tells the BBC there are effectively no channels of peace negotiations open between Kyiv and Moscow. âThere are only channels [of negotiations] about exhanging bodies and POWs,"" he says. ""Russia is a country for whom there is no humane approach to war or to treating civilians in occupied territories. Russia is a different civilisation. âAfter six months of this war, we canât continue believing that it will fulfil any agreements.â Podolyak has been by President Volodymyr Zelenskyâs side since the start of the full-scale invasion and is one of the key figures shaping Ukraineâs position. He says Kyiv will join negotiations with Russia when a realistic starting point is in sight, instead of what he described as a Russian ultimatum where Moscow intends to annex all occupied territories. Ukraineâs aim, says Podolyak, is restoring state borders as of March 2014, including Russia-annexed occupied Crimea. Otherwise, he says, there wonât be lasting peace. You may remember that, in the last few weeks, Turkey and the UN brokered a deal to allow shipments to leave Ukraine. The country's ports had been blocked since the start of the conflict, and a vessel called the Razoni became the first grain ship to set sail under the new agreement. The Razoni left Odesa on 1 August and had been bound for the Lebanese port of Tripoli, but over the weekend it ground to a halt and dropped anchor near southern Turkey. In a tweet, Ukraine's embassy in Beirut said,externalthe buyer of its grain cargo has refused to accept the delivery because of delays to the shipment. The buyer has not been named, but Ukraine's embassy said a new one is being sought and the ship might end up going to another country. Since the Razoni's departure, five other ships have left Ukraine. One of them, the Turkish-flagged ship Polarnet, has already arrived in the northern Turkish port of Derince and is expected to unload its cargo today.

Jack BurgessBBC News Live reporter More now from Prof Claire Corkhill - a nuclear material degradation expert who we've been speaking to, from the University of Sheffield. Another major risk at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia power plant is the possibility of a nuclear waste storage site getting hit by a missile, which ""could lead to a release of radioactivity"", Corkhill says. She says the consequences of this wouldn't be as wide-reaching and severe asa loss of coolant accident, but it could still be extremely dangerous. ""All it takes is for one missile to hit the wrong area and then it's serious,"" Corkhill says. Since Russia seized the plant - the largest in Europe - in March, its Ukrainian employees have been kept there to work. There have been concernsstress could impact the workers' ability to safely carry out their duties at the nuclear site. It's not the type of environment you want to be working under duress"" Prof Claire Corkhill Ukraine and Russia have both accused each other of shelling the plant over the weekend -Ukraine has said attacks damaged three radiation sensorsand left a worker injured, leading to a reactor needing to be disconnected from the system. Corkhill says although it's a ""precarious situation"" it gives her confidence workers at the plant were able to take actions ""in a safe way to stop a serious accident"". Hugo BachegaReporting from Kyiv The head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company Enerhoatom has accused Russian soldiers of turning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into a military base, using it to launch attacks against Ukrainian positions. Petro Kotin tells me the threat to the plant is great, but the site remains safe. ""They [Russian forces] use it [the power plant] like a shield against the Ukrainian forces, because nobody from Ukraine is going to make something. ""The Ukrainian Armed Forces know that these are Ukrainian personnel and this is a Ukrainian plant and there are Ukrainian people [there] so we are not going to kill our people, our staff and damage our infrastructure."" He says 500 Russian soldiers are at the complex, and Russia has positioned rocket launchers in the area of the plant. For days, Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the site. Ukraine says two workers have been wounded, and three radiation sensors damaged. The complex has been under Russian occupation since early March, but Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Since Russia began its attacks on Ukraine in February, we've seen images of destruction and hardship throughout the country. Five months later, life for its citizens contrasts significantly from region to region. Here are some recent photos showing how life varies around the country. Life is hard in the eastern city Sloviansk, north of Donetsk - residents fill up canisters with clean water on Saturday In neighbouring Kramatorsk, an elderly woman is among civilians evacuating by bus, hoping to find safety away from the eastern region - they are embarking on a long trip to Germany The evacuation of citizens from Donetsk region continues - Sanya is on a train with her two children and her mother Lumelia, heading towards Dnipro Shoppers in a Kharviv supermarket on Sunday are met with the sight of an armed Ukrainian soldier pushing a trolley while he stocks up on supplies Meanwhile, in the capital Kyiv, life is returning to some normality - opera lovers watch Giuseppe Verdi's opera Rigoletto at the National Opera of Ukraine, on Saturday Sunbathers in the eastern port of Chornomorsk watch the cargo ship Fulmar S arrive at the port on Sunday - it is one of the ships that will transport grain, now exports have resumed The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region has signed a decree that will enable a referendum to take place for the region to join the Russian Federation, RIA Novosti news agency reports. Southern Zaporizhzhia is under Russian control and it is the focus of this next stage of the war as Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant suffers heavy shelling. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the plant, which has prompted warnings of a ""nuclear disaster"" from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Jack BurgessBBC News Live reporter We've been speaking to Prof Claire Corkhill - a nuclear material degradation expert at the University of Sheffield. She says the more missiles fired and mines planted around Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the higher the risk of ""very serious consequences that would spread radiation"". Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the plant over the weekend. The plant was seized by the Russians early in the war - in March - but kept its Ukrainian employees. Corkhill calls it a ""very high risk situation"", and says her biggest concern is if a missile were to hit critical infrastructure. She says if this happened there would be a chance the water continually pumping around the nuclear reactor's core wouldn't be able to cool it down any more. The very worst case scenario is a loss of coolant accident - precisely what happened at Fukushima"" Prof Claire Corkhill This could lead to a meltdown and a series of hydrogen explosions that could release radiation over many kilometres, Corkhill says, adding ""this almost happened backin March this year"". However, she says the likelihood of a serious accident is unclear and says the
reactors themselves are heavily reinforced - so should be able to withstand a
direct hit. Read about the incident at Fukushimahere. Ukraine is usually the world's fourth-largest grain exporter. It normally produces 42% of the world's sunflower oil, 16% of its maize and 9% of its wheat. Wheat exports from Russia - the world's largest exporter - are also down. Western sanctions do not target Russian agriculture, but the Kremlin argues they have hindered exports by hiking insurance rates and affecting payments. Ships have begun to
leave Ukraine carrying grain in recent days, following a deal between the two nations brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. The first ship to do so left the port of Odesa carrying 26,000 tonnes of corn, bound for Lebanon, becoming the first cargo ship to have been able to leave the nation since February, when Russia began its naval blockade in the Black Sea.

"UK set for new heatwave as temperatures head to 35CHot conditions will not hit the 40.3C reached last month but could last longer, forecasters say.UK","An aerial view of the parched lawns of Leeds Castle in Kent The UK is set for another heatwave this week with highs of up to 35C (95F) in some parts, forecasters have said. The Met Office said while conditions would be belowthe 40.3C recorded last month, the hot weather could last for a longer period. More parts of England are also facing hosepipe bans amid very dry conditions, as fire crews warn of wildfires. Heat health-alerts have been put in place across England by the UK Health Security Agency. A level three warning will cover southern and central England from midday on Tuesday until 18:00 BST on Saturday, with a level two alert in place for northern England for the same period. Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said a ""fairly widespread heatwave"" was developing across the UK this week with the peak of the temperatures likely to be on Friday or Saturday. ""It does look like a prolonged period of dry weather and obviously that's bad news for southern England where some rain would really be useful now,"" he said. Temperatures will build from 28C or 29C on Tuesday and reach the low to mid-30s from Thursday, Mr Morgan said. He said the West Midlands and West Country could see the highest temperatures with a maximum of around 35C, but this is uncertain. A heatwave is defined as above average temperatures seen for three days or more. Is the UK getting hotter? How to keep pets safe as temperatures rise Six ways to keep your home cool What does hot weather do to the body? England had itsdriest July since 1935, said the Met Office. For some parts - south-east and central southern England - last month was the driest since records began in 1836. There have also been calls for more hosepipe bans to be brought in ,including from Environment Secretary George Eustice. Southern Water already has in place a hosepipe ban for customers in Hampshire and on the Isle of Wight, and from Friday South East Water will do the same in Kent and Sussex. A ban has also been in place in the Isle of Man since 29 July, where customers could face a Â£2,000 fine if they break the rules. Welsh Water will bring in a ban for Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire later this month. In France, the government has set up a crisis team to tackle a drought that has leftmore than 100 municipalities short of drinking water. Will there be a hosepipe ban in my area? Last month's record temperatures saw a series of wildfires across the country and Riccardo la Torre, from the Fire Brigades Union, described them as ""brutal"". ""They burn at extremely high temperatures, they spread faster than firefighters can move and they are very labour intensive,"" he said. He said fire services were under strain and claimed the reason blazes ""spread with regularity is because we do not have resources to get there quickly enough"". The government said spending for fire services had been increased by around Â£141m to Â£1.37bn over the last six years, ""demonstrating our commitment to ensuring fire services have the resources they need"". Essex County Fire and Rescue Service has urged people not to light bonfires or barbecues, or let off fireworks or sky lanterns, after a large blaze which damaged gardens, sheds and trees was started by a chiminea. Mark Hardingham, chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council said: ""I have not seen a distinction between the two heatwaves - it has remained hot between then and now and equally there's been no rainfall."" He said crews were expecting the busiest time of day to be between 13:00 and 19:00 BST every day and said fire chiefs would aim to maximise on-call firefighters in rural areas to help cope with demand. A combine harvester and the surrounding field caught fire in Gloucestershire on Monday, following a weekend of fires in the West which sawthousands of square metres of farmland destroyed. Fire destroys acres of corn in farmland M&S stops selling disposable barbecues across UK Sir John Armitt, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) said water companies who have not called for a hosepipe ban ""will be keeping it under constant review"". ""The advantage of doing it [a hosepipe ban] right now would be that it relieves pressure on their rivers,"" he said. Speaking on the BBC's The World at One programme he said there were simple steps people could take to help such as ""reducing the number of minutes we spend in the shower"". He said there was no doubt climate change was affecting our infrastructure and said water was something we took for granted. The National Farmers Union warned the heatwave was compounding problems already caused by months of dry weather - grass not growing and irrigation water running out are two. Deputy president Tom Bradshaw told the BBC: ""The biggest concern is always animal health and welfare and trying to make sure the animals are well looked after. ""There's also an impact on crops, particularly some vegetable crops - once they get over the mid-20s in temperature they stop growing"". Keith Stones, who farms in Swaledale, North Yorkshire, has been struggling to find grass to feed his livestock. He told the BBC: ""The ewes producing the milk for the lambs are thin because they're not picking up enough nutrition from the forage. ""The lambs are becoming pot-bellied and thin because they're not getting nutrition from the grass or from the milk because the mums aren't supplying."" The dry weather has also caused staff at Kew Gardens, in south-west London, to prioritise which plants that have high conservation value, historic importance or which are extinct in the wild. Director of gardens Richard Barley said this included not irrigating wider lawns and natural habitats. The heat-health alerts, which are designed to help healthcare professionals manage periods of extreme temperatures, mean care homes will be monitoring residents closely. David Lewis, manager of Cwmbran House Care Home in Cwmbran, Wales, said they were encouraging drinking as ""much as possible"" and offering ice creams and lollies if residents get warm. ""We're ventilating the rooms and have got fans in the lounges"", he said. Additional reporting by Charley Adams.

LiveLiveRussia using nuclear plant like a shield - Ukrainian energy headLess than a minute ago,"Russia is accused of using Europe's largest nuclear power plant as a military base, launching attacks against Ukraine Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company, says Russia is using the plant in Zaporizhzhia ""like a shield"" Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the plant, in the south-east of Ukraine, over the weekend UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has called for inspectors to be given access to the site, saying to attack it is a ""suicidal thingâ The fighting there has prompted the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of ""the very real risk of a nuclear disaster"" Meanwhile, two more ships loaded with grain have set sail from Ukraine's Black Sea ports as part of a deal reached with Russia Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Chris Giles We're now wrapping up our coverage of the war in Ukraine for the day, here's a round-up of today's main headlines:  Thank you for joining us. Today's writers were Jack Burgess, Catherine Evans, Anna Boyd, Krystyna Gajda, Malu Cursino, James Harness and Sam Hancock. And our editors were James Clarke, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jeremy Gahagan and Chris Giles. An expert from Imperial College, London, has been giving some reassurance
about the danger of a nuclear accident at the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. Dr Mark Wenman  says it is ""a relatively modern and robust reactor design,"" unlike the reactor in Chernobyl, where an explosion and fire in 1986 threw clouds of
radioactive material over the surrounding area. ""I do not believe there would be a high probability of a breach of the
containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell
and even less likely, the reactor itself could be damaged by such,"" he said. â""This
means the radioactive material is well protected.â"" ""Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would
be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear
release is still small."" Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine The US is to give Ukraine a further $4.5bn (Â£3.7bn). That'll bring its total budgetary support, since Russia launched its invasion back in February, to $8.5bn (Â£7bn). The package includes $1bn for weapons - including munitions for long-range weapons and armored medical
transport vehicles, according to acting Pentagon spokesman Todd Breasseale. The World Bank estimates that 55% of Ukrainians will be living in poverty by the end of 2023 as a result of the war - compared with 2.5% at the start of this year. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) said the money will help Ukrainian government to maintain infrastructure such as schools and hospitals and to deliver humanitarian supplies. USAID added that robust safeguards had been put in place to make sure the money is  properly used.

A former leading officer in the UK's armed forces thinks Russia is going to âformally annexâ as much of the Donbas area of
Ukraine as it can on 11 September. General Sir Richard Barrons, Joint Forces Command from 2013-2016, tells the BBC's World at One programme that Ukraine will need âour will, our money, our industry, and our inventoryâ to help
take back its country. He says if Ukraine is successful,
it could end up pushing into territory that âRussia has declared is Russiaâ. And that could see Moscow âreaching
for... its small nuclear weaponsâ. He says this would involve âquite
smallâ nuclear weapons that would be dangerous within a
two mile radius but would not âprovoke

There have been concernsstress could impact the workers' ability to safely carry out their duties at the nuclear site. It's not the type of environment you want to be working under duress"" Prof Claire Corkhill Ukraine and Russia have both accused each other of shelling the plant over the weekend -Ukraine has said attacks damaged three radiation sensorsand left a worker injured, leading to a reactor needing to be disconnected from the system. Corkhill says although it's a ""precarious situation"" it gives her confidence workers at the plant were able to take actions ""in a safe way to stop a serious accident"". Hugo BachegaReporting from Kyiv The head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company Enerhoatom has accused Russian soldiers of turning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into a military base, using it to launch attacks against Ukrainian positions. Petro Kotin tells me the threat to the plant is great, but the site remains safe. ""They [Russian forces] use it [the power plant] like a shield against the Ukrainian forces, because nobody from Ukraine is going to make something. ""The Ukrainian Armed Forces know that these are Ukrainian personnel and this is a Ukrainian plant and there are Ukrainian people [there] so we are not going to kill our people, our staff and damage our infrastructure."" He says 500 Russian soldiers are at the complex, and Russia has positioned rocket launchers in the area of the plant. For days, Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the site. Ukraine says two workers have been wounded, and three radiation sensors damaged. The complex has been under Russian occupation since early March, but Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Since Russia began its attacks on Ukraine in February, we've seen images of destruction and hardship throughout the country. Five months later, life for its citizens contrasts significantly from region to region. Here are some recent photos showing how life varies around the country. Life is hard in the eastern city Sloviansk, north of Donetsk - residents fill up canisters with clean water on Saturday In neighbouring Kramatorsk, an elderly woman is among civilians evacuating by bus, hoping to find safety away from the eastern region - they are embarking on a long trip to Germany The evacuation of citizens from Donetsk region continues - Sanya is on a train with her two children and her mother Lumelia, heading towards Dnipro Shoppers in a Kharviv supermarket on Sunday are met with the sight of an armed Ukrainian soldier pushing a trolley while he stocks up on supplies Meanwhile, in the capital Kyiv, life is returning to some normality - opera lovers watch Giuseppe Verdi's opera Rigoletto at the National Opera of Ukraine, on Saturday Sunbathers in the eastern port of Chornomorsk watch the cargo ship Fulmar S arrive at the port on Sunday - it is one of the ships that will transport grain, now exports have resumed The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region has signed a decree that will enable a referendum to take place for the region to join the Russian Federation, RIA Novosti news agency reports. Southern Zaporizhzhia is under Russian control and it is the focus of this next stage of the war as Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant suffers heavy shelling. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the plant, which has prompted warnings of a ""nuclear disaster"" from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Jack BurgessBBC News Live reporter We've been speaking to Prof Claire Corkhill - a nuclear material degradation expert at the University of Sheffield. She says the more missiles fired and mines planted around Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the higher the risk of ""very serious consequences that would spread radiation"". Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the plant over the weekend. The plant was seized by the Russians early in the war - in March - but kept its Ukrainian employees. Corkhill calls it a ""very high risk situation"", and says her biggest concern is if a missile were to hit critical infrastructure. She says if this happened there would be a chance the water continually pumping around the nuclear reactor's core wouldn't be able to cool it down any more. The very worst case scenario is a loss of coolant accident - precisely what happened at Fukushima"" Prof Claire Corkhill This could lead to a meltdown and a series of hydrogen explosions that could release radiation over many kilometres, Corkhill says, adding ""this almost happened backin March this year"". However, she says the likelihood of a serious accident is unclear and says the
reactors themselves are heavily reinforced - so should be able to withstand a
direct hit. Read about the incident at Fukushimahere. Ukraine is usually the world's fourth-largest grain exporter. It normally produces 42% of the world's sunflower oil, 16% of its maize and 9% of its wheat. Wheat exports from Russia - the world's largest exporter - are also down. Western sanctions do not target Russian agriculture, but the Kremlin argues they have hindered exports by hiking insurance rates and affecting payments. Ships have begun to
leave Ukraine carrying grain in recent days, following a deal between the two nations brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. The first ship to do so left the port of Odesa carrying 26,000 tonnes of corn, bound for Lebanon, becoming the first cargo ship to have been able to leave the nation since February, when Russia began its naval blockade in the Black Sea.

"UK set for new heatwave as temperatures head to 35CHot conditions will not hit the 40.3C reached last month but could last longer, forecasters say.","An aerial view of the parched lawns of Leeds Castle in Kent The UK is set for another heatwave this week with highs of up to 35C (95F) in some parts, forecasters have said. The Met Office said while conditions would be belowthe 40.3C recorded last month, the hot weather could last for a longer period. More parts of England are also facing hosepipe bans amid very dry conditions, as fire crews warn of wildfires. Heat health-alerts have been put in place across England by the UK Health Security Agency. A level three warning will cover southern and central England from midday on Tuesday until 18:00 BST on Saturday, with a level two alert in place for northern England for the same period. Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said a ""fairly widespread heatwave"" was developing across the UK this week with the peak of the temperatures likely to be on Friday or Saturday. ""It does look like a prolonged period of dry weather and obviously that's bad news for southern England where some rain would really be useful now,"" he said. Temperatures will build from 28C or 29C on Tuesday and reach the low to mid-30s from Thursday, Mr Morgan said. He said the West Midlands and West Country could see the highest temperatures with a maximum of around 35C, but this is uncertain. A heatwave is defined as above average temperatures seen for three days or more. Is the UK getting hotter? How to keep pets safe as temperatures rise Six ways to keep your home cool What does hot weather do to the body? England had itsdriest July since 1935, said the Met Office. For some parts - south-east and central southern England - last month was the driest since records began in 1836. There have also been calls for more hosepipe bans to be brought in ,including from Environment Secretary George Eustice. Southern Water already has in place a hosepipe ban for customers in Hampshire and on the Isle of Wight, and from Friday South East Water will do the same in Kent and Sussex. A ban has also been in place in the Isle of Man since 29 July, where customers could face a Â£2,000 fine if they break the rules. Welsh Water will bring in a ban for Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire later this month. In France, the government has set up a crisis team to tackle a drought that has leftmore than 100 municipalities short of drinking water. Will there be a hosepipe ban in my area? Last month's record temperatures saw a series of wildfires across the country and Riccardo la Torre, from the Fire Brigades Union, described them as ""brutal"". ""They burn at extremely high temperatures, they spread faster than firefighters can move and they are very labour intensive,"" he said. He said fire services were under strain and claimed the reason blazes ""spread with regularity is because we do not have resources to get there quickly enough"". The government said spending for fire services had been increased by around Â£141m to Â£1.37bn over the last six years, ""demonstrating our commitment to ensuring fire services have the resources they need"". Essex County Fire and Rescue Service has urged people not to light bonfires or barbecues, or let off fireworks or sky lanterns, after a large blaze which damaged gardens, sheds and trees was started by a chiminea. Mark Hardingham, chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council said: ""I have not seen a distinction between the two heatwaves - it has remained hot between then and now and equally there's been no rainfall."" He said crews were expecting the busiest time of day to be between 13:00 and 19:00 BST every day and said fire chiefs would aim to maximise on-call firefighters in rural areas to help cope with demand. A combine harvester and the surrounding field caught fire in Gloucestershire on Monday, following a weekend of fires in the West which sawthousands of square metres of farmland destroyed. Fire destroys acres of corn in farmland M&S stops selling disposable barbecues across UK Sir John Armitt, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) said water companies who have not called for a hosepipe ban ""will be keeping it under constant review"". ""The advantage of doing it [a hosepipe ban] right now would be that it relieves pressure on their rivers,"" he said. Speaking on the BBC's The World at One programme he said there were simple steps people could take to help such as ""reducing the number of minutes we spend in the shower"". He said there was no doubt climate change was affecting our infrastructure and said water was something we took for granted. The National Farmers Union warned the heatwave was compounding problems already caused by months of dry weather - grass not growing and irrigation water running out are two. Deputy president Tom Bradshaw told the BBC: ""The biggest concern is always animal health and welfare and trying to make sure the animals are well looked after. ""There's also an impact on crops, particularly some vegetable crops - once they get over the mid-20s in temperature they stop growing"". Keith Stones, who farms in Swaledale, North Yorkshire, has been struggling to find grass to feed his livestock. He told the BBC: ""The ewes producing the milk for the lambs are thin because they're not picking up enough nutrition from the forage. ""The lambs are becoming pot-bellied and thin because they're not getting nutrition from the grass or from the milk because the mums aren't supplying."" The dry weather has also caused staff at Kew Gardens, in south-west London, to prioritise which plants that have high conservation value, historic importance or which are extinct in the wild. Director of gardens Richard Barley said this included not irrigating wider lawns and natural habitats. The heat-health alerts, which are designed to help healthcare professionals manage periods of extreme temperatures, mean care homes will be monitoring residents closely. David Lewis, manager of Cwmbran House Care Home in Cwmbran, Wales, said they were encouraging drinking as ""much as possible"" and offering ice creams and lollies if residents get warm. ""We're ventilating the rooms and have got fans in the lounges"", he said. Additional reporting by Charley Adams.

No 10 rules out immediate cost of living action,"Boris Johnson has no plans to introduce big tax and spending measures before he leaves office to ease the cost-of-living crisis, Downing Street has said. Business group leader Tony Danker has urged ministers to ""grip the emerging crisis"", arguing it ""made no sense to wait"" for the next PM to arrive. And Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, has called for an urgent meeting with the devolved governments. Downing Street said it recognised the public were facing ""challenging times"". However, Mr Johnson's spokesman argued it would be up to his successor to make any decisions on further help. Mr Johnson is due to leave office in early September, and No 10 said ""by convention it is not for this prime minister to make major fiscal interventions during this period"". Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse said the government had already and was continuing to do work on cost-of-living problems. Cost of living crisis focus for Tory leader contest What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? ""My job is to make sure that when the new prime minister arrives, the plan is in place for them to put their foot on the accelerator,"" he told the BBC's PM programme. He also dismissed calls from ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown for the government to hold a meeting of the government's emergency response committee Cobra, arguing that would be ""a performative political act"". Earlier this year,the government announceda Â£15bn package of support to ease the cost-of-living crisis. This included giving households a Â£400 discount on energy bills and Â£650 for the poorest households to help with wider living costs. However, the government has come under pressure to do more, following worsening economic warnings. Last week, the Bank of England forecast that the UK was heading into a recession, with inflation set to hit 13%. Meanwhile, the energy price cap will go up in October, withindustry analysts estimatingaverage domestic energy bills could hit more than Â£3,600 a year. Mr Danker, head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI),said,externalthe prime minister and the candidates for the Tory leadership, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, ""should come together to agree a common pledge to support people and help quell fears"". The Conservative leadership race is taking place amid grim economic forecasts ""The economic situation people and businesses are facing requires all hands to the pump this summer,"" he said. ""We simply cannot afford a summer of government inactivity while the leadership contest plays out followed by a slow start from a new prime minister and cabinet."" And on Tuesday morning he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the prime minister and the Tory leadership candidates should ""agree on the principles"" of support for energy bills. He said civil servants should be ""working with the candidates now"" to draw up options for helping vulnerable people as soon as one of them took office. ""I just don't think it's responsible government for a prime minister or future prime ministers not to give the country reassurance,"" Mr Danker said. The CBI - which represents British businesses - said the prime minister should direct the civil service to draw up options on helping the most vulnerable people - and that these options should be made available to both leadership candidates. The organisation also said Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak and Ms Truss should agree ""a way forward to support people and businesses with energy bills"" ahead of 26 August, when Ofgem is due to announce the next energy price cap. Elsewhere, Ms Sturgeon has called for an emergency meeting with Mr Johnson and the leaders of devolved governments, to agree steps to help people. In a letter to the prime minister, she said the SNP-led government was ""committed to doing all we can"" but added: ""We cannot respond on the scale required without action by your government."" Writing in the Daily Record,,externalMr Brown - who was the Labour prime minister between 2007 and 2010 - said the UK faced ""a financial timebomb"" and urged Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak and Ms Truss to agree ""an immediate Budget to prevent a winter heating catastrophe"". Set budget before financial timebomb, says Brown 'Energy bills are bad now, but worse is to come' He also said the emergency committee Cobra should be in ""permanent session to deal with the coming fuel and energy crisis"". Speaking to the BBC's World This Weekend programme on Sunday, Mr Brown said there was ""a vacuum"" in government because ""the prime minister is on holiday, the chancellor is on holiday, the two leadership candidates for prime minister are on the campaign trail."" Boris Johnson is due to leave Downing Street in early September Asked if Mr Johnson - who has returned from a holiday in Slovenia - would summon a meeting of Cobra, No 10 said it would be up to Mr Johnson's successor to make any decisions on further support for households. The spokesman also said there were no plans to recall Parliament, but that Mr Johnson and his Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi are meeting this week to discuss progress on the support measures already announced. Responding to No 10's comments, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said ""people are worried sick about how they'll pay their bills... and all this Tory prime minister does is shrug his shoulders"". She said the two leadership candidates could only ""offer more of the same"", adding: ""Labour would start by scrapping tax breaks on oil and gas producers and providing more help to people who are struggling to pay their energy bills."" Meanwhile, the two MPs hoping to take over the leadership have beencriticisingeach other's plans to address mounting living costs. Mr Sunak has warned that the plans of his rival Ms Truss ""won't touch the sides"". Supporters of Ms Truss say her proposed tax cuts would help people, but did not rule out offering further support.

People turning back to cash as living costs soar,"People are going back to cash to keep tighter control on their spending as living costs soar, according to new research by the Post Office. Post offices handled Â£801m in personal cash withdrawals in July, the most since records began five years ago. That's up more than 20% from a year earlier. Natalie Ceeney, chair of the Cash Action Group, said it showed people are ""literally counting the pennies"" as they grapple with rising prices. ""It's absolutely because of the cost of living crisis,"" said Ms Ceeney, who chaired the government's independent Access to Cash review. ""People will be taking out cash and physically putting it into pots, saying 'this is what I have for bills, this is what I have for food, and this is what's left'."" How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Why are prices rising so quickly? Bank defends rate hike ahead of looming recession Prices are currently rising faster than they have for 40 years. The increase in the cost of living is putting a squeeze on people's finances, as incomes fail to keep up. In total, Â£3.32bn in cash was deposited and withdrawn at Post Office counters in July, Â£100m higher than in June. Personal cash withdrawals, at Â£801m, were up almost 8% month-on-month and up more than 20% year-on-year. It is the highest amount since records began five years ago, and only the second time that personal cash withdrawals have exceeded Â£800m. The last time was December 2021, and there's always an increase in withdrawals around that time of year, the Post Office said. The Post Office put the extra volume of withdrawals at its 11,500 branches down to more people turning to cash to help manage their budgets on a week-by-week and often a day-by-day basis. It also said it was partly due to more people choosing to have staycations, with recent research by the Post Office finding that 71% of Brits planning on going on holiday in the UK this year intended to take out cash before leaving. Key Post Office deal agreed for future of cash Rival banks join forces to protect future of cash Cost of living: share your experiences Martin Kearsley, banking director at the Post Office, said: ""We're seeing more and more people increasingly reliant on cash as the tried and tested way to manage a budget. ""Whether that's for a staycation in the UK or if it's to help prepare for financial pressures expected in the autumn, cash access in every community is critical."" Cash deposits also rose, according to the research. Individuals deposited Â£1.35bn in cash in July, up 2% month-on-month, while cash deposits for businesses totalled Â£1.13bn, up 1.9% from a month earlier. Mr Kearsley said the figures showed Britain is ""anything but a cashless society"". Ms Ceeney told the BBC that it was easy to see why cash use was going up, given the rising cost of living. ""Cash has been in decline for well over a decade, the pandemic accelerated this, but now it's going back up, and that's absolutely because of the cost of living crisis,"" she said. ""It helps people budget, as using cash means you literally can count the pennies. We all know that if you pay with a card, it's so easy to spend money you don't have and then go overdrawn. ""If you've only got Â£30 to last you the week, holding that in notes and coins is still the most effective way of budgeting and controlling how much you spend."" Salford University student Kira Hayward turned to social media for inspiration to help her cope with rising costs by taking cash out of her bank account. Student Kira Hayward limits her spending by using ""budget binders"" for cash She puts it in different labelled envelopes to ensure she has money for food and bills. ""I went on Instagram and YouTube and I saw these physical budget binders,"" she told the BBC in May. ""I take the money out of the bank and I budget for things like my shopping. If I know I have Â£80 in my personal shopping for the month I know I can't go over that."" With more high street banks closing branches, Ms Ceeley said there's a need for post offices and shared banking services to allow people to get the cash that they need, especially for vulnerable or elderly people or those who don't have access to digital banking. ""The reality is digital doesn't work for everyone,"" she said. ""Millions of people don't have access to computers or smartphones, and so we need to keep cash viable.""

Ryan Giggs has uglier and sinister side - courtThe ex-Manchester United and Wales star is accused of coercive behaviour and assaulting two women.Wales,"Ex-Manchester Utd and Wales star Ryan Giggs ""deliberately headbutted"" his ex-girlfriend, a court has heard. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, told the court Mr Giggs' private life involved a ""litany of abuse, both physical and psychological"". Mr Giggs, 48, denies a charge of coercive behaviour and assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her sister. His defence counsel said the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies"". Ryan Giggs charged with assaulting two women Giggs resigns as Wales manager Mr Giggs is charged with controlling and coercive behaviour against his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville, 38, between August 2017 and November 2020. He is also charged with assaulting Ms Greville, causing her actual bodily harm, and common assault of her younger sister, Emma Greville, at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, on 1 November 2020. Opening his case against Mr Giggs at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court, Mr Wright said this was a story of ""control and coercion"" of a woman who thought she was ""loved and respected"". He said his relationship with Ms Greville, 36, was ""punctuated by acts of violence and volatility"". He added Mr Giggs was ""idolised"" for his skills on the pitch but behind closed doors had ""a much uglier and more sinister side to his character"". He told the jury they will hear the relationship had ""ups and downs"" and that Mr Giggs was seeing someone else when he was with Ms Greville. ""Eventually, after years of turbulence, when the scales fell from her eyes, she realised she needed to remove herself from his sphere of influence,"" he said. Ryan Giggs in front of Judge Hilary Manley Mr Wright said this decision to break away led to the incident on 1 November 2020. Mr Giggs is said to have ""lost control"" that evening and headbutted Ms Greville. While both out with friends at Manchester's Stock Exchange Hotel, Ms Greville decided to terminate their relationship, said Mr Wright. He added Ms Greville knew Mr Giggs had ""once again"" been cheating on her, and informed her sister of her plan to end the relationship before leaving the hotel. ""She intended to make her departure before [Mr Giggs] got back from the hotel. The plan did not work. ""As she was vacating the defendant's home address, he came back and began arguing with her and trying to stop her leaving."" In the altercation that followed, in which Ms Greville took Mr Giggs phone as a ""bargaining chip"", they grappled together on the floor before Ms Greville's sister stepped in, the court heard. Mr Wright said Emma Greville then tried to pull Mr Giggs off her sister, but he ""deliberately elbowed her in the jaw"", before the argument moved to the kitchen. ""At that stage, we say, the defendant entirely lost self-control and he deliberately headbutted Kate, thereby causing swelling to her lips and bruising. Emma then called the police, who attended the premises."" Ryan Giggs' former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, and teammate Gary Neville will be witnesses in the case, the jury was told Mr Giggs' defence team challenged the prosecution's version of events. Addressing the jury, Chris Daw QC for the defence said on a ""moral level"" his behaviour was ""far from perfect"". He told the jury some of his messages and emails were ""marked by immaturity and inappropriate language"", but this was the case for both him and Ms Greville. ""They behaved like squabbling children, playing on the insecurities of the other."" But, Mr Daw said ""no matter how rude, unpleasant and mean"" they were, there were ""lines Mr Giggs would never cross"". ""He never once used unlawful violence against Ms Greville,"" he said, adding that the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies."" He said it was ""clear"" Ms Greville's injuries were not consistent with a head butt from ""a strong and physically fit man"". Referring to the incident on 1 November 2020, Mr Daw said Mr Giggs and Ms Greville both tripped and fell to the floor in the kitchen of his home and that she kicked him in the face as he tried to disentangle himself. Mr Daw added Mr Giggs was not aware the complainant's sister was in the house at the time and did not elbow her, as alleged. The alleged headbutt was ""not only a nasty lie but a ridiculous one,"" he said, as evidence in the trial will show there was ""minor and accidental contact"" between their faces. Mr Daw said in the weeks before, Ms Greville told friends she was determined not to walk away from the relationship with nothing. He added Mr Giggs had encouraged Ms Greville's career ambitions in PR, backed her with his own company, and introduced clients. She was always financially independent, free to travel and see her friends as much as she wanted, he told the court. ""Both could be childish,"" he said. On nights out, they would often block each other's numbers. ""Immaturity is not a crime,"" he added, and when it comes to law and morality, ""law is what matters"". The trial is expected to last 10 days Mr Wright, QC for the prosecution, also told the jury the abuse from Mr Giggs was ""interspersed with acts of kindness and contrition"". He said Mr Giggs would say she had misunderstood him, had jumped to the wrong conclusion and that he was the victim. ""We say this was controlling and coercive behaviour,"" he added. ""This was a behaviour to gaslight her, and make her pliant and compliant."" He said the behaviour was ""calculated"", and was ""conduct that would have an obvious and serious effect on her emotionally and physically"". Standing in the dock, wearing a dark grey suit, Mr Giggs listened to the opening statements and watched as the jury of seven women and five men was selected and sworn in for the trial. The jury was told witnesses in the case will include former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and former player Gary Neville. The trial - expected to last around 10 days - will relocate to Manchester Crown Court from Tuesday and remain there for the duration. Mr Giggs has denied all charges - the trial continues.

Ryan Giggs in front of Judge Hilary Manley Mr Wright said this decision to break away led to the incident on 1 November 2020. Mr Giggs is said to have ""lost control"" that evening and headbutted Ms Greville. While both out with friends at Manchester's Stock Exchange Hotel, Ms Greville decided to terminate their relationship, said Mr Wright. He added Ms Greville knew Mr Giggs had ""once again"" been cheating on her, and informed her sister of her plan to end the relationship before leaving the hotel. ""She intended to make her departure before [Mr Giggs] got back from the hotel. The plan did not work. ""As she was vacating the defendant's home address, he came back and began arguing with her and trying to stop her leaving."" In the altercation that followed, in which Ms Greville took Mr Giggs phone as a ""bargaining chip"", they grappled together on the floor before Ms Greville's sister stepped in, the court heard. Mr Wright said Emma Greville then tried to pull Mr Giggs off her sister, but he ""deliberately elbowed her in the jaw"", before the argument moved to the kitchen. ""At that stage, we say, the defendant entirely lost self-control and he deliberately headbutted Kate, thereby causing swelling to her lips and bruising. Emma then called the police, who attended the premises."" Ryan Giggs' former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, and teammate Gary Neville will be witnesses in the case, the jury was told Mr Giggs' defence team challenged the prosecution's version of events. Addressing the jury, Chris Daw QC for the defence said on a ""moral level"" his behaviour was ""far from perfect"". He told the jury some of his messages and emails were ""marked by immaturity and inappropriate language"", but this was the case for both him and Ms Greville. ""They behaved like squabbling children, playing on the insecurities of the other."" But, Mr Daw said ""no matter how rude, unpleasant and mean"" they were, there were ""lines Mr Giggs would never cross"". ""He never once used unlawful violence against Ms Greville,"" he said, adding that the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies."" He said it was ""clear"" Ms Greville's injuries were not consistent with a head butt from ""a strong and physically fit man"". Referring to the incident on 1 November 2020, Mr Daw said Mr Giggs and Ms Greville both tripped and fell to the floor in the kitchen of his home and that she kicked him in the face as he tried to disentangle himself. Mr Daw added Mr Giggs was not aware the complainant's sister was in the house at the time and did not elbow her, as alleged. The alleged headbutt was ""not only a nasty lie but a ridiculous one,"" he said, as evidence in the trial will show there was ""minor and accidental contact"" between their faces. Mr Daw said in the weeks before, Ms Greville told friends she was determined not to walk away from the relationship with nothing. He added Mr Giggs had encouraged Ms Greville's career ambitions in PR, backed her with his own company, and introduced clients. She was always financially independent, free to travel and see her friends as much as she wanted, he told the court. ""Both could be childish,"" he said. On nights out, they would often block each other's numbers. ""Immaturity is not a crime,"" he added, and when it comes to law and morality, ""law is what matters"". The trial is expected to last 10 days Mr Wright, QC for the prosecution, also told the jury the abuse from Mr Giggs was ""interspersed with acts of kindness and contrition"". He said Mr Giggs would say she had misunderstood him, had jumped to the wrong conclusion and that he was the victim. ""We say this was controlling and coercive behaviour,"" he added. ""This was a behaviour to gaslight her, and make her pliant and compliant."" He said the behaviour was ""calculated"", and was ""conduct that would have an obvious and serious effect on her emotionally and physically"". Standing in the dock, wearing a dark grey suit, Mr Giggs listened to the opening statements and watched as the jury of seven women and five men was selected and sworn in for the trial. The jury was told witnesses in the case will include former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and former player Gary Neville. The trial - expected to last around 10 days - will relocate to Manchester Crown Court from Tuesday and remain there for the duration. Mr Giggs has denied all charges - the trial continues.

LiveLiveRussia using nuclear plant like a shield - Ukrainian energy head10 minutes ago,"Russia is accused of using Europe's largest nuclear power plant as a military base, launching attacks against Ukraine Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company, says Russia is using the plant in Zaporizhzhia ""like a shield"" Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the plant, in the south-east of Ukraine, over the weekend UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has called for inspectors to be given access to the site, saying to attack it is a ""suicidal thingâ The fighting there has prompted the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of ""the very real risk of a nuclear disaster"" Meanwhile, two more ships loaded with grain have set sail from Ukraine's Black Sea ports as part of a deal reached with Russia Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Chris Giles We're now wrapping up our coverage of the war in Ukraine for the day, here's a round-up of today's main headlines:  Thank you for joining us. Today's writers were Jack Burgess, Catherine Evans, Anna Boyd, Krystyna Gajda, Malu Cursino, James Harness and Sam Hancock. And our editors were James Clarke, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jeremy Gahagan and Chris Giles. An expert from Imperial College, London, has been giving some reassurance
about the danger of a nuclear accident at the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. Dr Mark Wenman  says it is ""a relatively modern and robust reactor design,"" unlike the reactor in Chernobyl, where an explosion and fire in 1986 threw clouds of
radioactive material over the surrounding area. ""I do not believe there would be a high probability of a breach of the
containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell
and even less likely, the reactor itself could be damaged by such,"" he said. â""This
means the radioactive material is well protected.â"" ""Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would
be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear
release is still small."" Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine The US is to give Ukraine a further $4.5bn (Â£3.7bn). That'll bring its total budgetary support, since Russia launched its invasion back in February, to $8.5bn (Â£7bn). The package includes $1bn for weapons - including munitions for long-range weapons and armored medical
transport vehicles, according to acting Pentagon spokesman Todd Breasseale. The World Bank estimates that 55% of Ukrainians will be living in poverty by the end of 2023 as a result of the war - compared with 2.5% at the start of this year. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) said the money will help Ukrainian government to maintain infrastructure such as schools and hospitals and to deliver humanitarian supplies. USAID added that robust safeguards had been put in place to make sure the money is  properly used.

A former leading officer in the UK's armed forces thinks Russia is going to âformally annexâ as much of the Donbas area of
Ukraine as it can on 11 September. General Sir Richard Barrons, Joint Forces Command from 2013-2016, tells the BBC's World at One programme that Ukraine will need âour will, our money, our industry, and our inventoryâ to help
take back its country. He says if Ukraine is successful,
it could end up pushing into territory that âRussia has declared is Russiaâ. And that could see Moscow âreaching
for... its small nuclear weaponsâ. He says this would involve âquite
smallâ nuclear weapons that would be dangerous within a
two mile radius but would not âprovoke
a nuclear holocaust through an uncontrolled escalationâ. As we've been reporting, both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling Zaporizhzhia's nuclear plant - which is the largest in Europe. Now, the White House has called on Russia to cease all military operations around nuclear facilities in Ukraine. Spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said ""fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous,"" and ""full control"" of nuclear facilities should be returned to Ukraine. She says the US is continuing to monitor the situation at the facility and radiation sensors have ""thankfully"" not shown any indications of an increase or abnormal radiation levels. Jean-Pierre says the US is aware of reports of mistreatment of staff in the plant and, she adds, ""we applaud the Ukrainian authorities and operators for their commitment to nuclear safety and security under trying circumstances"". This video can not be played WATCH: IAEA ambassador Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk condemns Russian disinformation Earlier today we heard from nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which today spoke of its concern about the safety of the power plant in Zaporizhzhia. Now the Ukrainian representative to the agency, Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, condemned Russia's accusation that Ukraine shelled the nuclear power plant as a strategy of ""disinformation and propaganda"". Speaking in Vienna, Tsymbaliuk called the claim ""absolute nonsense"". Hugo BachegaReporting from Kyiv Tensions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have alarmed the world. For days, Ukrainian and Russian officials have blamed each other for attacking the site, although who has done what remains unclear. Itâs hard to independently confirm whatâs happening there. Russian forces captured the complex in early March, although Ukrainian technicians are still operating it. Itâs not clear why Russia would attack a site it already controls. Observers have said it could be a strategy to play on Western fears of a nuclear disaster, and degrade the military support for Ukraine. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company Enerhoatom, told me the workers are under pressure and in danger, and some had been captured, beaten and tortured. Again, these are allegations that canât be independently verified, but will certainly add to the concerns about the conditions at the plant. Kotin said the Russian plan was to eventually disconnect the plant from Ukraineâs grid and link it to the Russian system, a claim we canât verify. Calls are growing for Russia to allow international inspectors to visit the site. For now, though, the plant is safe, Kotin said. Civilians flee fighting on westbound trains from Donetsk The war in Ukraine has now been raging for more than five months. Here's a quick recap of where things stand and how we got here: What's the big picture? Russia invaded Ukraine in February, but failed in its advance on the capital Kyiv. By April it had pulled back to focus on gaining control of the whole eastern Donbas region, where separatists supported by Moscow have been fighting since 2014. The war has created a humanitarian crisis - the latest figures from UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, show that over 6.3 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. Ukraine is usually the world's fourth-largest grain exporter but disruption to harvests and shipping have caused steep price hikes - in Nigeria, for example, the cost of staples such as pasta and bread has increased by as much as 50%. Meanwhile, European gas prices are climbing as Russia restricts supplies. What's happening at Zaporizhzhia? Russia seized the nuclear plant, the biggest in Europe, in March but kept its Ukrainian employees. Ukraine said parts of the facility have been ""seriously damaged"" by Russian military strikes and accused them of ""blackmailing the entire world"". Russia has blamed Ukraine for the attacks. The UN's nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to any military action in its vicinity, warning of a ""very real risk of a nuclear disaster"". Latest fighting on the ground Ukraine says it is planning a counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied south of the country, and its forces have been shelling a key bridge in the city of Kherson. The Antonivskyi crossing is one of only two points where Russian troops can gain access to territory they have occupied west of the Dnipro river. In the north-eastern city of  Kharkiv, it's reported that one person's been killed and another injured in a Russian rocket attack. We've been reporting on the situation in Zaporizhzhia, where Ukraine and Russia have both accused each other of shelling the city's nuclear site. Now let's hear from a Ukrainian nuclear watchdog official about why Russia may want to focus its efforts on the area. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, Ukraine's ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says Russian forces want to cause electricity
blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling the Zaporizhzhia
nuclear complex. He also calls for an international mission to
the plant this month. ""We will use all possible channels of diplomacy to bring the
IAEA and UN closer to conducting this mission,"" Tsymbaliuk tells reporters in Vienna, insisting the visit must happen ""no later than the end of this month"". Svyatoslav KhomenkoBBC World Service, Kyiv One of Ukraineâs most influential presidential advisers, Mykhailo Podolyak, tells the BBC there are effectively no channels of peace negotiations open between Kyiv and Moscow. âThere are only channels [of negotiations] about exhanging bodies and POWs,"" he says. ""Russia is a country for whom there is no humane approach to war or to treating civilians in occupied territories. Russia is a different civilisation. âAfter six months of this war, we canât continue believing that it will fulfil any agreements.â Podolyak has been by President Volodymyr Zelenskyâs side since the start of the full-scale invasion and is one of the key figures shaping Ukraineâs position. He says Kyiv will join negotiations with Russia when a realistic starting point is in sight, instead of what he described as a Russian ultimatum where Moscow intends to annex all occupied territories. Ukraineâs aim, says Podolyak, is restoring state borders as of March 2014, including Russia-annexed occupied Crimea. Otherwise, he says, there wonât be lasting peace. You may remember that, in the last few weeks, Turkey and the UN brokered a deal to allow shipments to leave Ukraine. The country's ports had been blocked since the start of the conflict, and a vessel called the Razoni became the first grain ship to set sail under the new agreement. The Razoni left Odesa on 1 August and had been bound for the Lebanese port of Tripoli, but over the weekend it ground to a halt and dropped anchor near southern Turkey. In a tweet, Ukraine's embassy in Beirut said,externalthe buyer of its grain cargo has refused to accept the delivery because of delays to the shipment. The buyer has not been named, but Ukraine's embassy said a new one is being sought and the ship might end up going to another country. Since the Razoni's departure, five other ships have left Ukraine. One of them, the Turkish-flagged ship Polarnet, has already arrived in the northern Turkish port of Derince and is expected to unload its cargo today. Frank GardnerBBC News, Security Correspondent Ukrainian military inspect the site of a Russian missile strike in the Donetsk region Russia's military could be unable to operate the high-tech weapons and communications systems it has been using in Ukraine if the West were to tighten export controls, says a report. Almost all Moscow's modern military systems depend on Western-made microelectronics, the report says. Moscow has found ways to bypass sanctions and export controls. If the loopholes could be closed, says Rusi, the report authors, Russia's military might be permanently degraded. Researchers for Rusi, the Royal United Services Institute, spent months in Ukraine, examining 27 of Russia's most modern military systems, either captured, brought down or abandoned by Russian troops. They discovered at least 450 different kinds of unique, foreign-made components, most built in the US but also in other Western countries. You can read morehere. Jack BurgessBBC News Live reporter More now from Prof Claire Corkhill - a nuclear material degradation expert who we've been speaking to, from the University of Sheffield. Another major risk at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia power plant is the possibility of a nuclear waste storage site getting hit by a missile, which ""could lead to a release of radioactivity"", Corkhill says. She says the consequences of this wouldn't be as wide-reaching and severe asa loss of coolant accident, but it could still be extremely dangerous. ""All it takes is for one missile to hit the wrong area and then it's serious,"" Corkhill says. Since Russia seized the plant - the largest in Europe - in March, its Ukrainian employees have been kept there to work. There have been concernsstress could impact the workers' ability to safely carry out their duties at the nuclear site. It's not the type of environment you want to be working under duress"" Prof Claire Corkhill Ukraine and Russia have both accused each other of shelling the plant over the weekend -Ukraine has said attacks damaged three radiation sensorsand left a worker injured, leading to a reactor needing to be disconnected from the system. Corkhill says although it's a ""precarious situation"" it gives her confidence workers at the plant were able to take actions ""in a safe way to stop a serious accident"". Hugo BachegaReporting from Kyiv The head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company Enerhoatom has accused Russian soldiers of turning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into a military base, using it to launch attacks against Ukrainian positions. Petro Kotin tells me the threat to the plant is great, but the site remains safe. ""They [Russian forces] use it [the power plant] like a shield against the Ukrainian forces, because nobody from Ukraine is going to make something. ""The Ukrainian Armed Forces know that these are Ukrainian personnel and this is a Ukrainian plant and there are Ukrainian people [there] so we are not going to kill our people, our staff and damage our infrastructure."" He says 500 Russian soldiers are at the complex, and Russia has positioned rocket launchers in the area of the plant. For days, Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the site. Ukraine says two workers have been wounded, and three radiation sensors damaged. The complex has been under Russian occupation since early March, but Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Since Russia began its attacks on Ukraine in February, we've seen images of destruction and hardship throughout the country. Five months later, life for its citizens contrasts significantly from region to region. Here are some recent photos showing how life varies around the country. Life is hard in the eastern city Sloviansk, north of Donetsk - residents fill up canisters with clean water on Saturday In neighbouring Kramatorsk, an elderly woman is among civilians evacuating by bus, hoping to find safety away from the eastern region - they are embarking on a long trip to Germany The evacuation of citizens from Donetsk region continues - Sanya is on a train with her two children and her mother Lumelia, heading towards Dnipro Shoppers in a Kharviv supermarket on Sunday are met with the sight of an armed Ukrainian soldier pushing a trolley while he stocks up on supplies Meanwhile, in the capital Kyiv, life is returning to some normality - opera lovers watch Giuseppe Verdi's opera Rigoletto at the National Opera of Ukraine, on Saturday Sunbathers in the eastern port of Chornomorsk watch the cargo ship Fulmar S arrive at the port on Sunday - it is one of the ships that will transport grain, now exports have resumed The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region has signed a decree that will enable a referendum to take place for the region to join the Russian Federation, RIA Novosti news agency reports. Southern Zaporizhzhia is under Russian control and it is the focus of this next stage of the war as Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant suffers heavy shelling. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the plant, which has prompted warnings of a ""nuclear disaster"" from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Jack BurgessBBC News Live reporter We've been speaking to Prof Claire Corkhill - a nuclear material degradation expert at the University of Sheffield. She says the more missiles fired and mines planted around Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the higher the risk of ""very serious consequences that would spread radiation"". Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the plant over the weekend. The plant was seized by the Russians early in the war - in March - but kept its Ukrainian employees. Corkhill calls it a ""very high risk situation"", and says her biggest concern is if a missile were to hit critical infrastructure. She says if this happened there would be a chance the water continually pumping around the nuclear reactor's core wouldn't be able to cool it down any more. The very worst case scenario is a loss of coolant accident - precisely what happened at Fukushima"" Prof Claire Corkhill This could lead to a meltdown and a series of hydrogen explosions that could release radiation over many kilometres, Corkhill says, adding ""this almost happened backin March this year"". However, she says the likelihood of a serious accident is unclear and says the
reactors themselves are heavily reinforced - so should be able to withstand a
direct hit. Read about the incident at Fukushimahere. Ukraine is usually the world's fourth-largest grain exporter. It normally produces 42% of the world's sunflower oil, 16% of its maize and 9% of its wheat. Wheat exports from Russia - the world's largest exporter - are also down. Western sanctions do not target Russian agriculture, but the Kremlin argues they have hindered exports by hiking insurance rates and affecting payments. Ships have begun to
leave Ukraine carrying grain in recent days, following a deal between the two nations brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. The first ship to do so left the port of Odesa carrying 26,000 tonnes of corn, bound for Lebanon, becoming the first cargo ship to have been able to leave the nation since February, when Russia began its naval blockade in the Black Sea.

"Sunak: Truss living costs plan won't touch sidesBut she says her tax cuts would boost incomes, as the Tory leadership rivals row over the economy.UK PoliticsComments","Rishi Sunak has promised to step in to help people on lower incomes this winter Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak has said his rival Liz Truss's plans to cut taxes ""won't touch the sides"" of dealing with mounting living costs. Writing in the Sun, Mr Sunak said ""bolder action"" was needed to ""protect people from the worst of the winter"". But Ms Truss's allies said tax cuts would put more money in people's pockets and did not rule out more help. The worsening state of the UK economy has become the main battleground in the Tory leadership contest. Both candidates have put forward rival visions to deal with the economic fallout, with Ms Truss focusing on tax cuts, and Mr Sunak on bringing down inflation. Ms Truss and Mr Sunak are vying for support from Conservative Party members to be elected the next Tory leader, and British prime minister. Voting has started and the result is due to be announced on 5 September, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson will leave office. Mr Johnson is back at work after a holiday, but despite calls to help those struggling with living costs, his spokesman said any new spending decisions would be a matter for the next prime minister. The spokesman said the PM would speak to Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi to ensure cost-of-living support measures - including a Â£400 energy grant - would were on track to come into effect later in the year. Analysis: Cost of living crisis focus for Tory leader contest What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Ms Truss has pledged a package of tax cuts worth Â£30bn, which Mr Sunak has argued would increase inflation and only save lower earners Â£59 a year. Taking aim at Ms Truss's economic plans,Mr Sunak wrote in the Sun,external: ""We need clear-eyed realism, not starry-eyed boosterism."" Mr Sunak also accused Ms Truss of offering large businesses and ""the well-off"" a ""big bung"", while ""leaving those who most need help out in the cold"". Defending Ms Truss, supporter and former Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told the BBC the best way to ease rising living costs was ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". He said he would not pre-judge what would be in an emergency budget, which has been promised by Ms Truss if she became prime minister. Mr Lewis said: ""She's willing to do more to help people but her focus is around doing it in a way that puts more money in people's pockets, creating a high-growth economy with higher wages, more people in work."" The cost-of-living crisis will be one of the biggest issues facing the new prime minister when they take office. Liz Truss had faced pressure after saying at the weekend that she wanted to do things in a Conservative way; lowering the tax burden and not giving handouts. Low taxes and a smaller state are popular with many Conservative members, who are choosing the next prime minister. But Ms Truss's critics say her comments failed to acknowledge the extent of the problems many will face this winter. Her allies have spent the past 24 hours insisting she is not ruling out more direct support in an emergency budget if she becomes prime minister. But Rishi Sunak is not pulling any punches with his criticism this morning. He argues his rival's plans won't touch the sides. Mr Sunak is promising bolder action. But he has not set out what that would be. Over the weekend Ms Truss came under fire from Mr Sunak's allies for suggesting -in an interview with the Financial Times,external- there would be no ""handouts"" to ease the financial burden on households. She told the FT she would look at what more ""could be done"", adding: ""The way I would do things is in a Conservative way of lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts."" Oliver Dowden, former Conservative party chairman and supporter of Mr Sunak's candidacy, has said the ""precise nature"" of support offered by the former chancellor would depend on the ""exact level of the energy cap when that is announced in due course"". What taxes would Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak cut? Truss and Sunak row over recession warning in TV clash The energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - will go up in October. Energy industry analysts Cornwall Insight estimatedthe typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,358 a year from October. Meanwhile, the UK economy is expected to plunge into a year-long recession as inflation soars above 13% later this year,according to forecasts by the Bank of England. Mr Dowden told the BBC people could judge Mr Sunak ""by his record"" and the former chancellor would bring in ""direct support"" for people to help them with the cost of living.

Ryan Giggs has 'uglier and sinister' side - court,"Ex-Manchester Utd and Wales star Ryan Giggs ""deliberately headbutted"" his ex-girlfriend, a court has heard. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, told the court Mr Giggs' private life involved a ""litany of abuse, both physical and psychological"". Mr Giggs, 48, denies a charge of coercive behaviour and assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her sister. His defence counsel said the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies"". Ryan Giggs charged with assaulting two women Giggs resigns as Wales manager Mr Giggs is charged with controlling and coercive behaviour against his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville, 38, between August 2017 and November 2020. He is also charged with assaulting Ms Greville, causing her actual bodily harm, and common assault of her younger sister, Emma Greville, at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, on 1 November 2020. Opening his case against Mr Giggs at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court, Mr Wright said this was a story of ""control and coercion"" of a woman who thought she was ""loved and respected"". He said his relationship with Ms Greville, 36, was ""punctuated by acts of violence and volatility"". He added Mr Giggs was ""idolised"" for his skills on the pitch but behind closed doors had ""a much uglier and more sinister side to his character"". He told the jury they will hear the relationship had ""ups and downs"" and that Mr Giggs was seeing someone else when he was with Ms Greville. ""Eventually, after years of turbulence, when the scales fell from her eyes, she realised she needed to remove herself from his sphere of influence,"" he said. Ryan Giggs in front of Judge Hilary Manley Mr Wright said this decision to break away led to the incident on 1 November 2020. Mr Giggs is said to have ""lost control"" that evening and headbutted Ms Greville. While both out with friends at Manchester's Stock Exchange Hotel, Ms Greville decided to terminate their relationship, said Mr Wright. He added Ms Greville knew Mr Giggs had ""once again"" been cheating on her, and informed her sister of her plan to end the relationship before leaving the hotel. ""She intended to make her departure before [Mr Giggs] got back from the hotel. The plan did not work. ""As she was vacating the defendant's home address, he came back and began arguing with her and trying to stop her leaving."" In the altercation that followed, in which Ms Greville took Mr Giggs phone as a ""bargaining chip"", they grappled together on the floor before Ms Greville's sister stepped in, the court heard. Mr Wright said Emma Greville then tried to pull Mr Giggs off her sister, but he ""deliberately elbowed her in the jaw"", before the argument moved to the kitchen. ""At that stage, we say, the defendant entirely lost self-control and he deliberately headbutted Kate, thereby causing swelling to her lips and bruising. Emma then called the police, who attended the premises."" Ryan Giggs' former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, and teammate Gary Neville will be witnesses in the case, the jury was told Mr Giggs' defence team challenged the prosecution's version of events. Addressing the jury, Chris Daw QC for the defence said on a ""moral level"" his behaviour was ""far from perfect"". He told the jury some of his messages and emails were ""marked by immaturity and inappropriate language"", but this was the case for both him and Ms Greville. ""They behaved like squabbling children, playing on the insecurities of the other."" But, Mr Daw said ""no matter how rude, unpleasant and mean"" they were, there were ""lines Mr Giggs would never cross"". ""He never once used unlawful violence against Ms Greville,"" he said, adding that the case against him was based on ""distortion, exaggeration and lies."" He said it was ""clear"" Ms Greville's injuries were not consistent with a head butt from ""a strong and physically fit man"". Referring to the incident on 1 November 2020, Mr Daw said Mr Giggs and Ms Greville both tripped and fell to the floor in the kitchen of his home and that she kicked him in the face as he tried to disentangle himself. Mr Daw added Mr Giggs was not aware the complainant's sister was in the house at the time and did not elbow her, as alleged. The alleged headbutt was ""not only a nasty lie but a ridiculous one,"" he said, as evidence in the trial will show there was ""minor and accidental contact"" between their faces. Mr Daw said in the weeks before, Ms Greville told friends she was determined not to walk away from the relationship with nothing. He added Mr Giggs had encouraged Ms Greville's career ambitions in PR, backed her with his own company, and introduced clients. She was always financially independent, free to travel and see her friends as much as she wanted, he told the court. ""Both could be childish,"" he said. On nights out, they would often block each other's numbers. ""Immaturity is not a crime,"" he added, and when it comes to law and morality, ""law is what matters"". The trial is expected to last 10 days Mr Wright, QC for the prosecution, also told the jury the abuse from Mr Giggs was ""interspersed with acts of kindness and contrition"". He said Mr Giggs would say she had misunderstood him, had jumped to the wrong conclusion and that he was the victim. ""We say this was controlling and coercive behaviour,"" he added. ""This was a behaviour to gaslight her, and make her pliant and compliant."" He said the behaviour was ""calculated"", and was ""conduct that would have an obvious and serious effect on her emotionally and physically"". Standing in the dock, wearing a dark grey suit, Mr Giggs listened to the opening statements and watched as the jury of seven women and five men was selected and sworn in for the trial. The jury was told witnesses in the case will include former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and former player Gary Neville. The trial - expected to last around 10 days - will relocate to Manchester Crown Court from Tuesday and remain there for the duration. Mr Giggs has denied all charges - the trial continues.

"Boutique owner wins trademark row with ZaraZara had said the name of House of Zana was ""one small brush mark"" from being the same as theirs.Tees","Amber Kotrri said winning the battle against Zara was a ""genuine weight off my shoulders"" The owner of a small boutique says she is ""over the moon"" after winning a trademark battle with High Street fashion giant Zara. Amber Kotrri, who runs Darlington-based House of Zana, had been told by the retailer her businesswas ""conceptually identical"". Zara had argued there was a ""high degree of visual and aural similarities"" between the two brands. But a tribunal found the link was ""too insubstantial"". Mum-of-three Mrs Kotrri says dealing with lawyers has cost her time with her children She said the judgement was a ""genuine weight off my shoulders"". ""It's been well over a year and very stressful on my home life, as a mum of three young children, as well as on the business as there's been hours and hours of preparing documents of evidence,"" she said. ""My daughter's due date coincided with the time the last evidence was due so it hasn't been easy."" Mrs Kotrri said she had received an email informing her of the tribunal's decision while on a visit to the theatre with her three children - but took several days to build up the courage to open it. ""It was quite a long document and I couldn't really understand a lot of it as I had butterflies,"" she said. However, she said she saw the words ""the opposition is unsuccessful"" and was relieved she would be able to continue growing the business. ""It's been so stressful - but we won,"" she added. Inditex is one of the world's largest fashion retailers, with seven brands, including Zara In May Mrs Kotrri, who represented herself at the tribunal, told the hearing there was ""no likelihood"" of confusing the brands. Zara had argued the House of Zana trademark application should be refused because it was too similar in name, which could result in customers confusing one trademark for another. Julia King, representing Zara, said the name Zana was ""one small brush mark"" away from her client's, adding the County Durham-based brand was ""not distinctive and only descriptive"". She said it could pose a""serious threat"" to Zaraif the market was crowded with brands that looked and sounded similar. However, tribunal registrar Matthew Williams ruled he was satisfied any ""mental link"" made by customers between House of Zana and Zara would be ""too insubstantial and fleeting"" to result in an ""exploitation"" of Zara's reputation. He said the two brands were ""visually and aurally similar to a degree between low and medium"". Mrs Kotrri, whose husband is Albanian, set up and named her company in 2019 after the Balkan country's word for ""fairies"". She said she was contacted by Zara's lawyers last year after trying to trademark her brand. Mrs Kotrri said she had also been in contact with more than 10 other small business owners who had been contacted by the fashion company asking them to rebrand because of similarities with their names. Mrs Kotrri, who represented herself throughout the tribunal, said she hoped its outcome would empower others She has previously accused Zara of""very intimidating"" conductin its dealings with her. Mrs Kotrri said: ""To anyone in a similar position I would say, 'keep fighting it'll be worth it in the end - be brave and ignore the threatening way the legal letters are worded'. ""You know your business the most, you know the meaning behind any name, and if you've built it up then fight for it,  I couldn't tell my children that I closed down my business because someone bigger told me to."" Inditex, the parent company of Zara - is one of the world's largest fashion distribution groups with 6,477 stores, including Bershka, Pull & Bear and Massimo Dutti. A Zara spokesperson said while they did not want to comment on the judgement itself, the company ""continue to wish"" Mrs Kotrri and her business ""success in the future"".

Qantas asks executives to work as baggage handlers,"Airlines were forced to lay off thousands of staff members during the pandemic Australian airline Qantas has asked senior executives to work as baggage handlers for three months as it tries to tackle an acute labour shortage. The firm's head of operations is looking for at least 100 volunteers to work at Sydney and Melbourne airports. Tasks include loading and unloading bags as well as driving vehicles to move luggage around airports. Like much of the global airline industry, Qantas is struggling to resume its services as borders reopen. ""The high levels of winter flu and a Covid spike across the community, coupled with the ongoing tight labour market, make resourcing a challenge across our industry,"" Qantas' chief operating officer Colin Hughes said in an email shared with the BBC by the company. ""There is no expectation that you will opt into this role on top of your full-time position,"" Mr Hughes added. Qantas says Covid to cost billions in lost revenue Qantas says all employees must have Covid vaccine Airline boss over-hiring to beat staff exodus Going on a summer holiday? Become a BBC Travel Watcher The managers and executives were asked to work in the baggage handling roles for three or five days a week, in shifts of either four or six hours a day. The note went on to say that applicants need to be able to move suitcases weighing as much as 32kg each. ""We've been clear that our operational performance has not been meeting our customers' expectations or the standards that we expect of ourselves - and that we've been pulling out all stops to improve our performance,"" a Qantas spokesperson told the BBC. ""As we have done in the past during busy periods, around 200 head office staff have helped at airports during peak travel periods since Easter."" Qantas was among airlines hit hard by the pandemic as countries closed their borders, grounding planes. The industry laid off thousands of staff during the pandemic, many of which were ground staff. In November 2020, Qantas outsourced more than 2,000 ground staff roles, on top of thousands more job cuts it had already announced, in an effort to limit its financial losses. Last month, the airline apologised after passengers complained of delays and missing luggage. Australia had among the strictest Covid travel restrictions in the world, including for its own citizens,and only began lifting the controls in November 2021. As measures to slow the spread of Covid-19 have eased around the world, Qantas and other major airlines have struggled to resume services at the scale seen before the pandemic. UK airlines and airports have also faced staff shortages, leading to delays and cancellations during holiday periods. Shortages of baggage handlers have also been contributing to luggage piling up in terminals. Airports including Heathrow have put a cap on passenger numbers over the summer to help manage demand, leading to some airlines suspending ticket sales for certain routes.

Then Scotland clinched an unlikely medal in the women's 4 x 400m relay after England were disqualified to take the tally to 49 - 12 gold, 11 silver, and 26 bronze - with one day of competition left. Scotland's gallus boxers make mark with three golds Emotional Muir exorcises Commonwealth demons Watch every Scottish Commonwealth Games medal so far Scotland have now burst past the 44 earned in Gold Coast four years ago, which was the highest return apart from Glasgow 2014, where the team took 53, including 19 golds. That was despite Kirsty Gilmour missing out on a badminton medal after losing her bronze medal match to Jia Min Yeo of Singapore, and mixed doubles pair Adam Hall and Julie MacPherson also losing to Malaysia in their match for third place. However, squash duo Greg Lobban and Rory Stewart play in their bronze medal match on Monday. This video can not be played Commonwealth Games 2022: Sean Lazzerini beats Taylor Bevan in light heavyweight final Scotland have won a boxing medal at every Commonwealth Games, but the last gold medals came in 2014, when Josh Taylor and Charlie Flynn emerged victorious. In Birmingham, five of the eight fighters will leave with medals, with three of them gold - a record for Scotland. Hickey, the 22-year-old middleweight from Dundee, started it all of with a blockbuster defeat of 19-year-old Callum Peters of Australia. The pair traded brutal blows, and both landed shots in the final round before the three of the five judges gave Hickey the win. The fighters shared a hug of mutual respect after a gripping bout. ""It's been a long time coming,"" Hickey told BBC Scotland. ""I always believed in myself but to get in the ring is easier said, than done. I'm proud of myself. Proud to be Scottish. And proud to be from Dundee."" Not to be outdone, Barrhead light-heavyweight Lazzerini performed brilliantly to defeat Taylor Bevan of Wales, landing a flurry of blows in the final round to ensure he too would take gold. The 25-year-old performed Cristiano Ronaldo's trademark celebration in the ring afterwards, and was then conducting the crowd through Flower of Scotland as he stood atop the podium. This video can not be played Commonwealth Games 2022: Scotland's Sam Hickey claims gold in men's middleweight final ""Brilliant, but this is just the beginning,"" Lazzerini said. ""Maybe even tomorrow I'll train again. What is there to celebrate? There's not going to be an end, I've got to keep progressing. ""It's been a long road and a lot of people gave up on me. But I never gave up on myself and my family and friends never gave up on me and that's why I got the gold."" Finally, it was was light-welterweight Lynch's turn. The 21-year-old from Fauldhouse had to wait for his chance to make history alongside his team-mates, and he eventually produced under pressure. After a good first round from the Scot and an even second, Louis Richarno Colin of Mauritius finished strongly to open a cut on above Lynch's eye in the third round, before ending with a big right hand which sent his gumshield flying. But it was Lynch who raised his hands in victory amid some boos from the crowd, after four of the five judges scored the bout in his favour. ""It's not even sunk in yet. I'm buzzing,"" he said. ""It was a good fight, he was a good lad, very experienced. I thought I won the first and second [rounds] and the third I knew I was winning so I took it a bit easier. ""Obviously I got caught but my gumshield came out, which made it look worse than it was. I'm happy with my performance."" This video can not be played Commonwealth Games 2022: Scotlandâs Lynch takes gold in men's light welterweight final Cyclist Evans has been phenomenally consistent throughout the Games, finishing with a personal haul of three medals and a fourth place over the track and road. She took track silver in the points race and bronze in the individual pursuit in the velodrome last week, and narrowly missed a medal in the scratch race too. The 31-year-old former vet was less fancied on the road, but worked with team-mate Anna Shackley to finish second in a frantic bunch sprint behind Georgia Baker of Australia. It capped a fantastic fortnight for Evans, who has been one of the stars of Scotland's Games. ""It's going to take a while to sink in, especially because it was in two disciplines,"" she said. ""I'd not road raced in three years, so I had no expectation of winning a medal. When it got to the sprintâ¦ I don't even know how far out you're supposed to go from, so I didn't realise until I was crossing the line, then I was like 'oh, right'."" In the men's race, former Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas attacked off the front with two kilometres to go, but Crockett was part of a group of riders who came past and sprinted for the line, eventually finishing third. ""For a nation like Scotland to get a medal in the road race, with the talent that is here... I honestly can't believe it,"" Crockett said. ""To get a medal is honestly unreal.""

Landmark US climate bill clears Senate hurdle,"Vice-President Kamala Harris cast the deciding vote in a divided Senate The US Senate has approved a sweeping $700bn (Â£577bn) economic package that includes major legislation on healthcare, tax and climate change. The bill seeks to lower the cost of some medicines, increase corporate taxes and reduce carbon emissions. The passing of the bill - a flagship part of President Joe Biden's agenda - is a boost ahead of mid-term elections. But it is a significantly scaled-back version of the $3.5tn package that was first proposed by his administration. The bill, a product of 18 months of intense wrangling, passed by a margin of 51 to 50 on Sunday with Vice-President Kamala Harris casting the deciding vote. It was previously blocked by two Democratic senators who shared Republican concerns about its cost. It will now be sent to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass in a vote on Friday before the president can sign it into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes legislation that would allow the government to negotiate lower prices for prescription medicines provided under its Medicare health insurance programme for those aged over 65. That is expected to save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, according to estimates from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The package also includes a minimum 15% tax on most corporations that make more than $1bn a year in profits. That measure, an issue of contention during negotiations in Congress, is opposed by business groups who argue it will limit investment. ANALYSIS:US climate win masks scale of warming challenge BACKGROUND:Why are prices rising and what is the inflation rate? The bill also includes $369bn for climate action - the largest investment in the issue in US history. Some households could receive up to $7,500 in tax credits to buy an electric car, or $4,000 for a used car. Billions will also be spent in an effort to speed up the production of clean technology such as solar panels and wind turbines. There will also be $60bn given to communities that have suffered the most from fossil fuel pollution. The authors of the bill say it will cut the country's carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. The action on climate comes as the US experiences a wave of extreme weather, including a recent heatwave as well as deadly flooding in Kentucky that left dozens dead. President Biden visited flood-damaged areas of the state on Monday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Democratic Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers were ""making history"" Democratic Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said: ""After more than a year of hard work, the Senate is making history. To Americans who've lost faith that Congress can do big things, this bill is for you."" Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, reportedly cried tears of joy as he left the chamber. ""Now I can look my kid in the eye and say we're really doing something about the climate,"" he said, according to the New York Times. Some Republicans have said they will try to stall or block the progress of the bill. Florida's Republican Senator Marco Rubio argued it was out of touch as it did not help to lower prices for working people or keep criminals in jail - ""the things working people in this country care about"". On Saturday, Congress debated a revised version of the bill, after compromises on the more ambitious original plan were agreed with two key Democratic holdouts, Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Mr Manchin had feared the original bill would have exacerbated inflation. President Biden - who has called the bill ""historic"" - has pledged to return the US to the international stage on climate action. In April last year, he pledged to slash greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030. Last month, he announced $2.2bn to help build infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather and natural disasters. This isn't the all-singing, all-dancing climate mega-bill Joe Biden promised when he became president - but if it passes it will be the most ambitious action the US has taken to try to stop the planet overheating. And the indirect impact could be even more consequential. President Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, has been tireless in his efforts to persuade other countries to raise their ambitions on climate change. But the US faced a credibility gap. ""You can't preach temperance from a bar stool,"" is how one Democratic senator put it. What he means is you can't ask India, China or Brazil to cut emissions unless you are doing so yourself. That's still a very big ask, and things are particularly strained with China right now. Beijing said it is halting co-operation over climate change following senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi's recent trip to Taiwan. But with the US leading by example, the hope is that international efforts to tackle global warming will be revitalised.

"LiveLiveLet inspectors access Ukraine nuclear plant, says UN8 minutes ago","Russia is accused of using Europe's largest nuclear power plant as a military base, launching attacks against Ukraine Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company, says Russia is using the plant in Zaporizhzhia ""like a shield"" Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the plant, in the south-east of Ukraine, over the weekend UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has called for inspectors to be given access to the site, saying to attack it is a ""suicidal thingâ The fighting there has prompted the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to warn of ""the very real risk of a nuclear disaster"" Meanwhile, two more ships loaded with grain have set sail from Ukraine's Black Sea ports as part of a deal reached with Russia Edited by Jeremy Gahagan and Chris Giles We're now wrapping up our coverage of the war in Ukraine for the day, here's a round-up of today's main headlines:  Thank you for joining us. Today's writers were Jack Burgess, Catherine Evans, Anna Boyd, Krystyna Gajda, Malu Cursino, James Harness and Sam Hancock. And our editors were James Clarke, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jeremy Gahagan and Chris Giles. An expert from Imperial College, London, has been giving some reassurance
about the danger of a nuclear accident at the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. Dr Mark Wenman  says it is ""a relatively modern and robust reactor design,"" unlike the reactor in Chernobyl, where an explosion and fire in 1986 threw clouds of
radioactive material over the surrounding area. ""I do not believe there would be a high probability of a breach of the
containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell
and even less likely, the reactor itself could be damaged by such,"" he said. â""This
means the radioactive material is well protected.â"" ""Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would
be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear
release is still small."" Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine The US is to give Ukraine a further $4.5bn (Â£3.7bn). That'll bring its total budgetary support, since Russia launched its invasion back in February, to $8.5bn (Â£7bn). The package includes $1bn for weapons - including munitions for long-range weapons and armored medical
transport vehicles, according to acting Pentagon spokesman Todd Breasseale. The World Bank estimates that 55% of Ukrainians will be living in poverty by the end of 2023 as a result of the war - compared with 2.5% at the start of this year. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) said the money will help Ukrainian government to maintain infrastructure such as schools and hospitals and to deliver humanitarian supplies. USAID added that robust safeguards had been put in place to make sure the money is  properly used.

On Sunday, she visited a children's hospital in Kyiv and delighted the children, from Kherson and Chernihiv, with teddy bear gifts. In return, the children gave her presents - one was a picture drawn by a patient. The star also heard from staff about the challenges they face while caring for patients in the hospital. Jessica Chastain met President Zelensky during her visit Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Chastain for her visit during a meeting in Kyiv. She added the people of Ukraine are ""very brave and strong"". The UK's Ministry of Defence has been training Ukrainian civilians to be ready for combat in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. According to the British MoD, the UK-led military programmes are preparing Ukrainian soldiers to be ready to fight in the front line. Allow Twitter content?

A former leading officer in the UK's armed forces thinks Russia is going to âformally annexâ as much of the Donbas area of
Ukraine as it can on 11 September. General Sir Richard Barrons, Joint Forces Command from 2013-2016, tells the BBC's World at One programme that Ukraine will need âour will, our money, our industry, and our inventoryâ to help
take back its country. He says if Ukraine is successful,
it could end up pushing into territory that âRussia has declared is Russiaâ. And that could see Moscow âreaching
for... its small nuclear weaponsâ. He says this would involve âquite
smallâ nuclear weapons that would be dangerous within a
two mile radius but would not âprovoke
a nuclear holocaust through an uncontrolled escalationâ. As we've been reporting, both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling Zaporizhzhia's nuclear plant - which is the largest in Europe. Now, the White House has called on Russia to cease all military operations around nuclear facilities in Ukraine. Spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said ""fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous,"" and ""full control"" of nuclear facilities should be returned to Ukraine. She says the US is continuing to monitor the situation at the facility and radiation sensors have ""thankfully"" not shown any indications of an increase or abnormal radiation levels. Jean-Pierre says the US is aware of reports of mistreatment of staff in the plant and, she adds, ""we applaud the Ukrainian authorities and operators for their commitment to nuclear safety and security under trying circumstances"". This video can not be played WATCH: IAEA ambassador Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk condemns Russian disinformation Earlier today we heard from nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which today spoke of its concern about the safety of the power plant in Zaporizhzhia. Now the Ukrainian representative to the agency, Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, condemned Russia's accusation that Ukraine shelled the nuclear power plant as a strategy of ""disinformation and propaganda"". Speaking in Vienna, Tsymbaliuk called the claim ""absolute nonsense"". Hugo BachegaReporting from Kyiv Tensions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have alarmed the world. For days, Ukrainian and Russian officials have blamed each other for attacking the site, although who has done what remains unclear. Itâs hard to independently confirm whatâs happening there. Russian forces captured the complex in early March, although Ukrainian technicians are still operating it. Itâs not clear why Russia would attack a site it already controls. Observers have said it could be a strategy to play on Western fears of a nuclear disaster, and degrade the military support for Ukraine. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company Enerhoatom, told me the workers are under pressure and in danger, and some had been captured, beaten and tortured. Again, these are allegations that canât be independently verified, but will certainly add to the concerns about the conditions at the plant. Kotin said the Russian plan was to eventually disconnect the plant from Ukraineâs grid and link it to the Russian system, a claim we canât verify. Calls are growing for Russia to allow international inspectors to visit the site. For now, though, the plant is safe, Kotin said. Civilians flee fighting on westbound trains from Donetsk The war in Ukraine has now been raging for more than five months. Here's a quick recap of where things stand and how we got here: What's the big picture? Russia invaded Ukraine in February, but failed in its advance on the capital Kyiv. By April it had pulled back to focus on gaining control of the whole eastern Donbas region, where separatists supported by Moscow have been fighting since 2014. The war has created a humanitarian crisis - the latest figures from UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, show that over 6.3 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. Ukraine is usually the world's fourth-largest grain exporter but disruption to harvests and shipping have caused steep price hikes - in Nigeria, for example, the cost of staples such as pasta and bread has increased by as much as 50%. Meanwhile, European gas prices are climbing as Russia restricts supplies. What's happening at Zaporizhzhia? Russia seized the nuclear plant, the biggest in Europe, in March but kept its Ukrainian employees. Ukraine said parts of the facility have been ""seriously damaged"" by Russian military strikes and accused them of ""blackmailing the entire world"". Russia has blamed Ukraine for the attacks. The UN's nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to any military action in its vicinity, warning of a ""very real risk of a nuclear disaster"". Latest fighting on the ground Ukraine says it is planning a counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied south of the country, and its forces have been shelling a key bridge in the city of Kherson. The Antonivskyi crossing is one of only two points where Russian troops can gain access to territory they have occupied west of the Dnipro river. In the north-eastern city of  Kharkiv, it's reported that one person's been killed and another injured in a Russian rocket attack. We've been reporting on the situation in Zaporizhzhia, where Ukraine and Russia have both accused each other of shelling the city's nuclear site. Now let's hear from a Ukrainian nuclear watchdog official about why Russia may want to focus its efforts on the area. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, Ukraine's ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says Russian forces want to cause electricity
blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling the Zaporizhzhia
nuclear complex. He also calls for an international mission to
the plant this month. ""We will use all possible channels of diplomacy to bring the
IAEA and UN closer to conducting this mission,"" Tsymbaliuk tells reporters in Vienna, insisting the visit must happen ""no later than the end of this month"". Svyatoslav KhomenkoBBC World Service, Kyiv One of Ukraineâs most influential presidential advisers, Mykhailo Podolyak, tells the BBC there are effectively no channels of peace negotiations open between Kyiv and Moscow. âThere are only channels [of negotiations] about exhanging bodies and POWs,"" he says. ""Russia is a country for whom there is no humane approach to war or to treating civilians in occupied territories. Russia is a different civilisation. âAfter six months of this war, we canât continue believing that it will fulfil any agreements.â Podolyak has been by President Volodymyr Zelenskyâs side since the start of the full-scale invasion and is one of the key figures shaping Ukraineâs position. He says Kyiv will join negotiations with Russia when a realistic starting point is in sight, instead of what he described as a Russian ultimatum where Moscow intends to annex all occupied territories. Ukraineâs aim, says Podolyak, is restoring state borders as of March 2014, including Russia-annexed occupied Crimea. Otherwise, he says, there wonât be lasting peace. You may remember that, in the last few weeks, Turkey and the UN brokered a deal to allow shipments to leave Ukraine. The country's ports had been blocked since the start of the conflict, and a vessel called the Razoni became the first grain ship to set sail under the new agreement. The Razoni left Odesa on 1 August and had been bound for the Lebanese port of Tripoli, but over the weekend it ground to a halt and dropped anchor near southern Turkey. In a tweet, Ukraine's embassy in Beirut said,externalthe buyer of its grain cargo has refused to accept the delivery because of delays to the shipment. The buyer has not been named, but Ukraine's embassy said a new one is being sought and the ship might end up going to another country. Since the Razoni's departure, five other ships have left Ukraine. One of them, the Turkish-flagged ship Polarnet, has already arrived in the northern Turkish port of Derince and is expected to unload its cargo today. Frank GardnerBBC News, Security Correspondent Ukrainian military inspect the site of a Russian missile strike in the Donetsk region Russia's military could be unable to operate the high-tech weapons and communications systems it has been using in Ukraine if the West were to tighten export controls, says a report. Almost all Moscow's modern military systems depend on Western-made microelectronics, the report says. Moscow has found ways to bypass sanctions and export controls. If the loopholes could be closed, says Rusi, the report authors, Russia's military might be permanently degraded. Researchers for Rusi, the Royal United Services Institute, spent months in Ukraine, examining 27 of Russia's most modern military systems, either captured, brought down or abandoned by Russian troops. They discovered at least 450 different kinds of unique, foreign-made components, most built in the US but also in other Western countries. You can read morehere. Jack BurgessBBC News Live reporter More now from Prof Claire Corkhill - a nuclear material degradation expert who we've been speaking to, from the University of Sheffield. Another major risk at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia power plant is the possibility of a nuclear waste storage site getting hit by a missile, which ""could lead to a release of radioactivity"", Corkhill says. She says the consequences of this wouldn't be as wide-reaching and severe asa loss of coolant accident, but it could still be extremely dangerous. ""All it takes is for one missile to hit the wrong area and then it's serious,"" Corkhill says. Since Russia seized the plant - the largest in Europe - in March, its Ukrainian employees have been kept there to work. There have been concernsstress could impact the workers' ability to safely carry out their duties at the nuclear site. It's not the type of environment you want to be working under duress"" Prof Claire Corkhill Ukraine and Russia have both accused each other of shelling the plant over the weekend -Ukraine has said attacks damaged three radiation sensorsand left a worker injured, leading to a reactor needing to be disconnected from the system. Corkhill says although it's a ""precarious situation"" it gives her confidence workers at the plant were able to take actions ""in a safe way to stop a serious accident"". Hugo BachegaReporting from Kyiv The head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company Enerhoatom has accused Russian soldiers of turning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into a military base, using it to launch attacks against Ukrainian positions. Petro Kotin tells me the threat to the plant is great, but the site remains safe. ""They [Russian forces] use it [the power plant] like a shield against the Ukrainian forces, because nobody from Ukraine is going to make something. ""The Ukrainian Armed Forces know that these are Ukrainian personnel and this is a Ukrainian plant and there are Ukrainian people [there] so we are not going to kill our people, our staff and damage our infrastructure."" He says 500 Russian soldiers are at the complex, and Russia has positioned rocket launchers in the area of the plant. For days, Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the site. Ukraine says two workers have been wounded, and three radiation sensors damaged. The complex has been under Russian occupation since early March, but Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Since Russia began its attacks on Ukraine in February, we've seen images of destruction and hardship throughout the country. Five months later, life for its citizens contrasts significantly from region to region. Here are some recent photos showing how life varies around the country. Life is hard in the eastern city Sloviansk, north of Donetsk - residents fill up canisters with clean water on Saturday In neighbouring Kramatorsk, an elderly woman is among civilians evacuating by bus, hoping to find safety away from the eastern region - they are embarking on a long trip to Germany The evacuation of citizens from Donetsk region continues - Sanya is on a train with her two children and her mother Lumelia, heading towards Dnipro Shoppers in a Kharviv supermarket on Sunday are met with the sight of an armed Ukrainian soldier pushing a trolley while he stocks up on supplies Meanwhile, in the capital Kyiv, life is returning to some normality - opera lovers watch Giuseppe Verdi's opera Rigoletto at the National Opera of Ukraine, on Saturday Sunbathers in the eastern port of Chornomorsk watch the cargo ship Fulmar S arrive at the port on Sunday - it is one of the ships that will transport grain, now exports have resumed The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region has signed a decree that will enable a referendum to take place for the region to join the Russian Federation, RIA Novosti news agency reports. Southern Zaporizhzhia is under Russian control and it is the focus of this next stage of the war as Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant suffers heavy shelling. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the plant, which has prompted warnings of a ""nuclear disaster"" from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Jack BurgessBBC News Live reporter We've been speaking to Prof Claire Corkhill - a nuclear material degradation expert at the University of Sheffield. She says the more missiles fired and mines planted around Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the higher the risk of ""very serious consequences that would spread radiation"". Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the plant over the weekend. The plant was seized by the Russians early in the war - in March - but kept its Ukrainian employees. Corkhill calls it a ""very high risk situation"", and says her biggest concern is if a missile were to hit critical infrastructure. She says if this happened there would be a chance the water continually pumping around the nuclear reactor's core wouldn't be able to cool it down any more. The very worst case scenario is a loss of coolant accident - precisely what happened at Fukushima"" Prof Claire Corkhill This could lead to a meltdown and a series of hydrogen explosions that could release radiation over many kilometres, Corkhill says, adding ""this almost happened backin March this year"". However, she says the likelihood of a serious accident is unclear and says the
reactors themselves are heavily reinforced - so should be able to withstand a
direct hit. Read about the incident at Fukushimahere. Ukraine is usually the world's fourth-largest grain exporter. It normally produces 42% of the world's sunflower oil, 16% of its maize and 9% of its wheat. Wheat exports from Russia - the world's largest exporter - are also down. Western sanctions do not target Russian agriculture, but the Kremlin argues they have hindered exports by hiking insurance rates and affecting payments. Ships have begun to
leave Ukraine carrying grain in recent days, following a deal between the two nations brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. The first ship to do so left the port of Odesa carrying 26,000 tonnes of corn, bound for Lebanon, becoming the first cargo ship to have been able to leave the nation since February, when Russia began its naval blockade in the Black Sea.

about the danger of a nuclear accident at the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. Dr Mark Wenman  says it is ""a relatively modern and robust reactor design,"" unlike the reactor in Chernobyl, where an explosion and fire in 1986 threw clouds of
radioactive material over the surrounding area. ""I do not believe there would be a high probability of a breach of the
containment building, even if it was accidently struck by an explosive shell
and even less likely, the reactor itself could be damaged by such,"" he said. â""This
means the radioactive material is well protected.â"" ""Although it may seem worrying, and any fighting on a nuclear site would
be illegal according to international law, the likelihood of a serious nuclear
release is still small."" Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine The US is to give Ukraine a further $4.5bn (Â£3.7bn). That'll bring its total budgetary support, since Russia launched its invasion back in February, to $8.5bn (Â£7bn). The package includes $1bn for weapons - including munitions for long-range weapons and armored medical
transport vehicles, according to acting Pentagon spokesman Todd Breasseale. The World Bank estimates that 55% of Ukrainians will be living in poverty by the end of 2023 as a result of the war - compared with 2.5% at the start of this year. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) said the money will help Ukrainian government to maintain infrastructure such as schools and hospitals and to deliver humanitarian supplies. USAID added that robust safeguards had been put in place to make sure the money is  properly used.

On Sunday, she visited a children's hospital in Kyiv and delighted the children, from Kherson and Chernihiv, with teddy bear gifts. In return, the children gave her presents - one was a picture drawn by a patient. The star also heard from staff about the challenges they face while caring for patients in the hospital. Jessica Chastain met President Zelensky during her visit Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Chastain for her visit during a meeting in Kyiv. She added the people of Ukraine are ""very brave and strong"". The UK's Ministry of Defence has been training Ukrainian civilians to be ready for combat in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. According to the British MoD, the UK-led military programmes are preparing Ukrainian soldiers to be ready to fight in the front line. Allow Twitter content?

A former leading officer in the UK's armed forces thinks Russia is going to âformally annexâ as much of the Donbas area of
Ukraine as it can on 11 September. General Sir Richard Barrons, Joint Forces Command from 2013-2016, tells the BBC's World at One programme that Ukraine will need âour will, our money, our industry, and our inventoryâ to help
take back its country. He says if Ukraine is successful,
it could end up pushing into territory that âRussia has declared is Russiaâ. And that could see Moscow âreaching
for... its small nuclear weaponsâ. He says this would involve âquite
smallâ nuclear weapons that would be dangerous within a
two mile radius but would not âprovoke
a nuclear holocaust through an uncontrolled escalationâ. As we've been reporting, both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling Zaporizhzhia's nuclear plant - which is the largest in Europe. Now, the White House has called on Russia to cease all military operations around nuclear facilities in Ukraine. Spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said ""fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous,"" and ""full control"" of nuclear facilities should be returned to Ukraine. She says the US is continuing to monitor the situation at the facility and radiation sensors have ""thankfully"" not shown any indications of an increase or abnormal radiation levels. Jean-Pierre says the US is aware of reports of mistreatment of staff in the plant and, she adds, ""we applaud the Ukrainian authorities and operators for their commitment to nuclear safety and security under trying circumstances"". This video can not be played WATCH: IAEA ambassador Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk condemns Russian disinformation Earlier today we heard from nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which today spoke of its concern about the safety of the power plant in Zaporizhzhia. Now the Ukrainian representative to the agency, Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, condemned Russia's accusation that Ukraine shelled the nuclear power plant as a strategy of ""disinformation and propaganda"". Speaking in Vienna, Tsymbaliuk called the claim ""absolute nonsense"". Hugo BachegaReporting from Kyiv Tensions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant have alarmed the world. For days, Ukrainian and Russian officials have blamed each other for attacking the site, although who has done what remains unclear. Itâs hard to independently confirm whatâs happening there. Russian forces captured the complex in early March, although Ukrainian technicians are still operating it. Itâs not clear why Russia would attack a site it already controls. Observers have said it could be a strategy to play on Western fears of a nuclear disaster, and degrade the military support for Ukraine. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company Enerhoatom, told me the workers are under pressure and in danger, and some had been captured, beaten and tortured. Again, these are allegations that canât be independently verified, but will certainly add to the concerns about the conditions at the plant. Kotin said the Russian plan was to eventually disconnect the plant from Ukraineâs grid and link it to the Russian system, a claim we canât verify. Calls are growing for Russia to allow international inspectors to visit the site. For now, though, the plant is safe, Kotin said. Civilians flee fighting on westbound trains from Donetsk The war in Ukraine has now been raging for more than five months. Here's a quick recap of where things stand and how we got here: What's the big picture? Russia invaded Ukraine in February, but failed in its advance on the capital Kyiv. By April it had pulled back to focus on gaining control of the whole eastern Donbas region, where separatists supported by Moscow have been fighting since 2014. The war has created a humanitarian crisis - the latest figures from UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, show that over 6.3 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. Ukraine is usually the world's fourth-largest grain exporter but disruption to harvests and shipping have caused steep price hikes - in Nigeria, for example, the cost of staples such as pasta and bread has increased by as much as 50%. Meanwhile, European gas prices are climbing as Russia restricts supplies. What's happening at Zaporizhzhia? Russia seized the nuclear plant, the biggest in Europe, in March but kept its Ukrainian employees. Ukraine said parts of the facility have been ""seriously damaged"" by Russian military strikes and accused them of ""blackmailing the entire world"". Russia has blamed Ukraine for the attacks. The UN's nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to any military action in its vicinity, warning of a ""very real risk of a nuclear disaster"". Latest fighting on the ground Ukraine says it is planning a counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied south of the country, and its forces have been shelling a key bridge in the city of Kherson. The Antonivskyi crossing is one of only two points where Russian troops can gain access to territory they have occupied west of the Dnipro river. In the north-eastern city of  Kharkiv, it's reported that one person's been killed and another injured in a Russian rocket attack. We've been reporting on the situation in Zaporizhzhia, where Ukraine and Russia have both accused each other of shelling the city's nuclear site. Now let's hear from a Ukrainian nuclear watchdog official about why Russia may want to focus its efforts on the area. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, Ukraine's ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says Russian forces want to cause electricity
blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling the Zaporizhzhia
nuclear complex. He also calls for an international mission to
the plant this month. ""We will use all possible channels of diplomacy to bring the
IAEA and UN closer to conducting this mission,"" Tsymbaliuk tells reporters in Vienna, insisting the visit must happen ""no later than the end of this month"". Svyatoslav KhomenkoBBC World Service, Kyiv One of Ukraineâs most influential presidential advisers, Mykhailo Podolyak, tells the BBC there are effectively no channels of peace negotiations open between Kyiv and Moscow. âThere are only channels [of negotiations] about exhanging bodies and POWs,"" he says. ""Russia is a country for whom there is no humane approach to war or to treating civilians in occupied territories. Russia is a different civilisation. âAfter six months of this war, we canât continue believing that it will fulfil any agreements.â Podolyak has been by President Volodymyr Zelenskyâs side since the start of the full-scale invasion and is one of the key figures shaping Ukraineâs position. He says Kyiv will join negotiations with Russia when a realistic starting point is in sight, instead of what he described as a Russian ultimatum where Moscow intends to annex all occupied territories. Ukraineâs aim, says Podolyak, is restoring state borders as of March 2014, including Russia-annexed occupied Crimea. Otherwise, he says, there wonât be lasting peace. You may remember that, in the last few weeks, Turkey and the UN brokered a deal to allow shipments to leave Ukraine. The country's ports had been blocked since the start of the conflict, and a vessel called the Razoni became the first grain ship to set sail under the new agreement. The Razoni left Odesa on 1 August and had been bound for the Lebanese port of Tripoli, but over the weekend it ground to a halt and dropped anchor near southern Turkey. In a tweet, Ukraine's embassy in Beirut said,externalthe buyer of its grain cargo has refused to accept the delivery because of delays to the shipment. The buyer has not been named, but Ukraine's embassy said a new one is being sought and the ship might end up going to another country. Since the Razoni's departure, five other ships have left Ukraine. One of them, the Turkish-flagged ship Polarnet, has already arrived in the northern Turkish port of Derince and is expected to unload its cargo today. Frank GardnerBBC News, Security Correspondent Ukrainian military inspect the site of a Russian missile strike in the Donetsk region Russia's military could be unable to operate the high-tech weapons and communications systems it has been using in Ukraine if the West were to tighten export controls, says a report. Almost all Moscow's modern military systems depend on Western-made microelectronics, the report says. Moscow has found ways to bypass sanctions and export controls. If the loopholes could be closed, says Rusi, the report authors, Russia's military might be permanently degraded. Researchers for Rusi, the Royal United Services Institute, spent months in Ukraine, examining 27 of Russia's most modern military systems, either captured, brought down or abandoned by Russian troops. They discovered at least 450 different kinds of unique, foreign-made components, most built in the US but also in other Western countries. You can read morehere. Jack BurgessBBC News Live reporter More now from Prof Claire Corkhill - a nuclear material degradation expert who we've been speaking to, from the University of Sheffield. Another major risk at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia power plant is the possibility of a nuclear waste storage site getting hit by a missile, which ""could lead to a release of radioactivity"", Corkhill says. She says the consequences of this wouldn't be as wide-reaching and severe asa loss of coolant accident, but it could still be extremely dangerous. ""All it takes is for one missile to hit the wrong area and then it's serious,"" Corkhill says. Since Russia seized the plant - the largest in Europe - in March, its Ukrainian employees have been kept there to work. There have been concernsstress could impact the workers' ability to safely carry out their duties at the nuclear site. It's not the type of environment you want to be working under duress"" Prof Claire Corkhill Ukraine and Russia have both accused each other of shelling the plant over the weekend -Ukraine has said attacks damaged three radiation sensorsand left a worker injured, leading to a reactor needing to be disconnected from the system. Corkhill says although it's a ""precarious situation"" it gives her confidence workers at the plant were able to take actions ""in a safe way to stop a serious accident"". Hugo BachegaReporting from Kyiv The head of Ukraineâs state nuclear power company Enerhoatom has accused Russian soldiers of turning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into a military base, using it to launch attacks against Ukrainian positions. Petro Kotin tells me the threat to the plant is great, but the site remains safe. ""They [Russian forces] use it [the power plant] like a shield against the Ukrainian forces, because nobody from Ukraine is going to make something. ""The Ukrainian Armed Forces know that these are Ukrainian personnel and this is a Ukrainian plant and there are Ukrainian people [there] so we are not going to kill our people, our staff and damage our infrastructure."" He says 500 Russian soldiers are at the complex, and Russia has positioned rocket launchers in the area of the plant. For days, Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the site. Ukraine says two workers have been wounded, and three radiation sensors damaged. The complex has been under Russian occupation since early March, but Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Since Russia began its attacks on Ukraine in February, we've seen images of destruction and hardship throughout the country. Five months later, life for its citizens contrasts significantly from region to region. Here are some recent photos showing how life varies around the country. Life is hard in the eastern city Sloviansk, north of Donetsk - residents fill up canisters with clean water on Saturday In neighbouring Kramatorsk, an elderly woman is among civilians evacuating by bus, hoping to find safety away from the eastern region - they are embarking on a long trip to Germany The evacuation of citizens from Donetsk region continues - Sanya is on a train with her two children and her mother Lumelia, heading towards Dnipro Shoppers in a Kharviv supermarket on Sunday are met with the sight of an armed Ukrainian soldier pushing a trolley while he stocks up on supplies Meanwhile, in the capital Kyiv, life is returning to some normality - opera lovers watch Giuseppe Verdi's opera Rigoletto at the National Opera of Ukraine, on Saturday Sunbathers in the eastern port of Chornomorsk watch the cargo ship Fulmar S arrive at the port on Sunday - it is one of the ships that will transport grain, now exports have resumed The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region has signed a decree that will enable a referendum to take place for the region to join the Russian Federation, RIA Novosti news agency reports. Southern Zaporizhzhia is under Russian control and it is the focus of this next stage of the war as Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant suffers heavy shelling. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the plant, which has prompted warnings of a ""nuclear disaster"" from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Jack BurgessBBC News Live reporter We've been speaking to Prof Claire Corkhill - a nuclear material degradation expert at the University of Sheffield. She says the more missiles fired and mines planted around Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the higher the risk of ""very serious consequences that would spread radiation"". Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the plant over the weekend. The plant was seized by the Russians early in the war - in March - but kept its Ukrainian employees. Corkhill calls it a ""very high risk situation"", and says her biggest concern is if a missile were to hit critical infrastructure. She says if this happened there would be a chance the water continually pumping around the nuclear reactor's core wouldn't be able to cool it down any more. The very worst case scenario is a loss of coolant accident - precisely what happened at Fukushima"" Prof Claire Corkhill This could lead to a meltdown and a series of hydrogen explosions that could release radiation over many kilometres, Corkhill says, adding ""this almost happened backin March this year"". However, she says the likelihood of a serious accident is unclear and says the
reactors themselves are heavily reinforced - so should be able to withstand a
direct hit. Read about the incident at Fukushimahere. Ukraine is usually the world's fourth-largest grain exporter. It normally produces 42% of the world's sunflower oil, 16% of its maize and 9% of its wheat. Wheat exports from Russia - the world's largest exporter - are also down. Western sanctions do not target Russian agriculture, but the Kremlin argues they have hindered exports by hiking insurance rates and affecting payments. Ships have begun to
leave Ukraine carrying grain in recent days, following a deal between the two nations brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. The first ship to do so left the port of Odesa carrying 26,000 tonnes of corn, bound for Lebanon, becoming the first cargo ship to have been able to leave the nation since February, when Russia began its naval blockade in the Black Sea.

"War on drugs a 'failure', new Colombia leader warns","This video can not be played Watch: The moment Colombia's new president is sworn into office Colombian President Gustavo Petro has called for a fresh global strategy to combat illegal drugs trafficking. Speaking at his inauguration, the country's first ever left-wing leader declared the ""war on drugs"" a failure. Hundreds of thousands of people died in Colombia's decades-long civil war, fuelled in part by the narcotics trade. The 62-year-old former Bogota mayor and ex-rebel fighter was elected in June on a radical manifesto promising to fight inequality and ban new oil projects. Mr Petro told a crowd of his supporters in Bogota that it is time for a new global convention that ""accepts the war on drugs has failed."" ""It has left a million dead Latin Americans during 40 years,"" he said, ""and it leaves 70,000 North Americans dead by overdose each year."" More than 50 years ago US President Richard Nixon kickstarted a global anti-narcotics strategy that emphasised criminalisation and the use of police force, which became known as the ""war on drugs."" Colombia's newly sworn-in president said the strategy had merely strengthened the power of mafia gangs and weakened Latin American states over decades. In Colombia, whichaccording to estimates produces more than half of the world's cocaine,external, criminal groups and local militias are heavily involved in the drug's production and transportation to consumers around the world - including in the US and Europe. Mr Petro's predecessor, Ivan Duque, made the war on drugs a key priority of his government - enlisting substantial US support to crack down on cocaine production across the Colombian countryside. Supporters cheered Colombia's new president at his inauguration speech on Sunday More than 100,000 supporters gathered in Bogota's main square on Sunday to watch the former Marxist rebel make history by being sworn in as Colombia's first left-wing leader. He will serve with Francia MÃ¡rquez, who was elected alongside Mr Petro to serve as Colombia's first black vice-president. ""I do not want two countries, just as I do not want two societies, I want a strong, just and united Colombia,"" Mr Petro said after being sworn in, Reuters news agency reports. June's vote was held amid widespread discontent at the way the country had been run, and there were anti-government protests last year in which dozens of people died. The new leader was elected on a radical manifesto to fight inequality by providing free university education, pension reforms, and high taxes on unproductive lands - a departure for Colombia which up until now has voted only conservative presidents into office. He also pledged to fully implement a 2016 peace deal that ended a 50-year long conflict with the communist guerrilla group, Farc, and to seek negotiations with the still-active ELN rebels. Mr Petro's inauguration marks a major political change in direction for the country, which for decades had been led by moderates and conservatives.
