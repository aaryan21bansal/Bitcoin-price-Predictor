How is UK preparing for no deal?,"The government has released an assessment of the possible effects of a no-deal Brexit on the UK, after MPs demanded that it be made public. The document, marked as ""Official Sensitive"" and dated 2 August 2019,outlines a series of ""reasonable worst-case planning assumptions"". It was drawn up as part of ""Operation Yellowhammer"" - the name for the government's contingency plan to prepare for leaving the European Union (EU) without a deal. The government says it is spending an extra Â£2.1bn on no-deal planning and is updating these planning assumptions. So, what does the document say and what is being done - as far as we know - to prepare for no-deal? What Yellowhammer document says: Between 50-85% of UK lorries travelling to the EU may not be ready for French customs Lack of readiness and limited space in French ports could cut HGV traffic by 40-60% and lead to disruption lasting three months This would lead to significant queues in Kent. In a worst-case scenario, it could take lorries up to two-and-a-half days before being able to cross into France What's being done: To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The Port of Dover in Kent handles approximately 10,500 lorries a day. To prevent nearby roads from clogging up, the government has a traffic management plan codenamed Operation Brock. If the plan is activated, up to 2,000 lorries will be held in a queue leading to the port. Other traffic will be kept flowing around the queued-up lorries, in what is known as a contraflow system. A fallback option would be to divert lorries to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate - and use it to hold up to 6,000 lorries on the runway at any one time. If further capacity was still required, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the 10-mile  M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park. But there is a still a lot of confusion, according to Rona Hunnisett, from the Freight Transport Association. ""The report shows there's still significant detail to be clarified if Britain is to keep trading efficiently,"" she says. ""Businesses can only prepare for, and implement, new processes once, and still need confirmation of what they are to adopt in the way of new practices."" What Yellowhammer document says: Certain types of fresh food supply will decrease Key ingredients may be in shorter supply There will not be an overall shortage of food in the UK, but may be reduced availability and choice Prices may increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" What's being done: The government has said that it will continue to recognise EU standards for food being imported into the UK, to minimise disruption. The British Retail Consortium has said,externalretailers are doing all they can to prepare for no-deal, but will not be able to prevent all negative effects. It stresses that many fresh fruits and vegetables will be out of season in the UK and that there will be a shortage of warehouse space ahead of Christmas. ""No deal Brexit would be extremely disruptive to the supply chains that we operate, particularly the fresh food supply chains,"" Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's told BBC News. ""There will inevitably be disruption simply because we've never done this before,"" he added, although he also said that previous delays to the Brexit date mean ""there's probably more understanding of what could go wrong and therefore more contingency planning"". Another factor is what tariffs (the taxes on imports) will be charged on food coming into the UK. The governmentpublished a ""tariff schedule"",externalin March, which removed most tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit That means some food from outside the EU that currently attract a tariff could be cheaper, but some goods from the EU that are currently imported with 0% tariffs, like beef and dairy, will now carry tariffs, and so could become more expensive. What Yellowhammer document says: Supply chains for medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at the Channel ports While some products can be stockpiled, others cannot because they have a short shelf life It will not be practical to stockpile products to cover expected delays of up to six months An increase in inflation would ""significantly impact"" adult social care providers and may lead to some failing, with smaller providers impacted within two-three months. What's being done: At the end of June, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) started putting out contracts for freight, warehouse space and fridges. These will be used to stockpile medicines and fly in those which cannot be stored, like radioisotopes for cancer treatment. Of the Â£2.1bn pledged for no-deal preparations, Â£434m has been set aside for this. That includes a Â£25m contract for planes to bring in emergency medical supplies within 24 hours. Ahead of the UK's original departure date of 29 March - then extended to 12 April - the DHSC said thousands of medicines had been analysed to work out what might be affected by supply disruption from the EU. Suppliers stockpiled an additional six weeks' worth of these drugs over and above the usual ""buffer"" stock. This exercise is being repeated to ensure the department is ""as prepared for leaving the EU without a deal in October as it was on 29 March and 12 April"". Specific ferry routes were made available for suppliers to book onto 11 weeks before the no-deal deadline in March. Six weeks before the 31 October deadline, the government had only just opened the bidding process to freight firms competing to transport medicines. So the pharmaceutical industry doesn't currently know which ports and ferry routes will be made available. Steve Bates, an industry official working with government on no-deal planning, said the time frame to make sure everything was in place for the October deadline was ""significantly compressed"". He said the difference for drug suppliers between three months and potentially three weeks to put plans into action was ""material"". On social care, the government website advises providers to draw up contingency plans and support EU staff who may be working for them. Plans are in place to ensure there are enough essential medicines like insulin What Yellowhammer document says: There will be no immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies However, there are likely to be significant price rises if the UK splits from the EU single energy market, which could happen months or years after Brexit This could lead to some energy companies leaving the market Public water supplies are likely to remain largely unaffected What's being done: In the event of no-deal, the UK has said it will not impose tariffs on electricity and gas coming into the country. However, if the value of the pound falls in response to a no-deal Brexit, it will become more expensive to import energy from abroad. The government intends to remain part of the single energy market, in order for the UK's energy laws to continue to work after Brexit and that supplies are not disrupted. Water is unlikely to be affected, although there is still a low risk in the event of a chemical supply problem. The Yellowhammer report says water companies are well-prepared and have significant stockpiles of critical chemicals. What Yellowhammer document says: The government's planned short-term solution for the border is likely to be unsustainable because of the ""economic, legal and biosecurity risks"" it presents Trade between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic will be ""severely disrupted"" Some businesses will stop trading, some will move and some will experience higher costs that they may pass on to customers Agriculture will be hardest hit, leading to job losses, protests and direct action with road blockages Growth of the ""illegitimate economy"" around the border ""where criminal and dissident groups already operate"" What's being done: The UK government has said it is committed not to have any physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. On 13 Marchit published its contingency plan,externalto avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It said it would not bring in new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for any goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland, in the event of no-deal. But this will only be a temporary measure while negotiations take place to find longer-term solutions. Government has no plans for Irish border controls To protect people's health, some plant and animal products that come into Northern Ireland from outside the EU, via Ireland, will still need to be checked. The UK government has said these checks will not happen at the border itself, but it has not specified exactly where they will take place. It remains unclear what will happen to goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Ireland. Under EU rules, checks would normally be required at the point certain goods enter the EU single market. The Irish government says it is securing additional space, and has recruited more customs and agriculture staff to allow for a ""significant increase in checks and procedures"". What Yellowhammer document says: Protests and counter-protests likely across the UK May be a rise in public disorder and community tensions Information-sharing between UK and EU law enforcement will be disrupted What is being done: The National Police Coordination Centre will plan the allocation of officers across the country althoughit has said there has been no intelligence,externalto suggest that any protests will not be peaceful. The government has also established the International Crime and Coordination Centre, which is supposed to help the police cope with the change to the UK's relationship with law enforcement agencies in the EU. 10 ways you could be affected by no deal Most imports tariff-free under no-deal plan What could happen to food prices after Brexit?

Council fears over food supply,"Legal school meal nutrition standards may need to be amended, or discarded, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to internal local council planning documents seen by the BBC. The standards are designed to make sure school children are fed healthy food. Many councils say school meal costs will rise and funding for free school meals increase if there is no-deal. The government said the food industry was ""well versed at dealing with scenarios that can affect food supply."" ""We have a highly-resilient food supply chain and consumers in the UK have access to a range of sources of food. This will continue to be the case when we leave the EU."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisted earlier on Mondaythat no-deal Brexit preparations are on track. Some councils are anticipating they will not meet nutrition standards because of a rise in food prices and restriction of choice anticipated after a no-deal Brexit, particularly on fresh imports from Europe. For example, North Ayrshire Council says it ""might need to amend school nutrition standards"", in its internal Brexit planning document. Local councils are legally obliged to provide high standard food to vulnerable users of public services and to manage the food supply challenges of leaving the EU without a deal. Brexit: How have UK councils prepared? Brexit: Local councils to receive Â£56.5m fund Other councils, such as North Tyneside, report that ""special dietary requirements may be difficult to meet"" and that ""if fresh produce is difficult to come by"" schools should ""increase use of tins and frozen goods"". Many councils say that prices for school meals will rise, and central government funding for free school meals will have to increase. Some also mention the possible use of food banks. Slough has contacted food banks in its area to check contingency plans for food shortages, and some Scottish councils have already increased funding for extra provision from food banks. The government says that school food standards must continue to be adhered to post Brexit, but thatschools have ""significant flexibilities,,externalwhich they can refer to if certain items are in short supply."" Bedford Council's planning document from its internal Brexit planning team says care homes are ""advised to hold four to six weeks supply of non-perishable foodstuffs"". Hastings Council's internal Brexit risk document even goes as far as saying: ""There might be the need for rationing. The severity would depend on what was available and particularly the duration of any shortages."" Insiders suggest this is a reference to the prevention of stockpiling, more than a return to wartime ration books. The documents seen by the BBC date from the end of last year - up until last month - but predate the appointment of Boris Johnson as prime minister. Most take at face value the government's national assessment for March that there will be no impact of a no-deal Brexit on overall food supply, but there could be an impact on price and choice. An October no-deal Brexit would come, however, at a time when the UK is particularly dependent on European imports for its fresh food, and when there is littleto no excess warehousing space, unlike in March. One catering industry veteran, Andy Jones, the chair of the Public Sector 100 Group of caterers, backed the councils: ""Given a no-deal Brexit, they're being very sensible. They're being very cautious, and rightly so, we're going into something that we don't know about, we're going to the unknown. ""If a no-deal Brexit happens, I feel that the supply chain long term will absolutely be under pressure. And that will affect the most vulnerable in society."" Brexit: Food industry seeks no-deal competition waiver Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM Mr Jones said concern about rationing was excessive, unless supply disruptions lasted beyond the current four-to-six week worst case assumption. But he confirmed that menus would change and that ""certain nutritional standards will have to be altered or adapted for a short period of time"" for schools and hospitals. He said public services such as new hospitals, had been built without food storage, and that caterers were now effectively ""fighting each other for space"" in warehouses. Bidfood, one of the key suppliers to schools, hospitals, care homes and prisons, said it was now preparing for no-deal again having bought up warehouse space and assessed and identified alternatives for 400 key food imports to store. ""The key areas that we're looking at in terms of making sure we have surety of supply is around those key things that we import, like pasta, tuna, tinned tomatoes, olive oil, chips, french fries, rice. These are not exotic commodities, these are staples of everyday life, and we want to make sure that all of our customers can get those,"" said Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood. He said there was only limited scope to replace imports with domestic production. ""Because of our changing tastes, unless we're going to go back to a menu based on the 1700s, we are going to look at imported products and imported tastes and imported flavours."" However, he said his company would be ""ready"" to take care of key customers and he does not anticipate ""calamitous"" problems. ""There will be challenges around availability, delays at ports and around currency fluctuations,"" he said. He added that the government would have to increase funding for free school meals, and that it would be ""more complicated"" but manageable for suppliers to meet more stringent standards in Scotland based on nutritional values. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was meeting regularly with industry and retailers ""to make sure we are prepared for all scenarios as we leave the EU."" ""The food industry is well versed at dealing with scenarios that can affect food supply, from adverse weather damaging crops in other countries to transport issues abroad. The UK has robust supply chains across a range of countries to provide our food, in addition to the countless domestic food producers across the UK,"" it added. Bedford, Hastings, Slough, North Ayrshire and North Tyneside councils confirmed that the documents seen by the BBC formed part of their no-deal Brexit planning processes.

10 ways no deal could affect you,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""do or die"" by the 31 October - the date the UK must depart if no deal has been reached. But a government document outlining ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" in the event of such a no-deal Brexit has warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder. An extra Â£2.1bn of funding has been announced to help deal with the consequences of no deal. How could you be affected if the UK does leave the EU without an agreement? What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects. Almost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal. Thefive-page document spelling out the government's worst-case assumptions under Operation Yellowhammer,external- the government's no-deal contingency plan - warns: Some fresh food supplies will decrease Key ingredients for food made in the UK may be in shorter supply There won't be a shortage of food overall, but there could be reduced availability and choice Prices may also increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" Supermarkets themselves have warned thatthere could be empty shelves and higher prices. In preparation, supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg. Stockpiling is more of a challenge at this time of year too, businesses say, aswarehouse capacity is already strained by the seasonal stock build-up ahead of Black Friday and Christmas,external. The government has said it will continue to recognise EU standards for imported food, to minimise disruption. It has alsopublished a ""tariff schedule"",,externalwhich has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of no deal. Shoppers planning to buy from companies based in the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland after a no-deal Brexit have also been warnedcredit and debit card charges may be higher and payments may take longer,external. Government advice for the food and drink sector,external Government advice on buying things from Europe after Brexit,external What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal impact? Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there arelikely to be significant price rises,externalfor businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns. The market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets. Yellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms ""exit"" the energy market, ""exacerbating"" the economic and political impact of Brexit. The warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which saidthe UK could be ""more vulnerable to supply shortages,externalin the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  46%UK domestic production 45%Imported via European pipelines, inc from Russia and Norway 8%Liquefied natural gas imports The risk would arise as a result of the UK's exit from the EU's Internal Energy Market, it said. The bulk of the UK's natural gas imports come via Norway, which is part of the Internal Energy Market, although it is not an EU member. But the government says trade in gas between the UK and Norway will continue in its current form regardless. Brexit 'could leave UK short of energy' Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe. If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork. Travel to Ireland will not change, even if there's no deal. You'll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before. Passports The government isadvising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months,externalif you are travelling to most countries in Europe - thefull list is here,external. Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document. But the government has now warned that this time carried over may not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit. You can check if your passport has enough time leftwith this government tool.,external You'll need torenew your passport before travelling,externalif you do not have enough validity left. It usually takes three weeks. Visas You won't need a visa for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study. When new rules are confirmed, information about visa requirements will be oneach country's travel advice page.,external Border control The government has also advised that at EU borders you may need to: show a return or onward ticket show you have enough money for your stay use separate queueing lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens The government's Yellowhammer report also warns there may also be increased immigration checks at EU borders causing delays at airports and ports. European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, thenin theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist. The government is advising travellers ""whether there's a deal or not"" to ""get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover"". Ministers say it is ""particularly important"" to get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition.,externalThis is because the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not. Travel However you intend to travel, in the event of no-deal Brexit, the government says, you should check before you leave for any delays or disruption. If you intend to drive in the EU, you'll need some extra documents: a ""green card"", which proves your insurance provides the minimum required cover (obtained from your vehicle insurance company) a GB sticker an International Driving Permit for some countries (you cancheck if you need one,externalon the Post Office website) The government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal. An earlier government assessment hadwarned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK,external, but Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensuretheir services run as smoothly as possible. However, the government does warn some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run. Pets After Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow adifferent process, involving a number of vet's tests,external. The process could take up to four months. Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway,the government has warned that it may become more expensive.,external Full government travel advice,external How will it affect my holidays to Europe? While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there areconcerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse. The government's Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can't because of their short shelf life, it says. More than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, andabout 7,000 come from or via the EU. Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU. The government has announced a further Â£434m of funding and other measures, including: extra warehouse space for medicines securing additional roll-on, roll-off freight capacity in ports away from Dover and Folkestone building buffer stocks booking plane space for products requiring immediate shipment making changes to regulatory requirements strengthening processes to deal with shortages However, the National Audit Office has said there are still""significant"" gapsin the government's preparation regarding the NHS and care homes. Government advice on medicine supply,external Should NHS patients be worried? About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries. The UK government has requested that EU countries reciprocate its promise to uphold the rights of EU citizens in the UK, meaning UK citizens living in the EU would be able to continue their lives broadly as now. In event of no deal, this would ensure they would have continued access to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and other services. However, the government's Yellowhammer document warns that as UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship, they can ""expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time"". The government has announced a public information campaign and an increase in consular support for Britons living abroad, costing Â£138m. It advises UK citizens living in the EU to subscribe to updates from the relevantcountry advice pages.,external Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU with no deal. This will depend on decisions made by each country. However, the UK government says it is seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights, as a top priority. Its Yellowhammer report warns that whileEU countries should treat people with urgent needs, they may be required to pay. This could mean some people facing ""substantial costs"".,external Information on how to access healthcare abroad,externalcan be found on the NHS website. Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU. Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements, which apply to EU countries. These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income or gain - and determine which country has primary taxing rights. Full government advice for UK nationals living in the EU,external How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? Drivers UK nationals who live in the EU, European Economic Area or Switzerland should swap their UK driving licences for a local licence before 31 October 2019. If there is no deal, licence exchange arrangements may stop and UK licence holders may have to retake their driving test in the country where they live. The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK. There are currently 2.37 million EU nationals working in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The ONS has revised its estimates for overall arrivals to the UK - both from the EU and the rest of the world. Those new figures show the number of people arriving from the EU had been rising before the referendum. Statisticians have not yet adjusted the figures for EU immigration after 2016, but unrevised figures showed a steep decline. If you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has atool to find out what you need to do and when.,external Government advice on applying for settled and pre-settled status,external Home Office minister Brandon Lewis has warned thatthe UK will deport EU citizensafter Brexit if they do not apply for the right to remain in time. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure. As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU. But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply. UK businesses will need to apply the same processes to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world. Individuals may also have to pay VAT, duty and fees if they receive parcels worth more than Â£135. In March,the government published a 1,477-page documentoutlining its plans for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In October it published anupdate,externalto the plans which trade minister Conor Burns said are designed to support the UK economy. A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. Mostly, they are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. Under the temporary scheme, 88% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment, 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. How will the new tariff system work? Government guide to no-deal tariffs,external Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market. UK house pricesrose at a slower rate in the year to July than at any time since September 2012,according to the Office of National Statistics. Brexit uncertainty meant key aspects of the housing market were""pretty much flatlining"", the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said. The Bank of England says theimpact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant. It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a ""disorderly Brexit"". In July, the Office for Budget responsibility estimated a possible 10%fall in house prices,externalby 2021 in the event of no-deal. But bad news for homeowners might be better news for first time buyers trying to get a foot on the property ladder. Will the value of your home change in 2019? Up to85% of lorries using the main channel crossings ""may not be ready"" for French customs and could face queues of two-and-a-half days,,externalthe government's Yellowhammer report warns. These queues at Channel ports could reduce the flow of trucks to 40-60% of current levels within a day, it says, with the worst disruption lasting up to three months. Even after that time, traffic flows may only reach 50-70% of current levels and delays could lead to queues in Kent and other routes to France for significantly longer, the report said. A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU A jargon-busting guide to the key terms In the event of bottlenecks, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20. Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side. If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used. Kent County Council says it hasemployed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal. To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The government has also announced Â£344m more funding to be spent on new border and customs operations. Could leaving with no deal cause traffic jams? Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? What would no deal mean for lorry drivers? More than 16,000 British students studied on placements organised by the Erasmus study abroad scheme - in place since the 1980s - in 2016-17. UK universities say they would expecta similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.,external The government and the EU have agreed thatpeople who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them,external. This is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK. The government has also issued a ""guarantee"" that funding will be available to UK organisations who have had Erasmus applications approved by the European Commission at the time the UK departs, but which have not yet begun. Institutions are beingadvised to apply for this ""HMG guarantee"",externalto ensure they get the funding.

'No prospect of deal' unless backstop scrapped,"This video can not be played Johnson: EU 'a bit negative' over backstop demands Unless the UK's withdrawal agreement with Brussels is reopened and the backstop abolished there is no prospect of a deal, Downing Street has said. The strong statement came after the EU pushed back against Boris Johnson's proposal to implement ""alternative arrangements"" for the UK-Irish border. Mr Johnson has said the backstop is ""anti-democratic"" and must be scrapped. European Council President Donald Tusk said it was ""an insurance to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland"". Meanwhile, the government has announced UK officials will stop attending most EU meetings from 1 September. The Department for Exiting the European Union said it would ""unshackle"" them from discussions ""about the future of the Union after the UK has left"" and allow them to focus on ""our immediate national priorities"". What did we learn from the prime minister's Brexit letter? Are Germany and France ready for Brexit? What is the backstop? No-deal Brexit plan threatens UK fuel plants Later this week Mr Johnson will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron for the first time since entering No 10. Ahead of that, in aletter to European Council President Tusk,external, he called for the backstop to be removed from the withdrawal agreement reached between the EU and his predecessor, Theresa May, arguing it risked undermining the Northern Irish peace process. Mr Johnson said the reaction to his demand for the backstop to be scrapped had been ""a bit negative"" but ""we will get there"". He said he would enter Brexit talks with EU leaders with ""a lot of oomph"". Mr Johnson added: ""I think there is a real sense now that something needs to be done with this backstop. We can't get it through Parliament as it is."" He reiterated his view that EU countries were less likely to make concessions to the UK ""as long as they think there's a possibility that Parliament will block Brexit"". The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity, and both the UK and EU agree that whatever happens after Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. The backstop is a position of last resort to guarantee that, but if implemented, it would see Northern Ireland stay aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. Mrs May's withdrawal agreement has been voted down three times by MPs. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A series of voices from the European side rejected Mr Johnson's assertions. Mr Tusk said those opposing the backstop without ""realistic alternatives"" supported re-establishing a hard border. This was the reality ""even if they do not admit it"", he added. The European Commission said Mr Johnson's letter did not contain a ""legally operational solution"" to prevent a hard Irish border. ""It does not set out what any alternative arrangements could be,"" a spokeswoman said, and ""recognises that there is no guarantee such arrangements would be in place by the end of the transitional period"". Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit spokesman for the European Parliament, said the backstop was ""a vital insurance policy... supported by the people of the island of Ireland"". And speaking in Iceland, Chancellor Merkel said: ""Once we have a practical solution to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement continues to apply, then we don't need the backstop of course."" A Downing Street spokesperson insisted the UK government was ""ready to negotiate, in good faith, an alternative to the backstop, with provisions to ensure that the Irish border issues are dealt with where they should always have been: in the negotiations on the future agreement between the UK and the EU"". The question is whether Boris Johnson's letter to the EU is intended as the start of negotiations - or designed to be the end of them. He's suggested the only way to get a deal is to take the backstop out. Not to time limit it, or modify it, but to bin it. But if he has a fully-fledged, different plan up his sleeve, why he isn't spelling out more detail of those ""alternative arrangements""? And why can't Downing Street say what additional reassurances would be available to the Irish government in the absence of a backstop, if trade talks falter? The lack of detail on Plan B has made some critics in his own party wonder if his Plan A is simply to make an offer the EU can't accept and then blame them for no deal. But No 10 insists he'd do a deal quickly if the EU was more flexible. In other words, Brussels would be expected to blink first as the prospect of no deal approaches. So far, though, the EU is staring him out. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was unclear what the prime minister thought he was negotiating. ""He needs to recognise that by just holding the threat of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October towards the European Union isn't going to bring about a change, it's going to make things much worse,"" he said. ""He created this arbitrary date by his behaviour during the Tory Party leadership campaign. He needs to wise up and stop the nonsense of 31 October and start talking seriously.""

No-deal Brexit plan threatens UK fuel plants,"The future of the UK's fuel refineries could be threatened by a no-deal Brexit, according to an internal local authority document seen by the BBC. Under current government plans for no deal, they face a ""danger to viability"" from cheaper imports, while exports to the EU are set to be hit with tariffs. Concern is widespread in an industry deemed crucial for both economic and national security. The government said it was working with the industry to prepare for Brexit. ""We will continue to work flat out to prepare for the potential impact on UK refineries in the event of Brexit without a deal, and to be responsive to the needs of all UK businesses and consumers both as we prepare to leave the EU and afterwards,"" it added. There are six major petroleum refineries in the UK, supporting around 120,000 jobs directly and contributing about Â£8.6bn to the economy. They turn crude oil into petrol and diesel as well as products such as jet fuel. The concern, which is shared by both the Scottish and Welsh governments, relates to the UK government's decision not to apply tariffs - taxes on trade - to imports of petrol in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The decision was made to lessen the inflationary impact on prices in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The current tariff on fuel imports from non-EU countries is 4.7%. However, under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, a zero tariff rate must apply to petrol imports from all countries, opening up the UK to Russian fuel imports. At the same time, the EU has said it will apply a tariff, under WTO rules, of 4.7% to UK exports, making the trade with, for example, Ireland ""uneconomical"", according to insiders. While a flood of cheaper imports could initially mean lower fuel prices for consumers, the industry says relying on foreign suppliers will ultimately lead to higher prices. But the government has also said that reversing its no-deal zero import tariff plan would lead to higher prices for consumers. No-deal papers reveal council fears over food supply 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Brexit: A really simple guide The Irish market is of specific importance to the Pembrokeshire refinery run by US firm Valero. A document from Anglesey Council says: ""Pembrokeshire Valero is a significant contributor to overall UK fuel supply and if they cannot compete on equal terms with EU markets, then there is a danger to their viability."" The fuel industry says relying on foreign suppliers will ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers Stephen Marcos Jones of the UK Petroleum Industry Association says the changes to tariffs, ""distorts the competition for us, it means the importers have an advantage over the UK refining industry"". ""We could end up in a situation where it becomes extremely uncompetitive for a domestic industry to stay in the UK,"" he adds. ""Do we really want to be dependent on a country like Russia for our fuel? Do we want to be dependent on any country outside of the UK?"" The issue has been raised at the key no-deal Cabinet planning sub-committee. And the threat of zero import tariffs to two UK refineries was mentioned in the leakedOperation Yellowhammer government planning document published on Sunday. The problem is that opening up the schedule of no-deal tariffs is bound to lead to demands from other industries aggrieved at not getting the same protection. Although the industry denies it, some in government fear that charging tariffs on all imported petrol will simply raise prices for consumers, in a visible manner. The local authority documents also reveal a range of contingency plans and discussions around possible, though not expected, fuel shortages following a no-deal Brexit. Aberdeen City Council lists as a low risk ""reduced/lack of fuel affecting waste disposal, school transportation etc"", and says that it has two weeks of bunkered fuel. But it also says that the ""NPA [the UK-wide National Planning Assumption] suggests that fuel shortages will largely impact on the south east, however fuel costs are likely to increase and fuel supply could be an issue"". Cars queuing for petrol during the fuel shortages of 2000 Dorset Council alongside others has identified ""key staff who would require fuel warrants"" - special licences to grant them access to fuel supplies. Sutton Council, which normally only half-fills its fuel stores due to cost and risk, ""will fill fuel bunkers to maximum"". And Chorley Council, in its recent Brexit risk report, says that on-site fuel tanks should be ""topped up on a weekly basis to ensure that fleet vehicles can continue to operate for longer in the event of fuel shortages"". Such moves are part of an already existing national fuel plan, created after the fuel protests and shortages seen in 2000. Fuel providers have already identified key petrol stations, priority users, and arranged the mechanics for waiving competition law so that competing suppliers are legally allowed to co-operate. Some councils have considered going further. Chichester District Council, for example, has decided to spend Â£30,000 on a fuelling station and a 24,000 litre fuel tank. In a confidential document from January this year, it says fuel should be available but ""might be limited at some point"" and existing stores ""could well last 8-10 days before we have to operate hand to mouth"".

Facebook to stop stalking you - but only if asked,"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg first promised the new tool at the firm's F8 developers conference Facebook is drawing back the veil to show what data it collects on users. Many may not like what they see. A feature in settings called Off-Facebook Activity will show all the apps and websites that send information about you to Facebook, which is then used to target ads more effectively. You will also be able to clear your history and prevent your future off-app behaviour being tapped. But one expert said the move was unlikely to have a big impact on the firm's profits. For now, it is rolling out very slowly, with only Ireland, South Korea and Spain getting access. But the goal is to eventually offer it globally. The initiative comes at a time when Apple and Mozilla have already taken steps to prevent Facebook and other services from tracking users from one online platform to another via their browsers. In addition, Germany's competition regulator had told the firm it needed to substantially restrict the way it collected and combined dataabout its members unless it sought more explicit consent than it had done. Facebook collects data from beyond its platform either because you have opted to use the social media site to log in to an app or, more likely, because a website uses something called Facebook Pixel to track your activities. This is why when you browse a website for new shoes, you find an ad popping up in your Facebook Newsfeed half-an-hour later telling you about that nifty pair of boots you've just been looking at. The Off-Facebook Activity setting will let you drill down into exactly what data various apps or sites are sharing about you - Facebook says the average smartphone user has 80 apps and uses 40 of them every month, so the list could be long. You will then be able to disconnect the data from your Facebook profile - either the whole lot or singling out individual sources. If you take advantage of this, it should mean that those shoe ads stop following you across the internet in quite such a persistent fashion. It is important to stress that Facebook will still collect the data, but it will be anonymised - they may know that lots of people have been looking at those boots but they won't know that they include you. Off-Facebook Activity has been more than a year in the making and fulfils a pledge made by Mark Zuckerberg at last year's F8 developer conference to give users greater control over how their data is used. The new tool will let users see which third-party sites and apps are feeding data into Facebook about them But how will users react to this feature - and what will it mean for Facebook's advertising business? I suspect that those people who do use it will be pretty horrified. It is one thing to know that in principle you are being tracked, quite another to see it in black and white. ""This is how much of the internet works,"" says Facebook rather defensively in a blog about the new tool. And in a briefing Stephanie Max, the product manager behind it, made the unlikely claim that the reason it collected the data was to help users ""discover businesses they care about."" If millions of users do investigate this new setting and then decide to disconnect the data, then that in theory could prove damaging to advertisers and to Facebook's bottom line. How much impact would there be, we asked Stephanie Max, if say 20% of users shut down the link between this stream of data and their Facebook profiles? ""We didn't do any modelling of that,"" she replied, going on to say that there was a lot of evidence that users valued having a personalised experience and that was intertwined with the way Facebook works currently. It would seem bizarre that Facebook would not have worked out in advance what impact this new transparency might have on its revenues, but the company may be right to be pretty relaxed. For one thing, it looks likely that finding and then acting on the Off-Facebook tool will be a very niche activity. For another, an expert on Facebook's advertising business says it is changing in ways that make the precise targeting of users less important. Mat Morrison, planning director at marketing agency Digital Whiskey, says advertisers are gradually waking up to the idea that targeting 23 year old men in High Wycombe who like mountain-biking and sushi is not that useful. ""Agencies are trying to tell clients to calm down about nano-targeting,"" he explained. ""When we began using Facebook data we could easily create nano-target audiences - only 20 people. Of course, this turns out to be a waste of everyone's time and money."" The story a few years ago was that the hugely expensive ad break in ITV's Coronation Street, which delivered a broad if poorly-defined audience, was being superseded by the precise targeting offered by social media ads. Now, says Morrison, the pendulum is swinging again and Facebook advertising is being valued for delivering a wide swathe of the population. ""Creating a broad consensus in the audience is what advertising has always been about,"" he says. So even if some of the Facebook population revolts against the constant tracking of their wider online activities - and remember the social media site will still have lots of data about them - it is unlikely that advertisers will desert what has become the prime destination for their messages. It is worth noting that two of the countries where the new setting is making its debut are in the European Union. The tech giant can show EU regulators that it is giving users more control over their data, without doing any damage to its ad revenues. Job done...

UK shale reserves may be less than estimated,"Cuardrilla have recently resumed fracking for shale gas in Lancashire Previous projections of the potential amount of shale gas under the UK may have been significantly overestimated, according to a new study. Instead of 50 years of gas at the current rate of consumption, thisnew research,externalsuggests there are just 5-7 years' supply. But the UK's fracking industry, which represents companies like Cuadrilla, dismissed the report. The said the sample size was too small to draw serious conclusions. What is fracking? Energy firm Cuadrilla resumes fracking Fracking boss calls government 'pathetic' Fracking tsar resigns over 'ridiculous' rules The recovery of shale gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking has been a slow moving and controversial affair in the UK over the past decade. Attempts by oil and gas companies to drill wells and extract gas have been held up by planning issues, concerns about earth tremors and public displays of disaffection over the issue. Through it all, the government and industry have maintained faith in the process. They argued that there was huge potential for fracked gas particularly in the Bowland shale, a geological formation that runs under Lancashire, Yorkshire, parts of the Midlands and into North Wales. Plans for test drilling have drawn public protests in a number of locations around the UK The optimistic view was based in part on a study published in 2013 by the British Geological Survey (BGS)which issued a very positive report,externalon the likely amount of gas in place under the Bowland. That study suggested that it wasone of the world's biggest reserves, containing some 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas. ""To put that in context,"" wrote former Prime Minister David Cameron at the time, ""even if we extract just a tenth of that figure, that is still the equivalent of 51 years' gas supply."" But there were concerns expressed at the time that the estimate was on the high side. Now, scientists at the University of Nottingham and the BGS have developed a new method for analysing the gas content of shale, which they believe gives them a more accurate estimate of the overall potential. ""In terms of the total gas in place, the mean value from the 2013 study was 1,300 trillion feet of gas, we are struggling to get anywhere above 200 trillion feet,"" said Prof Colin Snape from the University of Nottingham, the lead author on the paper. ""The data we've got from the two shales we've looked at are very consistent - and gas companies Cuadrilla and Third Energy have just published two papers in the last year where they have taken core samples and measured the gas that's evolved and that data is very, very consistent with our own data."" According to the new study, the amount of gas in place, assuming an economic recovery rate of 10% would be a maximum of 20 trillion cubic feet, which would equate to around seven years' worth of gas at current UK rates of consumption. Other researchers were impressed with the new method developed by the researchers at Nottingham. ""The results bring bad news to those hoping that northern England is floating on a bed of cheap and abundant gas,"" said Prof Stuart Haszeldine, Professor of Geology and Carbon Storage, University of Edinburgh, who was not involved with the study. ""Abundant hydrocarbons may have been generated in the past, but have leaked away to the Earth's surface many millions of years ago.  Not only have all those hydrocarbon horses bolted, but there is no longer a secure stable door to retain very large quantities of present-day gas in these shales."" However, some of the leading experts at the BGS were cautious in their interpretation of the study, even though several of their own scientists were involved in the paper. ""Early indications published today suggest that it is possible there is less shale gas resource present than previously thought,"" said Prof Mike Stephenson, chief scientist for decarbonisation and resource management, at the BGS. ""However the study considered only a very small number of rock samples from only two locations."" ""BGS has continued to study resource estimation in shales over the past 16 years and further studies are still required to further refine estimates of shale gas resources."" Cuadrilla, the company which has recently resumed fracking a shale gas well in Lancashire, was blunt in its rejection of the new paper. Protestors have tried to shut down Cuadrilla's fracking operations in Lancashire ""Those involved in publishing this should be embarrassed,"" said Francis Egan, Cuadrilla chief executive. ""We hold more data and technical experience of the Bowland shale than anyone else in the UK yet not once did anyone from this research group or Nottingham University contact us for our view or input."" UKOOG, the body which represents the UK's onshore oil and gas industry, also rejected the implications of the study. ""To date we have made significant advancements in the understanding of the resource potential contained within UK shale, with very encouraging results seen at both Springs Road and Preston New Road which have demonstrated properties in line with world class, US shale plays,"" said Ken Cronin, chief executive of UK Onshore Oil and Gas. ""What we know now is that we have a world class resource which has broadly supported the estimates originally published by the British Geological Survey. Indeed, in terms of potential gas flow indications, the results are at the upper end of our original forecasts."" ""The only way to provide accurate estimates of how much gas is likely to be produced is to drill, hydraulically fracture and test many wells,"" said Prof Quentin Fisher, from the University of Leeds, who was not involved with the study. ""Which is exactly the intention of companies holding shale gas licences in the UK."" Thestudy has been published,externalin the journal Nature Communications.

"Man dies of Legionnaires' after holiday in BulgariaJohn Cowan, from Hamilton, became ill during a break at a Bulgarian beach resort.Glasgow & West Scotland","A man from Lanarkshire has died from Legionnaires' disease after returning home from holiday in Bulgaria. John Cowan, from Hamilton, died in June a week after falling ill at the Hotel Kalofer in the Sunny Beach resort. The 43-year-old's family believe he contracted the airborne bacteria at the hotel and are threatening legal action against holiday firm Jet2. Jet2 said two sets of independent tests had found no evidence of contamination at the hotel. The flight and holiday operator confirmed two of its customers died shortly after returning to the UK from holiday in Bulgaria. Mr Cowan's mother Marie, a retired care assistant, said: ""When John came home he was feeling unwell. ""He was weak and his bones were aching. ""He basically stayed in bed most of that week - it wasn't until he started getting short of breath that we went to the GP. ""As soon as the doctor saw John he realised he needed urgent attention and phoned an ambulance which took him to Wishaw General."" John Cowan, 43, known as Jake to his friends, was a hotelier from Hamilton and died a week after coming back from holiday in Bulgaria Mrs Cowan said he was diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease at the North Lanarkshire hospital and his health deteriorated to the point that he went into cardiac arrest during surgery and died on 19 June - one week after returning from his holiday. Mr Cowan's brother Barry said the family was preparing to take civil legal action because of what he claims is inaction on the part of Jet2 and the hotel. He said: ""We are all devastated. ""We just want answers - to know why this happened, to know it will never happen to anyone else and to know why the tour operator and the hotel have done nothing to help."" Mark Gibson, a partner at Digby Brown solicitors, said: ""We are currently investigating a claim that a man died as a result of Legionnaires poisoning at a hotel in Bulgaria but as the case is at an early stage it would be inappropriate to comment further."" A spokesman for Jet2 said: ""Sadly, we can confirm that two customers recently passed away shortly after returning to the UK from holiday in Bulgaria. ""We would like to offer our heartfelt condolences to their families at this very difficult time, and we have been in constant contact to offer all the assistance and support that we can. ""The health and safety of our customers is our absolute priority. In response, and to support our investigation, two independent specialists were instructed to take samples from the hotel and a United Kingdom Accreditation Service-accredited laboratory conducted testing of the water samples for any contamination. ""The results of all their tests were negative. We will continue to assist the local authorities in their investigations as required. "" The firm added that as a precaution it had, along with other UK-based tour operators, transferred all customers and all future bookings to other hotels in the resort.

"UK shale reserves may be less than estimatedPrevious research suggested 50 years of shale gas under the UK, but a new study says it could be less than 10.Science & Environment","Cuardrilla have recently resumed fracking for shale gas in Lancashire Previous projections of the potential amount of shale gas under the UK may have been significantly overestimated, according to a new study. Instead of 50 years of gas at the current rate of consumption, thisnew research,externalsuggests there are just 5-7 years' supply. But the UK's fracking industry, which represents companies like Cuadrilla, dismissed the report. The said the sample size was too small to draw serious conclusions. What is fracking? Energy firm Cuadrilla resumes fracking Fracking boss calls government 'pathetic' Fracking tsar resigns over 'ridiculous' rules The recovery of shale gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking has been a slow moving and controversial affair in the UK over the past decade. Attempts by oil and gas companies to drill wells and extract gas have been held up by planning issues, concerns about earth tremors and public displays of disaffection over the issue. Through it all, the government and industry have maintained faith in the process. They argued that there was huge potential for fracked gas particularly in the Bowland shale, a geological formation that runs under Lancashire, Yorkshire, parts of the Midlands and into North Wales. Plans for test drilling have drawn public protests in a number of locations around the UK The optimistic view was based in part on a study published in 2013 by the British Geological Survey (BGS)which issued a very positive report,externalon the likely amount of gas in place under the Bowland. That study suggested that it wasone of the world's biggest reserves, containing some 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas. ""To put that in context,"" wrote former Prime Minister David Cameron at the time, ""even if we extract just a tenth of that figure, that is still the equivalent of 51 years' gas supply."" But there were concerns expressed at the time that the estimate was on the high side. Now, scientists at the University of Nottingham and the BGS have developed a new method for analysing the gas content of shale, which they believe gives them a more accurate estimate of the overall potential. ""In terms of the total gas in place, the mean value from the 2013 study was 1,300 trillion feet of gas, we are struggling to get anywhere above 200 trillion feet,"" said Prof Colin Snape from the University of Nottingham, the lead author on the paper. ""The data we've got from the two shales we've looked at are very consistent - and gas companies Cuadrilla and Third Energy have just published two papers in the last year where they have taken core samples and measured the gas that's evolved and that data is very, very consistent with our own data."" According to the new study, the amount of gas in place, assuming an economic recovery rate of 10% would be a maximum of 20 trillion cubic feet, which would equate to around seven years' worth of gas at current UK rates of consumption. Other researchers were impressed with the new method developed by the researchers at Nottingham. ""The results bring bad news to those hoping that northern England is floating on a bed of cheap and abundant gas,"" said Prof Stuart Haszeldine, Professor of Geology and Carbon Storage, University of Edinburgh, who was not involved with the study. ""Abundant hydrocarbons may have been generated in the past, but have leaked away to the Earth's surface many millions of years ago.  Not only have all those hydrocarbon horses bolted, but there is no longer a secure stable door to retain very large quantities of present-day gas in these shales."" However, some of the leading experts at the BGS were cautious in their interpretation of the study, even though several of their own scientists were involved in the paper. ""Early indications published today suggest that it is possible there is less shale gas resource present than previously thought,"" said Prof Mike Stephenson, chief scientist for decarbonisation and resource management, at the BGS. ""However the study considered only a very small number of rock samples from only two locations."" ""BGS has continued to study resource estimation in shales over the past 16 years and further studies are still required to further refine estimates of shale gas resources."" Cuadrilla, the company which has recently resumed fracking a shale gas well in Lancashire, was blunt in its rejection of the new paper. Protestors have tried to shut down Cuadrilla's fracking operations in Lancashire ""Those involved in publishing this should be embarrassed,"" said Francis Egan, Cuadrilla chief executive. ""We hold more data and technical experience of the Bowland shale than anyone else in the UK yet not once did anyone from this research group or Nottingham University contact us for our view or input."" UKOOG, the body which represents the UK's onshore oil and gas industry, also rejected the implications of the study. ""To date we have made significant advancements in the understanding of the resource potential contained within UK shale, with very encouraging results seen at both Springs Road and Preston New Road which have demonstrated properties in line with world class, US shale plays,"" said Ken Cronin, chief executive of UK Onshore Oil and Gas. ""What we know now is that we have a world class resource which has broadly supported the estimates originally published by the British Geological Survey. Indeed, in terms of potential gas flow indications, the results are at the upper end of our original forecasts."" ""The only way to provide accurate estimates of how much gas is likely to be produced is to drill, hydraulically fracture and test many wells,"" said Prof Quentin Fisher, from the University of Leeds, who was not involved with the study. ""Which is exactly the intention of companies holding shale gas licences in the UK."" Thestudy has been published,externalin the journal Nature Communications.

Hoaxer who claimed to be Yorkshire Ripper dies,"This video can not be played When arrested in 2005 Humble read aloud a section of the hoax tape he sent to police in 1979 The man who hoaxed detectives by claiming to be the Yorkshire Ripper has died, police have confirmed. John Humble, who was dubbed Wearside Jack, sent police on a wild goose chase when he sent them hoax letters and an audio tape in the late 1970s. He wasunmasked and sentenced to eight years in jail in 2006 after admitting perverting the course of justice,external. Northumbria Police said Humble, who had changed his name to John Samuel Anderson, died on 30 July. West Yorkshire Police detectives, headed by the force's assistant chief constable George Oldfield, believed the letters and tape were genuine and diverted resources to Humble's home town of Sunderland. When Humble was eventually prosecuted, Leeds Crown Court heard claims that delays caused by the hoax allowed Peter Sutcliffe to murder three more women. Sutcliffe was jailed in 1981 and given 20 life sentences for killing 13 women and attempting to kill seven more. John Humble admitted perverting the course of justice Sutcliffe was jailed in 1981 for the murder of 13 women Humble, 63, died at his home in South Shields, where he had lived since being released from prison in 2009.

What is the backstop?,"A key part of the Brexit negotiations has been the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland. Therefore the UK and EU agreed that whatever happens as a result of Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. This is where the controversial ""backstop"" comes in. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions with few restrictions. That is because the UK and Ireland are part of the EU's single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs or standards. But after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal. However, the UK's ambition to leave the customs union and the single market, could make that very difficult. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And if both sides couldn't reach agreement on a deal keeping the border as open as it is now - that's where the backstop would come in. So how might it it work? There are several options: This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. It said it would see Northern Ireland treated differently and could threaten the union. Boris Johnson has alsospecifically ruled this out. After the DUP's objections, Mrs May agreed a backstop involving the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also see Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. The backstop plan was agreed by UK-EU negotiators and formed part of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in November 2018 (often referred to as the Brexit ""divorce deal""). It sparked a backlash from many Conservative MPs (and the DUP) at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest. Please upgrade your browser They feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Ultimately, her deal was voted down three times, leading to her resignation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""anti-democratic"". His government has instead proposed the idea of a ""single regulatory zone"" on the island of Ireland. That would mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on animal health, food safety and manufactured goods. It would effectively mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea with checks and controls at ports. The DUP say they can accept this as long as there is a role for the Northern Ireland Assembly to give ongoing consent to these arrangements. On customs, the UK has said Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union. However the Prime Minister believes checks at the Irish frontier can be avoided by instead having customs processes mainly at company premises. The EU is sceptical about this and the latest negotiations have focused largely on customs. Many Brexit supporters say what are known as ""alternative arrangements"" could be used to avoid checks at the border. The phrase is normally used to refer to technical or technological solutions. These include things like trusted traders schemes and using GPS to track lorries. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements but has said no systems which could solve the border problem are currently ""operational"".

West Yorkshire Police detectives, headed by the force's assistant chief constable George Oldfield, believed the letters and tape were genuine and diverted resources to Humble's home town of Sunderland.

UK consulate worker 'detained at HK-China border',"The UK Foreign Office has expressed concern over reports that a Hong Kong consulate employee has been detained at the Chinese border. Media reports say Simon Cheng, who is thought to be from Hong Kong, is believed to have gone missing on 8 August while on a business trip. The Foreign Office said it was ""seeking further information from authorities in Guangdong Province and Hong Kong"". The British embassy in Beijing is providing support to his family. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained while returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen."" Shenzhen, in south-east China, links Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland. Local outlet HKFP reports that Mr Cheng is a trade and investment officer,externalat the Scottish Development International section of the consulate. It says he travelled to a business event in Shenzhen on 8 August via the Lo Wu immigration control point. His girlfriend told news site HK01 he had planned to travel home by train the same day, but did not return. She shared screenshots of online messages from Mr Cheng, in which he wrote he was passing through the border, before adding ""pray for me"". The Scottish government said it was concerned for Mr Cheng's welfare and was liaising with the Foreign Office. Travellers have described heightened security measures at the border between Hong Kong and China, as Beijing looks to curb anti-government protests in Hong Kong which it has called ""close to terrorism"". Recent travellers have reported that everyone passing through the border from Hong Kong into mainland China were subject to police checks on the mainland side, with officers taking people's phones and scrutinising their photos and videos. What is mainland China hearing about Hong Kong? Hong Kong police: We donât need Beijingâs help A woman, who did not wish to be identified, has told the BBC she was forced to delete photos from her phone at the border during a recent trip. Police holding random checks asked the woman, who travels from Hong Kong to mainland China for work, to hand over the phone, which included some WhatsApp conversations with friends about the protests. ""I was so afraid of them checking my phone, so I gave them my old phone,"" she said. ""I thought I had deleted all protest photos, but they also checked for protest-related posters and news. ""After seeing I had these on my phone, the staff immediately called other uniformed staff, took me to another room, and asked about my background, my job, whether I had joined the protests. Another staff member carefully checked my phone's photo albums to see how many protest-related photos I had."" ""I have deleted some protest photos on my iPhone, but I didn't realise those were moved to the 'recently deleted' folder. The officer also checked that. He found I had about 100 protest photos and asked me to delete them all,"" she added. ""My observation is that they check two people out of three. The situation is quite severe. None of my friends want to go to mainland China now."" Protests in Hong Kong, now entering their third month, were sparked by a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong to send criminal suspects to China for trial. They have grown into a broader movement calling for democratic reform in Hong Kong, and an investigation into alleged police brutality against protesters. Organisers say1.7 million people attended a pro-democracy rallyin central Hong Kong on Sunday. Police put the figure much lower at 128,000, counting only those at an officially sanctioned rally in the city's Victoria Park. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows extent of Hong Kong protest On Tuesday Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, said she hoped Sunday's peaceful protests were a sign that tensions were easing in the territory. She promised to ""immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue"" between Hong Kong's government and protesters, but did not elaborate on what form this might take. She expressed hope that this platform, built on ""mutual understanding"", would find a ""way out"" of the political crisis crippling Hong Kong. ""I sincerely hope this is the start of society returning to calm and turning away from violence,"" she said. Carrie Lam (pictured) said she hoped Sunday's peaceful protests would herald the end of violence in Hong Kong She also said that said Hong Kong's police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), had set up a task force to investigate complaints made in recent months. Her announcement, however, is unlikely to satisfy protesters, who have demanded a third-party investigation into police actions. The twists and turns in Hong Kong so far Hong Kong protests spread across the globe Anthony Neoh, who heads the IPCC,told the South China Morning Post,externalthat Ms Lam should not rule out appointing an independent commission of inquiry at a later stage but ""be very careful in doing it"" But he said only a political solution could restore calm to Hong Kong. ""Every time I see the chief executive [Ms Lam], I mention to her, you need a political solution,"" he said. ""She agrees, and she says she's working on it."" This video can not be played The video shows a soldier using a loudspeaker to warn protesters Mr Neoh added that giving the extradition bill which sparked the protests a ""proper burial"" would be a first step towards meeting protesters' demands. Ms Lam has insisted the bill is ""dead"" but has not formally withdrawn the legislation. Some observers believe that hardening rhetoric from Beijing is a sign that China's central government is losing patience with the protesters in Hong Kong and raises the likelihood of a direct intervention. How could China intervene in Hong Kong protests? Analysts say this remains unlikely, despite the thousands of armed police stationed across the border in Shenzhen. On Monday,Twitter and Facebook said they had taken steps to block what they described as a state-backed Chinese misinformation campaignon social networks. Twitter said it removed 936 accounts it said were being used to ""sow political discord in Hong Kong"". Twitter and Facebook block HK misinformation Aerial footage shows extent of Hong Kong protest.

PM says 'undemocratic' backstop must be scrapped,"Boris Johnson has written to Donald Tusk (right) to set out his demands for a Brexit deal Boris Johnson has told the EU the Irish border backstop must be scrapped as it is ""unviable"" and ""anti-democratic"". In aletter to European Council President Donald Tusk,external, the PM also said the backstop risked undermining the Northern Irish peace process. But Mr Tusk said those opposing the arrangement without ""realistic alternatives"" supported re-establishing a hard border. This was the reality ""even if they do not admit it"", he added. ""The backstop is an insurance to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland unless and until an alternative is found,""Mr Tusk tweeted.,external ""This has been the clear and consistent EU position, it remains so,"" added Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney in response to the tweet. The European Commission said Mr Johnson's letter did not contain a ""legally operational solution"" to prevent a hard Irish border. ""It does not set out what any alternative arrangements could be,"" a spokeswoman said, and ""recognises that there is no guarantee such arrangements would be in place by the end of the transitional period"". The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement, negotiated by former PM Theresa May with Brussels but rejected three times by MPs. What is the backstop? Brexit: A really simple guide 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Mr Johnson's four-page letter to Mr Tusk came ahead of meetings this week with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Johnson appeared to be aiming for one of two outcomes - either the EU blinks as the prospect of no deal looms ever closer, or it holds firm, in which case the PM will argue it is Brussels' fault the country is heading for no deal. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity, and both the UK and EU agree that whatever happens after Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. The backstop is a position of last resort to guarantee that, but if implemented, it would see Northern Ireland stay aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. In his letter, Mr Johnson described the backstop as ""inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK"". He said the arrangement would be ""anti-democratic"" because it offered no means for the UK to unilaterally exit and no say for the people of Northern Ireland over the rules that would apply there. The PM also warned that it risked ""weakening the delicate balance"" of the Good Friday peace agreement because unionist parties like the DUP are so unhappy with it. He said he was confident that its removal would lead to the withdrawal deal finally being passed in the UK Parliament. But Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit spokesman for the European Parliament, said there was no majority in his assembly - which would also have to ratify any Brexit deal - to remove the backstop. ""It is a vital insurance policy, negotiated in good faith and supported by the people of the Island of Ireland,"" hetweeted,external. This video can not be played Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: âThere is not another country in the world with an internal customs arrangement â this is unacceptable.â The prime minister called for ""flexible and creative solutions"" and ""alternative arrangements"" - based on technology - to avoid a hard border. He said the backstop should be replaced with a commitment to put in place such arrangements as far as possible before the end of the transition period - currently the end of 2020 under Mrs May's deal. If they were not in place by the end of the transition period, Mr Johnson said the UK was ""ready to look constructively and flexibly at what commitments might help"". ""Time is very short. But the UK is ready to move quickly, and, given the degree of common ground already, I hope the EU will be ready to do likewise,"" he wrote. ""I am equally confident that Parliament would be able to act rapidly if we were able to reach a satisfactory agreement which did not contain the backstop."" Donald Tusk doesn't name Boris Johnson in his tweet, but it's pretty clear he's referring to the prime minister and people of the same view. In addition, the European Council and European Commission have sent a document to EU governments rebutting the claims in Mr Johnson's letter. The document says the prime minister is wrong to suggest the backstop contradicts the Good Friday Agreement. It also says he is wrong to suggest there is no way for the people of Northern Ireland to have a say, and that the separate legal orders of Northern Ireland and Ireland only coexist because of the framework provided by EU law. The bottom line from the EU is that the backstop has to stay, because it's the only way to resolve all these problems. In reply a senior UK government figure says Mr Tusk's response ""looks like an overreaction"". ""It appears their position is 'nothing will change' from the unworkable deal offered to Theresa May,"" they say. ""Sad they are unwilling to be reasonable."" However, Labour pointed out that Mr Johnson actually voted for Mrs May's deal - including the backstop - when it came before Parliament for a third time in March. Mr Johnson said at the time he was only doing so because he had reached the ""sad conclusion"" it was the only way to ensure the UK actually left the EU. ""Whichever Brexit outcome he pursues, whether it's a disastrous no deal or this fantasyland wish list, Boris Johnson clearly has no qualms about putting jobs, rights, prosperity or peace in Northern Ireland at risk,"" shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said.

The government insisted the Operation Yellowhammer information was out of date and Brexit planning had accelerated since Mr Johnson became PM. Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly told the BBC on Tuesday: ""What it is, it's an internal document to stimulate actions and behaviour of governments - it's not a prediction, it's not a future estimate of reality, it is a series of worst-case scenarios to be mitigated and avoided."" However, Mr Corbyn said: ""If the government wants to be believed that it doesn't represent the real impact, it must publish its most recent assessments today in full."" A government spokesperson said up-to-date information on what businesses and members of the public needed to do to prepare for the UK's departure from the EU was available on the government's website.

PM and Varadkar discuss Brexit,"Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar spoke by phone on Monday The prime minister and the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) have ""shared perspectives on the withdrawal agreement"" in a phone conversation. Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar spoke for almost an hour on Monday evening, the two governments said.

Lightning strike 'partly to blame' for power cut,"Train passengers were guided by torchlight at some stations during the power cut A lightning strike and the sudden loss of two large electricity generatorscaused nearly a million people to lose power in England and Walesearlier this month, an interim report has found. The National Grid outage affected homes, businesses and transport, and while power was restored quite quickly, disruption continued into the next day. Regulator Ofgem has opened an investigation,externalinto National Grid and other companies involved. That could lead to a financial penalty. Ofgem said its investigation ""would try to establish what lessons can be drawn from the power cut to ensure that steps can be taken to further improve the resilience of Britain's energy network"". The regulator will also establish whether the companies involved breached their licence conditions. Any punishment could involve a fine of 10% of the firms' turnover, an order to pay money to charities to help less well-off consumers, or to put cash into a fund to compensate those who lost out because of the power cuts. Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem's executive director of systems and networks, said: ""It's important that the industry takes all possible steps to prevent this happening again."" A National Grid spokesperson said: ""It is now right and proper that the investigation looks at the system-wide performance of the energy networks on 9 August, in both the performance of the electricity system, and subsequent significant disruption to transports networks and critical infrastructure."" The power cut, which happened just before 17:00 BST on Friday 9 August, caused blackouts across the Midlands, the South East, South West, North West and North East of England, and Wales. Thousands of homes lost power, people were stranded on trains and traffic lights stopped working Power was restored by 17:40 BST, but problems on the rail network carried on over the weekend. Two almost simultaneous unexpected power losses at Hornsea and Little Barford occurred independently of one another - but each associated with the lightning strike. 'We were stuck on a train with no food or toilets' Andrea Leadsom launches government investigation Why the power cut caused so much disruption Power was not cut to the railway tracks but there were many travel problems, largely because about 60 Govia Thameslink trains were affected. About half were able to restart when the power was restored to the correct frequency, but the rest required engineers to travel to restart them - and the resultant delay caused a backlog. The affected models were made by Siemens and introduced in 2014. The company said a software issue caused the problem and that it expected an update would prevent a recurrence. In a statement, Siemens added it had ""set up a Task Force together with our partners to investigate how the trains reacted to being exposed to this unusual power failure mode"". Passengers travelling on Thameslink were delayed At the height of the Friday rush hour, all trains out of London King's Cross were suspended and remained so for most of the evening. And by 21:00 BST, more than 1,000 passengers appeared to be stranded at the station, with London North Eastern Railway and National Rail advising customers not to travel for the rest of the day. As well as Network Rail, other critical infrastructure affected on the day included London Underground's Victoria Line and Newcastle Airport. Problems were also caused at Ipswich Hospital, where the back-up generator, which was supposed to supply power to outpatient areas,did not work after the outage because of a faulty battery. This affected outpatients, X-rays, scans and pathology for nearly half an hour, but the hospital stressed no patients were put at risk. Like the opening scene of an Agatha Christie novel, National Grid's preliminary investigation into the power cut 10 days ago is replete with clues and plausible villains, but lacks a final verdict on who or what cut the power. There is a handy timeline of events - a lightning strike before 17:00 BST, the failure of two big power generators a few seconds later, and the subsequent loss of electricity across part of the country. The authors though tread carefully when ascribing causality. The report says the power station failures were ""associated"" with the  strike, but points out that such strikes are not uncommon, and would normally not lead to power stations going offline. It also says there were many other lightning hits on the same day, none of which caused a problem. That gap at the heart of the report is what Ofgem will now investigate. It will want to know whether the lightning did cause the power station failures, and if so, how? It will also explore whether there were other problems at the power stations that caused them to go offline, and whether the lightning strike is in reality a red herring. There are other issues further down the chain to be resolved too. Once the power was cut, customers were automatically disconnected. Did that happen in the right order, or should critical users, including hospitals and power supplies for transport, be the last to be unplugged? The answers could make uncomfortable reading for National Grid and the other companies involved in the power cut. Sir John Armitt, chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission, told the BBC's Today programme the incident raised plenty of questions. ""What are the most critical elements of our infrastructure across this country and which elements do you turn off first?"" he said. ""Have we got that order of priority right? And so why was it the railways went down as opposed to those of us living at home not losing some of our electricity?"" Sir John added: ""The important thing is this a great case study in a way. It is a very unfortunate one, a lot of people were impacted by it, but it is something which everyone involved can learn from."" Ofgem is to investigate National Grid ESO, National Grid Electricity Transmission, 12 distribution network operators in England and Wales, as well as generators RWE Generation (Little Barford Power station) and Orsted (Hornsea) in relation to the power cut. The distribution companies are part of six network groups: Electricity North West Limited, Northern Powergrid, Scottish and Southern Energy, ScottishPower Energy Networks, UK Power Networks and Western Power Distribution. The National Grid has to publish a final, technical report by 6 September and any Ofgem enforcement action will follow after that.

New Great British Bake Off contestants revealed,"The Great British Bake Off class of 2019 A geography teacher, a vet and a fashion designer are just three of the contestants hoping to win this year's Great British Bake Off. It returns to Channel 4 on Tuesday 27 August, the third series since it moved across from BBC One. The presenters and judges remain the same, with Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig back for another year of puns. Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith will also be on hand to judge the best bakes produced in the famous white tent. This year's line-up consists of a baker's dozen - 13 - instead of the usual 12, and there's a decidedly younger contingent. More than half of the contestants are in their 20s, while the oldest contestant is 56. TV critic Scott Bryan tweeted that the show had encouraged younger people to don their aprons.

Leith said that the programme was ""a very inclusive show"". She said: ""What's so interesting is when they're choosing the bakers, the main thing they want to know is that they're getting the 12 best bakers in the country. ""They're not choosing, they're not set up to find somebody who's the right ethnic mix, or the right height, or the right age or anything."" Why Americans love the Great British Bake Off Clockwise from top left: Rosie, Michael, Priya and Helena Rosieis a 28-year-old veterinary surgeon in Somerset and her baking passions began when she was given a children's baking book at age five. When Rosie's not treating drunken hedgehogs, performing spleen surgery on dogs, or on call, she's baking through the night to unwind and keep the practice nurses well fed. Michael, 26, is a theatre manager/fitness instructor in Stratford-upon-Avon. He was born in Newcastle but considers himself Scottish as he moved to the suitably-named Scone aged seven and studied in Edinburgh. In his baking, though, he is especially inspired by the flavours of his Indian heritage. Priya, 34, is a marketing consultant in her hometown of Leicester and her first foray into baking started with an after-school baking club at primary school. Seven years ago, after she was given a mixer as a wedding gift, she went ""baking bonkers"". She recently started experimenting with vegan baking and is also writing her first novel. Online project managerHelena, 40, lives in Leeds and spent much of her childhood watching her Spanish grandmother cook and bake. She was born in North Africa and grew up in Lanzarote before studying in mainland Spain. She only really started baking properly after spending time living with a family in Las Vegas. Clockwise from top left: David, Michelle, Jamie and Amelia London-based international health adviserDavid, 36, is originally from Yorkshire and as a child, his mum baked all the time, meaning the family never ate a shop-bought loaf at home. His passion was further developed by his travels to Malawi, where he learned to build an oven out of an oil drum and invented a cake that could steam cook over a village fire. Michelle, 35, works as a print shop administrator in Tenby, Wales, and bakes almost every other day, with fresh bread for breakfast and sweet treats for pudding always on the menu. Part-time waiterJamiewas born and raised with his identical twin brother in Surrey and was taught the baking basics by his family. However, it was actually an episode of Bake-Off that inspired the 20-year-old to make a plaited loaf.  He happily takes on technically difficult bakes, such as a croquembouche or croissants. Sportswear fashion designer,Amelia, is 24 and also hails from Yorkshire, specifically Halifax. She honed her baking skills while at university and one of her proudest bakes is a snow leopard cake that she made for her nephew's fifth birthday. Alice Alice, a 28-year-old geography teacher from Essex, first turned her hand to baking at the age of 15, after she was left unable to do sport while recovering from a back operation for scoliosis. In her 20s, she perfected the fruit pavlova while living in New Zealand, where she also attended art school. Now living in east London, she uses cakes in her lessons to demonstrate everything from coastal erosion to volcanic activity. Clockwise from top left: Dan, Steph, Henry and Phil Support workerDan, 32, is another Yorkshire lad. He has fond memories of his mum showing him how to bake a Victoria sponge as a child. He got serious about baking when he was 21 in a bid to impress his then girlfriend (now wife) with a themed birthday cake. He went on to make their wedding cake. Steph, 28, is a shop assistant in Chester and her passion for sports and wellness inspires her baking. She enjoys the challenge of making her bakes healthier by adding vegetables or fruit and choosing nutritional fats. Durham University studentHenry, 20, whose love of baking and all things culinary began at the age of 12, when the Bake Off tent pitched up in his local park. He now tests out his culinary skills on the discerning student palates of his university housemates, while studying English Literature. Last but not least is Essex-based motorbike enthusiastPhil, 56, an HGV driver who was introduced to the joys of baking bread in his home economics class at school. He now bakes four or five times a week, frequently making focaccia, granary bread and brioche, as well as pastry. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Jeffrey Epstein 'signed will two days before death',"Epstein's more than $577m in assets were put into a trust, according to reports Jeffrey Epstein signed a will two days before killing himself in his New York jail cell, US media reports say. Court papers filed last week in the US Virgin Islands valued Epstein's estate at more than $577 million (Â£475m) but listed no details of beneficiaries, the Associated Press reported. The will, details of which were first reported by the New York Post, directs Epstein's assets to be put into trust. Epstein died while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. The New York medical examiner found that the 66-year-old, whose body was discovered on 10 August, died of ""suicide by hanging"". Epstein pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and was being held without bail. He faced up to 45 years in prison if convicted. The case of Jeffrey Epstein - in 300 words Epstein jail 'a gulag' in lower Manhattan How conspiracy theories spread after Epstein's death Who was Jeffrey Epstein? The former financier put all of his holdings into a trust called The 1953 Trust, according to a copy of the will published by the New York Post. He signed the document on 8 August. No details of any beneficiaries are included in the document, which lists assets including more than $56m in cash, more than $14m in fixed income investments and more than $18m in ""aviation assets, automobiles and boats"". Epstein's collection of fine arts, antiques and other valuables is yet to be appraised, the document says. Some of Epstein's alleged victims have said they will go after his assets for damages following his death. Epstein accuser sues his estate and staff Reports about Epstein's will came as US Attorney General William Barr announced a major leadership shake-up at the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The acting chief, Hugh Hurwitz, was removed and former BOP director Kathleen Hawk Sawyer named as his replacement. ""Under Dr. Hawk Sawyer's previous tenure at the Bureau, she led the agency with excellence, innovation, and efficiency, receiving numerous awards for her outstanding leadership,"" Mr Barr said in a statement. He also named former agency official Thomas Kane as her deputy. New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections. He was often seen socialising with the rich and powerful, including US President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and the UK's Prince Andrew. This video can not be played Footage appears to show Prince Andrew inside Jeffery Epstein's New York residence in 2010 Prince Andrew 'appalled' by Epstein sex abuse claims In a 2002 profile in New York Magazine, Mr Trump referred to Epstein as a ""terrific guy"". But in comments this year, Mr Trump said that he was ""not a fan of Jeffrey Epstein"". Epstein was accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. He was arrested on 6 July after landing in New Jersey on his private jet. He avoided similar charges in a controversial secret plea deal in 2008, and instead pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. That plea deal was closely scrutinised in recent weeks and, last month, US Labor Secretary Alex Acosta resigned over his role in it. Prosecutors also accused Epstein of paying large amounts of money to two potential witnesses ahead of his trial, which was scheduled to take place next year. Who was Jeffrey Epstein?

YouTuber sees racist link in knife crime warnings,"A YouTube star, famous for his reviews of chicken shops, has criticised the government's decision to feature knife crime warnings on takeaway boxes. Elijah Quashie - better known as the Chicken Connoisseur -told BBC's Wake Up to Moneythat the approach was too simplistic to solve a  complex problem. ""I can see the racist connotation. I'm not sure if I'd say racist, or stereotype but it's in that bracket."" The government said its chicken shop adverts were part of a wider campaign. Earlier this month, the government saidmore than 321,000 takeaway chicken boxes printed with anti-knife slogans would replace standard packaging as part of its #KnifeFree campaign. It said it chose chicken shops because research by the agency that produced the campaign showed 70% of their customers were aged 16 to 24, an age group it wanted to target. But Mr Quashie said the approach didn't make sense: ""There should be someone who has a deeper train of thought than: 'Black people, they eat chicken we can intersect the black people who kill each other at a chicken shop, with the chicken boxes."" ""I don't know what they think that's really going to do."" The special boxes feature real life stories of young people Mr Quashie rose to fame through his YouTube series the Pengest Munch, which has had 50 million views. Started in 2015, it features reviews of chicken shops in London assessing every detail from the seating, to the chips and how the burger is put together. In each episode, he visits a different restaurant but always orders exactly the same thing: a chicken strip burger, wings and a portion of chips. He now has more than half a million followers on YouTube and is the star of Channel 4's new show Peng Life. ""There's no particular diplomacy. If it's good, it's good if it's not - I make sure people know,"" the 26-year-old says. He is just as direct in his assessment of the businesses behind the anti-knife crime campaign. Three of the UK's biggest chicken chains are involved - Morleys, Dixy Chicken and Chicken Cottage. ""For a chicken shop to be recognised by a government body like the Home Office. They're in the newspapers now. Maybe they weren't before. The more marketing the merrier."" ""From their perspective it's very easy. Just switch a box that's it. Bossman doesn't need to do anything different,"" he said. ""It's just a chicken box,"" says Mr Quashie The agency behind the campaign, All City Media Solutions, said the chicken box campaign intended to resonate with ""young people of all races and religions"". ""Making the presumption that any one strategy alone, however big or small can tackle an endemic problem such as knife crime is naive at best, and politicising an issue that's ripping the heart out of this country is misplaced and counterproductive,"" it said in a statement. ""If even one young vulnerable person is helped by this campaign, this would've all been worth it."" But Mr Quashie  believes the government could do more. ""If something real happens, the chicken box unfortunately is not really going to weigh up. ""They would have at least thought maybe there's a reason why people are doing it. Let's look into the reason why. ""Or the circumstances people who commit knife crime are in and maybe we can do something to stop it at its infancy. It's not really treating the symptoms either. ""It's just a chicken box."" Earlier this month, the government announced an extra 10,000 prison places would be created with stop-and-search powers expanded as well. It said the Â£2.5bn programme showed it was ""serious about fighting crime"". So where does the Chicken Connoisseur see #KnifeFree chicken boxes fitting in. ""If it was a PR stunt that would work because the conversation begins. Or the conversation gets louder,"" he says. ""That is working."" ""But the aim was not the conversation. It seems like the aim was for the chicken boxes to make a difference in the streets."" He shakes his head and laughs at the thought of it. ""Wow...chicken boxes.""

No-deal Brexit 'could cost farms Â£850m in profits',"This video can not be played Farmer Colin Ferguson says he wants ""the Brexit uncertainty to end"" A no-deal Brexit could cost the farming industry Â£850m a year in lost profits, new research seen by the BBC suggests. Farm business consultants Andersons said that without government support increasing significantly, some farms would inevitably struggle to survive. The author of its research described a no-deal Brexit as a greater challenge than the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises. The government says it will ""provide direct support to boost some sectors in the unlikely event this is required"". Read more on the BBC'sFocus on Farming here. Under a no-deal Brexit, farms could have to pay a tariff on goods exported to the EU for the first time. Lamb and live sheep exports could face tariffs of 45-50%, while trade and farming groups say some cuts of beef could see tariffs of more than 90%. If European firms suddenly start having to pay more for UK meat, the fear is they could quickly switch to suppliers in other countries. Other so-called ""non-tariff barriers"", like extra veterinary and customs checks at the border, could also increase costs to farmers. Jo and Lindsay Best fear a no-deal Brexit could ""decimate both the sheep and cattle industries"" in Northern Ireland ""It could wipe out the sheep industry in Northern Ireland,"" farmers Jo and Lindsay Best, from County Antrim, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""A large percentage of our sheep are exported into France and the Republic of Ireland, and the price of feed could go up as well. It could decimate both the sheep and cattle industry here."" 'UK must accept US food standards in trade deal' NI farmers call for 'no deal' cross border tariffs No-deal Brexit: What is the UK government doing to prepare? Andersonsmodelled the impact on typical farms,externalin different parts of the UK. Farms already receive more than Â£3.5bn a year in EU subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The government has told farmers those support levels will be maintained until the next general election and that is included in Andersons' calculations. In the first year after a no-deal Brexit, profitability across the whole industry would fall by 18% - or between Â£800m and Â£850m - compared with the 2016-2018 average, its research suggests. ""At the moment a number of farms across numerous sectors are heavily reliant on support,"" says Michael Haverty, who compiled Andersons' research. ""Many farms are struggling to break even. If they get a hit in terms of profitability of 18%, and for some sectors significantly more, then that has huge implications for the viability of those farms."" The firm's model shows the profitability of a typical dairy farm in England will fall from 3.4 pence per litre of milk to 0.9 pence per litre under no deal. In Scotland, the typical dairy farm would struggle to break even, it suggests, while in Northern Ireland it is likely to become loss-making. Under a no-deal Brexit, dairy exports would attract higher tariffs and other restrictions which, it is feared, could lead to an oversupply of milk in the UK and falling prices. At the same time, tariffs on imports from outside the EU could be cut substantially, meaning British farmers would face competition from low-cost butter and cheese made overseas. Colin Ferguson, who runs his own herd of 200 dairy cattle on the Machars peninsula in south-west Scotland, said that would be his ""biggest concern"". ""[Produce from overseas] doesn't need to meet the high welfare or production standards that we conform to, therefore our market gets undermined by cheap produce and the consumer quite rightly will buy the cheapest item on the shelf,"" he added. Mr Ferguson - who voted Leave in 2016 - said uncertainty around the UK's relationship with the EU was the ""biggest challenge"" and had already made it harder to invest in new livestock or machinery. Colin Ferguson with some of his cattle ""That clarity is vital,"" he added. ""We just need to know what's going to happen."" In the longer term, he is positive about leaving the EU - seeing it as an opportunity to redesign the system of financial subsidies paid to farms in the UK. The research by Andersons shows the impact of a no-deal Brexit will not be felt equally across the industry. Lamb and beef farming are likely to be hardest hit, especially in Wales and Northern Ireland. Other businesses - like fruit and vegetables, pigs and poultry - could see modest increases in profitability as rivals like Danish bacon attract import tariffs and become more expensive. That though is dependent on migrant labour remaining available after 31 October. Michael Haverty says a no-deal Brexit would be ""the biggest challenge this industry has faced probably since World War Two"" Mr Haverty said it was ""inevitable"" the government would have to put in place substantial levels of financial support over a number of years, while farms in some sectors adjust. ""If we look at some of the other key challenges of the past - BSE and foot-and-mouth for instance - they were significant in their own right but perhaps a bit more confined,"" he said. ""A no-deal Brexit is more encompassing. It's not just within the agricultural sector, it's within the wider economy as well. On that basis it's the biggest challenge this industry has faced probably since World War Two."" The Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement: ""We have been very clear that once we leave the EU on 31 October, we will replace the Common Agricultural Policy with a fairer system of farm support and our new trade deals must work for UK farmers, businesses and consumers."" It added: ""As we have said before, the cash total for farm support will be protected until 2022, even in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""We will also intervene to provide direct support to boost some sectors in the unlikely event this is required."" If countries do not have free trade agreements, they trade with each other under rules agreed by members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Each country sets tariffs on goods crossing its borders. All EU countries share common tariffs because they are all signed up to the customs union. EU tariffs on most agricultural products can be very high - dairy averages more than 35% and for some meat products, such as lamb, it is more than 40%. As the UK is still a member of the EU, it applies EU tariffs to goods coming in from the rest of the world, but has no tariffs with the EU itself. But Brexit will change that. The UK has said that under a no-deal Brexitmost imports would not attract a tariff,in order to keep trade flowing through ports like Dover. But it would have to offer the same reductions to all other countries as well. Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

Mrs Harper described her husband as a ""pillar of strength"" to everyone he met Paying tribute to her husband,external, Mrs Harper said: ""We had so many plans for the future, you wanted to do it all. My darling boy I do not know how I will be able to survive without you. ""I want to be angry that your job took you away from us but I know you loved it and always wanted to keep everyone safe, especially me. ""We are all feeling so very lost without you but we are trying to be as brave as you were. ""You loved to go on adventures and find new places to explore. If there was a mountain to climb, you'd be there at the top. Bike rides and long walks, you loved it all. Never still, never down, so full of life. ""My heart is broken without you my sweetheart but my god I feel so lucky that it was me you chose to share your amazing life with.

UK consulate staffer 'detained at HK-China border',"The UK Foreign Office has expressed concern over reports that a Hong Kong consulate employee has been detained at the Chinese border. Media reports say Simon Cheng, who is thought to be from Hong Kong, is believed to have gone missing on 8 August while on a business trip. The Foreign Office said it was ""seeking further information from authorities in Guangdong Province and Hong Kong"". The British embassy in Beijing is providing support to his family. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained while returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen."" Shenzhen, in south-east China, links Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland. Local outlet HKFP reports that Mr Cheng is a trade and investment officer,externalat the Scottish Development International section of the consulate. It says he travelled to a business event in Shenzhen on 8 August via the Lo Wu immigration control point. His girlfriend told news site HK01 he had planned to travel home by train the same day, but did not return. She shared screenshots of online messages from Mr Cheng, in which he wrote he was passing through the border, before adding ""pray for me"". The Scottish government said it was concerned for Mr Cheng's welfare and was liaising with the Foreign Office. Travellers have described heightened security measures at the border between Hong Kong and China, as Beijing looks to curb anti-government protests in Hong Kong which it has called ""close to terrorism"". Recent travellers have reported that everyone passing through the border from Hong Kong into mainland China were subject to police checks on the mainland side, with officers taking people's phones and scrutinising their photos and videos. What is mainland China hearing about Hong Kong? Hong Kong police: We donât need Beijingâs help A woman, who did not wish to be identified, has told the BBC she was forced to delete photos from her phone at the border during a recent trip. Police holding random checks asked the woman, who travels from Hong Kong to mainland China for work, to hand over the phone, which included some WhatsApp conversations with friends about the protests. ""I was so afraid of them checking my phone, so I gave them my old phone,"" she said. ""I thought I had deleted all protest photos, but they also checked for protest-related posters and news. ""After seeing I had these on my phone, the staff immediately called other uniformed staff, took me to another room, and asked about my background, my job, whether I had joined the protests. Another staff member carefully checked my phone's photo albums to see how many protest-related photos I had."" ""I have deleted some protest photos on my iPhone, but I didn't realise those were moved to the 'recently deleted' folder. The officer also checked that. He found I had about 100 protest photos and asked me to delete them all,"" she added. ""My observation is that they check two people out of three. The situation is quite severe. None of my friends want to go to mainland China now."" Protests in Hong Kong, now entering their third month, were sparked by a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong to send criminal suspects to China for trial. They have grown into a broader movement calling for democratic reform in Hong Kong, and an investigation into alleged police brutality against protesters. Organisers say1.7 million people attended a pro-democracy rallyin central Hong Kong on Sunday. Police put the figure much lower at 128,000, counting only those at an officially sanctioned rally in the city's Victoria Park. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows extent of Hong Kong protest On Tuesday Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, said she hoped Sunday's peaceful protests were a sign that tensions were easing in the territory. She promised to ""immediately start the work to establish a platform for dialogue"" between Hong Kong's government and protesters, but did not elaborate on what form this might take. She expressed hope that this platform, built on ""mutual understanding"", would find a ""way out"" of the political crisis crippling Hong Kong. ""I sincerely hope this is the start of society returning to calm and turning away from violence,"" she said. Carrie Lam (pictured) said she hoped Sunday's peaceful protests would herald the end of violence in Hong Kong She also said that said Hong Kong's police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), had set up a task force to investigate complaints made in recent months. Her announcement, however, is unlikely to satisfy protesters, who have demanded a third-party investigation into police actions. The twists and turns in Hong Kong so far Hong Kong protests spread across the globe Anthony Neoh, who heads the IPCC,told the South China Morning Post,externalthat Ms Lam should not rule out appointing an independent commission of inquiry at a later stage but ""be very careful in doing it"" But he said only a political solution could restore calm to Hong Kong. ""Every time I see the chief executive [Ms Lam], I mention to her, you need a political solution,"" he said. ""She agrees, and she says she's working on it."" This video can not be played The video shows a soldier using a loudspeaker to warn protesters Mr Neoh added that giving the extradition bill which sparked the protests a ""proper burial"" would be a first step towards meeting protesters' demands. Ms Lam has insisted the bill is ""dead"" but has not formally withdrawn the legislation. Some observers believe that hardening rhetoric from Beijing is a sign that China's central government is losing patience with the protesters in Hong Kong and raises the likelihood of a direct intervention. How could China intervene in Hong Kong protests? Analysts say this remains unlikely, despite the thousands of armed police stationed across the border in Shenzhen. On Monday,Twitter and Facebook said they had taken steps to block what they described as a state-backed Chinese misinformation campaignon social networks.

Great British Bake Off contestants revealed for 2019,"The Great British Bake Off class of 2019 A geography teacher, a vet and a fashion designer are just three of the contestants hoping to win this year's Great British Bake Off. It returns to Channel 4 on Tuesday 27 August, the third series since it moved across from BBC One. The presenters and judges remain the same, with Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig back for another year of puns. Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith will also be on hand to judge the best bakes produced in the famous white tent. This year's line-up consists of a baker's dozen - 13 - instead of the usual 12, and there's a decidedly younger contingent. More than half of the contestants are in their 20s, while the oldest contestant is 56. TV critic Scott Bryan tweeted that the show had encouraged younger people to don their aprons.

Leith said that the programme was ""a very inclusive show"". She said: ""What's so interesting is when they're choosing the bakers, the main thing they want to know is that they're getting the 12 best bakers in the country. ""They're not choosing, they're not set up to find somebody who's the right ethnic mix, or the right height, or the right age or anything."" Why Americans love the Great British Bake Off Clockwise from top left: Rosie, Michael, Priya and Helena Rosieis a 28-year-old veterinary surgeon in Somerset and her baking passions began when she was given a children's baking book at age five. When Rosie's not treating drunken hedgehogs, performing spleen surgery on dogs, or on call, she's baking through the night to unwind and keep the practice nurses well fed. Michael, 26, is a theatre manager/fitness instructor in Stratford-upon-Avon. He was born in Newcastle but considers himself Scottish as he moved to the suitably-named Scone aged seven and studied in Edinburgh. In his baking, though, he is especially inspired by the flavours of his Indian heritage. Priya, 34, is a marketing consultant in her hometown of Leicester and her first foray into baking started with an after-school baking club at primary school. Seven years ago, after she was given a mixer as a wedding gift, she went ""baking bonkers"". She recently started experimenting with vegan baking and is also writing her first novel. Online project managerHelena, 40, lives in Leeds and spent much of her childhood watching her Spanish grandmother cook and bake. She was born in North Africa and grew up in Lanzarote before studying in mainland Spain. She only really started baking properly after spending time living with a family in Las Vegas. Clockwise from top left: David, Michelle, Jamie and Amelia London-based international health adviserDavid, 36, is originally from Yorkshire and as a child, his mum baked all the time, meaning the family never ate a shop-bought loaf at home. His passion was further developed by his travels to Malawi, where he learned to build an oven out of an oil drum and invented a cake that could steam cook over a village fire. Michelle, 35, works as a print shop administrator in Tenby, Wales, and bakes almost every other day, with fresh bread for breakfast and sweet treats for pudding always on the menu. Part-time waiterJamiewas born and raised with his identical twin brother in Surrey and was taught the baking basics by his family. However, it was actually an episode of Bake-Off that inspired the 20-year-old to make a plaited loaf.  He happily takes on technically difficult bakes, such as a croquembouche or croissants. Sportswear fashion designer,Amelia, is 24 and also hails from Yorkshire, specifically Halifax. She honed her baking skills while at university and one of her proudest bakes is a snow leopard cake that she made for her nephew's fifth birthday. Alice Alice, a 28-year-old geography teacher from Essex, first turned her hand to baking at the age of 15, after she was left unable to do sport while recovering from a back operation for scoliosis. In her 20s, she perfected the fruit pavlova while living in New Zealand, where she also attended art school. Now living in east London, she uses cakes in her lessons to demonstrate everything from coastal erosion to volcanic activity. Clockwise from top left: Dan, Steph, Henry and Phil Support workerDan, 32, is another Yorkshire lad. He has fond memories of his mum showing him how to bake a Victoria sponge as a child. He got serious about baking when he was 21 in a bid to impress his then girlfriend (now wife) with a themed birthday cake. He went on to make their wedding cake. Steph, 28, is a shop assistant in Chester and her passion for sports and wellness inspires her baking. She enjoys the challenge of making her bakes healthier by adding vegetables or fruit and choosing nutritional fats. Durham University studentHenry, 20, whose love of baking and all things culinary began at the age of 12, when the Bake Off tent pitched up in his local park. He now tests out his culinary skills on the discerning student palates of his university housemates, while studying English Literature. Last but not least is Essex-based motorbike enthusiastPhil, 56, an HGV driver who was introduced to the joys of baking bread in his home economics class at school. He now bakes four or five times a week, frequently making focaccia, granary bread and brioche, as well as pastry. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

UK PM and Varadkar discuss Brexit,"Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar spoke by phone on Monday The prime minister and the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) have ""shared perspectives on the withdrawal agreement"" in a phone conversation. Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar spoke for almost an hour on Monday evening, the two governments said. Mr Johnson said the agreement in its current form would not get through the House of Commons, while Mr Varadkar reiterated that it cannot be reopened. Both prime ministers condemned Monday's bomb in County Fermanagh. Leo Varadkar invites PM to Dublin for Brexit chat Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Hard Brexit could 'undermine the union' The phone call comes a day after agovernment dossier warning of the impact of a no-deal Brexitwas leaked. The report said leaving the EU without a deal could lead to a hard Irish border after plans to avoid checks fail. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mr Johnson maintained that the ""backstop would need to be removed"", while Mr Varadkar ""emphasised the importance of the legally operable guarantee to ensure no hard border and continued free trade on the island of Ireland"". The backstop, part of the withdrawal agreement negotiated by former prime minster Theresa May, is an insurance policy to prevent a hard border returning on the island of Ireland, which if implemented, would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. The prime ministers also spoke about the need for the power-sharing executive at Stormont to be reinstated and ""agreed to work closely to this end"". The leaders also agreed to meet face to face in Dublin in early September. Dublin says backstop pressure talk is 'codswallop' What are the Brexit backstop options?
