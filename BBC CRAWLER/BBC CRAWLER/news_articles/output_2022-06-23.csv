Why haven't train strikes caused more disruption?,"Many stations, including London Bridge, were quiet on Thursday The rail strikes this week had threatened to bring the country to a halt. But after two days of industrial action -  as well as the knock-on impact on services for the rest of the week - there is little evidence this has happened. Empty stations, half-full trains to Glastonbury Festival, and broadly similar traffic levels mean that for the most part, it appears to have been business as usual for many people across the country. However, for those who can't work remotely and city centre businesses which rely on footfall from office workers and commuters, the impact has still been substantial. The pandemic has meant many firms are now geared up to switch to remote working. According to official figures, 38% of workers now spend some of the week working from home. One office workspace firm in Cheltenham has seen a 30% upturn in business this week from people booking individual day passes. Claire Storey said the rail strikes have been good for her business Claire Storey, founder of the Workplace Network in Cheltenham, says she has a lot of clients who normally commute once or twice a week but during the strikes were unable to do so, meaning they booked more days at her co-working space. Office occupancy data across the UK on Tuesday was just 22%, compared to 40% the same day last week, according to workplace technology firm Freespace. What days are the strikes and which trains are running? 'Strikes have left my stag do plans in ruins' Ben Willmott, head of public policy for HR trade body the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, says more flexible ways of working have helped employees work from home with short notice. ""This takes pressure off the public transport system and reduced services for those who do have to travel to work,"" he adds. Pre-pandemic, the rail strikes would have taken more of a toll on Leeds Building Society, but boss Richard Fearon says a 30% reduction in the number of people in the office went ""seamlessly"". ""In 2019, we only could accommodate about 120 people working from home but now we can accommodate 1,000 wfh and can take these things in our stride,"" he adds. Working from home and the high cost of fuel also seem to have mitigated the impacts on the roads. The AA says it appears most drivers have been able to go about their journeys ""without too much disruption"". AA breakdown rates are also slightly lower than usual. ""It looks like the early strike notice has given those who can work from home the chance to continue to do so while those who have to travel to work appear to have planned ahead by setting off early and car-sharing,"" a spokesperson says. The AA's data showed some localised congestion close to major events like Glastonbury and Goodwood festivals, but it expected this to ease once festival-goers are on-site. More drivers are also choosing to car-share, according to Liftshare.com, who are seeing a new member added to their network every minute. National Highways also said there hadn't been a spike in traffic, with levels down 1% on Tuesday compared to 2019. Location technology firm TomTom found congestion had increased ""only slightly"" on Thursday morning across most UK cities compared to the same time a week ago. When people did need to travel, many appear to have turned to other modes of transport. On the first day of the strike there was a big jump in the number of people using cycle and e-scooter hire in London. Santander Cycle hires, which typically number about 30,000 per day, jumped to 67,000 hires on Tuesday, Transport for London said. This is the second biggest day for the scheme since it began. E-scooters in London have had around 6,500 hires per day in June but this jumped to more than 10,000 hires on Tuesday. A rise in bus use was recorded by National Express, which saw a ""significant increase"" in enquiries and bookings for strike dates. The firm said all of its services are ""very busy"" this week, with 70% of seats sold out across its UK-wide network. It anticipates this to hit close to 90% by the week's end. Meanwhile, Uber said demand in London was up by around 50% on Tuesday. However this reduced significantly on Thursday, which the company said could be an indication of more people working from home.

Those travelling from London Paddington on Thursday morning were relieved to find the station was quiet, with plenty of space on trains. With fewer people commuting, businesses based in city centres have been hit by reduced footfall. High Street footfall was 16.1% lower to 13:00 BSTon Thursday compared with the same day last week, according to retail analysts Springboard. In central London, the drop from last week was more than double the national average. Ashley Davis, who runs Morning Sunshine coffee shop at Warwick Parkway station, says the lack of footfall is ""really disheartening"". ""If this strike action does not get sorted, if the government do not get involved, we are left as collateral damage. Our bills still have to be paid every month,"" he adds. Ashley Davis says businesses like his need support So does the lack of impact on many workers mean rail unions have less power to negotiate? Gemma Dale, a lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University's business school, says with more office workers now able to do their job from home there is less pressure on the government to resolve the dispute than pre-pandemic. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested he's willing to wait it out - and has asked people to ""stay the course"". But the RMT union at the centre of the dispute has said more rail strikes are ""extremely likely"" if talks between rail bosses and unions continue to fail. Ms Dale points out the strike is still causing disruption for those who can't work remotely. ""It is still of course a huge issue to not have an effective rail service running across most of the country.""

Nike latest brand to leave Russia permanently,"Nike has announced plans to leave Russia, becoming the latest Western brand to quit the country since the invasion of Ukraine in February. The US sportswear giant halted online orders and closed the stores it owned in the country in March. Shops run by local partners continued to operate, but the firm is winding down those agreements. Networking giant Cisco also said it would start to fully shut down operations in Russia and Belarus. Other companies that have finalised plans to leave in recent weeks includeMcDonald'sandStarbucks. ""Nike has made the decision to leave the Russian marketplace,"" the company said in a statement. ""Our priority is to ensure we are fully supporting our employees while we responsibly scale down our operations over the coming months."" Russia has grown increasingly economically isolated since the invasion, as the West and allies impose sanctions and international companies head for the exits. The country is now working on legislation that would punish foreign companies seeking to leave, allowing the government to seize their assets and impose criminal penalties, according to Reuters. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? Russia unveils 'tasty' McDonald's substitute Nike has more than 50 stores in Russia, about a third of which are closed, according to its website. In May, Russian media reported that the company was ending its agreement with its largest franchisee in Russia, responsible for 37 stores. Nike had previously disclosed that Russia and Ukraine together accounted for less than 1% of the company's revenue. Cisco said on Thursday that it had ""made the decision to begin an orderly wind-down of our business in Russia and Belarus"". This decision will affect a few hundred employees, the US company said, adding that it wanted to ensure they are ""treated with respect"". ""Cisco remains committed to using all its resources to help our employees, the institutions and people of Ukraine, and our customers and partners during this challenging time,"" a spokesperson for the firm said. The networking giant had already stopped business operations, including sales and services, in the region in March, taking a $200m (Â£160m) hit to third quarter revenues.

PM and Charles unlikely to discuss asylum - No 10,"Downing Street says it is ""unlikely"" the UK's Rwanda asylum policy will come up when Boris Johnson meets the Prince of Wales on Friday. The prime minister had said he would defend the scheme if it was raised, but his spokesman later said it would not be at the forefront of his mind. Prince Charles is reported to have criticised plans to remove asylum seekers to the African country. The pair are in the Rwandan capital Kigali for a Commonwealth summit. The prime minister's spokesman said the policy was not something the Mr Johnson was focused on at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) summit, and emphasised challenges facing the Commonwealth such as sustainability, climate change and girls' education were the priority. Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda? âBeing sent to Rwanda didn't stop us getting to Europeâ Prince Charles meets Rwandan Genocide survivors Where does Rwanda flight setback leave ministers? A Clarence House spokesman said he would not be commenting on ""supposed remarks made in private"" except to say that ""the prince is politically neutral"" and that policy was a matter for the government. The policy has been criticised by politicians, refugee organisations and the Church of England, with some pointing to Rwanda's human rights record. There have been several legal challenges in the UK against the policy, with the first flight due to take people to Africa prevented from taking off earlier this month. Earlier, the prime minister said Rwanda had ""undergone an absolute transformation"" in the last couple of decades and had come on ""leaps and bounds"" in education and ""taking society forward"". ""People need to keep an open mind about the policy, the critics need to keep an open mind about the policy,"" he said. Boris Johnson is due to meet the Prince of Wales in Kigali It was reported in the Times, that Prince Charles had privately criticisedthe plan of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda as ""appalling"". But the prime minister, who said he had discussed the matter with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, said it was ""absolutely necessary and right to fix the problem of illegal cross-Channel trafficking of people"". Prince Charles, who is with his wife the Duchess of Cornwall, has met business leaders in Rwanda as part of the Commonwealth Business Forum. The Prince of Wales attends a Commonwealth Business Forum Exhibition at Kigali Cultural Exhibition Village, as part of his visit to Rwanda Prince Charles' wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, has joined him on the trip Boris Johnson is also joined by his wife Carrie in Rwanda Under theRwanda asylum plan, announced in April, the government intends to remove some asylum seekers who cross the Channel to the UK, sending them via a one-way ticket to Rwanda to claim asylum there instead. It has been criticised with some pointing out that last year the UK had raised concerns about restrictions to civil and political rights in the country. After the first flight taking asylum seekers to Rwanda was cancelled, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the scheme had ""never been a serious policy"" and described it as a ""shambles"" and ""shameful"". When the policy was first announced, the Liberal Democrats accused the government of ""slamming the door"" in the face of refugees. Boris Johnson held talks with Rwandan President Paul Kagame During his visit to Rwanda, Mr Johnson will not be visiting any of the accommodation set aside for the scheme, with his spokesman saying his time was limited. ""We think that the best use of his time for this short period he's in Rwanda is to dedicate himself to some of the issues that will be raised at the summit and to work with other world leaders on some of those issues we've talked about, not least Ukraine and global security,"" he said. During a speech as part of the summit, Mr Johnson spoke of the UK's support for green energy projects in Africa, including the announcement of up to Â£162m investment, via British International Investment, in the hydropower sector.

"Boxers exploited by Kinahan gang, officer says","Daniel Kinahan co-founded MTK Boxing which had links with many top boxers Many boxers have been exploited and preyed upon by the Kinahan organised crime group, a senior officer has said. The USrecently imposed sanctionson the gang's leaders and banned hundreds of people with suspected connections to the cartel from entering the country. A number of prominent boxers from Northern Ireland were formerly associated with the MTK boxing management company, which was co-founded by Daniel Kinahan. The boxers had no involvement in crime. Speaking to BBC News NI, Assistant Garda Commissioner John O'Driscoll said the United States shares information with the Irish authorities about some people who are banned from entering the US. ""That is a matter for the US authorities and we would not necessarily know all of the people who are refused entry in such circumstances. But, where it would be relevant to us, and where it may assist us in our investigations, that information is shared by the US authorities,"" he explained. Shortly after the US sanctions and reward were announced, MTKannounced that it was closing down. For years, the company was involved with some of the best boxers in the world, including some high profile boxers from Northern Ireland - Carl Frampton, Paddy Barnes and Michael Conlon. Carl Frampton and Paddy Barnes had retired, and Michael Conlon had disassociated himself from MTK, before it ceased operations. These boxers had no involvement with crime. In April, US authorities said a $5m reward was being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the gang's leaders BBC News NI asked Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll if any boxers - who were associated with MTK in the past - could be among the 600 people who've been banned from entering the US. He responded: ""It is a matter for interaction between a particular individual and the US authorities as they attempt to enter the US. But, from my knowledge, if they can assure the US authorities that they have disassociated themselves from people or entities that are problematic, that the prospect is there that they will be allowed entry to the US into the future."" The senior officer, who has been to the forefront of the international efforts to bring down the Kinahan cartel, believes the gang took advantage of many boxers from Northern Ireland and elsewhere. ""We see many people who are involved in boxing, in particular young people, being exploited by that organised crime group,"" he outlined. ""These are people who have, maybe, dedicated their life to pursuing a career in boxing, and who have no knowledge of the activities of the Kinahan organised crime group, but have been preyed upon by them and find themselves in circumstances that were not of their own making and they are people that we are attempting to protect also, in targeting the criminal activity engaged in by the Kinahan organised crime group."" Commenting on the continuing international efforts against the gang leaders and their assets, the Dublin-based assistant commissioner said there was an important cross-border dimension to the operation. ""Northern Ireland features from a number of perspectives. Firstly, it may feature in the drug trafficking route involved. So, while cocaine obviously, imported into Ireland by the Kinahan organised crime group, will in some cases be destined for Ireland, on other occasions it'll be destined for the UK, and the route which it will take may include transportation through Northern Ireland,"" he explained. ""Or indeed, it may in some cases be intended to supply a demand for that drug in that part of the UK also."" He added: ""Movement takes place on a regular basis among those who are involved in the criminal organisations concerned. ""So, you may find movement that is temporary in nature. On occasions, people may stay somewhat longer. But, all of those movements are subject to ongoing monitoring in the relevant jurisdictions.""

EU awards Ukraine and Moldova candidate status,"Ukrainians waited outside the EU summit building for the leaders to decide on their country's status Ukraine and Moldova have both been granted EU candidate status, President of the European Council Charles Michel has announced. ""Today marks a crucial step on your path towards the EU,"" Mr Michel said, describing the European Council's decision as a ""historic moment"". Ukraine applied days after the Russian invasion in February, and the process moved at a record speed. Its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, hailed Thursday's decision. ""It's a unique and historical moment in UA[Ukraine]-EU relations...""he tweeted,external. ""Ukraine's future is within the EU."" The mayor of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, former boxer Vitali Klitschko, paid an emotional tribute to his fellow citizens resisting the invasion. ""We paid a very high price for this chance,"" he wrote on Telegram. ""Yes, we still have a lot to do on the way to the European family. ""But I am sure that Ukraine will do everything necessary, fulfil all the conditions and pass the necessary laws. Because otherwise our state has no future. Indeed, our best defenders are dying for it."" Candidate status is the first official step towards EU membership. But it can take many years to join and there's no guarantee of success. The European Commission president said the accession process would be ""merit-based"" and ""by the book"", and that formal negotiations would not begin until conditional reforms are carried out. These include bolstering the rule of law, and fighting corruption. The Commission is due to take stock at the end of 2022. The step is undoubtedly a big moment for Ukraine, and a popular one. How might Russia react if Ukraine joins the EU? While Moldova's application was accepted, a third former Soviet state, Georgia, has still to qualify for candidacy. Mr Michel said that the Council recognised the country's ""European perspective"" and was ""ready to grant candidate status once the outstanding priorities are addressed"". Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili tweeted,externalthat her country was ""ready to work with determination over the next months to reach the candidate status"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said all three countries were ""part of our European family"". ""This decision strengthens us all,""she tweeted,external. ""It strengthens Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, in the face of Russian imperialism. And it strengthens the EU. Because it shows once again to the world that we are united and strong in the face of external threats."" President Zelensky spoke of his country's desire for candidate status in almost every speech over the past week. He knows that starting down the path of EU membership will permanently shift Ukraine out of Russia's sphere of influence. Four EU leaders travelled to Kyiv last Thursday to give their blessing to Ukraine's bid for candidacy Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told reporters the EU's political backing was very important for Ukrainians: ""This is the least we can provide for them."" Outside the summit building, activist Anna Melenchuk from Kyiv told the BBC: ""People I know are dying every day at the hands of Russian soldiers. This is why it's so important to have the European Union's support."" It was pro-EU protests that ousted Ukraine's Russia-backed President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. That event in turn led to the annexation of Crimea and the separatist uprisings, the events that Ukrainians see as the start of the current war. The Kremlin knew this was on the cards and has already been acting as if it's no big deal. Last week in St Petersburg, President Vladimir Putin claimed he had ""nothing against"" Ukraine's possible membership of the European Union: ""It's their sovereign decision to join economic unions or not."" He said it, but did he mean it? It is hard to believe Russia's president would sit back and watch the country he invaded join the European Union. How might Russia react if Ukraine joins the EU? President Putin once described Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people, a single whole"" and views Ukraine as a territory that, historically, belongs to Russia. The Russian invasion is widely seen as his attempt to force Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit, and he shows no sign of ending the offensive. EU candidate status for Ukraine sends a strong message to Moscow: that neither Kyiv nor Brussels accepts the Putin vision of a new European order. But he will be aware that the road from candidate status to EU member is a long one. Along the way Ukraine will face plenty of hurdles - quite likely many put there by Russia. The long process of joining the EU frustrated Western Balkan leaders at a separate Brussels summit on Thursday. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama warned Kyiv to be under no illusions: ""North Macedonia is a candidate [for] 17 years if I have not lost count, Albania eight, so welcome to Ukraine."" North Macedonian Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski expressed his ""dissatisfaction"" at the lack of progress in their own bids to join the EU. Bulgaria is effectively blocking North Macedonia and Albania's membership bids while other countries have yet to make the necessary reforms. Georgians took part in a ""March for Europe"" on Monday night, but the Commission said Georgia was not ready for candidate status Some EU diplomats have previously voiced concerns that giving Ukraine candidate status could offer false hope. French President Emmanuel Macron said in May that the prospect of membership was decades away and the Nato secretary general has warned the conflict could last years. ""We do not accept the idea of the queue,"" Ukraine's EU envoy told the BBC, pointing to work carried out since the EU and Ukraine signed an association agreement in 2014. As well as deciding on candidate status, EU leaders were also due to discuss food security in light of Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports, condemned by the EU's foreign policy chief this week as a war crime. They were also considering President Macron's proposal for a wider ""European Political Community"", to include countries waiting to join the EU or even those that have left, which would currently include the UK. Although a number of EU diplomats have rejected the idea as half-baked, the Ukrainian ambassador did not dismiss the idea out of hand. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said her preference would be to build on existing structures such as the G7 and Nato.

US bans all products from vaping company Juul,"The US is banning the sale of all products sold by Juul, one of the country's top e-cigarette companies. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it did not have enough data to be sure that marketing the firm's products was ""appropriate for the protection of public health"". Juul said it would challenge the move. It comes after other recent anti-smoking efforts by the FDA, including plans to reduce the amount of addictive nicotine allowed in cigarettes. The agency had already barred the fruity flavours that helped make Juul a phenomenon among teenagers a few years ago. ""Today's action is further progress on the FDA's commitment to ensuring that all e-cigarette and electronic nicotine delivery system products currently being marketed to consumers meet our public health standards,"" FDA commissioner Robert M. Califf said in a statement. Juul, founded in California in 2015 by a pair of former smokers, has promoted its vaping pods as a healthier alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes. But the products, which contain high concentrations of nicotine, raised alarm as use among teens exploded, with more than quarter of high schoolers using e-cigarettes in 2019, according to a federal survey. In 2020 the FDA said it would require companies to submit their e-cigarette products for approval. It has since granted some of them a green light. US plans to reduce nicotine in cigarettes Juul's rise to a $38bn vaping phenomenon In its statement,external, the FDA said it had not received any information to suggest an ""immediate hazard"". But it also noted the major role Juul, whose products under review had nicotine levels of 3% and 5%, still plays in the market. ""We recognise these make up a significant part of the available products and many have played a disproportionate role in the rise in youth vaping,"" Mr Califf said. Juul said it would seek a stay of the ruling, which would allow it to keep selling as it explores options including an appeal. ""We respectfully disagree with the FDA's findings and decision and continue to believe we have provided sufficient information and data based on high-quality research to address all issues raised by the agency,"" the firm's chief regulatory officer, Joe Murillo,said in a statement,external. ""We intend to seek a stay and are exploring all of our options under the FDA's regulations and the law, including appealing the decision and engaging with our regulator. ""We remain committed to doing all in our power to continue serving the millions of American adult smokers who have successfully used our products to transition away from combustible cigarettes, which remain available on market shelves nationwide,"" he added. Juul has already seen its business hit by regulatory action, as officials investigated its marketing practices to teens and tightened rules on what flavours could be sold. International restrictions have also limited its expansion outside the US. Altria Group, which took a 35% stake in the company in 2018 for more than $12bn, has been forced to write off much of the value of its investment. The firm's shares sank 9% on Wednesday, after the Wall Street Journal reported plans for the ban.

"More rail strikes extremely likely, says union boss","This video can not be played Watch: RMT boss says government is making negotiations worse as Rail Delivery Group chair suggests reform may not mean redundancies More rail strikes are ""extremely likely"" if talks between rail bosses and unions continue to fail, the union at the centre of the dispute has said. RMT boss Mick Lynch accused the government of blocking a deal, a claim denied by the government. For the second time this week a walkout by rail workers has left travellers facing another day of disruption. Trains have ground to a halt across much of England, Wales and Scotland, with about half the network closed. Another walkout is already planned for Saturday. Downing Street said the unions should call off the strikes ""as quickly as possible"", but Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) workers' union, earlier told BBC Breakfast that Saturday's industrial action might not be the last. He said talks would continue and he would consult members to see ""if and when there needs to be a new phase of industrial action"". ""But if we don't get a settlement, it's extremely likely there will be,"" he said. Tim Shoveller, the chief negotiator for Network Rail - which maintains the railways throughout Britain - said there had been hopes on Wednesday of stopping the second day of strikes and it was ""hugely frustrating"" after talks collapsed. As it happened: Trains grind to a halt on second day of strikes What days are the strikes and which trains are running? Ros Atkins on... Why rail strikes are happening Train services across the UK have been cancelled as a result of the rail strikes There have been accusations on both sides that third parties are hampering progress. Mr Lynch told BBC's Breakfast: ""The government's hand is in this... the [rail] companies leave the room, consult the government ministers and the department officials and when they come back often the situation is worse."" But Network Rail - with whom the RMT are negotiating - said it was the RMT, not the government which stalled negotiations. Mr Shoveller said they thought they had a deal on Wednesday until the RMT left the room to get guidance from their board. How have you been affected by the rail strikes? Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy The Department for Transport has insisted the rail industry is leading the negotiations. However, a contract seen by the BBC said train operating companies' handling of strike action was ""subject to the secretary of state's direction"", a reference to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary. A key sticking point of negotiations appears to centre around a letter from Network Rail about pressing ahead with a formal consultation over changes to working practices in maintenance teams - which would entail redundancies. The RMT asked for it to be withdrawn - and accused Transport Secretary Grant Shapps of wrecking negotiations by not allowing Network Rail to do so. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"" and said he had no involvement in the letter. Speaking from Rwanda, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the strikes as ""unnecessary"" and stressed the benefits of ""sensible reforms"" of the rail system. Mr Johnson, who is attending a Commonwealth summit, said ""people should get around the table and sort it out"", adding he wanted a ""great future"" for British railways. The RMT- the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers' union - represents 40,000 members from cleaners to train guards across the rail network The Rail Delivery Grouprepresents train operators andNetwork Rail- which maintains the tracks and runs some bigger stations The Transport Secretary- Grant Shapps says it is not his role to negotiate with unions, though Labour and some Tory MPs think he should be involved The RMT is calling for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the cost of living crisis, as inflation hits 9.1% and is forecast to reach 11% in the autumn. Employers have offered a maximum of 3%, on condition that the union accepts new working practices. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies, said it wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"", which meant modernising the railway to attract passengers back. As Network Rail and the unions get back around the table for another long day of negotiation, one rail company - one of the few franchises run without government money - has reached a settlement in a separate dispute. Picketers outside Edinburgh Waverley Station on Thursday Merseyrail workers have been given a 7.1% pay rise. Asked if that's what Network Rail would offer eventually, Mr Shoveller said: ""I think that's very unlikely."" ""We can see a way of funding a pay deal, not of those sort of proportions but still an overall good package recognising that the prime thing the unions are asking for is a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies,"" he told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. ""So we think we've got a package of no compulsory redundancies, of money and some other long sought after things the union and employees have been after and we want to move forward with that package."" Eddie Dempsey, of the RMT, said the Merseyrail deal was significant. ""Wherever we're dealing with somebody who's not directly controlled by the DfT, we're making progress,"" he added. A Department for Transport spokesperson said it was entirely false to claim the government was blocking negotiations. ""We have said from the outset we urge the unions and industry to agree a deal that is fair for railway staff, passengers and taxpayers,"" they added. Many would-be commuters worked from home, while many festival-goers heading to Glastonbury appeared to travel by road instead of rail. Those who did brave the commute were met by short queues, while normally bustling stations were quiet, with concourses closed off. Businesses which rely on morning commutersalso faced knock-on impact. RMT members picketed several stations, including general secretary Mick Lynch who joined the picket line at London's Euston station. Meanwhile, traffic in London was higher than at the same time last week,according to data by location technology firm TomTom. Elsewhere, the roads were not as busy as anticipated.

Fighting hard for votes in Devon,"A by-election deep in once-safe Conservative territory threatens to upend British politics. For the parties fighting it, the stakes are huge - but they're picking their battles in very different ways. It's a hot summer morning in mid-Devon and Kayleigh Diggle stands in the bookshop she runs, feeling conflicted. The 32-year-old, who normally supports the Greens, is annoyed with the Conservative government and is considering a tactical vote for the Liberal Democrats. But the sheer relentlessness of the latter's campaign makes her recoil. ""It's their constant leafleting,"" says Kayleigh. She's sick, too, of looking at the party's Day-Glo yellow-and-black diamond-shaped posters (""Winning here!"") everywhere she goes. ""It's very, very, over-the-top."" Voters in Tiverton and Honiton aren't used to anyone having to fight quite this hard for their votes. Kayleigh Diggle Sprawling from the fringes of Exmoor to a stretch of the Jurassic Coast, this cluster of villages and market towns was seen until recently as an extremely safe Conservative seat. Then erstwhile MP Neil Parish admitted watching pornography in Parliament after, by his own account, searching online for tractors. Now there's a by-election to replace him. Partygate, turmoil on the Tory benches and the cost of living crisis have made the 23 June vote a crucial test of the public's mood. And with another by-election taking place on the same dayin the northern ""Red Wall"" battleground of Wakefield, Tiverton and Honiton has been tasked with delivering an interim verdict from the Tories' southern base on Boris Johnson's government. The three main parties are joined by candidates from the For Britain Movement, the Green Party, the Heritage Party, Reform UK and the UK Independence Party.A full list is available here. The Lib Dems came third here in 2019, while the Conservative winning margin was a gargantuan 24,239. But having recently won a brace of safe Tory seats at by-elections in Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire, Lib Dem campaigners have poured into the seat. However, the Conservatives are also battling hard to hold on to what was theirs, albeit with a lower-key, tightly controlled strategy that couldn't be more different to the Lib Dems' electoral shock and awe. And despite talk of an informal alliance between opposition parties, Labour's candidate, who came second here in 2019, insists she hasn't given up the fight, either. On Honiton's handsome Georgian High Street, Jubilee bunting flutters against the florists and tea rooms. It's here that the Lib Dems have set up one of their campaign headquarters in an empty shop unit. Inside, a crudely sketched map on the wall shows where party volunteers have travelled from - Orkney, Carlisle, Kingston-upon-Hull. The party say that last weekend, 350 activists knocked on 14,000 doors. Piles of leaflets are carefully arranged into neat bundles by polling district. Canvassers are given issues specific to each area to discuss - river pollution in Axminster, for instance, or lack of dental services here in Honiton. In charge of directing volunteers today is Chessie Flack, 24. What gives her a political identity, she says, is ""this perfect Lib Dem machine of a load of activists in socks and sandals, and they knock on every door in the constituency and they win the campaign"". But no-one is under any illusions that overturning such a huge majority will be easy. Chessie Flack In a cafe across the street, the party's candidate Richard Foord empties a pile of miniature marshmallows into his hot chocolate and stirs. Bookmakers have named him the favourite to win but he knows he'll need all the energy he can summon. ""I think we can't entirely take at face value the bookies' odds as a predictor or a forecast of this election outcome,"" Foord says. ""We are absolutely working for every single vote but recognising that there's a mountain to climb, frankly."" Richard Foord In his Tattersall shirt, Foord, who lives locally, looks like he's stepped out of the pages of Country Life magazine. He has the military bearing, too, of a man who spent a decade in the Army, having risen to the rank of major. On the front page of a leaflet distributed by his campaign, he is pictured in uniform above the slogan: ""I served my country. Now I'm fighting for Devon."" Along with the Union Jack bunting in the window of the campaign office, this looks a lot like a pitch to the 58% of voters in the seat who voted to leave the EU. Earlier in the day I spotted Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, on a train heading west, and asked if his party's ""Stop Brexit"" slogan under former leader Jo Swinson in 2019 damaged its chances here in 2022. He was emphatic that it didn't: ""Traditionally we've been strong in rural communities, Liberal Democrats have been strong in the West Country,"" said Sir Ed. ""So in many ways this is going back to where our roots are."" Helen Hurford In a 1980s estate on the fringe of Tiverton, the sun blazes down on a near-empty car park outside a community centre. Half an hour ago, the phone in my pocket buzzed and a Tory press officer summoned me here to meet candidate Helen Hurford. Previously, the Independent reported that she had been ""ordered not to speak to the media"". The Financial Times wrote that she ""was being shielded from the national media"" and the Times described her as ""somewhat elusive"". But now a car pulls up and out steps Hurford, in a blue dress and trainers. With a broad smile, she flatly rejects the suggestion that she'd been kept hidden from the press corps. ""If you'd wanted to find me you could have just followed me around, knocking on the doors - you would have easily found me,"" she says. Her focus, she suggests, is on the residents of Tiverton and Honiton, not reporters: ""The people of the constituency come first."" She talks about the need to improve the area's road and rail network and support local farmers. Hurford emphasises, too, that she was born and brought up in Honiton and was the head teacher at a local school. ""She has probably taught a large part of the population around here,"" says local Conservative activist Luis Gordon. It's not the only way in which the Conservative campaign appears to have been carefully managed. While Johnson has visited the constituency during the campaign, his appearances have been low-key and without advance fanfare. The Lib Dems have accused the prime minister of ""hiding away"" - but equally, it makes sense for the Tories not to take risks. ""It's a small-C and big-C Conservative area,"" says Dr Hannah Bunting, a political scientist at the University of Exeter. ""It would really be remarkable if we saw the seat changing hands, even under the current conditions."" Privately, senior Lib Dem insiders concede that the Conservatives are taking this contest a lot more seriously than they did prior to their December 2021 defeat in North Shropshire. And while national issues might be a headache for the Tory campaign, it's not clear that the circumstances of Neil Parish's departure are having much of an impact. The former MP, a farmer himself, enjoyed a lot of goodwill among the agricultural community, according to Richard Tucker, chair of the local National Farmers Union. Richard Tucker ""As farmers we felt we were well represented in this area,"" adds Tucker. At a recent NFU hustings, he says, ""all the candidates were pretty open in acknowledging that they weren't as agriculturally qualified as Neil. But they're all open to learning - well, they've got to be."" Why some farmers are turning away from the Tories First-time voters consider cost of living Issues they'll need to have brushed up on include the government's new food strategy, the phasing out of taxpayer-funded direct payments to farmers under an EU scheme and the surging cost of fertiliser - all of huge concern to those working in agriculture locally. Among those contesting the by-election are the United Kingdom Independence Party, which came second in the seat in 2015, and Reform UK, which shares some of its political DNA, having also once been led by Nigel Farage. The Green Party, which attracted more than 2,000 votes here in 2019, is also standing again. Above all, what seems to motivate Conservative activists is the suggestion that Labour - who are concentrating their fire on Wakefield - have agreed to give the Lib Dems a free run in Tiverton and Honiton. Both opposition parties strenuously deny there has been any kind of formal agreement. But Chris Daw, a local councillor who has been campaigning for Hurford, is visibly riled at the notion of any stitch-up. ""It annoys me because I think, you know, let's just be honest with each other,"" she says. ""Not just put out hints. I believe they should be straight up front and say what they're doing."" If anyone could confirm or deny the existence of a pact, it's Liz Pole. This is the second time she has stood as Labour's candidate in Tiverton and Honiton. On the previous occasion, in 2019, she earned more than 11,000 votes while finishing second, albeit distantly. Over tea in a cafe in Cullompton, in the west of the constituency, Pole is emphatic that there has been no deal. ""That is definitely not part of my political DNA whatsoever,"" she says. ""I'm fighting to win this constituency, I want to see Labour thriving and growing."" Liz Pole However, Pole, who runs a software business and has lived locally for 20 years, admits it's ""frustrating"" to read articles anointing the Lib Dems as the main challengers. Remarks by nearby Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw were interpreted as calling for a Lib Dem win, although Pole says his comments were ""taken a little bit out of context"". While Labour's big beasts, including party leader Keir Starmer and deputy Angela Rayner, have flocked to Wakefield, it's harder to detect them in this part of Devon. Asked about this, Pole replies that she's expecting a visit from shadow food, farming and fisheries minister Daniel Zeichner - a frontbencher, certainly, but perhaps not one with the greatest box-office appeal. Is Tory marginal Wakefield ready to go red again? So Pole is getting help from closer to home. She says Labour has activists in each of the seat's 24 wards and their campaign will go into each of them with her messages about affordable housing, the cost of living crisis and food strategy. Richard Clarke, 49, has travelled here from Cawsand, south-east Cornwall, to campaign for Pole.  He says that on the doorstep, voters are receptive to what she's saying. ""People know we need a change of government - and people also know that needs to be a Labour government, because obviously you don't get Liberal governments, unless you're living in 1906,"" he says. There's a sense among Labour's activists, however, that the by-election has come at an inopportune time for the party. Broader trends suggest traditional north-south political divides are being upended and in 2021's local elections Labour won district council seat in Honiton, its first in East Devon for more than two decades. Parish's resignation, some volunteers feel, interrupted that momentum. ""Voters are looking for a home, I think, and a by-election isn't necessarily the best time to find that,""  says retired academic Paul Furlong, 73, from Aveton Gifford in south Devon. Nonetheless, Tiverton and Honiton has until Thursday to find a berth, temporary or otherwise. Photos by Emma Lynch / BBC Â© 2025 BBC.

Nike latest brand to leave Russia permanentlyRussia's economic isolation deepens as more Western companies leave the country.Business,"Nike has announced plans to leave Russia, becoming the latest Western brand to quit the country since the invasion of Ukraine in February. The US sportswear giant halted online orders and closed the stores it owned in the country in March. Shops run by local partners continued to operate, but the firm is winding down those agreements. Networking giant Cisco also said it would start to fully shut down operations in Russia and Belarus. Other companies that have finalised plans to leave in recent weeks includeMcDonald'sandStarbucks. ""Nike has made the decision to leave the Russian marketplace,"" the company said in a statement. ""Our priority is to ensure we are fully supporting our employees while we responsibly scale down our operations over the coming months."" Russia has grown increasingly economically isolated since the invasion, as the West and allies impose sanctions and international companies head for the exits. The country is now working on legislation that would punish foreign companies seeking to leave, allowing the government to seize their assets and impose criminal penalties, according to Reuters. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? Russia unveils 'tasty' McDonald's substitute Nike has more than 50 stores in Russia, about a third of which are closed, according to its website. In May, Russian media reported that the company was ending its agreement with its largest franchisee in Russia, responsible for 37 stores. Nike had previously disclosed that Russia and Ukraine together accounted for less than 1% of the company's revenue. Cisco said on Thursday that it had ""made the decision to begin an orderly wind-down of our business in Russia and Belarus"". This decision will affect a few hundred employees, the US company said, adding that it wanted to ensure they are ""treated with respect"". ""Cisco remains committed to using all its resources to help our employees, the institutions and people of Ukraine, and our customers and partners during this challenging time,"" a spokesperson for the firm said. The networking giant had already stopped business operations, including sales and services, in the region in March, taking a $200m (Â£160m) hit to third quarter revenues.

"EU awards Ukraine and Moldova candidate statusPresident of the European Council Charles Michel announces the ""crucial step"" towards membership.Europe","Ukrainians waited outside the EU summit building for the leaders to decide on their country's status Ukraine and Moldova have both been granted EU candidate status, President of the European Council Charles Michel has announced. ""Today marks a crucial step on your path towards the EU,"" Mr Michel said, describing the European Council's decision as a ""historic moment"". Ukraine applied days after the Russian invasion in February, and the process moved at a record speed. Its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, hailed Thursday's decision. ""It's a unique and historical moment in UA[Ukraine]-EU relations...""he tweeted,external. ""Ukraine's future is within the EU."" The mayor of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, former boxer Vitali Klitschko, paid an emotional tribute to his fellow citizens resisting the invasion. ""We paid a very high price for this chance,"" he wrote on Telegram. ""Yes, we still have a lot to do on the way to the European family. ""But I am sure that Ukraine will do everything necessary, fulfil all the conditions and pass the necessary laws. Because otherwise our state has no future. Indeed, our best defenders are dying for it."" Candidate status is the first official step towards EU membership. But it can take many years to join and there's no guarantee of success. The European Commission president said the accession process would be ""merit-based"" and ""by the book"", and that formal negotiations would not begin until conditional reforms are carried out. These include bolstering the rule of law, and fighting corruption. The Commission is due to take stock at the end of 2022. The step is undoubtedly a big moment for Ukraine, and a popular one. How might Russia react if Ukraine joins the EU? While Moldova's application was accepted, a third former Soviet state, Georgia, has still to qualify for candidacy. Mr Michel said that the Council recognised the country's ""European perspective"" and was ""ready to grant candidate status once the outstanding priorities are addressed"". Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili tweeted,externalthat her country was ""ready to work with determination over the next months to reach the candidate status"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said all three countries were ""part of our European family"". ""This decision strengthens us all,""she tweeted,external. ""It strengthens Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, in the face of Russian imperialism. And it strengthens the EU. Because it shows once again to the world that we are united and strong in the face of external threats."" President Zelensky spoke of his country's desire for candidate status in almost every speech over the past week. He knows that starting down the path of EU membership will permanently shift Ukraine out of Russia's sphere of influence. Four EU leaders travelled to Kyiv last Thursday to give their blessing to Ukraine's bid for candidacy Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told reporters the EU's political backing was very important for Ukrainians: ""This is the least we can provide for them."" Outside the summit building, activist Anna Melenchuk from Kyiv told the BBC: ""People I know are dying every day at the hands of Russian soldiers. This is why it's so important to have the European Union's support."" It was pro-EU protests that ousted Ukraine's Russia-backed President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. That event in turn led to the annexation of Crimea and the separatist uprisings, the events that Ukrainians see as the start of the current war. The Kremlin knew this was on the cards and has already been acting as if it's no big deal. Last week in St Petersburg, President Vladimir Putin claimed he had ""nothing against"" Ukraine's possible membership of the European Union: ""It's their sovereign decision to join economic unions or not."" He said it, but did he mean it? It is hard to believe Russia's president would sit back and watch the country he invaded join the European Union. How might Russia react if Ukraine joins the EU? President Putin once described Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people, a single whole"" and views Ukraine as a territory that, historically, belongs to Russia. The Russian invasion is widely seen as his attempt to force Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit, and he shows no sign of ending the offensive. EU candidate status for Ukraine sends a strong message to Moscow: that neither Kyiv nor Brussels accepts the Putin vision of a new European order. But he will be aware that the road from candidate status to EU member is a long one. Along the way Ukraine will face plenty of hurdles - quite likely many put there by Russia. The long process of joining the EU frustrated Western Balkan leaders at a separate Brussels summit on Thursday. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama warned Kyiv to be under no illusions: ""North Macedonia is a candidate [for] 17 years if I have not lost count, Albania eight, so welcome to Ukraine."" North Macedonian Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski expressed his ""dissatisfaction"" at the lack of progress in their own bids to join the EU. Bulgaria is effectively blocking North Macedonia and Albania's membership bids while other countries have yet to make the necessary reforms. Georgians took part in a ""March for Europe"" on Monday night, but the Commission said Georgia was not ready for candidate status Some EU diplomats have previously voiced concerns that giving Ukraine candidate status could offer false hope. French President Emmanuel Macron said in May that the prospect of membership was decades away and the Nato secretary general has warned the conflict could last years. ""We do not accept the idea of the queue,"" Ukraine's EU envoy told the BBC, pointing to work carried out since the EU and Ukraine signed an association agreement in 2014. As well as deciding on candidate status, EU leaders were also due to discuss food security in light of Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports, condemned by the EU's foreign policy chief this week as a war crime. They were also considering President Macron's proposal for a wider ""European Political Community"", to include countries waiting to join the EU or even those that have left, which would currently include the UK. Although a number of EU diplomats have rejected the idea as half-baked, the Ukrainian ambassador did not dismiss the idea out of hand. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said her preference would be to build on existing structures such as the G7 and Nato.

Ukrainians wait for EU summit decision on candidacy,"Ukrainians waited outside the EU summit building for the leaders to decide on their country's status Ukraine and Moldova have both been granted EU candidate status, President of the European Council Charles Michel has announced. ""Today marks a crucial step on your path towards the EU,"" Mr Michel said, describing the European Council's decision as a ""historic moment"". Ukraine applied days after the Russian invasion in February, and the process moved at a record speed. Its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, hailed Thursday's decision. ""It's a unique and historical moment in UA[Ukraine]-EU relations...""he tweeted,external. ""Ukraine's future is within the EU."" The mayor of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, former boxer Vitali Klitschko, paid an emotional tribute to his fellow citizens resisting the invasion. ""We paid a very high price for this chance,"" he wrote on Telegram. ""Yes, we still have a lot to do on the way to the European family. ""But I am sure that Ukraine will do everything necessary, fulfil all the conditions and pass the necessary laws. Because otherwise our state has no future. Indeed, our best defenders are dying for it."" Candidate status is the first official step towards EU membership. But it can take many years to join and there's no guarantee of success. The European Commission president said the accession process would be ""merit-based"" and ""by the book"", and that formal negotiations would not begin until conditional reforms are carried out. These include bolstering the rule of law, and fighting corruption. The Commission is due to take stock at the end of 2022. The step is undoubtedly a big moment for Ukraine, and a popular one. How might Russia react if Ukraine joins the EU? While Moldova's application was accepted, a third former Soviet state, Georgia, has still to qualify for candidacy. Mr Michel said that the Council recognised the country's ""European perspective"" and was ""ready to grant candidate status once the outstanding priorities are addressed"". Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili tweeted,externalthat her country was ""ready to work with determination over the next months to reach the candidate status"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said all three countries were ""part of our European family"". ""This decision strengthens us all,""she tweeted,external. ""It strengthens Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, in the face of Russian imperialism. And it strengthens the EU. Because it shows once again to the world that we are united and strong in the face of external threats."" President Zelensky spoke of his country's desire for candidate status in almost every speech over the past week. He knows that starting down the path of EU membership will permanently shift Ukraine out of Russia's sphere of influence. Four EU leaders travelled to Kyiv last Thursday to give their blessing to Ukraine's bid for candidacy Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told reporters the EU's political backing was very important for Ukrainians: ""This is the least we can provide for them."" Outside the summit building, activist Anna Melenchuk from Kyiv told the BBC: ""People I know are dying every day at the hands of Russian soldiers. This is why it's so important to have the European Union's support."" It was pro-EU protests that ousted Ukraine's Russia-backed President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. That event in turn led to the annexation of Crimea and the separatist uprisings, the events that Ukrainians see as the start of the current war. The Kremlin knew this was on the cards and has already been acting as if it's no big deal. Last week in St Petersburg, President Vladimir Putin claimed he had ""nothing against"" Ukraine's possible membership of the European Union: ""It's their sovereign decision to join economic unions or not."" He said it, but did he mean it? It is hard to believe Russia's president would sit back and watch the country he invaded join the European Union. How might Russia react if Ukraine joins the EU? President Putin once described Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people, a single whole"" and views Ukraine as a territory that, historically, belongs to Russia. The Russian invasion is widely seen as his attempt to force Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit, and he shows no sign of ending the offensive. EU candidate status for Ukraine sends a strong message to Moscow: that neither Kyiv nor Brussels accepts the Putin vision of a new European order. But he will be aware that the road from candidate status to EU member is a long one. Along the way Ukraine will face plenty of hurdles - quite likely many put there by Russia. The long process of joining the EU frustrated Western Balkan leaders at a separate Brussels summit on Thursday. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama warned Kyiv to be under no illusions: ""North Macedonia is a candidate [for] 17 years if I have not lost count, Albania eight, so welcome to Ukraine."" North Macedonian Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski expressed his ""dissatisfaction"" at the lack of progress in their own bids to join the EU. Bulgaria is effectively blocking North Macedonia and Albania's membership bids while other countries have yet to make the necessary reforms. Georgians took part in a ""March for Europe"" on Monday night, but the Commission said Georgia was not ready for candidate status Some EU diplomats have previously voiced concerns that giving Ukraine candidate status could offer false hope. French President Emmanuel Macron said in May that the prospect of membership was decades away and the Nato secretary general has warned the conflict could last years. ""We do not accept the idea of the queue,"" Ukraine's EU envoy told the BBC, pointing to work carried out since the EU and Ukraine signed an association agreement in 2014. As well as deciding on candidate status, EU leaders were also due to discuss food security in light of Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports, condemned by the EU's foreign policy chief this week as a war crime. They were also considering President Macron's proposal for a wider ""European Political Community"", to include countries waiting to join the EU or even those that have left, which would currently include the UK. Although a number of EU diplomats have rejected the idea as half-baked, the Ukrainian ambassador did not dismiss the idea out of hand. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said her preference would be to build on existing structures such as the G7 and Nato.

Far-right cell jailed for terror offences,"Liam Hall, Stacey Salmon, Daniel Wright and Samuel Whibley were jailed for a total of 31 years Members of a ""fascist"" cell who made gun parts on a 3D printer and rejoiced at mass shootings have been jailed. The three men and one woman were convicted of 18 offences in March following a two-month trial. Prosecutors said they had ""celebrated racist violence and killing"". At Sheffield Crown Court, Daniel Wright, 29, Liam Hall, 31, and Stacey Salmon, 29, all from Keighley, and Samuel Whibley, 29, from Anglesey, were jailed for a total of 31 years. During the trial, jurors had heard thata partially constructed 3D-printed gunwas found at the home of Hall and his partner Salmon at Hill Top Walk, Keighley. Firearms experts said despite being incomplete, the weapon could have proved lethal if fully assembled. Other weapons were also recovered from the gang, as well as chemicals and practical guides for making explosives. Counter terrorism police recovered a partially constructed 3D-printed gun from Hall and Salmon's home An undercover police officer had infiltrated the group, which used the Telegram online messaging app to exchange terror manuals and share racist ideology, the trial heard. The group also posted videos of atrocities, including mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March 2019. Daniel Wright, 30, of Whinfield Avenue, Keighley, was found guilty of seven offences, including an offence of manufacturing a firearm, and was jailed for 12 years.

We're closing our coverage shortly, but here's a recap of what happened:  Today's reporting was brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Adam Durbin, Craig Hutchison, Marita Moloney, James Harness, Alexandra Fouche, Lauren Hirst and Aoife Walsh. It was edited by Chris Giles, Jeremy Gahagan and Holly Wallis.  Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent This is going to be a difficult summer for British Airways. IT problems and staff shortages have already hit its
operations this year. Now you can add industrial action to the mix. Check-in staff at Heathrow are set to walk out during the
summer peak. The airline will have contingency plans in place, but with systems
already under strain, disruption seems inevitable. The airline insists that it wants to work with staff, and
that itâs 10% one-off bonus offer was a prelude to meaningful pay talks.
It is still under pressure, too â the industry has not fully recovered. But the problem its facing is that when the cuts were first
imposed, many staff were deeply upset by what they saw as the heavy-handed
approach of the airlineâs management. And now, itâs pretty clear that many workers simply donât
trust the word of their managers. Although railway staff are on strike today the effect of the industrial action will still be felt tomorrow. It's thought only 60% of the normal weekday services will operate. This is due to the knock-on effect of overnight signallers and control room staff being on strike. Trains will leave depots a lot later in the morning than usual when the daytime shift starts work at around 06:00. Normally, trains are moved from 03:00. The length of time it takes for train services to get back to normal depends on the distance between a depot and a station. In a major city trains do not have so far to travel, but for rural areas it may take several hours. However, it's not just Friday morning when there will be disruption. Some train operators will wind-down services slightly earlier than normal, ahead of the next planned strike on Saturday. Passengers are urged to check for amendments to train companies' timetables. Hamzah AbbasBBC News Rail strikes have been causing disruption across much of the UK this week, with people struggling to get to work. But for one commuter, the walkouts were never going to be an issue. George Bullard has been kayaking to the office since 2015, a mode of transport he chose because it was ""an interesting way to get to work"". He travels to his workplace in Presteigne in Wales, where he runs a camping company, by kayaking down the River Lugg, when it's safe to do so. But he warns against others following suit, saying it can be dangerous without the right experience. Read more here.   Strike action means stations such as Euston in London will not have the same footfall as normal It's estimated the rail strikes will cost the UK hospitality sector over half a billion pounds in lost revenue across the three planned days of action. And the impact will be felt particularly keenly in the capital, says one industry insider. ""London is proportionately more dense in terms of hospitality venues and so [the impact] will be disproportionately higher ,"" says Tony Sophoclides, strategic affairs director for UK Hospitality. He tells the BBC the walkouts will cost London hospitality around Â£70m in lost trading, ""which is really not what we need at the moment"". Less than 20% of services were expected to run on Thursday, but - unlike the first day of strikes on Tuesday - London Underground union members have not been striking andthe tube has been run as normal,external, with only minor disruption. High street footfall in the UK was 16.1% lower to 13:00 BST on Thursday than on the same day last week, and down 8.5% on Tuesday, retail analysts Springboard has said. In central London, the drop from last week was more than double the national average, down 34.4%, compared with a fall of 27% on Tuesday. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: ""On the second day of train strikes, it appears that not only are people working from home, but fewer people are visiting their local high streets. ""The key fact is that the impact of the strike today appears to be even greater than the first strike."" Jo BlackReporting from Stratford-Upon-Avon Stratford-upon-Avon,
the town where William Shakespeare was born, is one of the most popular tourist
destinations outside London. And in a post-Covid world, a rail strike affecting how people
travel is something local businesses are worried about. One ice-cream vendor told us his ice-cream sales are down
20%, something he blames on this week's rail strikes. But most visitors weâve spoken to today have driven here or
come by coach. Guides with microphones followed by lines of tourists wearing headphones have been making their way about the town. Elsewhere, the manager of Tudor World, a local museum has told us that he has seen more children coming through the door. He thinks this might be because some families impacted by the rail strike are taking advantage of having the time off and bringing their whole family here for a day out. Tourism bosses are worried as businesses try to recover after Covid the rail strike is the last thing they need and if the strikes continue in to the weekend - as expected - the impact could be significant. In
Merseyside, union members have accepted a 7.1% pay offer from
Merseyrail in a deal they
have praised for being in keeping with the spiralling cost of living. Some 94% of Transport
Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) members in general gradesvoted to accept the deal. Workers for the main RMT rail union who are striking today are asking for similar pay rises of 7%. The Merseyside rail operator, which is not involved in the national dispute, is run by Liverpool City Region
Combined Authority, led by Labour Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram. General Secretary Manuel Cortes
described the deal as ""a sensible outcome to a reasonable offer which goes a long way towards keeping pace with the escalating cost of living"". Merseyrail confirmed it had met union representatives âas part of our normal annual pay negotiationsâ. The deal comes afterit was agreed in Marchto give London's Tube workers an 8.4% pay rise. It's worth noting that it's not just rail workers threatening industrial action. Teachers, healthcare workers and even criminal barristers are considering or have approved proposals to strike over pay, conditions and workloads. And this afternoon, hundreds of British Airways check-in staff at Heathrow Airport have voted to go on strike over the summer. Members of the GMB and Unite unions want a 10% pay cut, imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, to be reversed. British Airways has offered them a one-off 10% payment - and says it's extremely disappointed. The vote threatens further disruption for travellers after the Easter break was marred by delays and cancellations. Meanwhile, teachers represented by the National Education Union are also likely to be asked in the autumn term whether they wish to walk out over pay and conditions, amid demands for an inflation-matching pay rise for teachers. And members of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers who prosecute and defend people on trial, have already approved strikes this summer over the government's funding of the criminal justice system. More railway workers are to vote on strikes over pay, conditions and job security. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) served notice to ballot dozens of members at TransPennine Express (TPE), it was announced on Thursday. TPE runs trains across northern England and Scotland. The union is demanding a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies for 2022, no unagreed changes to terms and conditions, and a pay increase which reflects the rising cost of living. The ballot opens on 29 June and closes in mid-July. The TSSA is also balloting its members in Network Rail, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, West Midlands Trains, Avanti West Coast, Northern, LNER, C2C and Great Western Railway (GWR).  Unions should call off the train strikes ""as quickly as possible"", Downing Street says. A No 10 spokesman says there were talks between the RMT and Network Rail today, but ""what we want to see is for the unions to call off the strikes, to continue to negotiate and to come to an agreement with their employer."" ""We don't want to see this strike action to continue for a moment longer than it has to,"" he adds. Asked if this was possible before Saturday's strike, he says: ""That's a question for the unions."" The Government has not been informed of any further rail strikes after this week, the official says. Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland News Correspondent Glasgow Queen Street if far quieter today than normal Here at Queen Street station it's far quieter than you would normally expect it to be at four o'clock in the afternoon. I reckon there are about 30 passengers around the station at the moment. In fact, the four o'clock train to Edinburgh, one of the few trains running from Queen Street this afternoon, was actually cancelled. But that was nothing to do with the industrial action. According to the announcement at the station, there was an obstruction on the line and the 16:30 BST train to Edinburgh would be 15 minutes late because of that. After that there are two more trains to Edinburgh. Clearly there could be problems here with the knock-on effect of that incident continuing. But certainly what I have noticed, compared to the first strike on Tuesday, is there have been far fewer  people turning up at the station. Celestina OlulodeBBC News Rail services
are winding down at Paddington station on day two of the three-day rail
strikes. Services are due to shut down early at 6.30pm. According to
Network Rail, by 11:30am on Thursday footfall at Paddington was down by 70% compared
to the same time last Thursday. Looking across the concourse itâs clear that many
passengers have heeded Network Railâs advice and stayed away. But earlier a number of passengers arrived to catch
trains to the Glastonbury music festival. Bethan arrived one hour earlier to
avoid delays. Special services to Castle Cary, the station nearest to the festival in Pilton, were put on for passengers trying to get to the site.  The lorry crashed onto the tracks in East Lothian Train services in and out of Edinburgh have been delayed after a lorry crashed onto the tracks in East Lothian. The driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital following the accident on the East Coast Main Line between Wallyford and Prestonpans at about 13:30. Services between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh via Falkirk High and Bathgate have been disrupted. Services between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh via Shotts have also been affected. Read more here. Returning to our coverage of the train strikes and we understand more walkouts are ""extremely likely"" if talks between rail bosses and unions continue to fail. Trains ground to a halt across much of England, Wales and Scotland on Thursday, with about half the network closed. RMT boss Mick Lynch has accused the government of blocking a deal, after talks on Wednesday collapsed - but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps called suggestions the government had intervened ""a total lie"". But Network Rail said it was the RMT, not the government which stalled latest negotiations. The rail strikes come as hundreds of British Airways workers at Heathrow Airport have voted to go on strike over pay, raising the threat of a summer of disruption. Lynch meanwhile has said talks would continue and members would be consulted to see ""if and when there needs to be a new phase of industrial action"" on the railways. A third day of train strikes is currently set for Saturday 25 June. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent What's unusual is that this ballot wasn't about pay increases, people saying their pay should go up to keep pace with the cost of living, this was about workers at Heathrow, mainly female check-in staff, part-time workers. They wanted to go back to pay levels they had before the pandemic - if you remember, a couple of years ago, the aviation industry was in crisis, and as a result, the airline puts a lot of pressure on staff to accept pay reductions. That happened at British Airways and these staff, about 700 of them, had to have their pay cut by around 10%.

Now they want it back. British Airways is not doing that, what they did offer was a 10% one-off payment this year while other negotiations continue. The ground crews unions, GMB and Unite, say that's not good enough, they want a commitment that they are going to get back what they lost. BA says the airline industry still isn't back up and running properly yet, there are still problems, itâs still not profitable, it lost Â£4bn over the past two years. Therefore, we have a conflict between two sides and now the workers have decided enough is enough, they're going to go out on strike. When will we see these strikes? There will probably a few days of disruption in the second half of July and then in August. We understand BA has contingency plans, so that's likely to be, for example, managers operating check in desks, but we'll have to wait and see how serious any disruption is going to be. British Airways should make
contingency plans to minimise disruption and refund passengers whose flights are impacted by strikes, the prime minister's spokesman says. ""This is obviously a matter for British Airways and the
unions and we would strongly encourage both to come together to
find a settlement,"" the spokesman continues. He says further disruption will only ""add to the misery
being faced by passengers at airports.""  British Airways says it's ""extremely disappointed"" after 700 workers based at Heathrow voted in favor of strike action in a dispute over pay. Unions say the action was due to a 10% pay cut imposed during the peak of the pandemic not being reinstated. In a statement, BA says: ""Despite the extremely challenging environment and losses of more than Â£4bn, we made an offer of a [one off] 10% payment which was accepted by the majority of other colleagues."" They said that included staff from ground operations, engineering and cabin crew. A spokesperson says: ""We are fully committed to work together to find a solution, because to deliver for our customers and rebuild our business we have to work as a team."" BA says it will update customers on what the decision will mean for them. Heathrow has already been hit by chaos this summer The looming strikes at Heathrow will only feed into the ""uncertainty"" of travel this summer, says one industry expert, who blames airlines  for ""not paying enough"" to staff. Paul Charles, who runs a PR agency specialising in luxury travel, said airlines in general were ""really struggling to deliver the quality of service needed"" at a time of flight cancellations, staff shortages and caps on flights. ""The demand is there,"" he told the BBC, but the airlines were ""not paying enough and therefore not attracting enough staff"". ""Wages are not seen as competitive,"" said Mr Charles, which led many to abandon their jobs during the pandemic in favour of other industries. ""Perks and benefits have been changed in the face of awful losses,"" he added and, in the face of losses of Â£4bn during the pandemic, ""BA has not been able to put workers back in the position they were in"". ""It's going to take some time to sort this dispute out. There is no easy compromise here."" Airlines had already been struggling with staff shortages, and now face further disruption after aviationworkers at Heathrow voted to strike. What are the strikes about? Those walking out include 700 British Airways (BA) check-in and ground staff who complain that a 10% pay cut imposed during the pandemic remains - while other BA workers have been given a 10% bonus. But BA dismissed their claims, saying that ""after a deeply difficult two years... these colleagues were offered a 10% payment for this year which was rejected"". Which routes will be affected? The BBC understands that BA - which operates from terminals three and five at the airport - has contingency plans in place, which could include managers dealing with check-ins. However, customers could still potentially face disruption and possibly some cancellations, in particular on routes with several daily flights. The strike dates will be confirmed in the coming days.

High street footfall in the UK was 16.1% lower to 13:00 BST on Thursday than on the same day last week, and down 8.5% on Tuesday, retail analysts Springboard has said. In central London, the drop from last week was more than double the national average, down 34.4%, compared with a fall of 27% on Tuesday. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: ""On the second day of train strikes, it appears that not only are people working from home, but fewer people are visiting their local high streets. ""The key fact is that the impact of the strike today appears to be even greater than the first strike."" Jo BlackReporting from Stratford-Upon-Avon Stratford-upon-Avon,
the town where William Shakespeare was born, is one of the most popular tourist
destinations outside London. And in a post-Covid world, a rail strike affecting how people
travel is something local businesses are worried about. One ice-cream vendor told us his ice-cream sales are down
20%, something he blames on this week's rail strikes. But most visitors weâve spoken to today have driven here or
come by coach. Guides with microphones followed by lines of tourists wearing headphones have been making their way about the town. Elsewhere, the manager of Tudor World, a local museum has told us that he has seen more children coming through the door. He thinks this might be because some families impacted by the rail strike are taking advantage of having the time off and bringing their whole family here for a day out. Tourism bosses are worried as businesses try to recover after Covid the rail strike is the last thing they need and if the strikes continue in to the weekend - as expected - the impact could be significant. In
Merseyside, union members have accepted a 7.1% pay offer from
Merseyrail in a deal they
have praised for being in keeping with the spiralling cost of living. Some 94% of Transport
Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) members in general gradesvoted to accept the deal. Workers for the main RMT rail union who are striking today are asking for similar pay rises of 7%. The Merseyside rail operator, which is not involved in the national dispute, is run by Liverpool City Region
Combined Authority, led by Labour Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram. General Secretary Manuel Cortes
described the deal as ""a sensible outcome to a reasonable offer which goes a long way towards keeping pace with the escalating cost of living"". Merseyrail confirmed it had met union representatives âas part of our normal annual pay negotiationsâ. The deal comes afterit was agreed in Marchto give London's Tube workers an 8.4% pay rise. It's worth noting that it's not just rail workers threatening industrial action. Teachers, healthcare workers and even criminal barristers are considering or have approved proposals to strike over pay, conditions and workloads. And this afternoon, hundreds of British Airways check-in staff at Heathrow Airport have voted to go on strike over the summer. Members of the GMB and Unite unions want a 10% pay cut, imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, to be reversed. British Airways has offered them a one-off 10% payment - and says it's extremely disappointed. The vote threatens further disruption for travellers after the Easter break was marred by delays and cancellations. Meanwhile, teachers represented by the National Education Union are also likely to be asked in the autumn term whether they wish to walk out over pay and conditions, amid demands for an inflation-matching pay rise for teachers. And members of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers who prosecute and defend people on trial, have already approved strikes this summer over the government's funding of the criminal justice system. More railway workers are to vote on strikes over pay, conditions and job security. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) served notice to ballot dozens of members at TransPennine Express (TPE), it was announced on Thursday. TPE runs trains across northern England and Scotland. The union is demanding a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies for 2022, no unagreed changes to terms and conditions, and a pay increase which reflects the rising cost of living. The ballot opens on 29 June and closes in mid-July. The TSSA is also balloting its members in Network Rail, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, West Midlands Trains, Avanti West Coast, Northern, LNER, C2C and Great Western Railway (GWR).  Unions should call off the train strikes ""as quickly as possible"", Downing Street says. A No 10 spokesman says there were talks between the RMT and Network Rail today, but ""what we want to see is for the unions to call off the strikes, to continue to negotiate and to come to an agreement with their employer."" ""We don't want to see this strike action to continue for a moment longer than it has to,"" he adds. Asked if this was possible before Saturday's strike, he says: ""That's a question for the unions."" The Government has not been informed of any further rail strikes after this week, the official says. Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland News Correspondent Glasgow Queen Street if far quieter today than normal Here at Queen Street station it's far quieter than you would normally expect it to be at four o'clock in the afternoon. I reckon there are about 30 passengers around the station at the moment. In fact, the four o'clock train to Edinburgh, one of the few trains running from Queen Street this afternoon, was actually cancelled. But that was nothing to do with the industrial action. According to the announcement at the station, there was an obstruction on the line and the 16:30 BST train to Edinburgh would be 15 minutes late because of that. After that there are two more trains to Edinburgh. Clearly there could be problems here with the knock-on effect of that incident continuing. But certainly what I have noticed, compared to the first strike on Tuesday, is there have been far fewer  people turning up at the station. Celestina OlulodeBBC News Rail services
are winding down at Paddington station on day two of the three-day rail
strikes. Services are due to shut down early at 6.30pm. According to
Network Rail, by 11:30am on Thursday footfall at Paddington was down by 70% compared
to the same time last Thursday. Looking across the concourse itâs clear that many
passengers have heeded Network Railâs advice and stayed away. But earlier a number of passengers arrived to catch
trains to the Glastonbury music festival. Bethan arrived one hour earlier to
avoid delays. Special services to Castle Cary, the station nearest to the festival in Pilton, were put on for passengers trying to get to the site.  The lorry crashed onto the tracks in East Lothian Train services in and out of Edinburgh have been delayed after a lorry crashed onto the tracks in East Lothian. The driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital following the accident on the East Coast Main Line between Wallyford and Prestonpans at about 13:30. Services between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh via Falkirk High and Bathgate have been disrupted. Services between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh via Shotts have also been affected. Read more here. Returning to our coverage of the train strikes and we understand more walkouts are ""extremely likely"" if talks between rail bosses and unions continue to fail. Trains ground to a halt across much of England, Wales and Scotland on Thursday, with about half the network closed. RMT boss Mick Lynch has accused the government of blocking a deal, after talks on Wednesday collapsed - but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps called suggestions the government had intervened ""a total lie"". But Network Rail said it was the RMT, not the government which stalled latest negotiations. The rail strikes come as hundreds of British Airways workers at Heathrow Airport have voted to go on strike over pay, raising the threat of a summer of disruption. Lynch meanwhile has said talks would continue and members would be consulted to see ""if and when there needs to be a new phase of industrial action"" on the railways. A third day of train strikes is currently set for Saturday 25 June. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent What's unusual is that this ballot wasn't about pay increases, people saying their pay should go up to keep pace with the cost of living, this was about workers at Heathrow, mainly female check-in staff, part-time workers. They wanted to go back to pay levels they had before the pandemic - if you remember, a couple of years ago, the aviation industry was in crisis, and as a result, the airline puts a lot of pressure on staff to accept pay reductions. That happened at British Airways and these staff, about 700 of them, had to have their pay cut by around 10%.

Now they want it back. British Airways is not doing that, what they did offer was a 10% one-off payment this year while other negotiations continue. The ground crews unions, GMB and Unite, say that's not good enough, they want a commitment that they are going to get back what they lost. BA says the airline industry still isn't back up and running properly yet, there are still problems, itâs still not profitable, it lost Â£4bn over the past two years. Therefore, we have a conflict between two sides and now the workers have decided enough is enough, they're going to go out on strike. When will we see these strikes? There will probably a few days of disruption in the second half of July and then in August. We understand BA has contingency plans, so that's likely to be, for example, managers operating check in desks, but we'll have to wait and see how serious any disruption is going to be. British Airways should make
contingency plans to minimise disruption and refund passengers whose flights are impacted by strikes, the prime minister's spokesman says. ""This is obviously a matter for British Airways and the
unions and we would strongly encourage both to come together to
find a settlement,"" the spokesman continues. He says further disruption will only ""add to the misery
being faced by passengers at airports.""  British Airways says it's ""extremely disappointed"" after 700 workers based at Heathrow voted in favor of strike action in a dispute over pay. Unions say the action was due to a 10% pay cut imposed during the peak of the pandemic not being reinstated. In a statement, BA says: ""Despite the extremely challenging environment and losses of more than Â£4bn, we made an offer of a [one off] 10% payment which was accepted by the majority of other colleagues."" They said that included staff from ground operations, engineering and cabin crew. A spokesperson says: ""We are fully committed to work together to find a solution, because to deliver for our customers and rebuild our business we have to work as a team."" BA says it will update customers on what the decision will mean for them. Heathrow has already been hit by chaos this summer The looming strikes at Heathrow will only feed into the ""uncertainty"" of travel this summer, says one industry expert, who blames airlines  for ""not paying enough"" to staff. Paul Charles, who runs a PR agency specialising in luxury travel, said airlines in general were ""really struggling to deliver the quality of service needed"" at a time of flight cancellations, staff shortages and caps on flights. ""The demand is there,"" he told the BBC, but the airlines were ""not paying enough and therefore not attracting enough staff"". ""Wages are not seen as competitive,"" said Mr Charles, which led many to abandon their jobs during the pandemic in favour of other industries. ""Perks and benefits have been changed in the face of awful losses,"" he added and, in the face of losses of Â£4bn during the pandemic, ""BA has not been able to put workers back in the position they were in"". ""It's going to take some time to sort this dispute out. There is no easy compromise here."" Airlines had already been struggling with staff shortages, and now face further disruption after aviationworkers at Heathrow voted to strike. What are the strikes about? Those walking out include 700 British Airways (BA) check-in and ground staff who complain that a 10% pay cut imposed during the pandemic remains - while other BA workers have been given a 10% bonus. But BA dismissed their claims, saying that ""after a deeply difficult two years... these colleagues were offered a 10% payment for this year which was rejected"". Which routes will be affected? The BBC understands that BA - which operates from terminals three and five at the airport - has contingency plans in place, which could include managers dealing with check-ins. However, customers could still potentially face disruption and possibly some cancellations, in particular on routes with several daily flights. The strike dates will be confirmed in the coming days.

PM and Charles unlikely to discuss asylum - No 10Boris Johnson earlier said he would defend the Rwanda asylum policy to Prince Charles if it came up.UK Politics,"Downing Street says it is ""unlikely"" the UK's Rwanda asylum policy will come up when Boris Johnson meets the Prince of Wales on Friday. The prime minister had said he would defend the scheme if it was raised, but his spokesman later said it would not be at the forefront of his mind. Prince Charles is reported to have criticised plans to remove asylum seekers to the African country. The pair are in the Rwandan capital Kigali for a Commonwealth summit. The prime minister's spokesman said the policy was not something the Mr Johnson was focused on at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) summit, and emphasised challenges facing the Commonwealth such as sustainability, climate change and girls' education were the priority. Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda? âBeing sent to Rwanda didn't stop us getting to Europeâ Prince Charles meets Rwandan Genocide survivors Where does Rwanda flight setback leave ministers? A Clarence House spokesman said he would not be commenting on ""supposed remarks made in private"" except to say that ""the prince is politically neutral"" and that policy was a matter for the government. The policy has been criticised by politicians, refugee organisations and the Church of England, with some pointing to Rwanda's human rights record. There have been several legal challenges in the UK against the policy, with the first flight due to take people to Africa prevented from taking off earlier this month. Earlier, the prime minister said Rwanda had ""undergone an absolute transformation"" in the last couple of decades and had come on ""leaps and bounds"" in education and ""taking society forward"". ""People need to keep an open mind about the policy, the critics need to keep an open mind about the policy,"" he said. Boris Johnson is due to meet the Prince of Wales in Kigali It was reported in the Times, that Prince Charles had privately criticisedthe plan of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda as ""appalling"". But the prime minister, who said he had discussed the matter with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, said it was ""absolutely necessary and right to fix the problem of illegal cross-Channel trafficking of people"". Prince Charles, who is with his wife the Duchess of Cornwall, has met business leaders in Rwanda as part of the Commonwealth Business Forum. The Prince of Wales attends a Commonwealth Business Forum Exhibition at Kigali Cultural Exhibition Village, as part of his visit to Rwanda Prince Charles' wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, has joined him on the trip Boris Johnson is also joined by his wife Carrie in Rwanda Under theRwanda asylum plan, announced in April, the government intends to remove some asylum seekers who cross the Channel to the UK, sending them via a one-way ticket to Rwanda to claim asylum there instead. It has been criticised with some pointing out that last year the UK had raised concerns about restrictions to civil and political rights in the country. After the first flight taking asylum seekers to Rwanda was cancelled, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the scheme had ""never been a serious policy"" and described it as a ""shambles"" and ""shameful"". When the policy was first announced, the Liberal Democrats accused the government of ""slamming the door"" in the face of refugees. Boris Johnson held talks with Rwandan President Paul Kagame During his visit to Rwanda, Mr Johnson will not be visiting any of the accommodation set aside for the scheme, with his spokesman saying his time was limited. ""We think that the best use of his time for this short period he's in Rwanda is to dedicate himself to some of the issues that will be raised at the summit and to work with other world leaders on some of those issues we've talked about, not least Ukraine and global security,"" he said. During a speech as part of the summit, Mr Johnson spoke of the UK's support for green energy projects in Africa, including the announcement of up to Â£162m investment, via British International Investment, in the hydropower sector.

Germany takes step closer to gas rationing,"Germany has taken a step closer to gas rationing after a drop in supplies from Russia. The country has triggered the ""alarm"" stage of an emergency gas plan to deal with shortages, Germany's economy ministry said. It is the latest part of a standoff between the European Union and Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. German economy minister Robert Habeck said Russia was using gas ""as a weapon"" in response to EU sanctions. ""We must not fool ourselves. The cut in gas supplies is an economic attack on us by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,"" Mr Habeck said, adding Germans would have to reduce consumption. Mr Habeck said there would ""hopefully never"" be a need to ration gas for German industry, but he added: ""Of course, I can't rule it out."" Germany has now moved to the second stage of its three-part emergency plan, which is triggered when there is disruption or very high demand for gas. The government will provide â¬15bn (Â£13bn) of loans to try to fill gas storage facilities, and will start auctioning gas to industry to encourage big businesses to use less. Moving to stage two of the plan puts more pressure on suppliers and network operators to balance out disruption by taking measures such as finding alternative sources for gas. However, the country stopped short of letting utilities pass on soaring costs to customers, although that is theoretically possible under stage two. Gas firms already had to ensure supplies under the first stage of the emergency plan, while gas network operators were reporting to the Economy Ministry at least once a day, and electricity grid operators had to ensure grid stability. Europe told to prepare for Russia turning off gas Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Johnson hints that new coal mine for Cumbria will get go-ahead State intervention would happen under the third stage when there is a significant disruption to supply which the market cannot cope with, meaning supplies are rationed. In the third stage, supply to industry would be restricted first, while households and critical institutions such as hospitals would continue to get available gas. Twelve European Union countries have now been affected by cuts to gas supply from Russia, EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said on Thursday. Russia cut flows through its Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 40% of capacity last week citing problems with equipment, affecting countries including Germany. Nord Stream 1 is due to undergo maintenance from 11 to 21 July when flows will stop. The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol,has warned that Russia may cut off gas supplies to Europe entirelyand that Europe needs to prepare now. Russia has already cut gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland over their refusal to comply with a new payment scheme. Germany's industrial might has been significantly aided by its access to cheap Russian energy. Now those taps are being closed. At the top of the German government they say they have a phased plan to deal with all dependencies on Russia for energy. It has been easy with coal, as they can simply buy it in shipped form from the likes of South Africa and Colombia. Oil too is mainly shipped on tankers, bar one refinery connected to a pipeline from Russia. But gas needs a significant investment in alternative infrastructure, basically the LNG terminals that enable the purchase of shipped gas from around the world. This normally takes years, but Germany is exploring the idea of floating terminals that some claim could be ready by the end of the year. Further permanent terminals will take two years or so, part of the German effort to reduce dependence on Russian gas from 55% to 10%. But then there is the much bigger issue of where the shipped gas comes from. Even before a fire at a key US export terminal, in theory 155 billion cubic metres of Russian gas exported to Europe by pipeline needs to be found from the current 500 billion cubic metres market for shipped LNG. Producers need to pump much more gas to meet this demand, but, for example the Qataris are finding it easy to sell this on long-term contracts lasting longer than a decade. Germany wants a shorter contract to reflect its efforts to phase out fossil fuels. In any event the transfer of German energy demand into this market will push up prices for the whole world. In the short term, however, the challenge will be to maintain supply and demand in the German energy system. And while Europe's industrial powerhouse scrambles to expand its gas import options, it might need to prepare for ""demand management"", using less energy in its factories and households, and that risks recession across Europe. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, said the continuing restrictions to gas supplies from Russia to Europe was a ""worrying development"". ""Effectively, all bets are off on what could happen next,"" he said. ""Any pretence that Russia is a reliable provider of gas supplies has gone."" In the summer disrupted gas supplies are ""less of a pressing concern"", but he said the situation could become worse in winter when people need more heating. Whether Germany has to start rationing gas ""remains to be seen"", he said, but if prices continue to rise industry will cut back anyway as gas becomes uneconomical. German industry is already looking at how it will cope with a supply squeeze, with some firms considering resorting to energy sources that were previously being phased out. Kelheim Fibres, which supplies Proctor & Gamble among others, is looking at fitting out its gas power plant to run on oil. ""Oil has only one advantage: supply is secure,"" the firm's Wolfgang Ott told Reuters. In the UK, coal plants have been asked to stay open longer, and the government is considering whether to let a new coal mine in Cumbria go ahead. This is despite global efforts to reduce coal consumption to try to limit the impact of climate change. The Ukraine war has hit the UK economy in a number of ways, such as by pushing up energy bills. Inflation - how quickly prices rise across the board -continued at its fastest rate for 40 yearsin the UK in May, with fuel and energy costs its biggest drivers. While the UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia, UK gas prices are affected by the global markets. ""Higher prices in Europe will mean UK gas prices rise too as gas users compete for the same limited sources of alternative supply,"" Mr Piper said.

Wales fans ditch Qatar for Tenerife for World Cup,"This video can not be played Bethany Evans was determined to go to the World Cup until she realised the cost Football fans priced out of a World Cup trip to Qatar plan to enjoy the tournament from... Tenerife. Bethany Evans suggested the idea on Twitter after having a lightbulb moment on realising the cost of going. She said she has had ""a plane full"" of interest in response as people look to recreate a Wales-on-tour vibe elsewhere. Football Supporters' Association Cymru's Vince Alm said Tenerife and Cyprus were popular with Wales fans. Wales qualified for their first World Cup in 64 years after beating Ukraine in a play-off this month. Their three group games are against the USA, Iran and England in Qatari capital Doha between 21 and 29 November in a 40,000-capacity stadium. Wales fans fear being priced out Gay Wales fans refuse to go to Qatar Celebrations as Wales qualify after 64-year wait Football Association of Wales (FAW) chief Noel Mooney said last week Wales was due to get 3,200 tickets per game, or 8% of the stadium,but were hoping for more. Match tickets go on sale from Fifa on 5 July. The plan to hold the competition in Qatar has come under fire because of the country's poor human rights record, including it beingillegal to be gay. Qatari officials haveinsisted it will be a ""tournament for everyone"". Bethany Evans suggested the idea on Twitter after a lightbulb moment Bethany Evans, from from Nelson, Caerphilly county, toldWales Liveher first thought after the nation qualified was: ""I need to get out there."" The cost soon became a barrier. ""The cheapest I could price it up for was Â£3,500-Â£4,000,"" the 25-year-old said. ""Plan B came around from a bit of a joke really. ""There was a post in one of the Cardiff City forums that was talking about people going to Qatar and the cost of things, and somebody said wouldn't it be really funny if we all got together in Benidorm or Tenerife."" People liked the idea - after posting about it on Twitter, Ms Evans said ""it got a lot more traction than I ever thought it was going to"". So far 16 have booked and 100 others have shown interest. ""It's just about bringing people together so that we can experience that Wales-away feeling,"" Ms Evans said. Mr Alm said some Wales supporters worried Qatar's strict laws would stop them having fun. Vince Alm said some Wales supporters worried Qatar's strict laws would stop them having fun He said: ""The football community, for me, is when you get five or six countries' supporters maybe just pitch up in a town or city centre somewhere, where they're crossing over to go to other cities, and they spend the night together, buying beers for each other, singing on the karaoke, buying each other pizzas and stuff like that. ""That will all be lost in Doha."" Football coach Ross Struel Clarke, from Swansea, moved to Doha a few months ago. He was ""so proud"" to see the Wales flag go up on Doha's waterfront promenade, called the Corniche, after they qualified. For those travelling to Qatar and not Tenerife, he advised Wales fans to respect the culture and not be too rowdy. ""In and around Qatar, if you go to Souq Waqif (marketplace), the Corniche or West Bay, just be a bit mindful of your actions,"" he said. Elin Thomas is paying between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 for her trip to Doha Cardiff's Elin Thomas has decided not to risk missing Wales at the World Cup, despite the expense and her concerns about Qatar. She is paying between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 for her trip to Doha and is confident she'll get match tickets. ""What we've got as a team and as a Red Wall is absolutely awesome,"" said Ms Thomas.

Nike to make full exit from Russia,"Nike has announced plans to leave Russia, becoming the latest Western brand to quit the country since the invasion of Ukraine in February. The US sportswear giant halted online orders and closed the stores it owned in the country in March. Shops run by local partners continued to operate, but the firm is winding down those agreements. Networking giant Cisco also said it would start to fully shut down operations in Russia and Belarus. Other companies that have finalised plans to leave in recent weeks includeMcDonald'sandStarbucks. ""Nike has made the decision to leave the Russian marketplace,"" the company said in a statement. ""Our priority is to ensure we are fully supporting our employees while we responsibly scale down our operations over the coming months."" Russia has grown increasingly economically isolated since the invasion, as the West and allies impose sanctions and international companies head for the exits. The country is now working on legislation that would punish foreign companies seeking to leave, allowing the government to seize their assets and impose criminal penalties, according to Reuters. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? Russia unveils 'tasty' McDonald's substitute Nike has more than 50 stores in Russia, about a third of which are closed, according to its website. In May, Russian media reported that the company was ending its agreement with its largest franchisee in Russia, responsible for 37 stores. Nike had previously disclosed that Russia and Ukraine together accounted for less than 1% of the company's revenue. Cisco said on Thursday that it had ""made the decision to begin an orderly wind-down of our business in Russia and Belarus"". This decision will affect a few hundred employees, the US company said, adding that it wanted to ensure they are ""treated with respect"".

Many children feared dead in Afghan quake,"This video can not be played WATCH: Body removed from rubble after deadly earthquake hits Afghanistan Doctors in Afghanistan have told the BBC that many children may have been killed in Wednesday's earthquake. More than 1,000 people died in the disaster, and heavy rain, threadbare resources and rugged terrain are hampering rescue workers. Unknown numbers were buried in the rubble of ruined, often mud-built homes by the magnitude 6.1 earthquake. One woman in hospital in Paktika province told reporters she had lost 19 family members. ""Seven in one room, five in another, four in another, then three in another, have all been killed in my family,"" she said from her bed. By Wednesday night Taliban officials said search and rescue operations had finished in most places, although in remoter areas some continued still. ""We can't reach the area - networks are too weak,"" a Taliban spokesman was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying earlier. Five beds between 500 at Afghan quake clinic The United Nations is among those scrambling to provide emergency shelter and food aid to remote areas in Paktika. Survivors and rescuers have told the BBC of villages completely destroyed near the epicentre of the quake, of ruined roads and mobile phone towers - and of their fears that the death toll will rise further.  Some 1,500 people were also injured, officials say. The Taliban authorities have called for more international aid. Villagers and rescue workers examine the damage in Bernal district Most of the casualties found so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts of Paktika. Locals report dozens of villages collapsed. ""There was a rumbling and my bed began to shake,"" a survivor called Shabir told the BBC. ""The ceiling fell down. I was trapped, but I could see the sky. My shoulder was dislocated, my head was hurt but I got out. I am sure that seven or nine people from my family, who were in the same room as me, are dead."" A mother of six who was badly injured in the earthquake told the BBC many in her village had been killed, including seven of her own family members. ""We are very poor. We cannot reconstruct our homes again,"" she said. ""We have nothing to eat."" All her family's food supplies are buried under the rubble. ""There is nowhere to go,"" she added. ""I demand the Taliban rebuild our houses."" All the villagers we meet want to show us the damage to their homes done by the earthquake. They have lost their loved ones, alongside homes and livelihoods. Possessions are scattered amongst the debris: blankets, pots, beds stick out from the rubble. The villagers want the world to see how their lives have been devastated, but also more tangibly, to have their names added to aid distribution schemes. A number of aid agencies have reached the scene but it's clear more help is needed. One man we meet has just arrived back in his village from Pakistan where he works as a labourer. Twenty members of his family were killed in the earthquake including his daughter. Another, elderly man now finds himself responsible for his five young grandchildren - after their father died. The valleys here are overflowing with tragedy. Many of the families are now living in makeshift tents, flanked by the rubble of the homes they had worked so hard to construct.

Afghanistan is in the midst of a humanitarian and economic crisis, and Abdul Qahar Balkhi, a senior Taliban official, said the government was ""financially unable to assist the people to the extent that is needed"". Images show true scale of devastation in Afghanistan 'Every street you go you hear mourning' The head of the UN, AntÃ³nio Guterres said the agency had ""fully mobilised"" over the disaster. But Mohammad Amin Huzaifa, head of information for Paktika province, told AFP it was proving ""very difficult"" for rescuers to reach areas ""affected by floods because of heavy rains last night"". Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it is located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Over the past decade more than 7,000 people have been killed in earthquakes in the country, the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports. There are an average of 560 deaths a year from earthquakes. Even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan's emergency services were stretched to deal with natural disasters - with few aircraft and helicopters available to rescuers. According to the UN, 93% of households in Afghanistan suffer food insecurity.

I will defend Rwanda asylum plan to Charles - PM,"Downing Street says it is ""unlikely"" the UK's Rwanda asylum policy will come up when Boris Johnson meets the Prince of Wales on Friday. The prime minister had said he would defend the scheme if it was raised, but his spokesman later said it would not be at the forefront of his mind. Prince Charles is reported to have criticised plans to remove asylum seekers to the African country. The pair are in the Rwandan capital Kigali for a Commonwealth summit. The prime minister's spokesman said the policy was not something the Mr Johnson was focused on at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) summit, and emphasised challenges facing the Commonwealth such as sustainability, climate change and girls' education were the priority. Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda? âBeing sent to Rwanda didn't stop us getting to Europeâ Prince Charles meets Rwandan Genocide survivors Where does Rwanda flight setback leave ministers? A Clarence House spokesman said he would not be commenting on ""supposed remarks made in private"" except to say that ""the prince is politically neutral"" and that policy was a matter for the government. The policy has been criticised by politicians, refugee organisations and the Church of England, with some pointing to Rwanda's human rights record. There have been several legal challenges in the UK against the policy, with the first flight due to take people to Africa prevented from taking off earlier this month. Earlier, the prime minister said Rwanda had ""undergone an absolute transformation"" in the last couple of decades and had come on ""leaps and bounds"" in education and ""taking society forward"". ""People need to keep an open mind about the policy, the critics need to keep an open mind about the policy,"" he said. Boris Johnson is due to meet the Prince of Wales in Kigali It was reported in the Times, that Prince Charles had privately criticisedthe plan of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda as ""appalling"". But the prime minister, who said he had discussed the matter with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, said it was ""absolutely necessary and right to fix the problem of illegal cross-Channel trafficking of people"". Prince Charles, who is with his wife the Duchess of Cornwall, has met business leaders in Rwanda as part of the Commonwealth Business Forum. The Prince of Wales attends a Commonwealth Business Forum Exhibition at Kigali Cultural Exhibition Village, as part of his visit to Rwanda Prince Charles' wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, has joined him on the trip Boris Johnson is also joined by his wife Carrie in Rwanda Under theRwanda asylum plan, announced in April, the government intends to remove some asylum seekers who cross the Channel to the UK, sending them via a one-way ticket to Rwanda to claim asylum there instead. It has been criticised with some pointing out that last year the UK had raised concerns about restrictions to civil and political rights in the country. After the first flight taking asylum seekers to Rwanda was cancelled, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the scheme had ""never been a serious policy"" and described it as a ""shambles"" and ""shameful"". When the policy was first announced, the Liberal Democrats accused the government of ""slamming the door"" in the face of refugees. Boris Johnson held talks with Rwandan President Paul Kagame During his visit to Rwanda, Mr Johnson will not be visiting any of the accommodation set aside for the scheme, with his spokesman saying his time was limited. ""We think that the best use of his time for this short period he's in Rwanda is to dedicate himself to some of the issues that will be raised at the summit and to work with other world leaders on some of those issues we've talked about, not least Ukraine and global security,"" he said. During a speech as part of the summit, Mr Johnson spoke of the UK's support for green energy projects in Africa, including the announcement of up to Â£162m investment, via British International Investment, in the hydropower sector.

"Germany takes step closer to gas rationingThe country triggers the ""alarm"" stage of its emergency gas plan after a drop in Russian supplies.","Germany has taken a step closer to gas rationing after a drop in supplies from Russia. The country has triggered the ""alarm"" stage of an emergency gas plan to deal with shortages, Germany's economy ministry said. It is the latest part of a standoff between the European Union and Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. German economy minister Robert Habeck said Russia was using gas ""as a weapon"" in response to EU sanctions. ""We must not fool ourselves. The cut in gas supplies is an economic attack on us by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,"" Mr Habeck said, adding Germans would have to reduce consumption. Mr Habeck said there would ""hopefully never"" be a need to ration gas for German industry, but he added: ""Of course, I can't rule it out."" Germany has now moved to the second stage of its three-part emergency plan, which is triggered when there is disruption or very high demand for gas. The government will provide â¬15bn (Â£13bn) of loans to try to fill gas storage facilities, and will start auctioning gas to industry to encourage big businesses to use less. Moving to stage two of the plan puts more pressure on suppliers and network operators to balance out disruption by taking measures such as finding alternative sources for gas. However, the country stopped short of letting utilities pass on soaring costs to customers, although that is theoretically possible under stage two. Gas firms already had to ensure supplies under the first stage of the emergency plan, while gas network operators were reporting to the Economy Ministry at least once a day, and electricity grid operators had to ensure grid stability. Europe told to prepare for Russia turning off gas Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Johnson hints that new coal mine for Cumbria will get go-ahead State intervention would happen under the third stage when there is a significant disruption to supply which the market cannot cope with, meaning supplies are rationed. In the third stage, supply to industry would be restricted first, while households and critical institutions such as hospitals would continue to get available gas. Twelve European Union countries have now been affected by cuts to gas supply from Russia, EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said on Thursday. Russia cut flows through its Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 40% of capacity last week citing problems with equipment, affecting countries including Germany. Nord Stream 1 is due to undergo maintenance from 11 to 21 July when flows will stop. The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol,has warned that Russia may cut off gas supplies to Europe entirelyand that Europe needs to prepare now. Russia has already cut gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland over their refusal to comply with a new payment scheme. Germany's industrial might has been significantly aided by its access to cheap Russian energy. Now those taps are being closed. At the top of the German government they say they have a phased plan to deal with all dependencies on Russia for energy. It has been easy with coal, as they can simply buy it in shipped form from the likes of South Africa and Colombia. Oil too is mainly shipped on tankers, bar one refinery connected to a pipeline from Russia. But gas needs a significant investment in alternative infrastructure, basically the LNG terminals that enable the purchase of shipped gas from around the world. This normally takes years, but Germany is exploring the idea of floating terminals that some claim could be ready by the end of the year. Further permanent terminals will take two years or so, part of the German effort to reduce dependence on Russian gas from 55% to 10%. But then there is the much bigger issue of where the shipped gas comes from. Even before a fire at a key US export terminal, in theory 155 billion cubic metres of Russian gas exported to Europe by pipeline needs to be found from the current 500 billion cubic metres market for shipped LNG. Producers need to pump much more gas to meet this demand, but, for example the Qataris are finding it easy to sell this on long-term contracts lasting longer than a decade. Germany wants a shorter contract to reflect its efforts to phase out fossil fuels. In any event the transfer of German energy demand into this market will push up prices for the whole world. In the short term, however, the challenge will be to maintain supply and demand in the German energy system. And while Europe's industrial powerhouse scrambles to expand its gas import options, it might need to prepare for ""demand management"", using less energy in its factories and households, and that risks recession across Europe. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, said the continuing restrictions to gas supplies from Russia to Europe was a ""worrying development"". ""Effectively, all bets are off on what could happen next,"" he said. ""Any pretence that Russia is a reliable provider of gas supplies has gone."" In the summer disrupted gas supplies are ""less of a pressing concern"", but he said the situation could become worse in winter when people need more heating. Whether Germany has to start rationing gas ""remains to be seen"", he said, but if prices continue to rise industry will cut back anyway as gas becomes uneconomical. German industry is already looking at how it will cope with a supply squeeze, with some firms considering resorting to energy sources that were previously being phased out. Kelheim Fibres, which supplies Proctor & Gamble among others, is looking at fitting out its gas power plant to run on oil. ""Oil has only one advantage: supply is secure,"" the firm's Wolfgang Ott told Reuters. In the UK, coal plants have been asked to stay open longer, and the government is considering whether to let a new coal mine in Cumbria go ahead. This is despite global efforts to reduce coal consumption to try to limit the impact of climate change. The Ukraine war has hit the UK economy in a number of ways, such as by pushing up energy bills. Inflation - how quickly prices rise across the board -continued at its fastest rate for 40 yearsin the UK in May, with fuel and energy costs its biggest drivers. While the UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia, UK gas prices are affected by the global markets. ""Higher prices in Europe will mean UK gas prices rise too as gas users compete for the same limited sources of alternative supply,"" Mr Piper said.

that itâs 10% one-off bonus offer was a prelude to meaningful pay talks.
It is still under pressure, too â the industry has not fully recovered. But the problem its facing is that when the cuts were first
imposed, many staff were deeply upset by what they saw as the heavy-handed
approach of the airlineâs management. And now, itâs pretty clear that many workers simply donât
trust the word of their managers. Although railway staff are on strike today the effect of the industrial action will still be felt tomorrow. It's thought only 60% of the normal weekday services will operate. This is due to the knock-on effect of overnight signallers and control room staff being on strike. Trains will leave depots a lot later in the morning than usual when the daytime shift starts work at around 06:00. Normally, trains are moved from 03:00. The length of time it takes for train services to get back to normal depends on the distance between a depot and a station. In a major city trains do not have so far to travel, but for rural areas it may take several hours. However, it's not just Friday morning when there will be disruption. Some train operators will wind-down services slightly earlier than normal, ahead of the next planned strike on Saturday. Passengers are urged to check for amendments to train companies' timetables. Hamzah AbbasBBC News Rail strikes have been causing disruption across much of the UK this week, with people struggling to get to work. But for one commuter, the walkouts were never going to be an issue. George Bullard has been kayaking to the office since 2015, a mode of transport he chose because it was ""an interesting way to get to work"". He travels to his workplace in Presteigne in Wales, where he runs a camping company, by kayaking down the River Lugg, when it's safe to do so. But he warns against others following suit, saying it can be dangerous without the right experience. Read more here.   Strike action means stations such as Euston in London will not have the same footfall as normal It's estimated the rail strikes will cost the UK hospitality sector over half a billion pounds in lost revenue across the three planned days of action. And the impact will be felt particularly keenly in the capital, says one industry insider. ""London is proportionately more dense in terms of hospitality venues and so [the impact] will be disproportionately higher ,"" says Tony Sophoclides, strategic affairs director for UK Hospitality. He tells the BBC the walkouts will cost London hospitality around Â£70m in lost trading, ""which is really not what we need at the moment"". Less than 20% of services were expected to run on Thursday, but - unlike the first day of strikes on Tuesday - London Underground union members have not been striking andthe tube has been run as normal,external, with only minor disruption. High street footfall in the UK was 16.1% lower to 13:00 BST on Thursday than on the same day last week, and down 8.5% on Tuesday, retail analysts Springboard has said. In central London, the drop from last week was more than double the national average, down 34.4%, compared with a fall of 27% on Tuesday. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: ""On the second day of train strikes, it appears that not only are people working from home, but fewer people are visiting their local high streets. ""The key fact is that the impact of the strike today appears to be even greater than the first strike."" Jo BlackReporting from Stratford-Upon-Avon Stratford-upon-Avon,
the town where William Shakespeare was born, is one of the most popular tourist
destinations outside London. And in a post-Covid world, a rail strike affecting how people
travel is something local businesses are worried about. One ice-cream vendor told us his ice-cream sales are down
20%, something he blames on this week's rail strikes. But most visitors weâve spoken to today have driven here or
come by coach. Guides with microphones followed by lines of tourists wearing headphones have been making their way about the town. Elsewhere, the manager of Tudor World, a local museum has told us that he has seen more children coming through the door. He thinks this might be because some families impacted by the rail strike are taking advantage of having the time off and bringing their whole family here for a day out. Tourism bosses are worried as businesses try to recover after Covid the rail strike is the last thing they need and if the strikes continue in to the weekend - as expected - the impact could be significant. In
Merseyside, union members have accepted a 7.1% pay offer from
Merseyrail in a deal they
have praised for being in keeping with the spiralling cost of living. Some 94% of Transport
Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) members in general gradesvoted to accept the deal. Workers for the main RMT rail union who are striking today are asking for similar pay rises of 7%. The Merseyside rail operator, which is not involved in the national dispute, is run by Liverpool City Region
Combined Authority, led by Labour Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram. General Secretary Manuel Cortes
described the deal as ""a sensible outcome to a reasonable offer which goes a long way towards keeping pace with the escalating cost of living"". Merseyrail confirmed it had met union representatives âas part of our normal annual pay negotiationsâ. The deal comes afterit was agreed in Marchto give London's Tube workers an 8.4% pay rise. It's worth noting that it's not just rail workers threatening industrial action. Teachers, healthcare workers and even criminal barristers are considering or have approved proposals to strike over pay, conditions and workloads. And this afternoon, hundreds of British Airways check-in staff at Heathrow Airport have voted to go on strike over the summer. Members of the GMB and Unite unions want a 10% pay cut, imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, to be reversed. British Airways has offered them a one-off 10% payment - and says it's extremely disappointed. The vote threatens further disruption for travellers after the Easter break was marred by delays and cancellations. Meanwhile, teachers represented by the National Education Union are also likely to be asked in the autumn term whether they wish to walk out over pay and conditions, amid demands for an inflation-matching pay rise for teachers. And members of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers who prosecute and defend people on trial, have already approved strikes this summer over the government's funding of the criminal justice system. More railway workers are to vote on strikes over pay, conditions and job security. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) served notice to ballot dozens of members at TransPennine Express (TPE), it was announced on Thursday. TPE runs trains across northern England and Scotland. The union is demanding a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies for 2022, no unagreed changes to terms and conditions, and a pay increase which reflects the rising cost of living. The ballot opens on 29 June and closes in mid-July. The TSSA is also balloting its members in Network Rail, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, West Midlands Trains, Avanti West Coast, Northern, LNER, C2C and Great Western Railway (GWR).  Unions should call off the train strikes ""as quickly as possible"", Downing Street says. A No 10 spokesman says there were talks between the RMT and Network Rail today, but ""what we want to see is for the unions to call off the strikes, to continue to negotiate and to come to an agreement with their employer."" ""We don't want to see this strike action to continue for a moment longer than it has to,"" he adds. Asked if this was possible before Saturday's strike, he says: ""That's a question for the unions."" The Government has not been informed of any further rail strikes after this week, the official says. Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland News Correspondent Glasgow Queen Street if far quieter today than normal Here at Queen Street station it's far quieter than you would normally expect it to be at four o'clock in the afternoon. I reckon there are about 30 passengers around the station at the moment. In fact, the four o'clock train to Edinburgh, one of the few trains running from Queen Street this afternoon, was actually cancelled. But that was nothing to do with the industrial action. According to the announcement at the station, there was an obstruction on the line and the 16:30 BST train to Edinburgh would be 15 minutes late because of that. After that there are two more trains to Edinburgh. Clearly there could be problems here with the knock-on effect of that incident continuing. But certainly what I have noticed, compared to the first strike on Tuesday, is there have been far fewer  people turning up at the station. Celestina OlulodeBBC News Rail services
are winding down at Paddington station on day two of the three-day rail
strikes. Services are due to shut down early at 6.30pm. According to
Network Rail, by 11:30am on Thursday footfall at Paddington was down by 70% compared
to the same time last Thursday. Looking across the concourse itâs clear that many
passengers have heeded Network Railâs advice and stayed away. But earlier a number of passengers arrived to catch
trains to the Glastonbury music festival. Bethan arrived one hour earlier to
avoid delays. Special services to Castle Cary, the station nearest to the festival in Pilton, were put on for passengers trying to get to the site.  The lorry crashed onto the tracks in East Lothian Train services in and out of Edinburgh have been delayed after a lorry crashed onto the tracks in East Lothian. The driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital following the accident on the East Coast Main Line between Wallyford and Prestonpans at about 13:30. Services between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh via Falkirk High and Bathgate have been disrupted. Services between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh via Shotts have also been affected. Read more here. Returning to our coverage of the train strikes and we understand more walkouts are ""extremely likely"" if talks between rail bosses and unions continue to fail. Trains ground to a halt across much of England, Wales and Scotland on Thursday, with about half the network closed. RMT boss Mick Lynch has accused the government of blocking a deal, after talks on Wednesday collapsed - but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps called suggestions the government had intervened ""a total lie"". But Network Rail said it was the RMT, not the government which stalled latest negotiations. The rail strikes come as hundreds of British Airways workers at Heathrow Airport have voted to go on strike over pay, raising the threat of a summer of disruption. Lynch meanwhile has said talks would continue and members would be consulted to see ""if and when there needs to be a new phase of industrial action"" on the railways. A third day of train strikes is currently set for Saturday 25 June. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent What's unusual is that this ballot wasn't about pay increases, people saying their pay should go up to keep pace with the cost of living, this was about workers at Heathrow, mainly female check-in staff, part-time workers. They wanted to go back to pay levels they had before the pandemic - if you remember, a couple of years ago, the aviation industry was in crisis, and as a result, the airline puts a lot of pressure on staff to accept pay reductions. That happened at British Airways and these staff, about 700 of them, had to have their pay cut by around 10%.

Now they want it back. British Airways is not doing that, what they did offer was a 10% one-off payment this year while other negotiations continue. The ground crews unions, GMB and Unite, say that's not good enough, they want a commitment that they are going to get back what they lost. BA says the airline industry still isn't back up and running properly yet, there are still problems, itâs still not profitable, it lost Â£4bn over the past two years. Therefore, we have a conflict between two sides and now the workers have decided enough is enough, they're going to go out on strike. When will we see these strikes? There will probably a few days of disruption in the second half of July and then in August. We understand BA has contingency plans, so that's likely to be, for example, managers operating check in desks, but we'll have to wait and see how serious any disruption is going to be. British Airways should make
contingency plans to minimise disruption and refund passengers whose flights are impacted by strikes, the prime minister's spokesman says. ""This is obviously a matter for British Airways and the
unions and we would strongly encourage both to come together to
find a settlement,"" the spokesman continues. He says further disruption will only ""add to the misery
being faced by passengers at airports.""  British Airways says it's ""extremely disappointed"" after 700 workers based at Heathrow voted in favor of strike action in a dispute over pay. Unions say the action was due to a 10% pay cut imposed during the peak of the pandemic not being reinstated. In a statement, BA says: ""Despite the extremely challenging environment and losses of more than Â£4bn, we made an offer of a [one off] 10% payment which was accepted by the majority of other colleagues."" They said that included staff from ground operations, engineering and cabin crew. A spokesperson says: ""We are fully committed to work together to find a solution, because to deliver for our customers and rebuild our business we have to work as a team."" BA says it will update customers on what the decision will mean for them. Heathrow has already been hit by chaos this summer The looming strikes at Heathrow will only feed into the ""uncertainty"" of travel this summer, says one industry expert, who blames airlines  for ""not paying enough"" to staff. Paul Charles, who runs a PR agency specialising in luxury travel, said airlines in general were ""really struggling to deliver the quality of service needed"" at a time of flight cancellations, staff shortages and caps on flights. ""The demand is there,"" he told the BBC, but the airlines were ""not paying enough and therefore not attracting enough staff"". ""Wages are not seen as competitive,"" said Mr Charles, which led many to abandon their jobs during the pandemic in favour of other industries. ""Perks and benefits have been changed in the face of awful losses,"" he added and, in the face of losses of Â£4bn during the pandemic, ""BA has not been able to put workers back in the position they were in"". ""It's going to take some time to sort this dispute out. There is no easy compromise here."" Airlines had already been struggling with staff shortages, and now face further disruption after aviationworkers at Heathrow voted to strike. What are the strikes about? Those walking out include 700 British Airways (BA) check-in and ground staff who complain that a 10% pay cut imposed during the pandemic remains - while other BA workers have been given a 10% bonus. But BA dismissed their claims, saying that ""after a deeply difficult two years... these colleagues were offered a 10% payment for this year which was rejected"". Which routes will be affected? The BBC understands that BA - which operates from terminals three and five at the airport - has contingency plans in place, which could include managers dealing with check-ins. However, customers could still potentially face disruption and possibly some cancellations, in particular on routes with several daily flights. The strike dates will be confirmed in the coming days.

In a major city trains do not have so far to travel, but for rural areas it may take several hours. However, it's not just Friday morning when there will be disruption. Some train operators will wind-down services slightly earlier than normal, ahead of the next planned strike on Saturday. Passengers are urged to check for amendments to train companies' timetables. Hamzah AbbasBBC News Rail strikes have been causing disruption across much of the UK this week, with people struggling to get to work. But for one commuter, the walkouts were never going to be an issue. George Bullard has been kayaking to the office since 2015, a mode of transport he chose because it was ""an interesting way to get to work"". He travels to his workplace in Presteigne in Wales, where he runs a camping company, by kayaking down the River Lugg, when it's safe to do so. But he warns against others following suit, saying it can be dangerous without the right experience. Read more here.   Strike action means stations such as Euston in London will not have the same footfall as normal It's estimated the rail strikes will cost the UK hospitality sector over half a billion pounds in lost revenue across the three planned days of action. And the impact will be felt particularly keenly in the capital, says one industry insider. ""London is proportionately more dense in terms of hospitality venues and so [the impact] will be disproportionately higher ,"" says Tony Sophoclides, strategic affairs director for UK Hospitality. He tells the BBC the walkouts will cost London hospitality around Â£70m in lost trading, ""which is really not what we need at the moment"". Less than 20% of services were expected to run on Thursday, but - unlike the first day of strikes on Tuesday - London Underground union members have not been striking andthe tube has been run as normal,external, with only minor disruption. High street footfall in the UK was 16.1% lower to 13:00 BST on Thursday than on the same day last week, and down 8.5% on Tuesday, retail analysts Springboard has said. In central London, the drop from last week was more than double the national average, down 34.4%, compared with a fall of 27% on Tuesday. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: ""On the second day of train strikes, it appears that not only are people working from home, but fewer people are visiting their local high streets. ""The key fact is that the impact of the strike today appears to be even greater than the first strike."" Jo BlackReporting from Stratford-Upon-Avon Stratford-upon-Avon,
the town where William Shakespeare was born, is one of the most popular tourist
destinations outside London. And in a post-Covid world, a rail strike affecting how people
travel is something local businesses are worried about. One ice-cream vendor told us his ice-cream sales are down
20%, something he blames on this week's rail strikes. But most visitors weâve spoken to today have driven here or
come by coach. Guides with microphones followed by lines of tourists wearing headphones have been making their way about the town. Elsewhere, the manager of Tudor World, a local museum has told us that he has seen more children coming through the door. He thinks this might be because some families impacted by the rail strike are taking advantage of having the time off and bringing their whole family here for a day out. Tourism bosses are worried as businesses try to recover after Covid the rail strike is the last thing they need and if the strikes continue in to the weekend - as expected - the impact could be significant. In
Merseyside, union members have accepted a 7.1% pay offer from
Merseyrail in a deal they
have praised for being in keeping with the spiralling cost of living. Some 94% of Transport
Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) members in general gradesvoted to accept the deal. Workers for the main RMT rail union who are striking today are asking for similar pay rises of 7%. The Merseyside rail operator, which is not involved in the national dispute, is run by Liverpool City Region
Combined Authority, led by Labour Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram. General Secretary Manuel Cortes
described the deal as ""a sensible outcome to a reasonable offer which goes a long way towards keeping pace with the escalating cost of living"". Merseyrail confirmed it had met union representatives âas part of our normal annual pay negotiationsâ. The deal comes afterit was agreed in Marchto give London's Tube workers an 8.4% pay rise. It's worth noting that it's not just rail workers threatening industrial action. Teachers, healthcare workers and even criminal barristers are considering or have approved proposals to strike over pay, conditions and workloads. And this afternoon, hundreds of British Airways check-in staff at Heathrow Airport have voted to go on strike over the summer. Members of the GMB and Unite unions want a 10% pay cut, imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, to be reversed. British Airways has offered them a one-off 10% payment - and says it's extremely disappointed. The vote threatens further disruption for travellers after the Easter break was marred by delays and cancellations. Meanwhile, teachers represented by the National Education Union are also likely to be asked in the autumn term whether they wish to walk out over pay and conditions, amid demands for an inflation-matching pay rise for teachers. And members of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers who prosecute and defend people on trial, have already approved strikes this summer over the government's funding of the criminal justice system. More railway workers are to vote on strikes over pay, conditions and job security. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) served notice to ballot dozens of members at TransPennine Express (TPE), it was announced on Thursday. TPE runs trains across northern England and Scotland. The union is demanding a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies for 2022, no unagreed changes to terms and conditions, and a pay increase which reflects the rising cost of living. The ballot opens on 29 June and closes in mid-July. The TSSA is also balloting its members in Network Rail, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, West Midlands Trains, Avanti West Coast, Northern, LNER, C2C and Great Western Railway (GWR).  Unions should call off the train strikes ""as quickly as possible"", Downing Street says. A No 10 spokesman says there were talks between the RMT and Network Rail today, but ""what we want to see is for the unions to call off the strikes, to continue to negotiate and to come to an agreement with their employer."" ""We don't want to see this strike action to continue for a moment longer than it has to,"" he adds. Asked if this was possible before Saturday's strike, he says: ""That's a question for the unions."" The Government has not been informed of any further rail strikes after this week, the official says. Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland News Correspondent Glasgow Queen Street if far quieter today than normal Here at Queen Street station it's far quieter than you would normally expect it to be at four o'clock in the afternoon. I reckon there are about 30 passengers around the station at the moment. In fact, the four o'clock train to Edinburgh, one of the few trains running from Queen Street this afternoon, was actually cancelled. But that was nothing to do with the industrial action. According to the announcement at the station, there was an obstruction on the line and the 16:30 BST train to Edinburgh would be 15 minutes late because of that. After that there are two more trains to Edinburgh. Clearly there could be problems here with the knock-on effect of that incident continuing. But certainly what I have noticed, compared to the first strike on Tuesday, is there have been far fewer  people turning up at the station. Celestina OlulodeBBC News Rail services
are winding down at Paddington station on day two of the three-day rail
strikes. Services are due to shut down early at 6.30pm. According to
Network Rail, by 11:30am on Thursday footfall at Paddington was down by 70% compared
to the same time last Thursday. Looking across the concourse itâs clear that many
passengers have heeded Network Railâs advice and stayed away. But earlier a number of passengers arrived to catch
trains to the Glastonbury music festival. Bethan arrived one hour earlier to
avoid delays. Special services to Castle Cary, the station nearest to the festival in Pilton, were put on for passengers trying to get to the site.  The lorry crashed onto the tracks in East Lothian Train services in and out of Edinburgh have been delayed after a lorry crashed onto the tracks in East Lothian. The driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital following the accident on the East Coast Main Line between Wallyford and Prestonpans at about 13:30. Services between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh via Falkirk High and Bathgate have been disrupted. Services between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh via Shotts have also been affected. Read more here. Returning to our coverage of the train strikes and we understand more walkouts are ""extremely likely"" if talks between rail bosses and unions continue to fail. Trains ground to a halt across much of England, Wales and Scotland on Thursday, with about half the network closed. RMT boss Mick Lynch has accused the government of blocking a deal, after talks on Wednesday collapsed - but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps called suggestions the government had intervened ""a total lie"". But Network Rail said it was the RMT, not the government which stalled latest negotiations. The rail strikes come as hundreds of British Airways workers at Heathrow Airport have voted to go on strike over pay, raising the threat of a summer of disruption. Lynch meanwhile has said talks would continue and members would be consulted to see ""if and when there needs to be a new phase of industrial action"" on the railways. A third day of train strikes is currently set for Saturday 25 June. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent What's unusual is that this ballot wasn't about pay increases, people saying their pay should go up to keep pace with the cost of living, this was about workers at Heathrow, mainly female check-in staff, part-time workers. They wanted to go back to pay levels they had before the pandemic - if you remember, a couple of years ago, the aviation industry was in crisis, and as a result, the airline puts a lot of pressure on staff to accept pay reductions. That happened at British Airways and these staff, about 700 of them, had to have their pay cut by around 10%.

Now they want it back. British Airways is not doing that, what they did offer was a 10% one-off payment this year while other negotiations continue. The ground crews unions, GMB and Unite, say that's not good enough, they want a commitment that they are going to get back what they lost. BA says the airline industry still isn't back up and running properly yet, there are still problems, itâs still not profitable, it lost Â£4bn over the past two years. Therefore, we have a conflict between two sides and now the workers have decided enough is enough, they're going to go out on strike. When will we see these strikes? There will probably a few days of disruption in the second half of July and then in August. We understand BA has contingency plans, so that's likely to be, for example, managers operating check in desks, but we'll have to wait and see how serious any disruption is going to be. British Airways should make
contingency plans to minimise disruption and refund passengers whose flights are impacted by strikes, the prime minister's spokesman says. ""This is obviously a matter for British Airways and the
unions and we would strongly encourage both to come together to
find a settlement,"" the spokesman continues. He says further disruption will only ""add to the misery
being faced by passengers at airports.""  British Airways says it's ""extremely disappointed"" after 700 workers based at Heathrow voted in favor of strike action in a dispute over pay. Unions say the action was due to a 10% pay cut imposed during the peak of the pandemic not being reinstated. In a statement, BA says: ""Despite the extremely challenging environment and losses of more than Â£4bn, we made an offer of a [one off] 10% payment which was accepted by the majority of other colleagues."" They said that included staff from ground operations, engineering and cabin crew. A spokesperson says: ""We are fully committed to work together to find a solution, because to deliver for our customers and rebuild our business we have to work as a team."" BA says it will update customers on what the decision will mean for them. Heathrow has already been hit by chaos this summer The looming strikes at Heathrow will only feed into the ""uncertainty"" of travel this summer, says one industry expert, who blames airlines  for ""not paying enough"" to staff. Paul Charles, who runs a PR agency specialising in luxury travel, said airlines in general were ""really struggling to deliver the quality of service needed"" at a time of flight cancellations, staff shortages and caps on flights. ""The demand is there,"" he told the BBC, but the airlines were ""not paying enough and therefore not attracting enough staff"". ""Wages are not seen as competitive,"" said Mr Charles, which led many to abandon their jobs during the pandemic in favour of other industries. ""Perks and benefits have been changed in the face of awful losses,"" he added and, in the face of losses of Â£4bn during the pandemic, ""BA has not been able to put workers back in the position they were in"". ""It's going to take some time to sort this dispute out. There is no easy compromise here."" Airlines had already been struggling with staff shortages, and now face further disruption after aviationworkers at Heathrow voted to strike. What are the strikes about? Those walking out include 700 British Airways (BA) check-in and ground staff who complain that a 10% pay cut imposed during the pandemic remains - while other BA workers have been given a 10% bonus. But BA dismissed their claims, saying that ""after a deeply difficult two years... these colleagues were offered a 10% payment for this year which was rejected"". Which routes will be affected? The BBC understands that BA - which operates from terminals three and five at the airport - has contingency plans in place, which could include managers dealing with check-ins. However, customers could still potentially face disruption and possibly some cancellations, in particular on routes with several daily flights. The strike dates will be confirmed in the coming days.

Stephen Port: Met failings and the lives of four men,"Anthony Walgate Inquests for the four victims of Stephen Port have exposed how failings by the Metropolitan Police contributed to the deaths of three men. Port killed four gay men - Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth and Jack Taylor  - between June 2014 and September 2015. For the first time, during the inquests, the Met Police responses to the deaths were fully revealed. Here is the story of what happened. Anthony Walgate from Hull was studying fashion in London and occasionally worked as an escort. Using an alias, Stephen Port arranged for him to visit his Barking flat in June 2014. Port then drugged Anthony with GHB and raped him. He died after being given a fatal overdose of the drug. In the early morning of 19 June, Port dragged Anthony's body to the pavement outside his flat and used his own mobile phone to call an ambulance. He didn't give his name but told an operator that he had been driving past and had seen a ""young boy"" looking unwell. Port then returned to his flat. A paramedic who checked Anthony's body requested that police attend the scene. They arrived shortly afterwards with homicide detectives. Anthony's phone was missing, his underpants were on back-to-front, and he had bruising under his arms consistent with being moved by another person. The cause of death would eventually be attributed to a GHB overdose, although friends would tell police during their inquiries he was not a GHB user. This in itself should have been seen as critical. Anthony Walgate At the police station, a trace of the mobile phone number showed that the caller - Stephen Port - lived in the flat right next to where Anthony's body was found. Police visited him and he immediately changed his account of what happened. The bus garage chef claimed he had returned from a night-shift to find ""a male lying in my front door"" and had called 999. A police records check at the station revealed Port had previously been accused of drugging and raping a teenager, but somehow investigators on the ground did not become aware of this for several days. The case was then left with local officers from Barking, rather than being taken on by a specialist Scotland Yard murder investigation team. Anthony's mother Sarah Sak says the call she received from police was so brief it was like a discussion about a lost pet. She says police liaison officer, DS Paul Slaymaker, described Anthony's death as ""not suspicious at the moment"". But she knew this was wrong. ""It just started literally from day one. They just weren't interested - they just didn't listen to any of us,"" she tells the BBC. Anthony's mother Sarah Anthony's friends, who also realised something was seriously amiss, told officers he had travelled to Barking to meet a new client who called himself Joe Deen. Anthony had shared a photo of the man with them - and that person turned out to be Stephen Port. Port was arrested for lying to police about his dealings with Anthony, and was questioned at Barking police station - but only by a junior borough detective on his own. The killer gave a rambling and inconsistent account, ultimately claiming the deceased had visited his flat, died after taking his own drugs, and he only placed Anthony outside after panicking. At the recent inquests, the junior officer revealed that he thought Port had killed Anthony and that an experienced homicide team should have carried out the interview. At this point, DCI Tony Kirk, head of Barking and Dagenham CID, asked for a murder inquiry team to take over. He messaged a senior Scotland Yard homicide detective to say Port had previously drugged and raped someone and that, on balance, it appeared Anthony had died ""at the hands of another"". He added: ""I feel we as an organisation have a duty to his friends and family to get to the bottom of his death in what are increasingly suspicious circumstances."" The request was refused, but specialist detectives were sent to interview Port. They obtained more information from him, yet, according to details from the inquests, failed to follow a basic interview strategy or challenge Port on things he said. Unprompted, the killer revealed that he had previously been searched and questioned by police at Barking railway station after helping out a friend who was unwell. Officers thought this information seemed significant and left a note for the borough team. But nothing was done to establish any more detail and Port was released on bail. A police intelligence log, available on a national database, would have shown Port was referring to an incident two weeks before Anthony's death, when British Transport Police were called to reports of him assaulting an unwell man at Barking station. But a basic check wasn't made. Port had claimed the man had possibly taken ""G"" - a reference to GHB - and he had found him on drugs outside the flat after they met online.  It was not until more than a year later - by which time four men had been killed - that a murder investigation team traced the victim of the assault. He described having been surreptitiously drugged, waking naked and disoriented in Port's flat. Homicide officers now accept they would have taken on the case had they known about the incident. Months after Port's police interviews, he was charged with perverting the course of justice for lying about his dealings with Anthony. But nothing more was done to investigate the death itself - Scotland Yard's homicide division was not contacted again by Barking officers despite an order for them to be updated and consulted on developments. The inquests would also hear that, at that time, formal advice from homicide officers to check a laptop and phone belonging to Port was ignored. Had they been sent for forensic analysis Port's obsession with drugging and raping young men would have been uncovered. When they were eventually analysed the following year - after a request from a coroner - they showed that Port had persistently watched ""drug rape"" pornography. Even then, a detective failed to even look at the relevant sections of the forensic report. By then, police had closed their investigation. An interaction with a coroner showed the investigation's poor grasp of key details. DS Martin O'Donnell, who was managing the inquiry, told the coroner that Port ""stated he hadn't used escorts before and didn't know about the costs"" even though he had told detectives he used male prostitutes and had worked as an escort himself. Anthony's mother, Sarah Sak, was so concerned by the lapsed police investigation and unhappy with her liaison officer, DS Slaymaker, that she was forced to approach her MP for help. The killer had ""literally got away with murder"", Ms Sak says now. She believes detectives ""just couldn't be bothered"" to investigate properly. While he was on bail, Port went on to kill two more young men. Gabriel Kovari, a 22-year-old from Slovakia who was planning to work as a translator, became Port's flatmate in August 2014. He was killed within days. His body was discovered by a dog-walker in a Barking graveyard near Port's flat. Like Anthony, his mobile phone was missing and he was eventually found to have died due to a GHB overdose. Gabriel Kovari Police treated the death as unexplained but not suspicious. The resulting inquiries were shallow. John Pape, with whom Gabriel had lived in south London for several weeks, was contacted as his was the last known address. Pape said that Gabriel had headed east, but he did not know where. Detectives could have discovered that he moved to Cooke Street - where Port lived - if they had sought out a man who helped Gabriel move to Barking. The young Slovakian had sent his friend a map showing the new residence and several photos from inside Port's flat. In September 2014, three weeks after Gabriel died, the body of Daniel Whitworth was found in exactly the same spot of the same graveyard by the same dogwalker. Daniel, too, had died of a GHB overdose, and his phone was missing. Daniel Whitworth The ambitious young chef lived in Gravesend and had no connection to Barking. On him was an apparent suicide note claiming he had accidentally killed Gabriel, and had taken his own life as a result. The note had actually been written by Stephen Port, but police fell for his lies. Taken at face value, which the police did, since the note referred to an apparent homicide, Scotland Yard policy demanded a murder investigation team take the lead. Homicide detectives were consulted, but the death was never investigated by them. Again, the case remained with local officers. Their performance was a disaster. No forensic tests were conducted on items found with Daniel and Gabriel. Had they been, Port would have been identified since his DNA was on record. Police could have established the ""suicide note"" was fake if they had scrutinised it properly. It was not sent to a handwriting expert, despite promises being made to Daniel's family. His father Adam Whitworth was emailed a small piece of the note, with DC Yinka Adeyemo-Phillips of Barking police then telling officers that he had confirmed the writing as Daniel's. Daniel's father Adam But Mr Whitworth says he never confirmed it, and says he has ""no idea"" how the detective decided he did. ""She has done an abominable thing there and it's led to tragic consequences,"" he says. The note also stated ""btw please do not blame the guy I was with last night"". Officers failed to establish that person's identity. If they had, it would have led them to Stephen Port. Weeks after Daniel's death, his father was shown the full note by DS Slaymaker, who also worked on the Anthony Walgate inquiry. ""The first thing I said to him was, there's nothing in here that identifies it as Daniel, there's no names of anybody, there's no words and phrases that he would use,"" says Mr Whitworth. ""Slaymaker had an opportunity there in that room, when we was telling him our concerns, to put that right."" Detectives also refused to show the note to Daniel's long-term partner, Ricky Waumsley, with whom he shared a home and a bank account, after refusing to class him as next of kin. He says ""I felt like I was being put to one side and I felt like they were being homophobic towards me. If it was a straight woman who'd been found dead, and that was my partner, I think I would have been treated very, very differently."" Daniel and his partner Ricky Questioned about Daniel's whereabouts at the time Gabriel had died in east London, Ricky Waumsley checked his phone and told officers they appeared to have been together at home in Kent, far from Barking. This gave Daniel an alibi and meant he could not have killed Gabriel. But officers ignored this fundamental point. DS Slaymaker, was ordered to get mobile phone data, which would have shown Daniel's real location on the key date, but failed to do so. In reality, the victims never met one another. Mandy Whitworth, Daniel's stepmother, says being told by police that Daniel was a killer was incredibly distressing.  ""I don't think I can even tell you not only how angry that has made us, but how deeply that has wounded us for life."" Detectives also ignored a series of warnings about the two deaths being linked to that of Anthony Walgate. Gabriel's former flatmate John Pape and boyfriend Thierry Amodio both suggested there might be link, after reading an anonymised local newspaper report about the earlier death. But they were ignored. Amodio, making his own inquiries, ended up in contact with a Facebook user calling himself Jon Luck. This person appeared to know important information about the last days of Gabriel and Daniel and made alarming suggestions about parties at which young men were drugged and exploited. He was plainly a central witness. Amodio sent the Facebook account to DC Adeyemo-Phillips but nothing was done to investigate the account or the person behind it. It turned out to be a fake account used by Stephen Port to spread lies. Officers did not bother taking a statement from Amodio, who lived in Spain, and refused to keep him updated as they did not regard him as 'next of kin'. When Amodio resorted to emailing the local coroner for information, one of the leading detectives on the case - DS Debbie Turrell - wrote to her colleague that he was ""fishing for information"". Pape persistently contacted detectives to raise concerns about the threat to gay men, but he was totally ignored. In one email he wrote: I worry about what is happening to young men in Barking"". He resorted to asking LGBT organisations to contact the Met, but the force continued to be dismissive. The officer who ignored Pape's warnings was DC Jacqueline Baxter, who had also been appointed as ""family liaison officer"" for Gabriel's family in Slovakia. But she failed in her role by not making any effort to contact them. DC Baxter then misled a coroner's officer. In an email, she wrongly stated that ""uniformed officers kept this case as it was not deemed suspicious. She then named the wrong country by stating, ""I just dealt with the burial company in Lithuania"". The inquests also heard about serious failings by DI Rolf Schamberger, who oversaw the Barking and Dagenham Police team that examined the deaths of Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth. He signed off a series of actions as complete, even though they had not been carried out, such as the crucial demand to obtain phone data on Daniel. DI Rolf Schamberger Schamberger personally prepared flawed reports for the men's first inquests, which took place in June 2015, giving evidence at both. He falsely told the coroner that a ""diary"" had been used to confirm Daniel Whitworth's handwriting on the suicide note, even though no diary was ever seized. Having been asked at Gabriel's first inquest in 2015 about a possible link to the death of Anthony Walgate, the detective said ""there was consideration given to there being a link, but, to the best of my knowledge, no link was ever established"". The officer, who has since been promoted, claimed at this year's inquest not to have known anything about Anthony's case at the time, saying it is ""hard to say"" what he meant in his answer back then. In 2015, Schamberger told the coroner that no testing had taken place on a bedsheet found with Daniel's body, contrary to a pathologist's recommendation, adding the ""circumstances at the time indicated towards no other external parties being involved"". He now says he ""can't really explain"" that answer, given the investigation had considered the possibility that other people might have been involved. The bedsheet was covered in the killer's DNA. Even before the pathologist's report on Daniel had concluded, the detective had written ""the investigation is complete and the report can be closed"". Jack Taylor was found dead in September 2015, slumped against the other side of the graveyard wall to where Gabriel and Daniel had been discovered. Like the other three young men, his phone was missing and he died of a GHB overdose. Like the others, he was not a user of drugs, meaning the circumstances were unusual. Jack Taylor Despite some detectives attending the scene who had been present at the earlier deaths, no connection was made to them. Officers decided Jack's death was non-suspicious. The Taylor family were briefly visited and told that Jack had died, but then heard nothing more from police. PC Jon Taylor, whose job was to patrol local parks, found out he was running the investigation from a digital crime report entry, rather than because anyone told him.  He was not a detective but had been put in charge because he had been the person flagged down in the street when the body was discovered. He asked for help from the local CID team - the same unit that had run inquiries into the earlier deaths - but a detective refused and stated: ""I deal with more protracted/unexplained deaths"". Almost a fortnight had passed when Donna Taylor, Jack's sister, contacted the Met, furious at the lack of contact. In that time Donna and younger sister Jenny had launched their own investigation, spotting the links to the earlier deaths. ""We should never have had to investigate and do everything behind the scenes ourselves,"" says Jenny Taylor. ""Why couldn't they have done that? Saying they didn't have enough resources or enough training, we've got no training, we had no resources, we had a laptop - that's all we had - and it makes us very angry."" The Taylor family kept pushing the police to do more. Jack's sisters Donna and Jenny For example, when police confirmed there was CCTV of Jack meeting a tall man at Barking station and walking away together, the Taylor sisters insisted that officers issue a public appeal to identify the stranger. At first, officers refused to do so, but relented following pressure from the sisters. It was one of the original Anthony Walgate detectives who recognised the tall blonde stranger as Stephen Port after seeing the appeal images on a colleague's desk. Donna Taylor says the Met ""didn't look into anything"" and have ""allowed that man to take three innocent people's lives"". Families of the dead men say the Met made false assumptions about their loved ones, with homophobia playing a role in the flawed decision-making. Scotland Yard accepts failing the victims, but denies that prejudice was a factor. Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said: ""I don't think the Met is an institutionally homophobic organisation. I do think that we need to make a great deal of change to our investigative practices. We have done that - and people need to be reassured that we have done that."" Seventeen police officers involved in the original response into the four deaths were investigated by the police watchdog. The Independent Office for Police Conduct did not refer any of them for misconduct proceedings. Seven of the officers have since been promoted. The Taylor sisters, whose persistence led the police to the killer, say they will not accept this result. ""We've never gone away - the Taylor family, the Taylor sisters - will never will go away.

Stephen Port police failings led to further deaths,"Stephen Port's victims (L-R): Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Jack Taylor and Daniel Whitworth Failings by the Met Police contributed to the deaths of serial killer Stephen Port's final three victims, an inquest jury has ruled. Port, 46, is serving a whole-life term for murdering Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth and Jack Taylor in Barking over 16 months. The deaths were not regarded suspicious until weeks after the fourth murder. The case was branded ""one of the most widespread institutional failings in modern history"" by the men's families. Neil Hudgell, a solicitor representing the victims, added: ""Our firmly held belief is that the Metropolitan Police's actions were, in part, driven by homophobia."" How Met failings contributed to the deaths of three men The Met failed to carry out basic checks, send evidence to be forensically examined, and exercise professional curiosity while Port was embarking on his killing spree, the inquest heard. Port is serving a whole-life term for the four murders Port killed the four men, who were all aged in their early 20s, by giving them overdoses of the ""date rape"" drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) at his east London home between June 2014 and September 2015. He was jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2016for the murders and a string of sex assaults. This video can not be played The sisters of Port's final victim blame police for his death Police refused to class the partner of Daniel Whitworth, with whom he shared a home and a bank account, as next of kin. Ricky Waumsley said he would have been treated differently if he was a ""straight, white woman"". Coroner Sarah Munro QC said: ""These inquests have, on any view, raised a number of serious concerns."" She added she would be preparing a prevention of future deaths report. This year already Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has been forced to make a series of public apologies following scandals: Forthe Met's inadequate response to two missing black sisterslater found murdered; fortwo officers taking selfies with the bodiesof those dead women; for corruption and cover-up inthe Daniel Morgan murder case; and after Met PC Wayne Couzens wasconvicted of the murder Sarah Everard. This year has also seen the force accused of institutional corruption, misogyny, racism and, today, institutional homophobia. The official graphs illustrating Londoners' perception of the Met show every line reflecting performance heading substantially downwards. A national poll by Ipsos Mori this week suggested the proportion who trust the police had fallen from 76% to 63% in the last two years. There have been more ""heartfelt apologies"" today, but sorrow and regret alone will not reverse the reputational decline of the force which pioneered ""professional policing"". The nine-week long inquests at Barking Town Hall were told police had ignored multiple chances to uncover that Port had been responsible for the first murder - Anthony Walgate, 23, in June 2014 - with the result being the later deaths were preventable. The jury found a murder team should have taken over that first inquiry. Referring to the inquiries made by officers in Barking and Dagenham into the deaths of Gabriel Kovari, 22, and Daniel Whitworth, 21, the jury said there were ""fundamental failings in these investigations from the beginning"". This meant Port was free to kill Jack Taylor, 25, a year later. The bodies of Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth were found in the graveyard of St Margaret's Church The inquest also ruled the failings were by both officers in Barking and in the Met's homicide command. In written conclusions, the jury acknowledged officers had faced a ""heavy workload"", but said there were failures which ""cannot be overlooked"". During the inquests police admitteda series of ""terrible mistakes"" were made. Coroner Sarah Munro QC ruled out homophobia as an issue for the jury to consider Mr Hudgell told a press conference: ""We are incensed by the police's successful attempts to prevent the jury from examining whether [homophobic] prejudice played any part in the police's action."" He added that ""had the police done their job properly in the first place, Gabriel, Daniel and Jack would not have been killed and other young men would not have been drugged and raped by him"". Met Police Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball offered ""my own and the Met's heartfelt apologies"" and said she and Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick have offered to meet personally with the victims' loved ones to hear concerns. She said: ""We completely accept people's trust in us has been damaged by a number of recent events. This video can not be played Asst Commissioner Helen Ball described the jury's conclusion as ""a devastating finding"" ""What has happened in connection with each of the deaths of these four young men is part of that damage, and we know has a particular impact in communities local to Barking and LGBT+ communities across London. ""It is very important now to show that we are trustworthy, that we care, that we have changed, and that we are learning."" The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) said it is considering reopening investigation into handling of the deaths. Although 17 officers were interviewed, 16 gave ""no comment"" interviews, submitting written statements instead. None faced gross misconduct charges but nine officers ""fell below the standard required"". Families pay tribute to young men murdered by Port Port case made assumptions about gay community The killer the police missed IOPC Regional Director Graham Beesley said: ""We are examining if anything was said by the officers who gave evidence during the inquests which could alter our findings and give grounds to re-open our investigation."" Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said some police officers ""have got to face serious disciplinary action"". ""Every single gay person who raised concerns about the young gay men was ignored, dismissed and treated with contempt, even the partner of one of the victims,"" he said.

"More rail strikes extremely likely, says union bossTravellers are facing another day of disruption on the second day of strikes, as half the network closes.UK","This video can not be played Watch: RMT boss says government is making negotiations worse as Rail Delivery Group chair suggests reform may not mean redundancies More rail strikes are ""extremely likely"" if talks between rail bosses and unions continue to fail, the union at the centre of the dispute has said. RMT boss Mick Lynch accused the government of blocking a deal, a claim denied by the government. For the second time this week a walkout by rail workers has left travellers facing another day of disruption. Trains have ground to a halt across much of England, Wales and Scotland, with about half the network closed. Another walkout is already planned for Saturday. Downing Street said the unions should call off the strikes ""as quickly as possible"", but Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) workers' union, earlier told BBC Breakfast that Saturday's industrial action might not be the last. He said talks would continue and he would consult members to see ""if and when there needs to be a new phase of industrial action"". ""But if we don't get a settlement, it's extremely likely there will be,"" he said. Tim Shoveller, the chief negotiator for Network Rail - which maintains the railways throughout Britain - said there had been hopes on Wednesday of stopping the second day of strikes and it was ""hugely frustrating"" after talks collapsed. As it happened: Trains grind to a halt on second day of strikes What days are the strikes and which trains are running? Ros Atkins on... Why rail strikes are happening Train services across the UK have been cancelled as a result of the rail strikes There have been accusations on both sides that third parties are hampering progress. Mr Lynch told BBC's Breakfast: ""The government's hand is in this... the [rail] companies leave the room, consult the government ministers and the department officials and when they come back often the situation is worse."" But Network Rail - with whom the RMT are negotiating - said it was the RMT, not the government which stalled negotiations. Mr Shoveller said they thought they had a deal on Wednesday until the RMT left the room to get guidance from their board. How have you been affected by the rail strikes? Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy The Department for Transport has insisted the rail industry is leading the negotiations. However, a contract seen by the BBC said train operating companies' handling of strike action was ""subject to the secretary of state's direction"", a reference to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary. A key sticking point of negotiations appears to centre around a letter from Network Rail about pressing ahead with a formal consultation over changes to working practices in maintenance teams - which would entail redundancies. The RMT asked for it to be withdrawn - and accused Transport Secretary Grant Shapps of wrecking negotiations by not allowing Network Rail to do so. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"" and said he had no involvement in the letter. Speaking from Rwanda, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the strikes as ""unnecessary"" and stressed the benefits of ""sensible reforms"" of the rail system. Mr Johnson, who is attending a Commonwealth summit, said ""people should get around the table and sort it out"", adding he wanted a ""great future"" for British railways. The RMT- the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers' union - represents 40,000 members from cleaners to train guards across the rail network The Rail Delivery Grouprepresents train operators andNetwork Rail- which maintains the tracks and runs some bigger stations The Transport Secretary- Grant Shapps says it is not his role to negotiate with unions, though Labour and some Tory MPs think he should be involved The RMT is calling for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the cost of living crisis, as inflation hits 9.1% and is forecast to reach 11% in the autumn. Employers have offered a maximum of 3%, on condition that the union accepts new working practices. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies, said it wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"", which meant modernising the railway to attract passengers back. As Network Rail and the unions get back around the table for another long day of negotiation, one rail company - one of the few franchises run without government money - has reached a settlement in a separate dispute. Picketers outside Edinburgh Waverley Station on Thursday Merseyrail workers have been given a 7.1% pay rise. Asked if that's what Network Rail would offer eventually, Mr Shoveller said: ""I think that's very unlikely."" ""We can see a way of funding a pay deal, not of those sort of proportions but still an overall good package recognising that the prime thing the unions are asking for is a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies,"" he told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. ""So we think we've got a package of no compulsory redundancies, of money and some other long sought after things the union and employees have been after and we want to move forward with that package."" Eddie Dempsey, of the RMT, said the Merseyrail deal was significant. ""Wherever we're dealing with somebody who's not directly controlled by the DfT, we're making progress,"" he added. A Department for Transport spokesperson said it was entirely false to claim the government was blocking negotiations. ""We have said from the outset we urge the unions and industry to agree a deal that is fair for railway staff, passengers and taxpayers,"" they added. Many would-be commuters worked from home, while many festival-goers heading to Glastonbury appeared to travel by road instead of rail. Those who did brave the commute were met by short queues, while normally bustling stations were quiet, with concourses closed off. Businesses which rely on morning commutersalso faced knock-on impact. RMT members picketed several stations, including general secretary Mick Lynch who joined the picket line at London's Euston station. Meanwhile, traffic in London was higher than at the same time last week,according to data by location technology firm TomTom. Elsewhere, the roads were not as busy as anticipated.

"Boxers exploited by Kinahan gang, officer saysAssistant Garda Commissioner John O'Driscoll says the crime group ""preyed upon"" many boxers.Northern Ireland","Daniel Kinahan co-founded MTK Boxing which had links with many top boxers Many boxers have been exploited and preyed upon by the Kinahan organised crime group, a senior officer has said. The USrecently imposed sanctionson the gang's leaders and banned hundreds of people with suspected connections to the cartel from entering the country. A number of prominent boxers from Northern Ireland were formerly associated with the MTK boxing management company, which was co-founded by Daniel Kinahan. The boxers had no involvement in crime. Speaking to BBC News NI, Assistant Garda Commissioner John O'Driscoll said the United States shares information with the Irish authorities about some people who are banned from entering the US. ""That is a matter for the US authorities and we would not necessarily know all of the people who are refused entry in such circumstances. But, where it would be relevant to us, and where it may assist us in our investigations, that information is shared by the US authorities,"" he explained. Shortly after the US sanctions and reward were announced, MTKannounced that it was closing down. For years, the company was involved with some of the best boxers in the world, including some high profile boxers from Northern Ireland - Carl Frampton, Paddy Barnes and Michael Conlon. Carl Frampton and Paddy Barnes had retired, and Michael Conlon had disassociated himself from MTK, before it ceased operations. These boxers had no involvement with crime. In April, US authorities said a $5m reward was being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the gang's leaders BBC News NI asked Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll if any boxers - who were associated with MTK in the past - could be among the 600 people who've been banned from entering the US. He responded: ""It is a matter for interaction between a particular individual and the US authorities as they attempt to enter the US. But, from my knowledge, if they can assure the US authorities that they have disassociated themselves from people or entities that are problematic, that the prospect is there that they will be allowed entry to the US into the future."" The senior officer, who has been to the forefront of the international efforts to bring down the Kinahan cartel, believes the gang took advantage of many boxers from Northern Ireland and elsewhere. ""We see many people who are involved in boxing, in particular young people, being exploited by that organised crime group,"" he outlined. ""These are people who have, maybe, dedicated their life to pursuing a career in boxing, and who have no knowledge of the activities of the Kinahan organised crime group, but have been preyed upon by them and find themselves in circumstances that were not of their own making and they are people that we are attempting to protect also, in targeting the criminal activity engaged in by the Kinahan organised crime group."" Commenting on the continuing international efforts against the gang leaders and their assets, the Dublin-based assistant commissioner said there was an important cross-border dimension to the operation. ""Northern Ireland features from a number of perspectives. Firstly, it may feature in the drug trafficking route involved. So, while cocaine obviously, imported into Ireland by the Kinahan organised crime group, will in some cases be destined for Ireland, on other occasions it'll be destined for the UK, and the route which it will take may include transportation through Northern Ireland,"" he explained. ""Or indeed, it may in some cases be intended to supply a demand for that drug in that part of the UK also."" He added: ""Movement takes place on a regular basis among those who are involved in the criminal organisations concerned. ""So, you may find movement that is temporary in nature. On occasions, people may stay somewhat longer. But, all of those movements are subject to ongoing monitoring in the relevant jurisdictions.""

"Many children dead in Afghan quake, doctors say","This video can not be played WATCH: Body removed from rubble after deadly earthquake hits Afghanistan Doctors in Afghanistan have told the BBC that many children may have been killed in Wednesday's earthquake. More than 1,000 people died in the disaster, and heavy rain, threadbare resources and rugged terrain are hampering rescue workers. Unknown numbers were buried in the rubble of ruined, often mud-built homes by the magnitude 6.1 earthquake. One woman in hospital in Paktika province told reporters she had lost 19 family members. ""Seven in one room, five in another, four in another, then three in another, have all been killed in my family,"" she said from her bed. By Wednesday night Taliban officials said search and rescue operations had finished in most places, although in remoter areas some continued still. ""We can't reach the area - networks are too weak,"" a Taliban spokesman was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying earlier. Five beds between 500 at Afghan quake clinic The United Nations is among those scrambling to provide emergency shelter and food aid to remote areas in Paktika. Survivors and rescuers have told the BBC of villages completely destroyed near the epicentre of the quake, of ruined roads and mobile phone towers - and of their fears that the death toll will rise further.  Some 1,500 people were also injured, officials say. The Taliban authorities have called for more international aid. Villagers and rescue workers examine the damage in Bernal district Most of the casualties found so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts of Paktika. Locals report dozens of villages collapsed. ""There was a rumbling and my bed began to shake,"" a survivor called Shabir told the BBC. ""The ceiling fell down. I was trapped, but I could see the sky. My shoulder was dislocated, my head was hurt but I got out. I am sure that seven or nine people from my family, who were in the same room as me, are dead."" A mother of six who was badly injured in the earthquake told the BBC many in her village had been killed, including seven of her own family members. ""We are very poor. We cannot reconstruct our homes again,"" she said. ""We have nothing to eat."" All her family's food supplies are buried under the rubble. ""There is nowhere to go,"" she added. ""I demand the Taliban rebuild our houses."" All the villagers we meet want to show us the damage to their homes done by the earthquake. They have lost their loved ones, alongside homes and livelihoods. Possessions are scattered amongst the debris: blankets, pots, beds stick out from the rubble. The villagers want the world to see how their lives have been devastated, but also more tangibly, to have their names added to aid distribution schemes. A number of aid agencies have reached the scene but it's clear more help is needed. One man we meet has just arrived back in his village from Pakistan where he works as a labourer. Twenty members of his family were killed in the earthquake including his daughter. Another, elderly man now finds himself responsible for his five young grandchildren - after their father died. The valleys here are overflowing with tragedy. Many of the families are now living in makeshift tents, flanked by the rubble of the homes they had worked so hard to construct.

We cannot reconstruct our homes again,"" she said. ""We have nothing to eat."" All her family's food supplies are buried under the rubble. ""There is nowhere to go,"" she added. ""I demand the Taliban rebuild our houses."" All the villagers we meet want to show us the damage to their homes done by the earthquake. They have lost their loved ones, alongside homes and livelihoods. Possessions are scattered amongst the debris: blankets, pots, beds stick out from the rubble. The villagers want the world to see how their lives have been devastated, but also more tangibly, to have their names added to aid distribution schemes. A number of aid agencies have reached the scene but it's clear more help is needed. One man we meet has just arrived back in his village from Pakistan where he works as a labourer. Twenty members of his family were killed in the earthquake including his daughter. Another, elderly man now finds himself responsible for his five young grandchildren - after their father died. The valleys here are overflowing with tragedy. Many of the families are now living in makeshift tents, flanked by the rubble of the homes they had worked so hard to construct.

The earthquake struck early on Wednesday about 44km (27 miles) from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India.

But Mohammad Amin Huzaifa, head of information for Paktika province, told AFP it was proving ""very difficult"" for rescuers to reach areas ""affected by floods because of heavy rains last night"". Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it is located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Over the past decade more than 7,000 people have been killed in earthquakes in the country, the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports. There are an average of 560 deaths a year from earthquakes. Even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan's emergency services were stretched to deal with natural disasters - with few aircraft and helicopters available to rescuers. According to the UN, 93% of households in Afghanistan suffer food insecurity. Lucien Christen, from the Red Cross, said Afghanistan's ""dire economic situation"" meant ""they're [Afghan families] not able to put food on the table"".

LiveLiveTrains grind to a halt on second day of strikes7 minutes ago,"Hundreds of British Airways workers at Heathrow Airport vote to strike over pay during the summer holiday period Tens of thousands of passengers have already been hit by airport disruption and flight cancellations in recent weeks Meanwhile, half the rail network is closed in England, Wales and Scotland as part of a second rail strike this week Tens of thousands of rail staff are taking action over pay, jobs and changes to working practices Just one in five trains are running, mostly on main lines, and services are due to shut down early at 6.30pm Special arrangements are in place at Paddington station to manage those heading to Glastonbury Festival Edited by Chris Giles Thanks for joining our live coverage of the day's events. We're closing our coverage shortly, but here's a recap of what happened:  Today's reporting was brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Adam Durbin, Craig Hutchison, Marita Moloney, James Harness, Alexandra Fouche, Lauren Hirst and Aoife Walsh. It was edited by Chris Giles, Jeremy Gahagan and Holly Wallis.  Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent This is going to be a difficult summer for British Airways. IT problems and staff shortages have already hit its
operations this year. Now you can add industrial action to the mix. Check-in staff at Heathrow are set to walk out during the
summer peak. The airline will have contingency plans in place, but with systems
already under strain, disruption seems inevitable. The airline insists that it wants to work with staff, and
that itâs 10% one-off bonus offer was a prelude to meaningful pay talks.
It is still under pressure, too â the industry has not fully recovered. But the problem its facing is that when the cuts were first
imposed, many staff were deeply upset by what they saw as the heavy-handed
approach of the airlineâs management. And now, itâs pretty clear that many workers simply donât
trust the word of their managers. Although railway staff are on strike today the effect of the industrial action will still be felt tomorrow. It's thought only 60% of the normal weekday services will operate. This is due to the knock-on effect of overnight signallers and control room staff being on strike. Trains will leave depots a lot later in the morning than usual when the daytime shift starts work at around 06:00. Normally, trains are moved from 03:00. The length of time it takes for train services to get back to normal depends on the distance between a depot and a station. In a major city trains do not have so far to travel, but for rural areas it may take several hours. However, it's not just Friday morning when there will be disruption. Some train operators will wind-down services slightly earlier than normal, ahead of the next planned strike on Saturday. Passengers are urged to check for amendments to train companies' timetables. Hamzah AbbasBBC News Rail strikes have been causing disruption across much of the UK this week, with people struggling to get to work. But for one commuter, the walkouts were never going to be an issue. George Bullard has been kayaking to the office since 2015, a mode of transport he chose because it was ""an interesting way to get to work"". He travels to his workplace in Presteigne in Wales, where he runs a camping company, by kayaking down the River Lugg, when it's safe to do so. But he warns against others following suit, saying it can be dangerous without the right experience. Read more here.   Strike action means stations such as Euston in London will not have the same footfall as normal It's estimated the rail strikes will cost the UK hospitality sector over half a billion pounds in lost revenue across the three planned days of action. And the impact will be felt particularly keenly in the capital, says one industry insider. ""London is proportionately more dense in terms of hospitality venues and so [the impact] will be disproportionately higher ,"" says Tony Sophoclides, strategic affairs director for UK Hospitality. He tells the BBC the walkouts will cost London hospitality around Â£70m in lost trading, ""which is really not what we need at the moment"". Less than 20% of services were expected to run on Thursday, but - unlike the first day of strikes on Tuesday - London Underground union members have not been striking andthe tube has been run as normal,external, with only minor disruption. High street footfall in the UK was 16.1% lower to 13:00 BST on Thursday than on the same day last week, and down 8.5% on Tuesday, retail analysts Springboard has said. In central London, the drop from last week was more than double the national average, down 34.4%, compared with a fall of 27% on Tuesday. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: ""On the second day of train strikes, it appears that not only are people working from home, but fewer people are visiting their local high streets. ""The key fact is that the impact of the strike today appears to be even greater than the first strike."" Jo BlackReporting from Stratford-Upon-Avon Stratford-upon-Avon,
the town where William Shakespeare was born, is one of the most popular tourist
destinations outside London. And in a post-Covid world, a rail strike affecting how people
travel is something local businesses are worried about. One ice-cream vendor told us his ice-cream sales are down
20%, something he blames on this week's rail strikes. But most visitors weâve spoken to today have driven here or
come by coach. Guides with microphones followed by lines of tourists wearing headphones have been making their way about the town. Elsewhere, the manager of Tudor World, a local museum has told us that he has seen more children coming through the door. He thinks this might be because some families impacted by the rail strike are taking advantage of having the time off and bringing their whole family here for a day out. Tourism bosses are worried as businesses try to recover after Covid the rail strike is the last thing they need and if the strikes continue in to the weekend - as expected - the impact could be significant. In
Merseyside, union members have accepted a 7.1% pay offer from
Merseyrail in a deal they
have praised for being in keeping with the spiralling cost of living. Some 94% of Transport
Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) members in general gradesvoted to accept the deal. Workers for the main RMT rail union who are striking today are asking for similar pay rises of 7%. The Merseyside rail operator, which is not involved in the national dispute, is run by Liverpool City Region
Combined Authority, led by Labour Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram. General Secretary Manuel Cortes
described the deal as ""a sensible outcome to a reasonable offer which goes a long way towards keeping pace with the escalating cost of living"". Merseyrail confirmed it had met union representatives âas part of our normal annual pay negotiationsâ. The deal comes afterit was agreed in Marchto give London's Tube workers an 8.4% pay rise. It's worth noting that it's not just rail workers threatening industrial action. Teachers, healthcare workers and even criminal barristers are considering or have approved proposals to strike over pay, conditions and workloads. And this afternoon, hundreds of British Airways check-in staff at Heathrow Airport have voted to go on strike over the summer. Members of the GMB and Unite unions want a 10% pay cut, imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, to be reversed. British Airways has offered them a one-off 10% payment - and says it's extremely disappointed. The vote threatens further disruption for travellers after the Easter break was marred by delays and cancellations. Meanwhile, teachers represented by the National Education Union are also likely to be asked in the autumn term whether they wish to walk out over pay and conditions, amid demands for an inflation-matching pay rise for teachers. And members of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers who prosecute and defend people on trial, have already approved strikes this summer over the government's funding of the criminal justice system. More railway workers are to vote on strikes over pay, conditions and job security. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) served notice to ballot dozens of members at TransPennine Express (TPE), it was announced on Thursday. TPE runs trains across northern England and Scotland. The union is demanding a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies for 2022, no unagreed changes to terms and conditions, and a pay increase which reflects the rising cost of living. The ballot opens on 29 June and closes in mid-July. The TSSA is also balloting its members in Network Rail, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, West Midlands Trains, Avanti West Coast, Northern, LNER, C2C and Great Western Railway (GWR).  Unions should call off the train strikes ""as quickly as possible"", Downing Street says. A No 10 spokesman says there were talks between the RMT and Network Rail today, but ""what we want to see is for the unions to call off the strikes, to continue to negotiate and to come to an agreement with their employer."" ""We don't want to see this strike action to continue for a moment longer than it has to,"" he adds. Asked if this was possible before Saturday's strike, he says: ""That's a question for the unions."" The Government has not been informed of any further rail strikes after this week, the official says. Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland News Correspondent Glasgow Queen Street if far quieter today than normal Here at Queen Street station it's far quieter than you would normally expect it to be at four o'clock in the afternoon. I reckon there are about 30 passengers around the station at the moment. In fact, the four o'clock train to Edinburgh, one of the few trains running from Queen Street this afternoon, was actually cancelled. But that was nothing to do with the industrial action. According to the announcement at the station, there was an obstruction on the line and the 16:30 BST train to Edinburgh would be 15 minutes late because of that. After that there are two more trains to Edinburgh. Clearly there could be problems here with the knock-on effect of that incident continuing. But certainly what I have noticed, compared to the first strike on Tuesday, is there have been far fewer  people turning up at the station. Celestina OlulodeBBC News Rail services
are winding down at Paddington station on day two of the three-day rail
strikes. Services are due to shut down early at 6.30pm. According to
Network Rail, by 11:30am on Thursday footfall at Paddington was down by 70% compared
to the same time last Thursday. Looking across the concourse itâs clear that many
passengers have heeded Network Railâs advice and stayed away. But earlier a number of passengers arrived to catch
trains to the Glastonbury music festival. Bethan arrived one hour earlier to
avoid delays. Special services to Castle Cary, the station nearest to the festival in Pilton, were put on for passengers trying to get to the site.  The lorry crashed onto the tracks in East Lothian Train services in and out of Edinburgh have been delayed after a lorry crashed onto the tracks in East Lothian. The driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital following the accident on the East Coast Main Line between Wallyford and Prestonpans at about 13:30. Services between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh via Falkirk High and Bathgate have been disrupted. Services between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh via Shotts have also been affected. Read more here. Returning to our coverage of the train strikes and we understand more walkouts are ""extremely likely"" if talks between rail bosses and unions continue to fail. Trains ground to a halt across much of England, Wales and Scotland on Thursday, with about half the network closed. RMT boss Mick Lynch has accused the government of blocking a deal, after talks on Wednesday collapsed - but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps called suggestions the government had intervened ""a total lie"". But Network Rail said it was the RMT, not the government which stalled latest negotiations. The rail strikes come as hundreds of British Airways workers at Heathrow Airport have voted to go on strike over pay, raising the threat of a summer of disruption. Lynch meanwhile has said talks would continue and members would be consulted to see ""if and when there needs to be a new phase of industrial action"" on the railways. A third day of train strikes is currently set for Saturday 25 June. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent What's unusual is that this ballot wasn't about pay increases, people saying their pay should go up to keep pace with the cost of living, this was about workers at Heathrow, mainly female check-in staff, part-time workers. They wanted to go back to pay levels they had before the pandemic - if you remember, a couple of years ago, the aviation industry was in crisis, and as a result, the airline puts a lot of pressure on staff to accept pay reductions. That happened at British Airways and these staff, about 700 of them, had to have their pay cut by around 10%.

Now they want it back. British Airways is not doing that, what they did offer was a 10% one-off payment this year while other negotiations continue. The ground crews unions, GMB and Unite, say that's not good enough, they want a commitment that they are going to get back what they lost. BA says the airline industry still isn't back up and running properly yet, there are still problems, itâs still not profitable, it lost Â£4bn over the past two years. Therefore, we have a conflict between two sides and now the workers have decided enough is enough, they're going to go out on strike. When will we see these strikes? There will probably a few days of disruption in the second half of July and then in August. We understand BA has contingency plans, so that's likely to be, for example, managers operating check in desks, but we'll have to wait and see how serious any disruption is going to be. British Airways should make
contingency plans to minimise disruption and refund passengers whose flights are impacted by strikes, the prime minister's spokesman says. ""This is obviously a matter for British Airways and the
unions and we would strongly encourage both to come together to
find a settlement,"" the spokesman continues. He says further disruption will only ""add to the misery
being faced by passengers at airports.""  British Airways says it's ""extremely disappointed"" after 700 workers based at Heathrow voted in favor of strike action in a dispute over pay. Unions say the action was due to a 10% pay cut imposed during the peak of the pandemic not being reinstated. In a statement, BA says: ""Despite the extremely challenging environment and losses of more than Â£4bn, we made an offer of a [one off] 10% payment which was accepted by the majority of other colleagues."" They said that included staff from ground operations, engineering and cabin crew. A spokesperson says: ""We are fully committed to work together to find a solution, because to deliver for our customers and rebuild our business we have to work as a team."" BA says it will update customers on what the decision will mean for them. Heathrow has already been hit by chaos this summer The looming strikes at Heathrow will only feed into the ""uncertainty"" of travel this summer, says one industry expert, who blames airlines  for ""not paying enough"" to staff. Paul Charles, who runs a PR agency specialising in luxury travel, said airlines in general were ""really struggling to deliver the quality of service needed"" at a time of flight cancellations, staff shortages and caps on flights. ""The demand is there,"" he told the BBC, but the airlines were ""not paying enough and therefore not attracting enough staff"". ""Wages are not seen as competitive,"" said Mr Charles, which led many to abandon their jobs during the pandemic in favour of other industries. ""Perks and benefits have been changed in the face of awful losses,"" he added and, in the face of losses of Â£4bn during the pandemic, ""BA has not been able to put workers back in the position they were in"". ""It's going to take some time to sort this dispute out. There is no easy compromise here."" Airlines had already been struggling with staff shortages, and now face further disruption after aviationworkers at Heathrow voted to strike. What are the strikes about? Those walking out include 700 British Airways (BA) check-in and ground staff who complain that a 10% pay cut imposed during the pandemic remains - while other BA workers have been given a 10% bonus. But BA dismissed their claims, saying that ""after a deeply difficult two years... these colleagues were offered a 10% payment for this year which was rejected"". Which routes will be affected? The BBC understands that BA - which operates from terminals three and five at the airport - has contingency plans in place, which could include managers dealing with check-ins. However, customers could still potentially face disruption and possibly some cancellations, in particular on routes with several daily flights. The strike dates will be confirmed in the coming days.

"Rescuers struggle to reach Afghans hit by quakeHeavy rain, threadbare resources and rugged terrain hamper rescuers after a quake killed 1,000 people.","This video can not be played WATCH: Body removed from rubble after deadly earthquake hits Afghanistan Doctors in Afghanistan have told the BBC that many children may have been killed in Wednesday's earthquake. More than 1,000 people died in the disaster, and heavy rain, threadbare resources and rugged terrain are hampering rescue workers. Unknown numbers were buried in the rubble of ruined, often mud-built homes by the magnitude 6.1 earthquake. One woman in hospital in Paktika province told reporters she had lost 19 family members. ""Seven in one room, five in another, four in another, then three in another, have all been killed in my family,"" she said from her bed. By Wednesday night Taliban officials said search and rescue operations had finished in most places, although in remoter areas some continued still. ""We can't reach the area - networks are too weak,"" a Taliban spokesman was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying earlier. Five beds between 500 at Afghan quake clinic The United Nations is among those scrambling to provide emergency shelter and food aid to remote areas in Paktika. Survivors and rescuers have told the BBC of villages completely destroyed near the epicentre of the quake, of ruined roads and mobile phone towers - and of their fears that the death toll will rise further.  Some 1,500 people were also injured, officials say. The Taliban authorities have called for more international aid. Villagers and rescue workers examine the damage in Bernal district Most of the casualties found so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts of Paktika. Locals report dozens of villages collapsed. ""There was a rumbling and my bed began to shake,"" a survivor called Shabir told the BBC. ""The ceiling fell down. I was trapped, but I could see the sky. My shoulder was dislocated, my head was hurt but I got out. I am sure that seven or nine people from my family, who were in the same room as me, are dead.""

Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) members in general gradesvoted to accept the deal. Workers for the main RMT rail union who are striking today are asking for similar pay rises of 7%. The Merseyside rail operator, which is not involved in the national dispute, is run by Liverpool City Region
Combined Authority, led by Labour Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram. General Secretary Manuel Cortes
described the deal as ""a sensible outcome to a reasonable offer which goes a long way towards keeping pace with the escalating cost of living"". Merseyrail confirmed it had met union representatives âas part of our normal annual pay negotiationsâ. The deal comes afterit was agreed in Marchto give London's Tube workers an 8.4% pay rise. It's worth noting that it's not just rail workers threatening industrial action. Teachers, healthcare workers and even criminal barristers are considering or have approved proposals to strike over pay, conditions and workloads. And this afternoon, hundreds of British Airways check-in staff at Heathrow Airport have voted to go on strike over the summer. Members of the GMB and Unite unions want a 10% pay cut, imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, to be reversed. British Airways has offered them a one-off 10% payment - and says it's extremely disappointed. The vote threatens further disruption for travellers after the Easter break was marred by delays and cancellations. Meanwhile, teachers represented by the National Education Union are also likely to be asked in the autumn term whether they wish to walk out over pay and conditions, amid demands for an inflation-matching pay rise for teachers. And members of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers who prosecute and defend people on trial, have already approved strikes this summer over the government's funding of the criminal justice system. More railway workers are to vote on strikes over pay, conditions and job security. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) served notice to ballot dozens of members at TransPennine Express (TPE), it was announced on Thursday. TPE runs trains across northern England and Scotland. The union is demanding a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies for 2022, no unagreed changes to terms and conditions, and a pay increase which reflects the rising cost of living. The ballot opens on 29 June and closes in mid-July. The TSSA is also balloting its members in Network Rail, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, West Midlands Trains, Avanti West Coast, Northern, LNER, C2C and Great Western Railway (GWR).  Unions should call off the train strikes ""as quickly as possible"", Downing Street says. A No 10 spokesman says there were talks between the RMT and Network Rail today, but ""what we want to see is for the unions to call off the strikes, to continue to negotiate and to come to an agreement with their employer."" ""We don't want to see this strike action to continue for a moment longer than it has to,"" he adds. Asked if this was possible before Saturday's strike, he says: ""That's a question for the unions."" The Government has not been informed of any further rail strikes after this week, the official says. Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland News Correspondent Glasgow Queen Street if far quieter today than normal Here at Queen Street station it's far quieter than you would normally expect it to be at four o'clock in the afternoon. I reckon there are about 30 passengers around the station at the moment. In fact, the four o'clock train to Edinburgh, one of the few trains running from Queen Street this afternoon, was actually cancelled. But that was nothing to do with the industrial action. According to the announcement at the station, there was an obstruction on the line and the 16:30 BST train to Edinburgh would be 15 minutes late because of that. After that there are two more trains to Edinburgh. Clearly there could be problems here with the knock-on effect of that incident continuing. But certainly what I have noticed, compared to the first strike on Tuesday, is there have been far fewer  people turning up at the station. Celestina OlulodeBBC News Rail services
are winding down at Paddington station on day two of the three-day rail
strikes. Services are due to shut down early at 6.30pm. According to
Network Rail, by 11:30am on Thursday footfall at Paddington was down by 70% compared
to the same time last Thursday. Looking across the concourse itâs clear that many
passengers have heeded Network Railâs advice and stayed away. But earlier a number of passengers arrived to catch
trains to the Glastonbury music festival. Bethan arrived one hour earlier to
avoid delays. Special services to Castle Cary, the station nearest to the festival in Pilton, were put on for passengers trying to get to the site.  The lorry crashed onto the tracks in East Lothian Train services in and out of Edinburgh have been delayed after a lorry crashed onto the tracks in East Lothian. The driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital following the accident on the East Coast Main Line between Wallyford and Prestonpans at about 13:30. Services between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh via Falkirk High and Bathgate have been disrupted. Services between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh via Shotts have also been affected. Read more here. Returning to our coverage of the train strikes and we understand more walkouts are ""extremely likely"" if talks between rail bosses and unions continue to fail. Trains ground to a halt across much of England, Wales and Scotland on Thursday, with about half the network closed. RMT boss Mick Lynch has accused the government of blocking a deal, after talks on Wednesday collapsed - but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps called suggestions the government had intervened ""a total lie"". But Network Rail said it was the RMT, not the government which stalled latest negotiations. The rail strikes come as hundreds of British Airways workers at Heathrow Airport have voted to go on strike over pay, raising the threat of a summer of disruption. Lynch meanwhile has said talks would continue and members would be consulted to see ""if and when there needs to be a new phase of industrial action"" on the railways. A third day of train strikes is currently set for Saturday 25 June. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent What's unusual is that this ballot wasn't about pay increases, people saying their pay should go up to keep pace with the cost of living, this was about workers at Heathrow, mainly female check-in staff, part-time workers. They wanted to go back to pay levels they had before the pandemic - if you remember, a couple of years ago, the aviation industry was in crisis, and as a result, the airline puts a lot of pressure on staff to accept pay reductions. That happened at British Airways and these staff, about 700 of them, had to have their pay cut by around 10%.

Now they want it back. British Airways is not doing that, what they did offer was a 10% one-off payment this year while other negotiations continue. The ground crews unions, GMB and Unite, say that's not good enough, they want a commitment that they are going to get back what they lost. BA says the airline industry still isn't back up and running properly yet, there are still problems, itâs still not profitable, it lost Â£4bn over the past two years. Therefore, we have a conflict between two sides and now the workers have decided enough is enough, they're going to go out on strike. When will we see these strikes? There will probably a few days of disruption in the second half of July and then in August. We understand BA has contingency plans, so that's likely to be, for example, managers operating check in desks, but we'll have to wait and see how serious any disruption is going to be. British Airways should make
contingency plans to minimise disruption and refund passengers whose flights are impacted by strikes, the prime minister's spokesman says. ""This is obviously a matter for British Airways and the
unions and we would strongly encourage both to come together to
find a settlement,"" the spokesman continues. He says further disruption will only ""add to the misery
being faced by passengers at airports.""  British Airways says it's ""extremely disappointed"" after 700 workers based at Heathrow voted in favor of strike action in a dispute over pay. Unions say the action was due to a 10% pay cut imposed during the peak of the pandemic not being reinstated. In a statement, BA says: ""Despite the extremely challenging environment and losses of more than Â£4bn, we made an offer of a [one off] 10% payment which was accepted by the majority of other colleagues."" They said that included staff from ground operations, engineering and cabin crew. A spokesperson says: ""We are fully committed to work together to find a solution, because to deliver for our customers and rebuild our business we have to work as a team."" BA says it will update customers on what the decision will mean for them. Heathrow has already been hit by chaos this summer The looming strikes at Heathrow will only feed into the ""uncertainty"" of travel this summer, says one industry expert, who blames airlines  for ""not paying enough"" to staff. Paul Charles, who runs a PR agency specialising in luxury travel, said airlines in general were ""really struggling to deliver the quality of service needed"" at a time of flight cancellations, staff shortages and caps on flights. ""The demand is there,"" he told the BBC, but the airlines were ""not paying enough and therefore not attracting enough staff"". ""Wages are not seen as competitive,"" said Mr Charles, which led many to abandon their jobs during the pandemic in favour of other industries. ""Perks and benefits have been changed in the face of awful losses,"" he added and, in the face of losses of Â£4bn during the pandemic, ""BA has not been able to put workers back in the position they were in"". ""It's going to take some time to sort this dispute out. There is no easy compromise here."" Airlines had already been struggling with staff shortages, and now face further disruption after aviationworkers at Heathrow voted to strike. What are the strikes about? Those walking out include 700 British Airways (BA) check-in and ground staff who complain that a 10% pay cut imposed during the pandemic remains - while other BA workers have been given a 10% bonus. But BA dismissed their claims, saying that ""after a deeply difficult two years... these colleagues were offered a 10% payment for this year which was rejected"". Which routes will be affected? The BBC understands that BA - which operates from terminals three and five at the airport - has contingency plans in place, which could include managers dealing with check-ins. However, customers could still potentially face disruption and possibly some cancellations, in particular on routes with several daily flights. The strike dates will be confirmed in the coming days.

How did passengers cope in first strike?,"A normally busy Euston station was empty on Tuesday morning All the advance publicity and media coverage about the biggest national rail strike in decades seems to have had an impact - with many passengers apparently heeding advice not to travel by train. During the peak commuting time on Tuesday morning, many station concourses around the country were virtually empty. At Manchester Piccadilly just before 07:00 BST there were more pigeons than people and the station shutters remained down, while it was a similar picture at Liverpool Lime Street as picket lines formed. At Glasgow Central station, normally Scotland's busiest, the departure board and the concourse were empty at 05:30. ScotRail, which is not involved in the strike, cancelled 90% of its trains because it relies on staff from Network Rail. In Wales fewer than 10% of normal services were running. In 2020 it was estimated that only 3% of commuting in Wales was by rail, compared with 10% on average across Britain and 45% in London. However drivers were warned to expect a surge in vehicles on the roads - and there were reports of slow traffic across Wales during the rush hour. In London, there were very few people at normally heaving stations like Euston and King's Cross. But passengers who had chosen to travel were aware of the strikes, were well prepared and leaving extra time for their journeys. Separately in the capital, London Underground workers were on strike over pensions and job losses, with services suspended on the vast majority of lines. According to Transport for London, by mid-morning the Tube had seen 80,000 entries and exits across the network, 95% down on last Tuesday. In London, Santander Cycle hire had surged by 46% by 10:00 on Tuesday compared with the previous day, while bus journeys were up by 7% as people sought alternative means to get around. Some of those who opted to travel by taxi found themselves paying more. Uber users in London saw a surge in prices, with a three-mile journey from Paddington to King's Cross estimated to cost Â£27 at 08:45, according to the PA news agency. But, by 10:30 the charge had dropped down to just under Â£15. Ride-hailing apps like Uber raise the price of journeys when demand spikes. The AA said there were ""traffic hotspots"" on the M25 in south-east England, and on roads near London, Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow as people switched from the train to the roads. Location technology firm TomTom said congestion levels at 11:00 were higher than at the same time last week in several urban areas. However, the National Traffic Operations Centre for National Highways said motorways across England were marginally quieter than a normal Tuesday. It spotted a busier peak at about 09:00 when there were reports of congestion around city centre car parks, but after that the situation became become quieter than normal. What days are the strikes and which trains are running? How much are rail workers paid? 'Strikes have left my stag do plans in ruins' One new factor in this rail strike was that many commuters are now set up to work from home if they need to. So, although some bosses will no doubt have found it frustrating, it means the impact isn't as serious for some workers as it might have been in the past. Frank Bird, a senior network planner at Highways England, said in the post-pandemic world people had come up with a much better Plan B when they can't get into work, and for many that means working from home rather than driving. Not everyone can do their job remotely, and not everyone has the option to drive when trains aren't available. Vivienne O'Connor, who lives in Ireland, managed to get the last train on Monday night to get to her cousin's funeral in England. After getting the ferry to Holyhead, she caught the train to Wrexham, where a friend picked her up and drove her to Shropshire. But now the strikes have left her stranded. ""The original intention was I was going to travel back after the funeral on Thursday, but obviously that can't now happen because there's no trains,"" she says. ""So I've had to rejiggle my arrangements. I'm staying with my brother - for who knows how many days until it gets sorted."" Vivienne O'Connor isn't sure how she'll get home from her cousin's funeral Meanwhile, businesses have also been affected by commuters choosing to work from home. Fabio Manara, who owns a coffee shop in Debden station in Essex, says the strikes have caused him to lose 80% of his business on Tuesday. The shop is open six days a week and he expects to lose Â£300 per day due to the strikes. ""I opened two months before the pandemic and got help back then, but there's been so many strikes since then it makes it very hard,"" he said. Another coffee shop owner, John Kelly, who is based at in Farncombe station in Surrey, says the strikes have been ""disastrous"" for him. ""70% of our business is from commuters and if we haven't got thatâ¦ we're making coffee for ourselves and twiddling our thumbs,"" he says. ""It's quite soul-destroying to be honest."" This video can not be played John Kelly says the rail strikes are ""soul-destroying"" for his business There's also a ripple effect on businesses based in city centres from workers staying home and leisure plans changing, with the hospitality industry among the worst hit. UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls warned the strikes could cost the sector up to Â£540m. Footfall in central London was 27% lower than last Tuesday as of 13:00, according to retail tracker Springboard. In city centres outside the capital, it was 11% lower. However, footfall in outer London was less impacted, with a fall of only 6%, while for market towns it was down 2%. Diane Wehrle, Insights Director at Springboard, suggested the data reflected how it was easier for people working from home to visit their local high streets during the day. The RMT union, whose members are striking, has apologised to passengers for the disruption. However general secretary Mick Lynch says the union's members are ""are leading the way for all workers in this country who are sick and tired of having their pay and conditions slashed"". The RMT and railway employers are due to hold fresh talks on Wednesday aimed at resolving the dispute, with the government and railway companies arguing the industry must modernise working practices to survive. But with more strikes scheduled for Thursday and Saturday - and the rest of the week also affected due to the knock-on impact - the disruption for passengers is set to continue.

New Tesla plants losing billions of dollars - Musk,"Elon Musk says Tesla's new factories in Germany and the US are ""losing billions of dollars"" due to battery shortages and supply disruptions in China. The multi-billionaire also called the plants in Berlin and Austin, Texas ""gigantic money furnaces"". Covid-19 lockdowns in China this year, including in Shanghai where Tesla has a huge factory, have made it increasingly difficult for manufacturers to operate. In recent weeks Mr Musk has been warning of job cuts at the firm. ""Both Berlin and Austin factories are gigantic money furnaces right now. It's really like a giant roaring sound, which is the sound of money on fire,"" said Mr Musk, who is the electric vehicle maker's chief executive. The plants are ""losing billions of dollars right now. There's a ton of expense and hardly any output,"" he added in an interview with the Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley, a company-recognised club. Elon Musk hints at potential Twitter layoffs Musk threatens to walk away from Twitter deal Mr Musk said the so-called gigafactories have been struggling to increase production since they were opened earlier this year. Tesla's site in Austin currently produces a ""tiny"" number of cars, partly because some components for its batteries were ""stuck"" at a Chinese port ""with no one to actually move it"", he said. ""This is all going to get fixed real fast but it requires a lot of attention,"" Mr Musk added. The interview was recorded at the end of last month but this part of the conversation was only posted on Wednesday. Authorities in China locked down a number of its cities earlier this year in response to a surge in Covid-19 infections. Tough restrictions were imposed on the movement of people and materials including in the financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai. Mr Musk said the shutdown of Shanghai was ""very, very difficult"" for Tesla, which reportedly halted most of its production at its 'gigafactory' in the city for weeks. The site will largely be closed again for two weeks next month for upgrading works, according to the Reuters news agency, which cited an internal memo. This is aimed at boosting the site's output, bringing it closer to the company's goal of the plant producing 22,000 cars every week, the report said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Last week, the company raised the price of its whole range of cars in the US by almost 5%, as the cost of raw materials including aluminium and lithium rose. This week, Mr Musk said Tesla planned to shed 3.5% of its global workforce after earlier saying that he had a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy. Meanwhile, German carmaker BMW said on Thursday that it had formally begun production at its new $2.2bn (Â£1.8bn) facility in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang. BMW said the plant, which is its third in China, will increase its annual output in the country from 700,000 to 830,000. You may also be interested in: This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?

Rescuers struggle to reach Afghans hit by quake,"This video can not be played WATCH: Body removed from rubble after deadly earthquake hits Afghanistan Doctors in Afghanistan have told the BBC that many children may have been killed in Wednesday's earthquake. More than 1,000 people died in the disaster, and heavy rain, threadbare resources and rugged terrain are hampering rescue workers. Unknown numbers were buried in the rubble of ruined, often mud-built homes by the magnitude 6.1 earthquake. One woman in hospital in Paktika province told reporters she had lost 19 family members. ""Seven in one room, five in another, four in another, then three in another, have all been killed in my family,"" she said from her bed. By Wednesday night Taliban officials said search and rescue operations had finished in most places, although in remoter areas some continued still. ""We can't reach the area - networks are too weak,"" a Taliban spokesman was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying earlier. Five beds between 500 at Afghan quake clinic The United Nations is among those scrambling to provide emergency shelter and food aid to remote areas in Paktika. Survivors and rescuers have told the BBC of villages completely destroyed near the epicentre of the quake, of ruined roads and mobile phone towers - and of their fears that the death toll will rise further.  Some 1,500 people were also injured, officials say. The Taliban authorities have called for more international aid. Villagers and rescue workers examine the damage in Bernal district Most of the casualties found so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts of Paktika. Locals report dozens of villages collapsed. ""There was a rumbling and my bed began to shake,"" a survivor called Shabir told the BBC. ""The ceiling fell down. I was trapped, but I could see the sky. My shoulder was dislocated, my head was hurt but I got out. I am sure that seven or nine people from my family, who were in the same room as me, are dead."" A mother of six who was badly injured in the earthquake told the BBC many in her village had been killed, including seven of her own family members. ""We are very poor. We cannot reconstruct our homes again,"" she said. ""We have nothing to eat."" All her family's food supplies are buried under the rubble. ""There is nowhere to go,"" she added. ""I demand the Taliban rebuild our houses."" All the villagers we meet want to show us the damage to their homes done by the earthquake. They have lost their loved ones, alongside homes and livelihoods. Possessions are scattered amongst the debris: blankets, pots, beds stick out from the rubble. The villagers want the world to see how their lives have been devastated, but also more tangibly, to have their names added to aid distribution schemes. A number of aid agencies have reached the scene but it's clear more help is needed. One man we meet has just arrived back in his village from Pakistan where he works as a labourer. Twenty members of his family were killed in the earthquake including his daughter. Another, elderly man now finds himself responsible for his five young grandchildren - after their father died. The valleys here are overflowing with tragedy. Many of the families are now living in makeshift tents, flanked by the rubble of the homes they had worked so hard to construct. TheTaliban run the country:The hardline Islamists took over Afghanistan last year, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition There's a food crisis:More than a third of people can't meet basic needs and the economy is struggling, as foreign aid and cash dried up when the Taliban took power Women's rights are restricted: They have been ordered to cover their faces in public and teenage girls have not been allowed to go to school Read more about Afghanistan The deadliest earthquake to strike the country in two decadesis a major challenge for the Taliban, the Islamist movement which regained power last year after the Western-backed government collapsed. The earthquake struck early on Wednesday about 44km (27 miles) from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. Afghanistan is in the midst of a humanitarian and economic crisis, and Abdul Qahar Balkhi, a senior Taliban official, said the government was ""financially unable to assist the people to the extent that is needed"". Images show true scale of devastation in Afghanistan 'Every street you go you hear mourning' The head of the UN, AntÃ³nio Guterres said the agency had ""fully mobilised"" over the disaster. But Mohammad Amin Huzaifa, head of information for Paktika province, told AFP it was proving ""very difficult"" for rescuers to reach areas ""affected by floods because of heavy rains last night"". Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it is located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Over the past decade more than 7,000 people have been killed in earthquakes in the country, the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports. There are an average of 560 deaths a year from earthquakes. Even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan's emergency services were stretched to deal with natural disasters - with few aircraft and helicopters available to rescuers. According to the UN, 93% of households in Afghanistan suffer food insecurity. Lucien Christen, from the Red Cross, said Afghanistan's ""dire economic situation"" meant ""they're [Afghan families] not able to put food on the table"".

Law change would allow agency staff to cover strikes,"The second day of rail strikes is under way after talks between unions and rail bosses broke down Plans are under way to change the law to enable employers to use agency staff to cover staffing gaps during strikes, the government has announced Ministers say the measure, which needs Parliament's approval, would limit the impact of future strikes. But opposition parties and unions have criticised the plan, arguing it would undermine pay and working conditions. It comes asrail strikes in Britain resumedafter talks between unions and rail bosses broke down on Wednesday. Rail workers are holding their second strike this week - the largest action of its kind in decades - in a dispute over jobs, pay and conditions, with just 20% of services expected to run. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union is calling for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the cost of living crisis, but employers have offered a maximum of 3%, on condition that the union accepts new working practices. Agency staff could cover strikes under law change Thursday rail strike to go ahead as talks collapse Disruption for millions on rail strike's first day The government argues that changing laws that were introduced in the 1970s will keep services running during strikes by giving businesses the freedom to access agency staff quickly. The changes - which would apply across England, Scotland and Wales - would cover employers in both the private and public sector and would likely come into effect in mid-July. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng accused trade unions of holding the country to ""ransom"" by bringing businesses and public services to a halt. He said: ""Repealing these 1970s-era restrictions will give businesses freedom to access fully-skilled staff at speed, all while allowing people to get on with their lives uninterrupted to help keep the economy ticking."" Network Rail said the proposal was ""welcome news"" that could help it provide a better service during strike days if the dispute ""drags on"". ""While key safety-critical roles require many months of training, there are many other roles where they could be used, such as in security operations, which would make a real difference."" But the Trades Union Congress said the plan would undermine the right to strike, adding that bringing in less qualified agency staff to deliver services would endanger public safety. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""The government should be getting people around the table to find a fair resolution to this rail dispute. ""But ministers are more interested in cynically picking a fight with unions than reaching a negotiated settlement."" Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said it would undermine pay and working conditions and risk public safety. The Liberal Democrats' transport spokesperson, Sarah Olney, said the proposals were ""too little too late"" to stop the disruption caused by rail strikes. Passengers across Britain faced journeys hours longer than usual and surging road traffic on Tuesday Meanwhile, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi has said a teachers' strike would be ""unforgiveable"". The National Education Union this week warned that it would hold a ballot on industrial action if its demands for an ""inflation-plus"" pay rise were not met. Writing in theDaily Telegraph,external, Mr Zahawi said a strike would be ""irresponsible"" given the disruption children and young people had endured as a result of the Covid pandemic. Mr Zahawi said: ""Young people have suffered more disruption than any generation that's gone before them, and to compound that now, as recovery is in full swing and families are thinking about their big step following school or college, would be unforgivable and unfair.""

Five Welsh routes to run as rail strike hits again,"There are no train services west of Cardiff or north of Merthyr on strike days Just five train services are running in Wales as the rail strikes enter a third day. Passengers in Wales have been affected asthousands of frontline rail staff strike againwith no trains west of Cardiff or north of Merthyr Tydfil. Routes that are running, including the south Wales to London main line, are running a reduced service as less than 10% of the network in Wales operates. Travellers are also being affected by theM48 Severn Bridge weekendclosure. About 50 people have taken part in a protest in Cardiff in support of RMT members. About 50 people took part in a protest in Cardiff in support of RMT members Rail strike union urges government to engage in talks UK rail passengers hit by third day of strikes Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? Trains started at 07:30 BST and finish at 18:30 across most of the rail network on days of industrial action, which were called by the RMT union after talks over pay and redundancies fell through. Aspecial timetable,externalhas been published and Network Rail has said passengers should travel by train only if necessary. Rail companies have also warned passengers that journeys on Sunday and even Monday could be affected by the walkout. The expected knock-on disruption is because of too few staff working overnight and morning shifts not clocking on until after the usual morning timetable has begun. On the south Wales to London mainline, there are just nine trains running in each direction, but trains are operating only from Cardiff Central. Stations between the Welsh capital and Swansea have no services. GWR's south Wales mainline service to London will only run to and from Cardiff on strike days rather than Swansea Those directGWR services between London Paddington and Cardiff,externalwill be one an hour, not the usual two, with the first service leaving each terminus later than normal. A service between Cardiff and Westbury in Wiltshire - linking south Wales with Bristol and Bath - also ran a reduced service. Theonly other trains operating in Wales are valley line services,externalfrom Treherbert, Aberdare and Merthyr Tydfil, but they have been reduced to an hourly service and terminate at Radyr, with a bus taking passengers to Cardiff Central.

Valley line routes to Rhymney, Coryton and Cardiff Bay and Cardiff's City Line are suspended as signalling for those lines is operated by Network Rail. The only train services in Wales on strike days will be running out of Cardiff Central, Wales' busiest station TfW services connecting Aberystwyth with the Midlands and linking Cardiff with Manchester and north Wales and Manchester are also not running - so racegoers attending Saturday's meeting at Chester have been warned there areno services running to and from the city,external. Services between north Wales and London are suspended on strike days asAvanti West Coast will only run reduced services,externalbetween Euston and Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Preston and Glasgow. CrossCountry trains between south Wales and Birmingham, and Nottingham and Bristol have also been suspended. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

TfW has warned passengers that services that are running are expected to be ""very busy"" while GWR said people faced ""severe disruption"" and asked them ""to only travel by rail if absolutely necessary."" Across the UK, four out of five trains will not run during the strikes, with 4,500 services operating compared to the usual 20,000. Rail workers, such as maintenance staff, signallers and operations teams, are in dispute. As well as Saturday's rail strikes, theM48 Severn Bridge is shut from Fridayat 19:00 until Monday at 06:00 for essential maintenance work to start inspecting the bridge's suspension cables. The M48 Severn Bridge will be shut until Monday morning due to prepare for essential maintenance work The strike and bridge closure means Angie Ruston has to leave for work more than two hours before she clocks on. The 58-year-old, who works at an artificial intelligence project in Bristol, has to be at her nearest bus stop in Chepstow for just after 07:45 to get into work for 10:00. Angie Ruston's commute to work from Chepstow to Bristol is more than twice as long on Saturday ""It's a nightmare, a perfect storm for me,"" she said. ""I'd have thought whoever runs the bridge would have known there is a rail strike on, anticipate the possible excess traffic and put the closure off. ""It seems stupid to do it at the same time as the rail strike, there's no forward thinking. ""My journey to work normally takes me less than 50 minutes, it'll take me two hours on Saturday. It's not ideal so while I'm working between 10am and 3pm, I'll be out the house between half seven and 5pm. ""But on Sunday it's worse because there will be no buses or trains that get me into work by 10:00 so unfortunately I'll be late."" Ilsehar Hopcroft has said she has cancelled a family get-together on Saturday because of travel disruption The double disruptions are not just affecting people's work but family plans too as Ilsehar Hopcroft has cancelled a family get-together. ""I had families coming from Norfolk and mum was going to come from Cardiff, but we've had to put that off,"" said the 23-year-old mum-of-one from Chepstow. ""It's quite frustrating as Saturday was quite important because of distance and Covid lately, we don't see them very often. It is having a huge impact on people."" Chelsea Hopkins said it took her almost seven hours to get home from work on Wednesday evening after her commute was affected when alorry fire closed the M4 Severn Bridge. Now the marketing manager, who lives 10 miles from Chepstow on the Welsh side of the bridge, said she was doing more logistics planning to meet a colleague at her work in Bristol to travel together to an event in Coventry. ""The bridge closures always seem to be incredibly inconvenient at the height of tourist season, during commute times or on school holidays,"" said the 30-year-old. Chelsea Hopkins says although the disruption is frustrating ""it has to happen"" ""I certainly support the rail strikers and rail is usually my backup plan. The traffic network around the bridges is pretty fragile, like the lorry fire on the M4 on Wednesday which caused tailbacks. ""It'll be frustrating but it has to happen, perhaps we can all have a weekend at home enjoying the area we live in - apart from those working"". National Highways said it was ""not anticipating a significant impact"" from the M48 Severn Bridge closure - especially with M4 Severn Bridge remaining open - after data showed a 4% rise in traffic on the first day of the rail strike on Tuesday. A usual five-mile, 10 minute trip between Chepstow to Aust will be 31 miles and take about 40 minutes on the weekend due to the M48 Severn Bridge closure ""We understand this work may cause some inconvenience and disruption, but we are making every effort to ensure the impact on drivers is kept to a minimum,"" said Chris Pope of National Highways. ""These pre-planned inspections are vital to allow us to understand the current condition of the suspension cables."" Roads in Wales and Scotland especially are expected to be busier as most railway lines in both nations are shut during the biggest rail walkout for more than 30 years. Motorists are warned to expect Wales' busiest routes to be congested on rail strike days The AA predicted a surge in traffic as train passengers switch to road transport with the worst affected roads likely to be main motorway arteries. The RMT union has said members working for train companies have been subjected to ""pay freezes, threats to jobs and attacks on their terms and conditions"". How much are rail workers paid? Huge rail strike will cause 'misery for millions' Rail dispute still resolvable, says industry boss Network Rail plans to cut 2,500 maintenance jobs as it tries to make Â£2bn of savings over the next two years. The RMT said the jobs were safety critical and cutting them will make accidents more likely, so 40,000 rail workers have walked out over three days this week Network Rail said it would not consider any changes that would make the railways less safe and that modernisation was needed. Most of Transport for Wales services are suspended on Saturday due to the rail strike RMT members are striking and they include people working for Network Rail, which maintains the railways throughout Britain, including Wales. However, TfW - now owned by the Welsh government - is not in dispute with the unions although it has warned of disruption because its trains use railways run by Network Rail. Welsh Education Minister Jeremy Miles said the Labour Welsh government was ""obviously pleased"" staff at TfW were not striking. Transport for Wales is owned by the Labour-run Welsh Government, which is more union friendly ""Clearly the strikes elsewhere will have a significant disruptive impact in Wales and we are asking the UK government to do everything to avoid that disruption,"" Mr Miles toldBBC Politics Wales. ""When people are put in the position that the UK government have, people don't have many options. Nobody wants to see strikes, not even the unions, but the UK government needs to now step up."" But ConservativeMember of the Senedd(MS) Tom Giffard said the unions were ""stuck in the past"" so it was ""really unfortunate these strikes are going ahead."" ""Network Rail and the [UK government's] Department for Transport had said that negotiations had barely started before the unions started balloting to strike... and the timing of this strike was just to maximise disruption as best it could,"" added the South Wales West MS. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: ""If we cannot provide a service for customers due to strike action then we will refund customers."" It has not decided whether customers worried about disruption could cancel trips in advance and get refunds. The National Rail website suggests,externalthere may be options such as switching to a different operator or travelling on another date. But it said customers would not be compensated for things such as hotel stays. Season ticket holders will be able to apply for a refund for the days affected.

National Gallery to lend famous art for first time,"Monet's The Water-Lily Pond has been loaned to York Art Gallery The National Gallery has sent some of its finest masterpieces around the UK to mark its 200th anniversary. Twelve famous artworks including Constable's The Hay Wain, Botticelli's Venus and Mars, and Renoir's The Umbrellas have travelled across the UK. Simultaneous exhibitions opened on Friday at 12 institutions, putting more than half of the population within an hour of one of the masterpieces. Some of the paintings have never been loaned by the gallery before. The Â£95m bicentenary plans also include a blockbuster Van Gogh show, the creation of a new digital gallery, a UK road trip of art workshops, and a refurbishment of the National Gallery site at London's Trafalgar Square. Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller has been commissioned to create a work celebrating 200 years of public art. The National Gallery will also host a party to celebrate its birthday weekend, with live music from Jools Holland, DJ performances and interactive art workshops. The gallery will stage its first exhibition of the paintings of Van Gogh this autumn A Young Woman standing at a Virginal - Vermeer (National Galleries Scotland: National, Edinburgh) The Supper at Emmaus - Caravaggio (Ulster Museum, Belfast) The Rokeby Venus - VelÃ¡zquez (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) The Fighting Temeraire - JMW Turner (Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne) The Water-Lily Pond - Monet (York Art Gallery) Self Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria - Artemisia Gentileschi (Ikon Gallery, Birmingham) The Umbrellas - Renoir (Leicester Museum & Art Gallery) The Hay Wain - Constable (Bristol Museum & Art Gallery) The Stonemason's Yard - Canaletto (National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth) Venus and Mars - Botticelli (The Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge) The Wilton Diptych - unknown (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) Self Portrait at the Age of 34 - Rembrandt (Brighton Museum & Art Gallery) The National Gallery was set up 200 years ago by Parliament to create a collection of paintings for the use of the public. But for much of the past two centuries, the only way that the public could see the art was in person in London. In recent decades, the gallery has stepped up its efforts to share its art more widely across the nation. After it bought a self-portrait by acclaimed 17th Century Italian artist Artemisia Gentileschi in 2018, the paintingwent on a tour of the UK, not to museums and galleries but to places where different kinds of people might actually see it. The work spent time in a GP's surgery in Yorkshire, a girls' school in Newcastle, a library in Glasgow and even a women's prison in Surrey. Inmates in a women's prison had the chance to see Artemisia Gentileschi's Self Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria (about 1615-17) in 2018 Two of the 12 masterpieces in the latest scheme have never been loaned by the National Gallery before - Botticelli's Venus and Mars and the 14th Century Wilton Diptych, regarded as one of the greatest pictures ever produced in the UK. Venus and Mars by Botticelli (circa 1485) is on loan for the first time The work known as The Wilton Diptych (about 1395-9) is also on loan for the first time But with only 12 paintings out of a collection now totalling around 2,400 being lent for the NG200: National Treasures exhibitions, the gallery's plans could be accused of being small-scale in outlook. And of the 12 on loan, only one is by a woman - Gentileschi's Self Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The Umbrellas by Renoir (circa 1881) is on show in Leicester Dr Gabriele Finaldi, director of the National Gallery, said it was ""the most ambitious, national programme we have ever undertaken"". It is ""all about reaching out right across the nation"", he said, adding: ""A significant amount of the activities are in regional locations and are mostly free. We also want to reach out globally and promote the UK.""

EU leaders to back Ukraine as a candidate to join,"Ukrainians waited outside the EU summit building for the leaders to decide on their country's status Ukraine and Moldova have both been granted EU candidate status, President of the European Council Charles Michel has announced. ""Today marks a crucial step on your path towards the EU,"" Mr Michel said, describing the European Council's decision as a ""historic moment"". Ukraine applied days after the Russian invasion in February, and the process moved at a record speed. Its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, hailed Thursday's decision. ""It's a unique and historical moment in UA[Ukraine]-EU relations...""he tweeted,external. ""Ukraine's future is within the EU."" The mayor of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, former boxer Vitali Klitschko, paid an emotional tribute to his fellow citizens resisting the invasion. ""We paid a very high price for this chance,"" he wrote on Telegram. ""Yes, we still have a lot to do on the way to the European family. ""But I am sure that Ukraine will do everything necessary, fulfil all the conditions and pass the necessary laws. Because otherwise our state has no future. Indeed, our best defenders are dying for it."" Candidate status is the first official step towards EU membership. But it can take many years to join and there's no guarantee of success. The European Commission president said the accession process would be ""merit-based"" and ""by the book"", and that formal negotiations would not begin until conditional reforms are carried out. These include bolstering the rule of law, and fighting corruption. The Commission is due to take stock at the end of 2022. The step is undoubtedly a big moment for Ukraine, and a popular one. How might Russia react if Ukraine joins the EU? While Moldova's application was accepted, a third former Soviet state, Georgia, has still to qualify for candidacy. Mr Michel said that the Council recognised the country's ""European perspective"" and was ""ready to grant candidate status once the outstanding priorities are addressed"". Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili tweeted,externalthat her country was ""ready to work with determination over the next months to reach the candidate status"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said all three countries were ""part of our European family"". ""This decision strengthens us all,""she tweeted,external. ""It strengthens Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, in the face of Russian imperialism. And it strengthens the EU. Because it shows once again to the world that we are united and strong in the face of external threats."" President Zelensky spoke of his country's desire for candidate status in almost every speech over the past week. He knows that starting down the path of EU membership will permanently shift Ukraine out of Russia's sphere of influence. Four EU leaders travelled to Kyiv last Thursday to give their blessing to Ukraine's bid for candidacy Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told reporters the EU's political backing was very important for Ukrainians: ""This is the least we can provide for them."" Outside the summit building, activist Anna Melenchuk from Kyiv told the BBC: ""People I know are dying every day at the hands of Russian soldiers. This is why it's so important to have the European Union's support."" It was pro-EU protests that ousted Ukraine's Russia-backed President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. That event in turn led to the annexation of Crimea and the separatist uprisings, the events that Ukrainians see as the start of the current war. The Kremlin knew this was on the cards and has already been acting as if it's no big deal. Last week in St Petersburg, President Vladimir Putin claimed he had ""nothing against"" Ukraine's possible membership of the European Union: ""It's their sovereign decision to join economic unions or not."" He said it, but did he mean it? It is hard to believe Russia's president would sit back and watch the country he invaded join the European Union. How might Russia react if Ukraine joins the EU? President Putin once described Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people, a single whole"" and views Ukraine as a territory that, historically, belongs to Russia. The Russian invasion is widely seen as his attempt to force Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit, and he shows no sign of ending the offensive. EU candidate status for Ukraine sends a strong message to Moscow: that neither Kyiv nor Brussels accepts the Putin vision of a new European order. But he will be aware that the road from candidate status to EU member is a long one. Along the way Ukraine will face plenty of hurdles - quite likely many put there by Russia. The long process of joining the EU frustrated Western Balkan leaders at a separate Brussels summit on Thursday. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama warned Kyiv to be under no illusions: ""North Macedonia is a candidate [for] 17 years if I have not lost count, Albania eight, so welcome to Ukraine."" North Macedonian Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski expressed his ""dissatisfaction"" at the lack of progress in their own bids to join the EU. Bulgaria is effectively blocking North Macedonia and Albania's membership bids while other countries have yet to make the necessary reforms. Georgians took part in a ""March for Europe"" on Monday night, but the Commission said Georgia was not ready for candidate status Some EU diplomats have previously voiced concerns that giving Ukraine candidate status could offer false hope. French President Emmanuel Macron said in May that the prospect of membership was decades away and the Nato secretary general has warned the conflict could last years. ""We do not accept the idea of the queue,"" Ukraine's EU envoy told the BBC, pointing to work carried out since the EU and Ukraine signed an association agreement in 2014. As well as deciding on candidate status, EU leaders were also due to discuss food security in light of Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports, condemned by the EU's foreign policy chief this week as a war crime. They were also considering President Macron's proposal for a wider ""European Political Community"", to include countries waiting to join the EU or even those that have left, which would currently include the UK. Although a number of EU diplomats have rejected the idea as half-baked, the Ukrainian ambassador did not dismiss the idea out of hand. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said her preference would be to build on existing structures such as the G7 and Nato.

More cash wanted to help older people manage pain,"Age Cymru runs Tai Chi classes to help people manage their conditions Exercise classes for older people waiting for treatment for muscle conditions should get more cash, a charity has said. Waiting lists rose to more than 707,000 in April, with the latest figures on Thursday showing two solid years of growth since the pandemic. Now Age Cymru wants to see long-term funding for schemes allowing more people to ""wait well"" for treatment. The Welsh government said funding was helping to offer a range of services. Orthopaedics and opthalmology are the areas with the largest numbers waiting and Age Cymru has warned more older people are ""eating into their savings"" by turning to private healthcare because they struggle to access NHS services. Numbers of patient pathways in orthopaedics rose slightly overall in April, while those waiting more than nine months for treatment rose to more than 53,650. Opthalmology lists rose again, to 84,563 waiting for treatment, with 38,256 waiting more than nine months and 8,803 more than a year. The charity's annual survey findings showed almost two-thirds of people had problems or a negative experience related to their treatment. Many said their physical wellbeing had irreversibly changed, with others worried about making ends meet as a result of turning to private healthcare. Heather Ferguson from Age Cymru says funding for more schemes will allow others to stay well while waiting for treatment Heather Ferguson, head of policy and projects at Age Cymru, said their Tai Chi classes for the over-50s - funded by the Welsh government - had helped many people manage their conditions. ""It has a fantastic preventative role,"" she said, as well as ""a real impact on their mental and physical wellbeing."" But with more people potentially facing years on waiting lists, Ms Ferguson said ""pain management is going to be a key issue"". ""This type of support is quite patchy across Wales and we'd like it to be more consistent so that people are able to access it at an early stage. ""We're grateful for funding from Welsh government to provide these classes, but what we really need is long-term, sustainable funding through third sector organisations for these to work long term."" Elizabeth Weekley attends regular Tai Chi to help with polymyalgia rheumatica which affects her muscles Elizabeth Weekley attends sessions in Cardiff and has a condition called polymyalgia rheumatica, which affects her muscles. ""I've been on steroids for 10 years and was gradually getting less mobile. When I first started I used to crawl upstairs. Now I can run up the stairs,"" she said. ""I'm not saying it's all Tai Chi, but it certainly helps."" Madeleine Elliott says gentle movements in Tai Chi help her fibromyalgia Madeleine Elliott, 73, said her biggest health challenge is fibromyalgia, which causes her muscle pain and chronic fatigue. She said the class cannot take that away, but certainly helps. ""Things happen unfortunately with age, and once you reach a certain period you've got to find ways to help yourself,"" she said. ""Otherwise you end up doing very little. ""I've fallen a few times recently - a little clumsiness - but this helps bring your balance back."" Tai Chi classes in Cardiff, run by Age Cymru Linda Loveless said she's been waiting a year for steroid injections to help with a spinal problem. ""I find coming regularly does help - I'm in pain, but by the end of the [hour-long] class it'll be easing off. ""I'm asthmatic too and I find it helps with the breathing - that time to slow down and breathe does you a lot of good."" For 80-year-old Teresa Jegard, the classes have helped manage her osteoporosis and lung condition, but said she also valued the social interaction. ""Even in lockdown we met on the common - you've got to look after yourself, because otherwise it was four walls. Other than shopping, what did you do for two years?"" Volunteer instructor Corina Walker said the free class had members aged between 50 and 92. ""Because the exercises are gentle, you can't really do any harm to yourself and it benefits so many things. It's a joy to see people doing it."" A new mobile cataract hub at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff has quadrupled the number of patients treated each month. The Â£1.4m unit, funded by the Welsh government, has two operating theatres and sits in a former car park, separate to the main hospital building. ""Before the pandemic we were doing about 130 cataract operations per month and currently we're doing about 400 and aiming to increase even more if possible,"" said Seine Ng, clinical director of Cardiff Eye Unit. ""I think the patient journey itself is nicer as well. The ward areas are a lot larger, so patients feel more comfortable."" Seine Ng, clinical director of Cardiff Eye Unit, says many procedures were more complicated because of delays in treatment Dr Ng explained the extra space allows a more efficient flow of patients through the unit, with one patient being prepped while another is in theatre. The overall ophthamology waiting list in Cardiff and Vale in April rose to 15,230, with 7,480 waiting more than nine months. That's a 70% rise on pre-pandemic levels. Dr Ng added that procedures are ""getting more complicated"" because of the waits patients have experienced. ""The cataracts are getting harder and more difficult to take out and so it can take a bit longer than a routine operation. ""A lot of patients are stopping their driving, they can't do things that they normally like to do. ""That all plays into our patients' quality of life. So we're aiming to try and improve that, to try and keep patients independent, driving, working."" A Welsh government spokesman said: ""Our significant investment in planned care recovery is helping health boards across Wales to develop a range of approaches that will help people manage their conditions and access the right support when they need it.""

Day one: How did passengers cope?,"A normally busy Euston station was empty on Tuesday morning All the advance publicity and media coverage about the biggest national rail strike in decades seems to have had an impact - with many passengers apparently heeding advice not to travel by train. During the peak commuting time on Tuesday morning, many station concourses around the country were virtually empty. At Manchester Piccadilly just before 07:00 BST there were more pigeons than people and the station shutters remained down, while it was a similar picture at Liverpool Lime Street as picket lines formed. At Glasgow Central station, normally Scotland's busiest, the departure board and the concourse were empty at 05:30. ScotRail, which is not involved in the strike, cancelled 90% of its trains because it relies on staff from Network Rail. In Wales fewer than 10% of normal services were running. In 2020 it was estimated that only 3% of commuting in Wales was by rail, compared with 10% on average across Britain and 45% in London. However drivers were warned to expect a surge in vehicles on the roads - and there were reports of slow traffic across Wales during the rush hour. In London, there were very few people at normally heaving stations like Euston and King's Cross. But passengers who had chosen to travel were aware of the strikes, were well prepared and leaving extra time for their journeys. Separately in the capital, London Underground workers were on strike over pensions and job losses, with services suspended on the vast majority of lines. According to Transport for London, by mid-morning the Tube had seen 80,000 entries and exits across the network, 95% down on last Tuesday. In London, Santander Cycle hire had surged by 46% by 10:00 on Tuesday compared with the previous day, while bus journeys were up by 7% as people sought alternative means to get around. Some of those who opted to travel by taxi found themselves paying more. Uber users in London saw a surge in prices, with a three-mile journey from Paddington to King's Cross estimated to cost Â£27 at 08:45, according to the PA news agency. But, by 10:30 the charge had dropped down to just under Â£15. Ride-hailing apps like Uber raise the price of journeys when demand spikes. The AA said there were ""traffic hotspots"" on the M25 in south-east England, and on roads near London, Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow as people switched from the train to the roads. Location technology firm TomTom said congestion levels at 11:00 were higher than at the same time last week in several urban areas. However, the National Traffic Operations Centre for National Highways said motorways across England were marginally quieter than a normal Tuesday. It spotted a busier peak at about 09:00 when there were reports of congestion around city centre car parks, but after that the situation became become quieter than normal. What days are the strikes and which trains are running? How much are rail workers paid? 'Strikes have left my stag do plans in ruins' One new factor in this rail strike was that many commuters are now set up to work from home if they need to. So, although some bosses will no doubt have found it frustrating, it means the impact isn't as serious for some workers as it might have been in the past. Frank Bird, a senior network planner at Highways England, said in the post-pandemic world people had come up with a much better Plan B when they can't get into work, and for many that means working from home rather than driving. Not everyone can do their job remotely, and not everyone has the option to drive when trains aren't available. Vivienne O'Connor, who lives in Ireland, managed to get the last train on Monday night to get to her cousin's funeral in England. After getting the ferry to Holyhead, she caught the train to Wrexham, where a friend picked her up and drove her to Shropshire. But now the strikes have left her stranded. ""The original intention was I was going to travel back after the funeral on Thursday, but obviously that can't now happen because there's no trains,"" she says. ""So I've had to rejiggle my arrangements. I'm staying with my brother - for who knows how many days until it gets sorted."" Vivienne O'Connor isn't sure how she'll get home from her cousin's funeral Meanwhile, businesses have also been affected by commuters choosing to work from home. Fabio Manara, who owns a coffee shop in Debden station in Essex, says the strikes have caused him to lose 80% of his business on Tuesday. The shop is open six days a week and he expects to lose Â£300 per day due to the strikes. ""I opened two months before the pandemic and got help back then, but there's been so many strikes since then it makes it very hard,"" he said. Another coffee shop owner, John Kelly, who is based at in Farncombe station in Surrey, says the strikes have been ""disastrous"" for him. ""70% of our business is from commuters and if we haven't got thatâ¦ we're making coffee for ourselves and twiddling our thumbs,"" he says. ""It's quite soul-destroying to be honest."" This video can not be played John Kelly says the rail strikes are ""soul-destroying"" for his business There's also a ripple effect on businesses based in city centres from workers staying home and leisure plans changing, with the hospitality industry among the worst hit. UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls warned the strikes could cost the sector up to Â£540m. Footfall in central London was 27% lower than last Tuesday as of 13:00, according to retail tracker Springboard. In city centres outside the capital, it was 11% lower. However, footfall in outer London was less impacted, with a fall of only 6%, while for market towns it was down 2%. Diane Wehrle, Insights Director at Springboard, suggested the data reflected how it was easier for people working from home to visit their local high streets during the day. The RMT union, whose members are striking, has apologised to passengers for the disruption. However general secretary Mick Lynch says the union's members are ""are leading the way for all workers in this country who are sick and tired of having their pay and conditions slashed"". The RMT and railway employers are due to hold fresh talks on Wednesday aimed at resolving the dispute, with the government and railway companies arguing the industry must modernise working practices to survive. But with more strikes scheduled for Thursday and Saturday - and the rest of the week also affected due to the knock-on impact - the disruption for passengers is set to continue.

EU leaders to back Ukraine as candidate,"Ukrainians waited outside the EU summit building for the leaders to decide on their country's status Ukraine and Moldova have both been granted EU candidate status, President of the European Council Charles Michel has announced. ""Today marks a crucial step on your path towards the EU,"" Mr Michel said, describing the European Council's decision as a ""historic moment"". Ukraine applied days after the Russian invasion in February, and the process moved at a record speed. Its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, hailed Thursday's decision. ""It's a unique and historical moment in UA[Ukraine]-EU relations...""he tweeted,external. ""Ukraine's future is within the EU."" The mayor of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, former boxer Vitali Klitschko, paid an emotional tribute to his fellow citizens resisting the invasion. ""We paid a very high price for this chance,"" he wrote on Telegram. ""Yes, we still have a lot to do on the way to the European family. ""But I am sure that Ukraine will do everything necessary, fulfil all the conditions and pass the necessary laws. Because otherwise our state has no future. Indeed, our best defenders are dying for it."" Candidate status is the first official step towards EU membership. But it can take many years to join and there's no guarantee of success. The European Commission president said the accession process would be ""merit-based"" and ""by the book"", and that formal negotiations would not begin until conditional reforms are carried out. These include bolstering the rule of law, and fighting corruption. The Commission is due to take stock at the end of 2022. The step is undoubtedly a big moment for Ukraine, and a popular one. How might Russia react if Ukraine joins the EU? While Moldova's application was accepted, a third former Soviet state, Georgia, has still to qualify for candidacy. Mr Michel said that the Council recognised the country's ""European perspective"" and was ""ready to grant candidate status once the outstanding priorities are addressed"". Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili tweeted,externalthat her country was ""ready to work with determination over the next months to reach the candidate status"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said all three countries were ""part of our European family"". ""This decision strengthens us all,""she tweeted,external. ""It strengthens Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, in the face of Russian imperialism. And it strengthens the EU. Because it shows once again to the world that we are united and strong in the face of external threats."" President Zelensky spoke of his country's desire for candidate status in almost every speech over the past week. He knows that starting down the path of EU membership will permanently shift Ukraine out of Russia's sphere of influence. Four EU leaders travelled to Kyiv last Thursday to give their blessing to Ukraine's bid for candidacy Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told reporters the EU's political backing was very important for Ukrainians: ""This is the least we can provide for them."" Outside the summit building, activist Anna Melenchuk from Kyiv told the BBC: ""People I know are dying every day at the hands of Russian soldiers. This is why it's so important to have the European Union's support."" It was pro-EU protests that ousted Ukraine's Russia-backed President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. That event in turn led to the annexation of Crimea and the separatist uprisings, the events that Ukrainians see as the start of the current war. The Kremlin knew this was on the cards and has already been acting as if it's no big deal. Last week in St Petersburg, President Vladimir Putin claimed he had ""nothing against"" Ukraine's possible membership of the European Union: ""It's their sovereign decision to join economic unions or not."" He said it, but did he mean it? It is hard to believe Russia's president would sit back and watch the country he invaded join the European Union. How might Russia react if Ukraine joins the EU? President Putin once described Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people, a single whole"" and views Ukraine as a territory that, historically, belongs to Russia. The Russian invasion is widely seen as his attempt to force Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit, and he shows no sign of ending the offensive. EU candidate status for Ukraine sends a strong message to Moscow: that neither Kyiv nor Brussels accepts the Putin vision of a new European order. But he will be aware that the road from candidate status to EU member is a long one. Along the way Ukraine will face plenty of hurdles - quite likely many put there by Russia. The long process of joining the EU frustrated Western Balkan leaders at a separate Brussels summit on Thursday. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama warned Kyiv to be under no illusions: ""North Macedonia is a candidate [for] 17 years if I have not lost count, Albania eight, so welcome to Ukraine."" North Macedonian Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski expressed his ""dissatisfaction"" at the lack of progress in their own bids to join the EU. Bulgaria is effectively blocking North Macedonia and Albania's membership bids while other countries have yet to make the necessary reforms. Georgians took part in a ""March for Europe"" on Monday night, but the Commission said Georgia was not ready for candidate status Some EU diplomats have previously voiced concerns that giving Ukraine candidate status could offer false hope. French President Emmanuel Macron said in May that the prospect of membership was decades away and the Nato secretary general has warned the conflict could last years. ""We do not accept the idea of the queue,"" Ukraine's EU envoy told the BBC, pointing to work carried out since the EU and Ukraine signed an association agreement in 2014. As well as deciding on candidate status, EU leaders were also due to discuss food security in light of Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports, condemned by the EU's foreign policy chief this week as a war crime. They were also considering President Macron's proposal for a wider ""European Political Community"", to include countries waiting to join the EU or even those that have left, which would currently include the UK. Although a number of EU diplomats have rejected the idea as half-baked, the Ukrainian ambassador did not dismiss the idea out of hand. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said her preference would be to build on existing structures such as the G7 and Nato.
