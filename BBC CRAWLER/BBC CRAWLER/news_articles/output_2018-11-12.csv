Tory rebellion over betting machinesMore than 20 Conservative MPs join opposition parties demanding a crackdown be brought forward.UK Politics,"This video can not be played What are fixed-odds betting terminals? The government is facing a rebellion over the timing of its crackdown on fixed-odds gambling machines. Ministers have promised to cut the machines' maximum stake from Â£100 to Â£2 in October 2019 - but some MPs are calling for it to happen sooner. More than 20 Conservatives have joined opposition politicians in trying to bring the change forward to April 2019. They backed an amendment to the Finance Bill, which was tabled on Monday evening. The government said it had consulted widely and considered ""all of the evidence"" before making its decision on a timeframe. It has denied that MPs were led to believe the cut in the maximum stake would come into force in April - but the timing, announced in last month's Budget, has been criticised, with sports minister Tracey Crouch resigning in protest. High stakes for fixed-odds betting machines Pro-betting MPs more persuasive - Crouch 16 MPs receive free tickets from betting firms In her resignation letter, Ms Crouch suggested MPs who supported the betting industry had been ""more persuasive in their arguments"" to senior ministers - and it was this that had convinced them to opt for the later date. Scheduling the change for October means it will happen at the same time as increases in the amount of tax charged to gambling firms who are based abroad but operate in the UK. The government says doing it this way means the public finances will not be hit by a fall in the amount of tax coming in. Fixed-odds betting terminals generate Â£1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry, according to the Gambling Commission, and bring in taxes of Â£400m for the government. The Finance Bill is the legislation that puts the proposals outlined in the Budget into law. Senior Tories Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis and Justine Greening backed the amendment on Monday evening, along with four DUP MPs. Currently, people can bet as much as Â£100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette. Anti-gambling campaigners say the machines let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems. But bookmakers have warned the cut in stakes could lead to thousands of outlets closing. Labour's Carolyn Harris, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on fixed-odds betting terminals, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the MPs were trying to ""force the government into doing the right thing"". The Welsh Labour deputy leader said there was a ""very realistic chance"" that MPs would back bringing in the cut to April 2019 when they discuss the Finance Bill. ""There's a huge feeling in the House that this is the wrong decision and we need to implement it as a matter of urgency,"" she added. The government said it was making ""a significant change that will help stop extreme losses and protect the most vulnerable in our society"". The amendment will be voted on next week.

Apple iPhone sales fears rock Wall StreetThe tech giant's share price fall has wiped more than $40bn off its market value.Business,"Apple chief executive Tim Cook presenting the firm's newest line of products last month Apple shares sank by 5% on Monday, dragging down US markets and wiping more than $40bn (Â£31bn; â¬35bn) off the tech giant's market value. The fall followed a profit warning from some of the firm's suppliers, which exacerbated concerns that demand for iPhones is slowing. The declines made the company one of the biggest losers on the Dow, which closed down 2.3%. The wider S&P 500 ended about 2% lower, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.75%. Technology stocks led the Wall Street sell-off which saw shares in most sectors tumble. Tech firms helped drive many of the stock market gains earlier in the year but now face rising calls for regulatory and tax changes that could hurt their growth. Amazon shares lost more than 4%, Alphabet dropped over 2.5% while Facebook fell 2.3%. Apple's share price fall came after Lumentum, a US manufacturer of facial recognition technology and Apple supplier, said one of its major customers had reduced its shipments. As a result, Lumentum downgraded its sales and profit outlook, sending its shares down over 30%. Lumentum's warning came shortly after another Apple supplier, Japan Display, also cut its full-year guidance blaming ""volatile customer demand"". The warnings from Apple suppliers extendeda slide in Apple shares that started earlier this monthafter the firm's sales forecast disappointed investors. The shares closed at about $194, down 5% for the day and more than 15% below their peak in October. Apple has said it will no longer report individual sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs Apple has insisted that it is optimistic about its Christmas season outlook, attributing the weaker than expected forecast to one-off changes, such as the timing of the release of new phones, and temporary supply chain issues. Apple falls below $1tn despite revenue and profit rise Five big things that have made Apple Smartphone use falls among young for first time It continues to make record profits, thanks to higher prices and growing income from its services business, which includes services such as the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple Music. But analysts have remained sceptical, especially after the firm said it would stop sharing the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells with investors. They have warned that Apple's reliance on higher prices could also make it especially vulnerable if there is a broader pullback in consumer spending. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, which has been embroiled in a corruption scandal at Malaysia's state-backed development fund, also dragged Wall Street indexes lower. Shares in the investment bank ended down about 7.5%, after a Malaysian official said the country wanted a refund of the fees Goldman earned for work on bond sales for the 1MDB fund. A former Goldman executive this month pleaded guilty to US charges that he had participated in a scheme to use some of the money raised in those offerings for bribes. The US market declines come amid an extended period of volatility on Wall Street, with investors wary due to warnings of a slowdown in global growth, trade tensions, falling oil prices and rising interest rates. US companies are also facing a rising dollar, which hurts sales overseas. The combination of factors has helped fuel speculation that corporate profits may be at their peak, especially after several companies, including Apple and Amazon, issued weaker than expected sales forecasts for the months ahead.

Stolen dog found 300 miles from homeThe Pomeranian's owner had given up hope of ever finding her after she was taken more than a year ago.Wales,"Juan Mino was reunited with Kiara in Bangor more than a year after she was stolen from his garden in London An 11-year-old dog has been found nearly 300 miles from home more than a year after she was stolen. Pomeranian Kiara was taken from her garden in London in August 2017. But when two stray dogs wandered into Peter Daniel's house in Bangor, Gwynedd, he was able to find Kiara's owners Juan and Antoinette Mino via her microchip and reunite the family. Mrs Mino said she was ""so thankful"" her precious pooch had been found after she had given up hope. Mr Daniel said he spotted two dogs going through his bins on Saturday while he got ready to go to his work, before one of them - Kiara - walked into his house and made herself at home. Mourning dog waits for 80 days in road where owner died Dog trapped in engine during drive After he put out posts on lost dog groups on social media, Tess Jones volunteered to scan the dogs for microchips on Sunday - and while the other dog did not have one, Kiara's contained a phone number for her owners. ""They couldn't get their heads around it, I can't believe it myself,"" Mr Daniel said. ""While I was on the phone to the lady that owned the dog, her partner was getting in the car to drive the six or seven hours up here."" Kiara at home in London before she was stolen last year Co-operative worker Mr Daniel said when Mr Mino was reunited with Kiara, there was not a dry eye in the house. ""It was lovely,"" he said. ""I think we all shed a tear. Dogs are family members."" When Kiara was taken, Mr and Mrs Mino printed 500 lost dog posters, offered a reward and kept across lost dog agencies and councils. But after a year went by with two false alarms and no sign of Kiara, they gave up hope  - until this weekend. Finally reunited with her dog on Monday, Mrs Mino said she had spent more than a year haunted by thoughts of Kiara being abused or killed. ""I've just been crying for days, I am so thankful,"" she said. ""We are animal lovers and we have had dogs who have died before but with Kiara, we were always thinking 'what's happened to her? Was she ill-treated? Was she killed? Are they hitting her?' ""My husband was home when she was stolen and he always felt guilty. Peter Daniel with the other stray dog who he has now fostered ""It is so nice to have her back."" But alongside the celebrations, Kiara will need some tender loving care while she recovers. ""She came home in such a state, and she smells, apparently she was with another dog and they had been living rough for months."" Mrs Mino added Kiara's coat is in knots and she will have to be shaved by a vet, along with needing health checks and vaccinations. But Mr Daniel's life has also been changed after finding the dogs - as he is now fostering Kiara's stray friend with a view to permanently adopting the Jack Russell if its owners cannot be found. He described the weekend's events as a ""Christmas miracle"". Runaway dog found 400km from home The dogs stolen from their owners' homes On the case with the dog drone detectives.

Three guilty of Nazi group membership,"Claudia Patatas and Adam Thomas named their baby Adolf out of ""admiration"" for Hitler A couple who named their baby after Adolf Hitler have been found guilty of being members of a banned terrorist group. Adam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, from Banbury, along with Daniel Bogunovic, 27, from Leicester, were convicted of being in National Action. Birmingham Crown Court heard the couple gave their child the middle name Adolf in honour of the Nazi leader. Jurors saw images of Thomas in Ku Klux Klan robes while cradling his baby. The Neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action, founded in 2013, was outlawed under anti-terror legislation three years later after it celebratedthe murder of Labour MP Jo Cox. Prosecutors said the Midlands chapter of the group ""shed one skin for another"" and ""rebranded"" after being banned. They said the case was about ""a specific type of terror...born out of fanatical and tribal belief in white supremacy"". Thomas told the court that the pictures showing him wearing KKK clothing were ""just play"", but he admitted being a racist. Thomas was also found guilty of having a copy of terrorist manual the Anarchist Cookbook. Daniel Bogunovic, Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas stayed in National Action after it was banned Thomas and Patatas had two machetes, one with a serrated 18in (46cm) blade, in the bedroom where their baby son slept. A police search of their home in January also found one of two crossbows just a few feet from the baby's crib, the jury was told. Also found was a pastry cutter shaped like a swastika in a kitchen drawer, as well as pendants, flags and clothing emblazoned with symbols of the Nazi-era SS and National Action. Nazi-themed goods on Amazon marketplace Is National Action a threat to the UK? National Action co-founder confronted by the BBC YouTube attacked over Neo-Nazi video Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said a deleted Skype log was recovered from Thomas's laptop. He said the messages sent between two parties spoke of National Action being ""destroyed"", with its leaders agreeing to disband with ""no attempt at revival"". The group was founded in 2013 by Ben Raymond, now 29, and Alex Davies, now 24 It was intended to be an explicitly neo-Nazi party Raymond was a politics graduate from the University of Essex, and Davies was a Welsh former member of the British National Party National Action shunned democratic politics, regarding itself instead as a youth-based street movement It is believed it never had more than 100 members Its activities involved leafleting university campuses, aggressive publicity stunts and city-centre demonstrations In 2015, 25-year-old member Zack Davies used a hammer and machete to attack a Sikh dentist and was jailed for attempted murder After the murder of Jo Cox in 2016, an official National Action Twitter account posted: ""Only 649 MPs to go #WhiteJihad"" The group was banned later that year after the government concluded it was ""concerned in terrorism"" It became the first far-right group to be proscribed in this country since World War Two Reading from the log, Mr Jameson said: ""But the Midlands branch of NA, which is just 17-20 of us, have decided to ignore this and we've renamed ourselves the Thule Combat League. ""Traitors. Midlands will continue the fight alone."" Jurors reached unanimous verdicts after 12 hours of deliberating. The three defendants will be sentenced on 14 December. Patatas was given bail, while Thomas and Bogunovic were remanded in custody. Earlier this year Darren Fletcher, 28, from Wolverhampton; Nathan Pryke, 27, from March, Cambridgeshire; and Joel Wilmore, 24, from Stockport; also pleaded guilty to being in National Action. Jurors were shown a picture showing Adam Thomas in the robes of the Ku Klux Klan A swastika-shaped pastry cutter was found in the home of Patatas and Thomas Det Ch Supt Matt Ward, from West Midlands Police, said the defendants ""were not simply racist fantasists; we now know they were a dangerous, well-structured organisation"". He added: ""Their aim was to spread neo-Nazi ideology by provoking a race war in the UK, and they had spent years acquiring the skills to carry this out. ""Unchecked, they would have inspired violence and spread hatred and fear across the West Midlands."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the convictions were a ""significant success"" for the police. He said: ""We are determined to tackle the threat presented by extreme right-wing terrorism, as we are all forms of terrorism, which is why this government banned National Action in 2016.""

"Brexit talks in the endgame, says May","Ministers were being briefed individually on the draft agreement UK and EU officials have agreed the draft text of a Brexit agreement after months of negotiations. A cabinet source told the BBC that the document has been agreed at a technical level by officials from both sides after intensive discussions this week. A special cabinet meeting will be held at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday as Theresa May seeks ministers' backing. The PM has been meeting ministers in Downing Street for one-to-one talks on the draft agreement. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the agreement contained a UK-wide customs ""backstop"" aimed at preventing new border checks in Northern Ireland. There is no additional Northern Ireland-only backstop - but sources wouldn't be drawn on any specific arrangements for Northern Ireland on rules and regulation within the UK-wide one, she added. This ""backstop"" has proved to the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work. Laura Kuenssberg: Agreement is in Downing Street's grasp Katya Adler: EU gives May space to 'spin' draft deal A brief guide to where we are with Brexit Pienaar: May's big gamble Thepound surged against the dollar and the eurofollowing the negotiations breakthrough - but analysts warned it could be short-lived, with the cabinet and Parliament yet to agree to the plans. The EU said it would ""take stock"" on Wednesday, while the Irish government said negotiations were ""ongoing and have not concluded"". Leading Brexiteers, such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, immediately criticised what has been reported to be in the draft agreement, saying it would keep the UK under EU control. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which gives Theresa May vital support in key votes, said it would be a ""very, very hard sell"". But Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was ""confident"" it would pass when put to a crucial Commons vote, and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling called for ""a little bit of calm"" before the cabinet gives its verdict on Wednesday. Both the UK and EU hope to be able to schedule a special summit of European leaders at the end of November to sign off the deal. The details of the draft agreement have not been published, so we don't know the small print yet. But it is made up of a withdrawal agreement - said to run to 500 pages - alongside a statement about what the UK and EU's future relationship will look like. The withdrawal agreement includes how to guarantee there will not be physical border checks reintroduced in Northern Ireland - the major sticking point in recent weeks. Some Brexiteers fear the likely arrangement will keep the UK locked into EU trade rules for years to come in order to maintain a frictionless border. Reality Check: When is the crunch time? Bisto owner plans Brexit stockpile The agreement also includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". The future relationship statement is expected to be far shorter, with the UK and the EU's long-term trade arrangements yet to be settled. No 10 said ministers were now being called to a special meeting to ""consider the draft agreement the negotiating teams have reached in Brussels, and to decide on next steps"". Before they do so, they will be able to read relevant ""documentation"". By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document. It's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament. One source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament. Slamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down. Read Laura's full blog Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said the plan would see the UK remain in the customs union and ""large parts"" of the single market. He told the BBC it was ""utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy"" and he would vote against it. Mr Rees-Mogg warned of the UK becoming a ""vassal state"" with Northern Ireland ""being ruled from Dublin"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said ""given the shambolic nature of the negotiations, this is unlikely to be the good deal for the country."" Pro-EU Conservative MP Justine Greening said the agreement would leave the UK with less influence and undermine its credibility. Speaking at a rally calling for another EU referendum to be held, she said: ""Even if some people in my party can't see this is a bad deal, everyone else around this entire planet can."" At the rally, former minister Jo Johnson was interviewed by Match of the Day host Gary Lineker Former Transport Minister Jo Johnson told the audience at a packed Westminster Hall that cabinet ministers were ""looking deep into their consciences"" about whether to support the deal. Mr Johnson, who quit his ministerial role last week over Brexit policy, added: ""The whips are going to tighten the thumbscrews on all our colleagues across Parliament in all parties probably, so it is very hard to predict."" BBC Europe editor Katya Adler Brussels is keeping schtum this evening. This doesn't mean that nothing's going on. Those in the know simply prefer to keep quiet at this sensitive stage. It seems what is being described to me as a ""mutual understanding"" has indeed been reached on a technical level between EU and UK Brexit negotiators. This is not yet a deal. All eyes are now on the UK cabinet. If ministers reject the draft, then it's back to the drawing board. If they approve it, then the 27 EU ambassadors scheduled to meet tomorrow may be told by the European Commission that decisive progress has been made in negotiations, meaning a Brexit summit could be convened with Theresa May, possibly in less than two weeks' time. First though, all 27 EU countries and the European Parliament will want to pore over the text. And that won't be with an uncritical eye. Meanwhile, following pressure from all sides of the Commons, ministers have agreed to provide MPs with a legal assessment of the implications for the UK of the Irish backstop and other controversial aspects of any deal. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would make a statement to MPs and take questions ahead of the final vote on any Brexit deal. MPs, he said, would get to see ""a full reasoned position statement laying out the government's both political and also legal position on the proposed withdrawal agreement"".

California wildfires reach grim milestone,"This video can not be played California wildfires continue to rage The death toll in wildfires sweeping California has risen to 31, with more than 200 people still missing, officials have said. Six more people were confirmed killed in the Camp Fire in the north of the state, taking the toll there to 29. That fire now equals the deadliest on record in California - the 1933 Griffith Park disaster in Los Angeles. In the south, the Woolsey Fire has claimed two lives as it damaged beach resorts including Malibu. In pictures: Wildfire rages in Malibu Watch: Aerial footage shows devastation 'Three minutes separated me from death' An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes to avoid three major blazes in the state. With strengthening winds threatening to spread the flames,California Governor Jerry Brown has urged President Donald Trump to declare a major disaster,external, a move that would harness more federal emergency funds. The appeal came a day after Mr Trump threatened to cut funding for California, blaming the fires on poor forest management. Harold Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, called the president's comments ""reckless and insulting"". Allow Twitter content?

Emergency teams have been sifting through the remains of more than 6,700 homes and businesses burned down in the town of Paradise. The town and surrounding area bore the brunt of the inferno, which started in nearby forest on Thursday. Celebrity homes destroyed by wildfires Kim K dedicates award to firefighters Animals caught in wildfire destruction At a news conference late on Sunday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said the bodies of five people had been found in their burned-out homes and a sixth was found inside a vehicle. He said that at least 228 people were still unaccounted for, adding that DNA testing equipment was being sent should it be required to help identify victims. The mayor of Paradise, Jody Jones, gave the BBC an update on the situation in the town. ""Most of the residential [area] is gone. I would say 90%,"" she said. ""I had an opportunity to go up there and take a look for myself. Just about everyone I know lost their home."" The fire is the most destructive in the state's history and the joint deadliest. It has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials said. ""Containment"" refers to a physical barrier around a fire that stops it spreading - such as a river, or a shallow, 10ft(3m)-wide trench dug by fire crews. If a fire is 100% contained, this means it has containment lines around its whole perimeter. However - the fire may still burn for days or weeks to follow. Police said suspected looters were arrested in Paradise on Saturday, and may have been trying to impersonate Forest Service workers. The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials said. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. This video can not be played Fleeing through flames: ""I'm so scared right now... so terrified"" Looting was also reported in the southern fire area over the weekend. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties razed by the flames. Hollywood actor Gerard Butler shared a picture of a charred house on Twitter, writing: ""Returned to my house in Malibu after evacuating. Heartbreaking time across California."" He thanked firefighters for their ""courage, spirit and sacrifice"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills, where the HBO series Westworld is filmed, was also destroyed. Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly On Saturday, firefighters used a respite from strong winds to drop fire retardant in a bid to strengthen firebreaks. But officials warned that winds of up to 70mph (112km/h) are expected over the coming days, meaning fires could spread quickly and unexpectedly. ""Winds are already blowing. They are going to blow for the next three days. Your house can be rebuilt but you can't bring your life back,"" said Los Angeles County fire chief Daryl Osby. Homes and vehicles left in Paradise, Butte County, were all but destroyed by the wildfires Fire retardant is dropped on to the Woolsey Fire near Malibu The Woolsey Fire is only 10% contained Luxury beachfront homes in Malibu have been claimed by the fire Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn. But experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. The current fires are being blamed on a combination of climate change and weather conditions. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The experts who start fires to study them Why can't California control its wildfires? The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness.

Climate change protest sees '22 arrests',"Protesters lay chained together on the pavement outside the UK government's energy department Environment activists who have blockaded the UK's energy department in London say 22 people have been arrested during the protest. The Met Police confirmed at least eight protestors have been detained. The UK is seen as a leader in policies to reduce greenhouse gases and will soon be considering tougher targets. But the protesters say research suggests the chance of keeping the global temperature rise under a 2C danger threshold is just one in 20. The demonstrators blocked entry to the offices by lying chained together on the pavement, while some glued themselves to the doors of the department building. Further protests are planned through the week and the demonstrators believe the public will take them seriously, as they are willing to go to jail for their cause. UK steps towards zero-carbon economy Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Some demonstrators also glued themselves to the door of the building They compare themselves with the suffragettes, the anti-apartheid movement, the followers of Gandhi, and the US civil rights movement, although their critics point out that these groups didn't have the vote. They have declared Saturday as Extinction Rebellion Day â the day theyâll commit acts of civil disobedience in the hope of jolting governments round the world into stronger action. Gail Bradbrook says she wants to protect the planet for her children's sake One of the protesters, Gail Bradbrook - a mother of two from Stroud - said: âI want the planet protected for my children. âChange comes when people are willing to commit acts of peaceful civil disobedience. âFifty people in jail for a short time is likely to bring the ecological crisis into the public consciousness.â The first mass meeting of the organisation last month drew 1,000 people to Westminster and blocked roads for two hours. There were 15 arrests. The organisers insist that this weekâs actions will be non-violent. They say if protesters commit an illegal act, they must stay on the spot to face the police. The police told BBC News they expected disruption on Saturday and were prepared for any level of protest. A member of the London Mayorâs office wondered privately if the protesters thought that freeing protesters from cycle locks was a good use of police time. Lizia Wolf said she felt compelled to act But Lizia Wolf told BBC News she felt compelled to act. âThe facts and figures are easily accessible if you have the stomach to look, but here within Extinction Rebellion and certainly with myself, is an offer of friendship, guidance and mutual grief. âThe first step towards creating the changes necessary for survival - and towards solving any problem in general - is to acknowledge the utterly terrifying situation we are in.â The protestersâ short-term aims are to cancel what they call âcontradictoryâ projects they say will actually increase emissions in the UK, such as the third runway at Heathrow, fracking and the Â£30bn roads programme. Their long-term aims are to: Oblige cabinet members to âtell the truthâ about the seriousness of the environmental crisis Make the UK carbon neutral by 2025 (the government is considering 2050 as a date for that) Set up a Peopleâs Assembly of ordinary citizens to decide priorities for reshaping the economy so that protecting the climate becomes Number One priority The aim of persuading some cabinet members to speak out may possibly be achievable. But experts say achieving a zero-emissions economy by 2025 isnât in any scenario. It would need a revolution in transport, home insulation, energy efficiency, agriculture and more. Setting up an assembly of mostly randomly selected citizens to take charge of the great economic shift will surely not be accepted by politicians. Tiana Jacout says she is happy to give up her freedom for the cause At the media launch of Extinction Rebellion, one young woman teared up, asking whether runaway climate change was an acceptable choice, when it was suggested that their demands were unlikely to be met. Another protester, Tiana Jacout, 31, from Bristol, told BBC News: âFinally! Someone has given us all permission to rage against the idea that we are barrelling towards extinction. âWe have been invited to decide, between those unbearable nights of watching the slow-moving car crash that is how humanity treats the world, or standing up for the world we know is possible. âI am happy to give up my freedom for the idea of that, that others can see a better world."" The protesters were boosted bya letter from 100 academics in the Guardian,externalâ including the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams. It said the failure of politicians to tackle climate breakdown and the growing extinction crisis means âthe 'social contract' has been brokenâ¦ [and] it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the governmentâs inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself.â Despite uncertainties in forecasts about the rate of heating, many senior scientists working on environmental change are genuinely alarmed by the huge risks mankind is taking. But can the UK really de-carbonise by 2025? Three professors concerned about the issue - Peter Cox, Jim Skea and Piers Forster - did not believe the timetable demanded by the Extinction Rebellion was possible. To the protesters, this wonât matter much. Theyâre harnessing new media to shake up what they see as societyâs complacency. They say failing to protect the climate isnât an option.

Why obesity increases cancer risk,"A new discovery could explain why obese people are more likely to develop cancer, scientists say. A type of cell the body uses to destroy cancerous tissue gets clogged by fat and stops working, the team, from Trinity College Dublin, found. Obesity is the biggest preventable cause of cancer in the UK after smoking, Cancer Research UK says. And more than one in 20,externalcancer cases - about 22,800 cases each year in the UK - are caused by excess body weight. Experts already suspected fat sent signals to the body that could both damage cells, leading to cancer, and increase the number of them. Now, the Trinity scientists have been able to show, inNature Immunology,externaljournal, how the body's cancer-fighting cells get clogged by fat. And they hope to be able to find drug treatments that could restore these ""natural killer"" cells' fighting abilities. Prof Lydia Lynch said: ""A compound that can block the fat uptake by natural killer cells might help. ""We tried it in the lab and found it allowed them to kill again. ""But arguably a better way would be to lose some weight - because that is healthier for you anyway."" Dr Leo Carlin, from the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, said: ""Although we know that obesity increases the risk of 13 different types of cancer, we still don't fully understand the mechanisms underlying the link. ""This study reveals how fat molecules prevent immune cells from properly positioning their tumour-killing machinery, and provides new avenues to investigate treatments. ""A lot of research focuses on how tumours grow in order to find metabolic targets to stop them, so this is a reminder that we should consider the metabolism of immune cells too.""

Apple iPhone sales fears rock Wall Street,"Apple chief executive Tim Cook presenting the firm's newest line of products last month Apple shares sank by 5% on Monday, dragging down US markets and wiping more than $40bn (Â£31bn; â¬35bn) off the tech giant's market value. The fall followed a profit warning from some of the firm's suppliers, which exacerbated concerns that demand for iPhones is slowing. The declines made the company one of the biggest losers on the Dow, which closed down 2.3%. The wider S&P 500 ended about 2% lower, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.75%. Technology stocks led the Wall Street sell-off which saw shares in most sectors tumble. Tech firms helped drive many of the stock market gains earlier in the year but now face rising calls for regulatory and tax changes that could hurt their growth. Amazon shares lost more than 4%, Alphabet dropped over 2.5% while Facebook fell 2.3%. Apple's share price fall came after Lumentum, a US manufacturer of facial recognition technology and Apple supplier, said one of its major customers had reduced its shipments. As a result, Lumentum downgraded its sales and profit outlook, sending its shares down over 30%. Lumentum's warning came shortly after another Apple supplier, Japan Display, also cut its full-year guidance blaming ""volatile customer demand"". The warnings from Apple suppliers extendeda slide in Apple shares that started earlier this monthafter the firm's sales forecast disappointed investors. The shares closed at about $194, down 5% for the day and more than 15% below their peak in October. Apple has said it will no longer report individual sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs Apple has insisted that it is optimistic about its Christmas season outlook, attributing the weaker than expected forecast to one-off changes, such as the timing of the release of new phones, and temporary supply chain issues. Apple falls below $1tn despite revenue and profit rise Five big things that have made Apple Smartphone use falls among young for first time It continues to make record profits, thanks to higher prices and growing income from its services business, which includes services such as the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple Music. But analysts have remained sceptical, especially after the firm said it would stop sharing the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells with investors. They have warned that Apple's reliance on higher prices could also make it especially vulnerable if there is a broader pullback in consumer spending. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, which has been embroiled in a corruption scandal at Malaysia's state-backed development fund, also dragged Wall Street indexes lower. Shares in the investment bank ended down about 7.5%, after a Malaysian official said the country wanted a refund of the fees Goldman earned for work on bond sales for the 1MDB fund. A former Goldman executive this month pleaded guilty to US charges that he had participated in a scheme to use some of the money raised in those offerings for bribes. The US market declines come amid an extended period of volatility on Wall Street, with investors wary due to warnings of a slowdown in global growth, trade tensions, falling oil prices and rising interest rates. US companies are also facing a rising dollar, which hurts sales overseas. The combination of factors has helped fuel speculation that corporate profits may be at their peak, especially after several companies, including Apple and Amazon, issued weaker than expected sales forecasts for the months ahead.

Israel-Gaza violence erupts after killings,"A bus in a kibbutz was set ablaze after being hit and an Israeli seriously wounded Violence has flared between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, a day after seven militants and an Israeli soldier were killed during an undercover Israeli operation in Gaza. Militants fired 300 rockets and mortars at Israel. One hit a bus, seriously injuring a soldier nearby. Israel responded with more than 70 strikes on what it said were targets belonging to Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Three Palestinians, two of them reportedly militants, were killed. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said nine Palestinians were injured. Meanwhile, Israeli medics said 10 people in Israel were injured. Israeli media later reported that a man was killed after a house was hit by a rocket in the Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israeli Maj Gen Kamil Abu Rukun warned that Hamas ""has crossed a red line"" and Israel would ""continue to respond with an iron fist against all terrorist activity or rocket fire"""". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his visit to France for an urgent meeting with his security chiefs. A Hamas commander and an Israeli soldier were among the dead on Sunday. Palestinians said an Israeli unit travelling in a civilian vehicle had killed the Hamas commander. According to Palestinian sources, the Israeli unit was about 3km (2 miles) inside the Gaza Strip, which borders Israel, when militants from Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, stopped the car. The group's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said the Israelis opened fire, killing a local commander, Nur Barakeh. Hamas commander Nur Barakeh's mother was seen at the morgue where his body was reportedly brought The incident is reported to have happened east of Khan Younis, in the south of the territory. A gun battle erupted and Israeli tanks and aircraft opened fire in the area, witnesses said. Six of the Palestinians killed belonged to Hamas and the seventh was a member of the militant Popular Resistance Committees, AFP news agency cited Palestinian officials as saying. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a member of the special unit involved was killed and another was lightly wounded. The Israeli soldiers were later flown back by helicopter. Due to the secrecy of the operation, Israel has not revealed specific details about the mission. The IDF said, however, that the operation was ""not intended to kill or abduct terrorists, but to strengthen Israeli security"". Israel carried out air strikes when Sunday night's firefight erupted The BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem says that according to a former Israeli general, the incident was likely to have been an intelligence-gathering operation that went wrong. The exposure of such an operation by Israeli special forces inside Gaza would be extremely rare, he says. Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for Hamas, denounced the incident as a ""cowardly Israeli attack"". IDF chief Lt Gen Gadi Eisenkot said the Israeli unit had carried out ""a very meaningful operation to Israel's security"", without giving further details. The Israeli military said that immediately after the clashes, 17 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, three of which were shot down. Throughout Monday, some 300 rockets and mortars were launched towards Israel, dozens of which were intercepted while many landed in open spaces, according to the Israeli military.

Paramedics said an Israeli soldier was seriously injured when a projectile hit a bus he was standing near in the Shaar Hanegev region. Three people also suffered minor injuries from shrapnel in the town of Sderot. The Israeli military said aircraft and tanks bombed more than 70 Hamas and Islamic Jihad targets in Gaza in retaliation, including militant compounds, observation posts, and rocket-launching squads. Israeli air strikes targeted the Hamas-run television station Al-Aqsa The building that houses the Hamas-run television station in Gaza, Al-Aqsa, was also struck, Palestinian officials said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The Israeli military had warned that the property would be targeted, accusing the channel of broadcasting ""propaganda"", and staff had evacuated. Broadcasting reportedly resumed after a brief outage. Life in the Gaza Strip Gaza protest image likened to famous painting The IDF later said the military also hit Hamas's military intelligence headquarters. The health ministry in Gaza reported that three men were killed and nine other people were wounded in the Israeli strikes. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine militant group said two of the dead were its members. UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov urged restraint from both sides. Allow Twitter content?

Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and reinforced its power in the Gaza Strip after ousting West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' rival Fatah faction in clashes the following year. While Mr Abbas' umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has signed peace accords with Israel, Hamas does not recognise Israel's right to exist and advocates the use of violence against it. Schools have been ordered to close in Israeli border communities as a precaution Israel, along with Egypt, has maintained a blockade of Gaza since about 2006 in order, they say, to stop attacks by militants. Israel and Hamas have gone to war three times, and rocket-fire from Gaza and Israeli air strikes against militant targets are a regular occurrence. Sunday night's incident comes after apparent progress in an Egyptian- and UN-brokered process to mediate after a series of escalations between the two sides in recent months. More than 200 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli forces since the end of March - most during weekly protests along the border at which thousands have expressed their support for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? Israel has said its soldiers have only opened fire in self-defence or on potential attackers trying to infiltrate its territory under the cover of the protests. One Israeli soldier was killed on the Gaza-Israel border by a Palestinian sniper in July.

US police kill black security guard 'hero',"Jemel Roberson hoped to become a police officer himself, friends say An armed security guard at a bar in suburban Chicago was killed by police as he detained a suspected gunman, according to officials and witnesses. After gunfire erupted around 04:00 local time on Sunday, Jemel Roberson, 26, chased down an attacker and knelt on his back until police arrived. Moments after police came on the scene, an officer opened fire on Roberson, who was black, killing him. Friends say Roberson was a musician who had dreams of joining the police. ""The very people that he wanted to be family with took his life,"" Patricia Hill, the pastor of Purposed Hill church in Chicago, told WGN-TV. Roberson worked as a gospel musician at several nearby churches, and also had found work at Manny's Blue Room in Robbins, Illinois, where the shooting occurred. Sophia Ansari, a spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's office, said police were called to the scene after a fight broke out in the bar and four people were shot. Witness Adam Harristold Fox32,externalthat Roberson, who was armed with a legally owned firearm, then chased down and caught one of the attackers. ""The security guard that got killed, he caught somebody and had his knee on him the whole time,"" Mr Harris said. ""Just waiting on the police to get there. I guess when the police got there, they probably thought he was one of the bad guys, cause he had his gun on the guy and they shot him."" ""Everybody was screaming out 'security, he was a security guard'"", Mr Harris added, ""and they still did their job and saw a black man with a gun and basically killed him"". Images on social media show a chaotic scene outside the bar as witnesses shouted at police. ""He was protecting the club and holding a suspect down,"" Mr Harris told CBS. The chief of the Midlothian police, whose officer fired the fatal shot, said in a statement: ""Upon arrival officers learned there were several gunshot victims inside the bar.""

Brexit 'judgement day' warning for cabinet,"Theresa May returning to Downing Street on Monday Ministers have been told ""judgement day is coming"" over Brexit as the UK and EU strive for a deal within 48 hours. Officials are trying to hammer out an agreement on the terms of the UK's exit by Wednesday to enable EU leaders to agree it by the end of the month. Downing Street said talks had gone on through the night but ""substantial issues"" still remained to be resolved. Amid growing pressure on the PM, one Tory said MPs will be ""judged at the bar of history"" if they back her plans. Mark Francois compared Mrs May's handling of the Brexit negotiations with the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in World War Two, complaining of ""one tactical defeat after another"". Ministers 'voiced Brexit plan doubts in July' MPs can stop no-deal Brexit, says Starmer Why May's Brexit deal may be impossible A growing number of Tory MPs are warning the prime minister that her Brexit plan will not be approved by Parliament while Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer has said MPs will not allow the UK to leave without a negotiated agreement and ""technically"" the whole process can be stopped. The uncertainty has been reflected on the financial markets,with sterling falling 1% against the dollar.before recovering slightly. Michel Barnier (right) is not in a position yet to recommend a special summit in November The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Negotiations are continuing on the so-called ""divorce"" agreement and an outline declaration on the two sides' future relationship. The next 48 hours are set to be critical in the process. Both sides want to schedule a special summit of EU leaders at the end of November to sign off the withdrawal deal but the EU says it will only agree to this if agreement can be reached on the issue of the Irish border. Time is running out to put the wheels in motion for the summit. EU member states need time to scrutinise any agreement before the gathering and the European Council's president Donald Tusk has reportedly said a deal must be reached by Wednesday evening at the latest. Following an update by their Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday, EU officials played down talk of a breakthrough, saying ""intense negotiating efforts continue, but an agreement has not been reached yet"". However, the Financial Times reported,externalthat Mr Barnier told EU diplomats that the text of an agreement was ""almost ready"" and everything hinged on whether Mrs May could muster enough political support in the UK. A November summit is a key staging post in trying to avoid the UK leaving without a deal. If the decision is pushed back to the next scheduled meeting in December, no-deal preparations will have to be ramped up significantly and the chances of getting it through the UK and EU parliaments will recede. Please upgrade your browser The negotiators have been burning the midnight oil in search of a deal. Talks continued to nearly 03:00 GMT on Monday and have since resumed in Brussels. The EU said key issues remained ""under discussion"", in particular over finding a solution to avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Downing Street said some progress had been made but the proposed Irish backstop - a fallback arrangement for avoiding border checks, which would see the UK remain in a temporary customs arrangement - had not been agreed. Amid claims a special cabinet meeting scheduled for Monday to approve the deal had had to be postponed, No 10 said ministers would only be asked to approve the draft agreement when it was ready. Other sticking points include EU demands for a ""level-playing field"" in labour regulations and environmental standards during any temporary customs arrangement, so UK firms cannot undercut their European counterparts. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said it was a ""very important"" week for the Brexit process and the sooner the two sides bridged their differences the better. Penny Mordaunt said cabinet had a key role to play in the process Theresa May is coming under increasing pressure from both Brexiteers and Remainers. In his latest column for the Daily Telegraph, Boris Johnson called for a ""cabinet mutiny"" against the PM's proposal for the UK to sign up to EU rules in trade in goods without, he said, having any say in them. Mr Francois, the vice-chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said it was an open secret that five or six cabinet members were very unhappy with the PM's proposals and urged them to show ""moral courage"". ""It's been one tactical defeat after another,"" he said. ""Everyone of which has been followed by a retreat. And it all ends in one massive surrender right at the end."" International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the cabinet would be a ""check"" on whatever deal was agreed and suggested she could not support anything which did not respect the 2016 referendum result. ""Cabinet's job is to put something to Parliament that is going to deliver on the referendum result,"" she said. ""We need to work together as a Cabinet to do that."" Former education secretary Justine Greening, who backs another referendum on Brexit with the option to remain in the EU, said there was ""no chance"" of the PM's blueprint for future relations being approved by MPs. But Mrs May has received the support of one prominent Brexiteer in the cabinet. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said she was trying to get the ""very, very best deal"" for Britain. Brexit: Danger for May on all sides This video can not be played Gordon Brown: ""There will be a referendum at some point."" It's not only Conservative divisions which are on show over Brexit. Labour continues to struggle to read from the same script when it comes to another UK-wide vote. In an interview with a German magazine on Friday, Jeremy Corbyn said the public had already had their say and Brexit could not be stopped. He later told Channel 4 his priority was the UK's new relationship with Europe. Sir Keir Starmer, the party's Brexit spokesman, disagrees, pointing out that Labour members voted to keep all options open at their conference and Parliament would not allow the UK to leave without some form of agreement. This video can not be played ""All options are on the table"" if there is a no-deal Brexit, Keir Starmer tells Today And former prime minister Gordon Brown believes another referendum is inevitable at the some stage, although he will not predict when this might happen. In a speech to the Institute for Government in London on Monday, he claimed Brexit was now ""more divisive"" than either the Iraq War or the Miners Strike and  the door must be left open to the UK rejoining the EU one day. Referring to Mr Corbyn's remarks, he said. ""Jeremy always told me we should be bound by conference motions. He needs to look at the conference motion.""

Airport 'assisting Salmond investigation',"Mr Salmond told BBC Scotland in an interview in the summer that he had never sexually harassed anyone Police have spoken to staff at Edinburgh Airport as part of their inquiry into the conduct of former First Minister Alex Salmond. It emerged in August thattwo women had made complaintsto the Scottish government about Mr Salmond. Airport bosses confirmed that they were ""assisting police with inquiries"" into a separate alleged incident understood to date from 2008. The former first minister denies ""all suggestions of misconduct at any time"". Police have declined to comment further. The Scottish government set up its investigation after two formal complaints about Mr Salmond were lodged in January this year. These are understood to relate to claims of sexual harassment while he was first minister, which he describes as ""patently ridiculous"". Mr Salmond haslaunched a judicial reviewof the Scottish government's handling of the matter, claiming it was ""unfair and unjust"". The government insists its processes are ""legally sound"", and arguments about this will be heard in court in January 2019. A separate police investigation into the claims was established in September, after the row over the government's inquiry became public. This is a separate probe from the government one and will not be affected by the outcome of the judicial review. TheDaily Record newspaper reported on Monday,externalthat the probe had been widened to include an alleged incident at Edinburgh Airport. A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: ""We can confirm that we are assisting Police Scotland with its inquiries. We cannot comment further at this time."" A spokesman for Police Scotland said inquiries were continuing, and that police would not be commenting further. A spokesman for the former first minister said: ""Mr Salmond denies all suggestions of misconduct at any time and suggests that everyone should allow police inquires to take their proper course without briefing or breaching their confidentiality. ""Alex has not been interviewed by the police about any matter. He is content to have his case against the Scottish government stated in the Court of Session in January.""

'Hundreds spend week in school isolation',"This video can not be played School isolation rooms: 'The shelves, the windows, the bare walls... every single day' ""The windows, the bare walls. It was that every day. Every single day. They put me in a room on my own, I was in isolation,"" says Casey, 16. More than 200 pupils spent at least five straight days in isolation booths in schools in England last year, a BBC News investigation has learned. Casey's school disputes the length of time he spent on his own and said he was ""regularly disruptive"". The teenager says he was placed on his own after he contracted fibromyalgia. He takes the painkiller Tramadol for the chronic pain condition. More than 5,000 children with special educational needs also attended isolation rooms at some stage. Dozens of them had education, health and care plans (EHCPs) provided for children with complex needs. The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, says school isolation can be ""distressing and degrading"" and she is concerned it is being used ""as a gateway to excluding and off-rolling"", where pupils are removed from a school's register. The Department for Education says children should be in isolation no longer than is necessary and that the health, safety and welfare of pupils must always be put first. Excluded pupils 'abandoned by schools' Schools expel 40 pupils each day, data shows School exclusions: Are more children being expelled? School exclusions: Inside a Pupil Referral Unit Casey's father died when he was nine and he lives with his grandmother in Bristol. ""I was quite athletic, I was happy, then I fell ill. That's when it all went downhill."" He says he didn't learn during the isolation period and spent much of his time copying out of GCSE revision books, often without a teacher present. ""It made me feel there was no point to learning,"" he said. Casey says the experience has had a lasting impact on him. ""I locked myself into my room every day after I came home and shut the blinds,"" he said. ""It felt like being isolated was normal. I wouldn't expect them to treat a dog like that. It was just vile."" Casey's school says the room he was in was not the school's actual isolation facility. In a statement, it said that schools were increasingly encountering pupils ""in crisis"" who are being ""failed by a combination of public services"". Isolation rooms, or internal inclusion units, are facilities pupils are sent to when it is thought they need to be removed from a classroom during the school day. They vary in their nature significantly. Many include so-called isolation or consequence booths - partitioned desks in which children typically face the wall and work in silence. Occasionally schools use ""seclusion"" units - rooms where children sometimes remain on their own - while others place pupils in more conventional classrooms to work in silence. A recent government report on alternative provision,externalsaid that schools with internal inclusion units saw them as a halfway point between excluding a pupil and keeping them in a mainstream classroom. Isolation booths used in a primary school The BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to more than 1,000 secondary schools and academy chains across the UK asking how they use isolation and around 600 responded. It learned that more than 200 schools in England used isolation booths, with 12 in Wales and six in Scotland but none in Northern Ireland. While the majority had rules for children spending a maximum of one, two or three continuous days in isolation, 225 pupils in England and one in Wales spent a whole week in isolation booths as a single punishment last year. The investigation also learned: more than 5,000 pupils with special educational needs in England spent time in isolation children with autism and ADHD have attended isolation one school had five separate isolation rooms, each permanently staffed at an annual cost of more than Â£170,000 some schools prevent pupils from using the playground during the day and the dining hall at lunch two schools - which included a bathroom as part of the facility - do not allow pupils to leave the unit all day. A seclusion room used in a primary school Government guidance in England says schools are free to decide how long pupils should be kept in isolation, but they should be there ""no longer than is necessary"". The guidelines also say that in order for isolation to be lawful as a punishment it should be ""reasonable"" in all circumstances, and factors such as special educational needs should be taken into account. Schools do not need to record use or report to parents that their child has been sent to isolation, although many do. A pupil sitting in an isolation booth Paul Dix says he has probably visited more isolation facilities than anyone else in his work as a behavioural consultant in schools across England. He says he has seen 50 children at one time in isolation in one school and children with Asperger's syndrome and ADHD in isolation rooms and met one child who said they had spent 36 days in isolation in one school year. ""That is not education, it is a custodial sentence,"" he said. ""Where's the regulation around it, where's the reporting, where is the accountability?"" He said he has heard of pupils being placed into isolation for not bringing a pen or wearing the right shoes. Paul says disruptive pupils may need to be removed from classrooms but believes they should be returned after a short period and a discussion of their behaviour with an experienced teacher. ""That is the intelligent way. Isolation is desperation,"" he said. Isolation booths are used in hundreds of schools in England Richard Sheriff is the executive head for eight schools - three of which have rooms with isolation booths - as well as president of the Association of School and College Leaders. He says his schools would never place pupils in isolation booths for five consecutive days, but understands why some schools feel the need to find ways of tackling extreme behaviour. ""There is a gathering storm with regards to student behaviour,"" he says. ""We've seen cuts in services in local authorities, but also in the ability of schools to purchase well-run, good quality alternative provision."" He says a lot of society's problems are now being ""laid at the door of schools"". Richard Sheriff is executive head of three schools which use isolation The government's school behaviour expert, Tom Bennett, says isolation rooms can be effective in tackling disruption in classrooms. ""When you're a lone adult with a class of 25 pupils, it only take two people to really persistently wilfully misbehave for that lesson to be completely detonated,"" he said. He believes removing students from classrooms should be seen as a positive solution. ""It can be a way of preventing fixed-term exclusions by keeping them in the school and being looked after,"" he said.

Peer faces suspension over sex claims case,"A member of the House of Lords should be suspended for sexually harassing a woman and offering her ""corrupt inducements to sleep with him"", the Lords Privileges Committee has said. The committee recommended a suspension of Lord Lester of Herne Hill until 2022, which would be the longest in modern parliamentary history. The House of Lords will debate a motion to suspend Lord Lester on Thursday. The 82-year-old peer described the allegations as ""completely untrue"". But the Lords Standards Commissioner upheld the complaint - which is judged on the balance of probabilities - ""on the basis of the strong and cogent evidence of the complainant and her witnesses"". Lord Lester is currently suspended by the Liberal Democrats. In itsreport, the committee said,externala complaint had been received in November 2017 that Lord Lester ""had sexually harassed the complainant, had offered her a corrupt inducement to have sexual relations with her, and had warned her of unspecified consequences if she did not accept his offer"". It added: ""These allegations were connected to Lord Lester's conduct of his parliamentary duties."" The report also said Lord Lester had admitted telling another peer the name of the complainant and that she had been responsible for him being suspended by his party. This was a breach of confidentiality rules, it said. A separate report by the Sub-Committee on Lords' Conduct, which looks at appropriate sanctions, recommended he should be expelled from the House of Lords, saying the ""allegations taken together constituted a grave abuse of power"". After an appeal by Lord Lester, the committee agreed with the commissioner's verdict but changed the sub-committee's recommended sanction from expulsion to suspension. In a statement, Lord Lester said: ""I produced evidence which clearly demonstrated that what I was said to have done 12 years ago did not happen. ""Independent counsel who previously advised the committee on its procedures provided an advice which concluded that the investigation was flawed. I regret the committee's conclusions in the light of these materials."" He called for reform of the procedure for investigating sexual harassment claims, adding: ""I hope to be judged by my work over decades for gender equality, race relations and free speech."" A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""Anthony Lester has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats and is no longer a member of the Liberal Democrat group in the House of Lords.""

Lee was born in 1922 to working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania. He began working at the comics section of Martin Goodman's Timely Publications - a company that would eventually transform into Marvel Comics - and became comics editor there at age 18. For years Lee wrote only simple comics, focusing on crime stories, horrors and westerns and aimed at young readers. Aged 40, he decided to give up on comics. But his wife Joan urged him to create the characters he always wanted to write as his comic swansong. In 1961, Lee and artist Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four - compelling characters with individual personalities and relatable problems. Timely Publications was renamed Marvel, and the golden age of comic books began. Black Panther (portrayed in film by actor Chadwick Boseman, right) was one of the first black mainstream superheroes in America Many Marvel characters were groundbreaking at the time. For example, Black Panther was the first black superhero featured in a mainstream US comic. Other characters he created include the Silver Surfer, the X-Men, Iron Man and Doctor Strange. Lee was also known for giving artists their due credit. Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romita and others achieved cult status in their own right. In its heyday, Marvel sold 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.

'Nazi' posed in 'KKK robes with baby',"Jurors were shown photographs from the ""Thomas-Patatas family album"" A ""fanatical"" neo-Nazi posed for photographs with his newborn baby in Ku Klux Klan robes, a court has heard. Jurors at Birmingham Crown Court were shown images said to be of Adam Thomas, 22. Another photo showed him holding a swastika flag alongside his partner and baby. Mr Thomas, along with partner Claudia Patatas, 38 and Daniel Bogunovic, 27, denies being a member of banned far-right group National Action. Prosecuting, Barnaby Jameson QC said the photos were from the ""Thomas-Patatas family album"". Jurors were shown photographs said to be of Mr Thomas and his newborn son Mr Jameson said one image, found on a memory card at the house, shows Ms Patatas holding her baby, standing next to another man holding a swastika flag and performing a Nazi-style salute. Describing another image, said to show Mr Thomas in the hooded robe with his child, he said: ""The suggestion is that is Mr Thomas and his child, whose middle name is Adolf."" Turning to an image of a hooded man with a machete, Mr Jameson added: ""There is a strong inference, and you'll appreciate this when you look inside the Thomas and Patatas house, that that was taken inside their home, and that the person in the robes was Thomas."" Mr Jameson said there was ""a strong inference"" the photographs were taken inside Mr Thomas' home The couplegave their child the middle name Adolf, which the prosecution allege was in honour of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Mr Thomas and Ms Patatas, of Waltham Gardens, Banbury, Oxfordshire, are on trial accused of being members of National Action, which was banned under terrorism laws in December 2016. Co-defendant Mr Bogunovic, of Crown Hills Rise, Leicester, is facing the same charge. A host of Nazi and far-right memorabilia, and National Action flags, badges and banners, were found at the couple's home, the court has heard, as well as an ""extensive"" collection of weapons, including crossbows, an axe and knives. A Swastika pastry cutter, a mug with an SS emblem, and a beaker with a Swastika were found during a police search of the home in Oxfordshire Two cushions bearing the swastika were found during police searches of the house after their arrest for alleged terrorism offences in January, the court was told. A greetings card on the sideboard of their living room featured KKK figures and read: ""May all your Christmases be white.""

The genius of superhero creator Stan Lee,"Stan Lee was born Stan Lieber in 1922 American comic book writer Stan Lee was the human behind the superheroes. Many marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. The Hulk, Iron Man, Daredevil and the Fantastic Four all sprang from his fertile imagination and spilled onto the page. But while his career may have started in pen and ink, it grew and evolved into much more. From digital graphic novels to blockbuster Hollywood films; leading Marvel Comics from a small division of a publishing house to a large multimedia corporation; Stan Lee was prolific. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stanley Martin Lieber got a job in Timely Publications - that would eventually become Marvel Comics - a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to the reach of his imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was ""the ultimate hack"" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or all bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieber by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the by-line. He assumed the ""dumb name"", Stan Lee, which he later legally adopted. By the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond. Lee's answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the so-called 'silver age' of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York's skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too. ""Just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,"" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romita and and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee's influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers. In 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which went on to develop films and TV programmes. His half-century-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, Fantastic Four, Hulk, Daredevil, Iron Man and the Avengers all given the Hollywood treatment. Spider-Man was a huge box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (Â£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales were counted. More recently the three Captain America films, starring Chris Evans, took $2.24bn at the worldwide box office. Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man pulled in $2.4bn. Marvel's appeal was unequivocal. And fans also delighted in seeing Lee's brief cameo appearances in almost every Marvel live-action movie. Lee also enjoyed success with graphic novels. In 2012 he co-wrote Romeo and Juliet: The War which landed on The New York Times' best-seller list and launched a YouTube channel, Stan Lee's World of Heroes. He introduced his digital graphic novel Stan Lee's God Woke at the 2016 Comic-Con. The print version won the 2017 Independent Publisher Book Awards' independent voice award. In later years he lamented his deteriorating eyesight, which meant he could no longer read the comic books where he made his name. Hetold the Radio Times,externalin 2016  that he ""missed reading 100%"". And he also talked about what he considered to be the greatest superpower - luck. He said: ""Every time I go to a comic book convention, at least one fan will ask me, 'What is the greatest superpower of all?' I always say that luck is the greatest superpower, because if you have good luck then everything goes your way.""

Crossbow 'found near baby Adolf's crib',"Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas gave their child the middle name Adolf, the trial has heard A couple accused of being in a banned British neo-Nazi group kept machetes, crossbows and other weaponry at home, a court has heard. Prosecutors say Adam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, also had a greetings card which featured Ku Klux Klan figures and read ""May all your Christmases be white"". The pair are charged alongside Daniel Bogunovic, 27, with being members of banned group National Action. All three deny being in the group. Birmingham Crown Court heard that the Oxfordshire couple,who named their child after Adolf Hitler, had two machetes, one with a serrated 18in (46cm) blade, in the bedroom where their baby son slept. A police search of their home in January also found one of two crossbows just a few feet from the baby's crib, the jury was told. Ms Patatas sent offensive messages on WhatsApp, the court has heard It was said officers also found an axe under their bed, a makeshift target range in the back garden and old clothes with holes in made by crossbow bolts. Also found was a Nazi dagger bearing the Swastika, a pastry cutter shaped like a Swastika in a kitchen drawer, as well as pendants, flags and clothing emblazoned with symbols of the Nazi-era SS and National Action. Jurors were also told the couple had a photograph of their infant son in his crib next to a cushion bearing the Nazi party symbol, and another of Mr Thomas in camouflage gear and a mask, brandishing a machete at home. Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said: ""Why, members of the jury, was there such an extensive degree of weaponry in this particular house and in this case the parental bedroom? ""Why is it these clothes appear to be covered in holes made by crossbow bolts? ""Why was it necessary for anybody in the garden of the address to be firing a crossbow and crossbow bolts into the clothes you've seen?"" The jury was also told a digital copy of The Anarchist Cookbook was found, containing chapters headed ""Making plastic explosive"", ""Letter bombs"", and ""Molotov cocktails"". Press cuttings in the lounge related to far-rightmass-murderer Anders Breivik, it was said. Meanwhile, Mr Bogunovic had a large number of stickers and images relating to National Action at his address, and a Nazi flag in his bedroom, the court heard. Ms Patatas and Mr Thomas, both of Waltham Gardens, Banbury, and Bogunovic, of Crowns Hills Rise, Leicester deny being members of a banned group. Mr Thomas further denies a separate charge of having The Anarchist Cookbook. The trial continues.

Lee was born in 1922 to working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania. He began working at the comics section of Martin Goodman's Timely Publications - a company that would eventually transform into Marvel Comics - and became comics editor there at age 18. For years Lee wrote only simple comics, focusing on crime stories, horrors and westerns and aimed at young readers. Aged 40, he decided to give up on comics. But his wife Joan urged him to create the characters he always wanted to write as his comic swansong. In 1961, Lee and artist Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four - compelling characters with individual personalities and relatable problems. Timely Publications was renamed Marvel, and the golden age of comic books began. Black Panther (portrayed in film by actor Chadwick Boseman, right) was one of the first black mainstream superheroes in America Many Marvel characters were groundbreaking at the time. For example, Black Panther was the first black superhero featured in a mainstream US comic. Other characters he created include the Silver Surfer, the X-Men, Iron Man and Doctor Strange. Lee was also known for giving artists their due credit. Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romita and others achieved cult status in their own right. In its heyday, Marvel sold 50 million copies a year.

"Briton dies from rabies after cat biteThe individual was on holiday in Morocco, a country deemed high risk by public health officials.UK","A cat in Morocco (file picture) A Briton has died after contracting rabies while on holiday in Morocco, health officials have said. Public Health England said the victim became infected after being bitten by a cat. PHEissued a reminder to travellers,externalto avoid coming into contact with animals when in rabies-affected countries. Rabies is not found in wild or domestic animals in the UK, but five Britons became infected between 2000 and 2017 after ""animal exposures abroad"". Some species of bats in the UK can carry a rabies-like virus. According to the World Health Organization,external, the disease occurs in more than 150 countries and causes tens of thousands of deaths every year, mainly in Asia and Africa. It says in up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for the transmission of the virus to humans. TheUK government says,externalnorth African countries such as Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are among 139 nations where there is a high risk. PHE did not release further details about the Briton's death. It said that while there was no risk to the wider public, as a precautionary measure, health workers and close contacts of the person who died were being assessed and offered vaccination if necessary. Rabies is a viral infection that affects the brain and central nervous system. It is passed on through bites and scratches from an infected animal. There are no documented instances of it being transmitted via human to human contact. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, said: ""This is an important reminder of the precautions people should take when travelling to countries where rabies is present."" The last recorded rabies case in Britain was in 2012, after a UK resident was bitten by a dog in south Asia. Electron micrograph of the rabies virus Initial symptoms can include anxiety, headaches and fever As the disease progresses, there may be hallucinations and respiratory failure Spasms of the muscles used for swallowing make it difficult for the patient to drink The incubation period between being infected and showing symptoms is between three and 12 weeks If you are bitten, scratched or licked by an animal you must wash the wound or site of exposure with plenty of soap and water and seek medical advice without delay Once symptoms have developed, rabies is almost always fatal Before symptoms develop, rabies can be treated with a course of vaccine - this is ""extremely effective"" when given promptly after a bite - along with rabies immunoglobulin if required Every year, more than 15m people worldwide receive a post-bite vaccination and this is estimated to prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths But effective treatment for rabies is not readily available to those in need Pre-exposure immunisation is recommended for people in certain high-risk occupations and for travellers to rabies-affected, remote areas Source: Public Health England/World Health Organization Rabies warning over imported puppies Rabies jabs for girl, 8, bitten by bat Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Briton dies from rabies after cat bite,"A cat in Morocco (file picture) A Briton has died after contracting rabies while on holiday in Morocco, health officials have said. Public Health England said the victim became infected after being bitten by a cat. PHEissued a reminder to travellers,externalto avoid coming into contact with animals when in rabies-affected countries. Rabies is not found in wild or domestic animals in the UK, but five Britons became infected between 2000 and 2017 after ""animal exposures abroad"". Some species of bats in the UK can carry a rabies-like virus. According to the World Health Organization,external, the disease occurs in more than 150 countries and causes tens of thousands of deaths every year, mainly in Asia and Africa. It says in up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for the transmission of the virus to humans. TheUK government says,externalnorth African countries such as Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are among 139 nations where there is a high risk. PHE did not release further details about the Briton's death. It said that while there was no risk to the wider public, as a precautionary measure, health workers and close contacts of the person who died were being assessed and offered vaccination if necessary. Rabies is a viral infection that affects the brain and central nervous system. It is passed on through bites and scratches from an infected animal. There are no documented instances of it being transmitted via human to human contact. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, said: ""This is an important reminder of the precautions people should take when travelling to countries where rabies is present."" The last recorded rabies case in Britain was in 2012, after a UK resident was bitten by a dog in south Asia. Electron micrograph of the rabies virus Initial symptoms can include anxiety, headaches and fever As the disease progresses, there may be hallucinations and respiratory failure Spasms of the muscles used for swallowing make it difficult for the patient to drink The incubation period between being infected and showing symptoms is between three and 12 weeks If you are bitten, scratched or licked by an animal you must wash the wound or site of exposure with plenty of soap and water and seek medical advice without delay Once symptoms have developed, rabies is almost always fatal Before symptoms develop, rabies can be treated with a course of vaccine - this is ""extremely effective"" when given promptly after a bite - along with rabies immunoglobulin if required Every year, more than 15m people worldwide receive a post-bite vaccination and this is estimated to prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths But effective treatment for rabies is not readily available to those in need Pre-exposure immunisation is recommended for people in certain high-risk occupations and for travellers to rabies-affected, remote areas Source: Public Health England/World Health Organization Rabies warning over imported puppies Rabies jabs for girl, 8, bitten by bat Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Pro Green: Knife crime not just a black issue,"Professor Green has said black youths as a whole are being ""criminalised"" over recent stabbings - and that in some places ""knife crime is white"". The rapper claimed the media had an ""agenda"" to ""bring back racially-profiled stop and search"" - but he does not think the practice works. Green, who was stabbed in 2009, blamed poverty for thegrowing problem. His comments come as a senior police officer said current rules on stop and search might be too restrictive. Home Office minister Nick Hurd told the Commons on Monday there were ""no plans"" to ""go back to random stop and search"", but the government would look at ways to reduce bureaucracy around it. Should stronger stop and search powers be used? London's 119 homicide victims of 2018 Violent crime 'could take a generation to solve' Professor Green spoke out onInstagram,externalafter being asked about knife crime on Monday's Good Morning Britain. He wrote: ""There had been a lot of reference to a statistic that it's largely black youths stabbing each other - what was left out was that this is only true of certain areas, as anyone with a brain can work out, in more densely white populated areas, the face of knife crime is white. ""That's never represented in the media. The fact that the face of knife crime they project nationally is black youths, as I said this morning implies institutional racism and criminalises a whole race, fitting their agenda to bring back racially-profiled stop and search."" He said all stop and search achieved was to cause ""more division, friction and lack of trust"" of police. While speaking on GMB, he added that while he was stabbed, he does not see himself as a victim. In London alone, there have been 119 homicides this year - including 69 fatal stabbings. Four of those happened in a five-day period this month. Professor Green said knife crime had been ""a growing problem for years with many different contributing factors"", with ""poverty at the top of the list"". ""Years of neglect"" have caused the current crisis, with social deprivation, lack of paternal role models, inequality in education and cuts to services all to blame, he added. He said he agreed with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan's comment that it might take a generation to solve the problem of knife crime. ""Stop and search isn't going to be a quick fix,"" he added. ""Children should never get to the point of carrying a knife - but society needs to move on a hell of a lot before that will happen."" Meanwhile, Adrian Hanstock - the National Police Chiefs' Council lead on stop and search and deputy chief constable of British Transport Police - has suggested the threshold for stops to take place could be lowered. He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One it was not currently a proposal, but discussions had been held about how to do things differently. ""What's behind this is there's a lot of call for officers up and down the country, not just in the cities, to use more stop and search to tackle violence,"" he said. ""We see every day knives and weapons and other items taken off the streets, and every one of those can save a life."" But Mr Hanstock added: ""If we are to make longstanding impact on these causes of violence, police use of stop and search will not be the single answer to this."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid is expected to outline plans in the coming weeks to make stop and search more efficient and reduce the bureaucracy around it. According toHome Office figures,external, there were 298,949 stop and searches carried out in England and Wales in the 2016-17 financial year. There were four for every 1,000 white people - compared with 29 for every 1,000 black people. The most recent census,external, in 2011, showed 86% of the population was white, with black ethnic groups making up 3.3%. The return of stop and search?

No evidence found in Lamplugh body search,"Suzy Lamplugh went missing in 1986 aged 25 Police investigating the murder of estate agent Suzy Lamplugh have found ""no evidence"" during a search at a property in Birmingham. The Metropolitan Police said it had concluded a two-week search at the Sutton Coldfield home - once owned by the mother of suspect John Cannan. Ms Lamplugh was 25 when she disappeared in west London in 1986 and declared dead, presumed murdered, in 1994. Her brother said he was ""upset"" a body had not been found. Speaking to the BBC, Richard Lamplugh said he wanted police to keep looking ""if they have credible evidence"". ""We want to bury her where we choose to bury her, not where whoever murdered her chooses to bury her,"" he said. Forensic officers and detectives had been searching the garden and garage of the semi-detached house on Shipton Road since 29 October. Det Ch Supt Richard Wood said the latest line of inquiry ""must have been traumatic"" and ""hugely painful"" for Ms Lamplugh's family and friends. ""This has been a landmark case for the Met, both in terms of its scale and complexity, and because of the huge sense of tragedy of a young woman's life being cut short and the uncertainty around what happened to Suzy,"" he said. ""The case remains open, and the Met remains committed to bringing Suzy's killer to justice. We will continue to assess any new information that comes in."" Police have been searching the former home of John Cannan's mother since 29 October The ""painstaking"" search of the grounds of the property involved the excavation of parts of the garden and the use of ground-penetrating radar, police said. About 15 officers and staff from the Met and West Midlands Police were involved as well as an archaeologist. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Police said new information received earlier this year was ""assessed by specialist officers and experts before the decision was taken to go ahead with the search"". Cannan, 64, who is serving a life sentence for the abduction and murder of Bristol newlywed Shirley Banks, was named as a suspect in Ms Lamplugh's murder in 2002. What do we know about Suzy Lamplugh? New police search for Suzy Lamplugh body Lamplugh suspect wants end to speculation A former Met detective, who led a review of the case beginning in 2000, said Cannan bore a strong resemblance to an e-fit of ""Mr Kipper"" -  a man to whom Ms Lamplugh was seen talking to in Fulham on the day she went missing. John Cannan and the ""Mr Kipper"" e-fit Cannan's solicitor Matthew Claughton said he continued to ""deny any involvement"" with Ms Lamplugh's death.

"'Hundreds spend week in school isolation'More than 200 children spent five consecutive days in an isolation booth in English schools, the BBC has learned.Family & Education","This video can not be played School isolation rooms: 'The shelves, the windows, the bare walls... every single day' ""The windows, the bare walls. It was that every day. Every single day. They put me in a room on my own, I was in isolation,"" says Casey, 16. More than 200 pupils spent at least five straight days in isolation booths in schools in England last year, a BBC News investigation has learned. Casey's school disputes the length of time he spent on his own and said he was ""regularly disruptive"". The teenager says he was placed on his own after he contracted fibromyalgia. He takes the painkiller Tramadol for the chronic pain condition. More than 5,000 children with special educational needs also attended isolation rooms at some stage. Dozens of them had education, health and care plans (EHCPs) provided for children with complex needs. The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, says school isolation can be ""distressing and degrading"" and she is concerned it is being used ""as a gateway to excluding and off-rolling"", where pupils are removed from a school's register. The Department for Education says children should be in isolation no longer than is necessary and that the health, safety and welfare of pupils must always be put first. Excluded pupils 'abandoned by schools' Schools expel 40 pupils each day, data shows School exclusions: Are more children being expelled? School exclusions: Inside a Pupil Referral Unit Casey's father died when he was nine and he lives with his grandmother in Bristol. ""I was quite athletic, I was happy, then I fell ill. That's when it all went downhill."" He says he didn't learn during the isolation period and spent much of his time copying out of GCSE revision books, often without a teacher present. ""It made me feel there was no point to learning,"" he said. Casey says the experience has had a lasting impact on him. ""I locked myself into my room every day after I came home and shut the blinds,"" he said. ""It felt like being isolated was normal. I wouldn't expect them to treat a dog like that. It was just vile."" Casey's school says the room he was in was not the school's actual isolation facility. In a statement, it said that schools were increasingly encountering pupils ""in crisis"" who are being ""failed by a combination of public services"". Isolation rooms, or internal inclusion units, are facilities pupils are sent to when it is thought they need to be removed from a classroom during the school day. They vary in their nature significantly. Many include so-called isolation or consequence booths - partitioned desks in which children typically face the wall and work in silence. Occasionally schools use ""seclusion"" units - rooms where children sometimes remain on their own - while others place pupils in more conventional classrooms to work in silence. A recent government report on alternative provision,externalsaid that schools with internal inclusion units saw them as a halfway point between excluding a pupil and keeping them in a mainstream classroom. Isolation booths used in a primary school The BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to more than 1,000 secondary schools and academy chains across the UK asking how they use isolation and around 600 responded. It learned that more than 200 schools in England used isolation booths, with 12 in Wales and six in Scotland but none in Northern Ireland. While the majority had rules for children spending a maximum of one, two or three continuous days in isolation, 225 pupils in England and one in Wales spent a whole week in isolation booths as a single punishment last year. The investigation also learned: more than 5,000 pupils with special educational needs in England spent time in isolation children with autism and ADHD have attended isolation one school had five separate isolation rooms, each permanently staffed at an annual cost of more than Â£170,000 some schools prevent pupils from using the playground during the day and the dining hall at lunch two schools - which included a bathroom as part of the facility - do not allow pupils to leave the unit all day. A seclusion room used in a primary school Government guidance in England says schools are free to decide how long pupils should be kept in isolation, but they should be there ""no longer than is necessary"". The guidelines also say that in order for isolation to be lawful as a punishment it should be ""reasonable"" in all circumstances, and factors such as special educational needs should be taken into account. Schools do not need to record use or report to parents that their child has been sent to isolation, although many do. A pupil sitting in an isolation booth Paul Dix says he has probably visited more isolation facilities than anyone else in his work as a behavioural consultant in schools across England. He says he has seen 50 children at one time in isolation in one school and children with Asperger's syndrome and ADHD in isolation rooms and met one child who said they had spent 36 days in isolation in one school year. ""That is not education, it is a custodial sentence,"" he said. ""Where's the regulation around it, where's the reporting, where is the accountability?"" He said he has heard of pupils being placed into isolation for not bringing a pen or wearing the right shoes. Paul says disruptive pupils may need to be removed from classrooms but believes they should be returned after a short period and a discussion of their behaviour with an experienced teacher. ""That is the intelligent way. Isolation is desperation,"" he said. Isolation booths are used in hundreds of schools in England Richard Sheriff is the executive head for eight schools - three of which have rooms with isolation booths - as well as president of the Association of School and College Leaders. He says his schools would never place pupils in isolation booths for five consecutive days, but understands why some schools feel the need to find ways of tackling extreme behaviour. ""There is a gathering storm with regards to student behaviour,"" he says. ""We've seen cuts in services in local authorities, but also in the ability of schools to purchase well-run, good quality alternative provision."" He says a lot of society's problems are now being ""laid at the door of schools"". Richard Sheriff is executive head of three schools which use isolation The government's school behaviour expert, Tom Bennett, says isolation rooms can be effective in tackling disruption in classrooms. ""When you're a lone adult with a class of 25 pupils, it only take two people to really persistently wilfully misbehave for that lesson to be completely detonated,"" he said. He believes removing students from classrooms should be seen as a positive solution. ""It can be a way of preventing fixed-term exclusions by keeping them in the school and being looked after,"" he said.

Â£1 smartphone flash sale comes under fire,"Only three Mi 8 Lite phones could be bought in the first flash sale ""Flash sales"" publicising a Chinese smartphone company's UK launch have sparked a backlash on social media. Xiaomi advertised two of its new handsets for Â£1 each last week as part of a ""crazy deals"" promotion. But it has emerged that each flash sale involved only two or three phones and Xiaomi had set its website to say: ""Sold out,"" as soon as the sale opened. The UK's ads watchdog said it had received a complaint and was now deciding whether to investigate. Xiaomi said it hoped customers would not be discouraged from taking part in future campaigns. ""We've held flash sales all over the world since our first one back in 2013 as a way to give a lucky few customers a chance to get their hands on our smartphones at incredibly low prices,"" said a spokeswoman. ""[This] was our first in the UK and attracted enormous levels of demand, far beyond what we were expecting. ""We're sorry so many Xiaomi fans missed out this time round but we hope they'll take part in future flash sales as and when we announce them."" Xiaomi's business modelis based on selling its hardware at low profit marginsand it has regularly held flash sales in other markets as a relatively cheap way to attract attention and gauge demand. It typicallyoffers thousands of devices,externalat a more realistic prices when doing so. But even when it held a similar â¬1 (88p) event in Spain last year, it provided 50 units. By contrast, the first two UK flash sales involved only three phones apiece, while two follow-ups were limited to two units. This fact was not mentioned on the main sales page. Instead, users had to click ona link to its terms and conditions,external, found at the foot of the site, and then scroll halfway through them. Xiaomi enters UK with phones and scooter Vodafone's break-up advert banned HTC's swimming pool selfie ad attacked Dozens of users complained on Xiaomi's Facebook page after failing to obtain a phone. ""For a company worth around $50bn launching in a brand new country and making a big deal about it they could have done 50 easily. They didn't. They'll lose potential customers over this,""wrote Simon Hodge,external. Another user,James Bowen, said,external: ""What a joke, as soon as the timer hit zero, it was out of stock - just clickbait to get people to visit the website."" One user subsequentlyanalysed the webpage's code,externaland pointed out it had been set to say: ""Sold out,"" as soon as the sale had opened - without even checking to see if the allocated stock had indeed been purchased. Xiaomi held a launch event for its products in London last week However, Xiaomi denied accusations this indicated no phones had been sold at the promised price. Instead, its UK sales manager Wilkin Lee said, a lottery had taken place made up of those who had pressed the button closest to the set time. ""Of the thousands who clicked 'buy' simultaneously, the tie-breaker is done by selecting the winners randomly,""he tweeted,external. But users have complained the terms and conditions made no mention of a lottery, stating only that the phones would be ""given away on [a] first-come, first-serve basis"". Moreover, one user pointed out at one point the texthad not stated how many phones would be offered,external. A spokeswoman for Xiaomi has confirmed that this was the case but added that this ""mistake"" had been fixed the day before the first sale. This could still have consequences as theAdvertising Standards Authority's rules state that consumers must be informed,external""clearly and in a timely fashion"" about the limited availability of a product. ""If the ad didn't include significant conditions and the terms and conditions were changed part way through the promotion, then that could potentially be a problem,"" said a spokesman for the ASA. Xiaomi is the world's fourth-bestselling smartphone brand One marketing expert said there were lessons to be learned. ""Viral campaigns exude novelty but there are growing concerns about whether a PR [public relations] stunt like this comes at the cost of consumer trust,"" said Dr Mariann Hardey, from Durham University. ""Xiaomi's promotion sought to create faith in what is a little-known brand. ""But it has put its reputation in a precarious position by pursuing a marketing campaign that is viral both in terms of spreading widely and having had a damaging effect.""

Hal controlled the spacecraft's functions, but ended up rebelling against its human commanders when they planned to disconnect him after suspecting he was malfunctioning. The film is regarded as a cinematic masterpiece and won an Oscar for Kubrick for best visual effects. Rain's chilling, dry voice is key to the drama, but he wasn't the first choice to play the computer. The director originally selected Oscar winner Martin Balsam - but decided he was ""too colloquially American"". He also considered actor Nigel Davenport in the role, but later concluded he did not want a British voice.

The actor recorded all his lines in 10 hours over two days, with the director sat ""three feet away, explaining the scenes to me and reading all the parts"", he said.

Climate protesters blockade energy department,"Protesters lay chained together on the pavement outside the UK government's energy department Environment activists who have blockaded the UK's energy department in London say 22 people have been arrested during the protest. The Met Police confirmed at least eight protestors have been detained. The UK is seen as a leader in policies to reduce greenhouse gases and will soon be considering tougher targets. But the protesters say research suggests the chance of keeping the global temperature rise under a 2C danger threshold is just one in 20. The demonstrators blocked entry to the offices by lying chained together on the pavement, while some glued themselves to the doors of the department building. Further protests are planned through the week and the demonstrators believe the public will take them seriously, as they are willing to go to jail for their cause. UK steps towards zero-carbon economy Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Some demonstrators also glued themselves to the door of the building They compare themselves with the suffragettes, the anti-apartheid movement, the followers of Gandhi, and the US civil rights movement, although their critics point out that these groups didn't have the vote. They have declared Saturday as Extinction Rebellion Day â the day theyâll commit acts of civil disobedience in the hope of jolting governments round the world into stronger action. Gail Bradbrook says she wants to protect the planet for her children's sake One of the protesters, Gail Bradbrook - a mother of two from Stroud - said: âI want the planet protected for my children. âChange comes when people are willing to commit acts of peaceful civil disobedience. âFifty people in jail for a short time is likely to bring the ecological crisis into the public consciousness.â The first mass meeting of the organisation last month drew 1,000 people to Westminster and blocked roads for two hours. There were 15 arrests. The organisers insist that this weekâs actions will be non-violent. They say if protesters commit an illegal act, they must stay on the spot to face the police. The police told BBC News they expected disruption on Saturday and were prepared for any level of protest. A member of the London Mayorâs office wondered privately if the protesters thought that freeing protesters from cycle locks was a good use of police time. Lizia Wolf said she felt compelled to act But Lizia Wolf told BBC News she felt compelled to act. âThe facts and figures are easily accessible if you have the stomach to look, but here within Extinction Rebellion and certainly with myself, is an offer of friendship, guidance and mutual grief. âThe first step towards creating the changes necessary for survival - and towards solving any problem in general - is to acknowledge the utterly terrifying situation we are in.â The protestersâ short-term aims are to cancel what they call âcontradictoryâ projects they say will actually increase emissions in the UK, such as the third runway at Heathrow, fracking and the Â£30bn roads programme. Their long-term aims are to: Oblige cabinet members to âtell the truthâ about the seriousness of the environmental crisis Make the UK carbon neutral by 2025 (the government is considering 2050 as a date for that) Set up a Peopleâs Assembly of ordinary citizens to decide priorities for reshaping the economy so that protecting the climate becomes Number One priority The aim of persuading some cabinet members to speak out may possibly be achievable. But experts say achieving a zero-emissions economy by 2025 isnât in any scenario. It would need a revolution in transport, home insulation, energy efficiency, agriculture and more. Setting up an assembly of mostly randomly selected citizens to take charge of the great economic shift will surely not be accepted by politicians. Tiana Jacout says she is happy to give up her freedom for the cause At the media launch of Extinction Rebellion, one young woman teared up, asking whether runaway climate change was an acceptable choice, when it was suggested that their demands were unlikely to be met. Another protester, Tiana Jacout, 31, from Bristol, told BBC News: âFinally! Someone has given us all permission to rage against the idea that we are barrelling towards extinction. âWe have been invited to decide, between those unbearable nights of watching the slow-moving car crash that is how humanity treats the world, or standing up for the world we know is possible. âI am happy to give up my freedom for the idea of that, that others can see a better world."" The protesters were boosted bya letter from 100 academics in the Guardian,externalâ including the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams. It said the failure of politicians to tackle climate breakdown and the growing extinction crisis means âthe 'social contract' has been brokenâ¦ [and] it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the governmentâs inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself.â Despite uncertainties in forecasts about the rate of heating, many senior scientists working on environmental change are genuinely alarmed by the huge risks mankind is taking. But can the UK really de-carbonise by 2025? Three professors concerned about the issue - Peter Cox, Jim Skea and Piers Forster - did not believe the timetable demanded by the Extinction Rebellion was possible. To the protesters, this wonât matter much. Theyâre harnessing new media to shake up what they see as societyâs complacency. They say failing to protect the climate isnât an option.

Many cycle tracks 'unsafe for child of 12',"Almost half of the UK's flagship cycling routes are unsafe for a child of 12 to use, a transport charity says. Sustrans says poor surfaces, traffic, and too many barriers are making more than 7,500 miles of tracks inaccessible to young users, and other groups. ""There may as well be a 'no entry' sign on their local path,"" the group's chief executive Xavier Brice said. The group is calling for an overhaul of the 16,575 miles of cycle routes ""to make the network safer for everyone"". It says its long-term goal is to make the network traffic-free and ""safe for a 12-year-old to use on their own"". A route being safe for a 12-year-old is a safety benchmark set by the UK government. But according to Sustrans, two-thirds of the network is on the road - including nearly 2,000 miles of A and B roads. What is stopping women from cycling? 'Lost' cycle ways found on Street View The Paths for Everyone report, a review and independent audit of the network commissioned by Sustrans, classified 42% of the UK's Cycle Network as ""very poor"". As well as being unsafe for children, it says thousands of miles of cycle routes are unsuitable for those with mobility issues and the less physically active. The charity - which itself owns 500 miles of the network - says improvements could be made, including: doubling the number of paths away from cars, from 5,000 to 10,000 miles diverting all routes off busy and fast-moving roads onto quieter routes removing or redesigning 16,000 barriers, to improve accessibility improved safety at road and rail junctions introducing wider, better surfaced paths It says these improvements would cost Â£2.8bn and would lead to the number of users rising from 4.4 million in 2017 to 8.4 million. The review has highlighted 50 so-called ""activation projects"" which Sustrans aims to see completed by 2023, at a cost of Â£60 million. These include: rerouting the National Route 5 between Flint and Connah's Quay in North Wales to circumvent a major A road and create a new traffic-free path following the coastline bridging the River Bann in Northern Ireland to allow cyclists to complete the 113-mile Lap the Lough circuit, ending the current 16-mile detour realigning the National Route 76 in Stirling to avoid the multi-lane Manor Powis roundabout on the A907 Cycling and walking minister Jesse Norman said the cycle network was a great asset for cyclists and walkers but the report showed more needed to be done to make it fully accessible. Earlier in the year, the government announced Â£1m to repair and upgrade sections of the routes. The Scottish Government has committed Â£7m towards the development and maintenance of the paths in Scotland.

The new parents and UK's neo-Nazi terror threat,"Three people have been convicted of belonging to the banned neo-Nazi group National Action. Adam Thomas, 22, and his partner Claudia Patatas, 38, were found guilty with Daniel Bogunovic, 27, of being members of the far-right group - which was proscribed under anti-terror laws after it celebrated the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox. UPDATE 18 December 2018: Thomas and Patatas have been sentenced to six-and-a-half years and five years in prison respectively, and Bogunovic to six years and four months. Three other men who pleaded guilty earlier in the case were also jailed. Here is the story of National Action and the threat posed by its members. It appeared to be a normal home. The property, in a quiet part of an Oxfordshire town, was occupied by a couple who had just welcomed their first child into the world. Neighbours sometimes saw the pair taking their baby out in a pram. The male, who often dressed in combat trousers, worked as a security guard. The woman - a part-time wedding photographer - had, until recently, worked in a clothes shop. But inside their house Adam Thomas and his Portuguese partner Claudia Patatas had created a disturbing world. Adam Thomas Their bedroom was strewn with weapons - machetes, crossbows, an axe under the bed, a Nazi-style dagger. In the hallway were pendants bearing a black sun - a symbol associated with the SS and the occult - and the insignia of the Ku Klux Klan. Cushions emblazoned with swastikas decorated the lounge. In the kitchen, there was a swastika-shaped pastry cutter. The fridge was adorned with a poster by the banned neo-Nazi group National Action, declaring 'Britain is ours - the rest must go'. Adam Thomas with his son A memory card hidden beneath a floorboard under the dining table contained several startling photographs of the couple. In one, Thomas holds the flag of Nazi Germany while Patatas cradles their baby. In another, mother and baby are with a different man, Darren Fletcher, who performs a Nazi salute while both adults hold the flag. Darren Fletcher, Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas Other images found on a mobile phone show Thomas dressed in the distinctive white costume of the KKK, looking down at his son through the eyeholes of a white, peaked hood. The baby, a little over a month old at the time, had been given the middle name Adolf by his parents - in tribute to the leader of Nazi Germany. The pictures were found by counter terrorism detectives who arrived at the property early in the morning of 3 January this year to arrest Thomas and Patatas for membership of National Action - a group that had been banned under terrorism legislation in December 2016. Alex Davies (l) and Ben Raymond National Action was founded in 2013 by Ben Raymond, now 29, and Alex Davies, now 24. At the time, Raymond, a recent politics graduate from the University of Essex and avowed neo-Nazi, was living in Bognor Regis. After university, he had drifted into a job as a double-glazing salesman and would go on to work at a job centre, assisting claimants. Much of his free time was spent online immersed in disturbing extreme right-wing content. He designed memes, edited videos, and wrote long diatribes, including for the obscure Integralist Party, which was seeking a ""nationwide fascist army"" for its ""racial religion that inspires and demands fanaticism"". Ben Raymond It was that online activity that first attracted Davies, a University of Warwick student from Carmarthen and member of the British National Party. By then, the party was in steep decline from its best ever performance in European elections four years earlier. The pair believed that, in recent years, British far-right organisations had diluted their message by seeking to appeal beyond their core support. National Action's founders determined that, in contrast, the group would be unashamedly racist and overtly neo-Nazi. Alex Davies It had all the characteristics of post-war neo-Nazism - hatred of non-white and Jewish people, a worldview entirely based on racism, veneration of white ""Aryans"", and lionisation of the Nazi era and its worst war criminals. Davies was eventually forced out of Warwick university for his far-right political activities and moved back to Wales, where he eventually found work as an insurance salesman. The pair believed young people across the UK would eagerly embrace the group's toxic blend of Hitler worship, Holocaust denial, and malicious conspiracy theories. In reality, it would never exceed 100 members and those it did attract were a disparate set of fanatics united by various deviancies and irrational hatreds. No attempt was made at engaging in democratic politics, with the organisation instead regarding itself as a youth-based street movement. Its logo was strikingly similar to the paramilitary arm of the Nazi party - the Sturmabteilung, or SA Recruitment focused on those in their teens and 20s, although some of those targeted were children of secondary school age. The group's strategy initially involved leafleting university campuses. But it soon turned to organising aggressive publicity stunts and city-centre demonstrations, with activities chronicled on the group's website and social media channels. As it grew, National Action developed into a clandestine network of small, regional networks, with senior figures in each cooperating at a national level. National Action regional map Members, who dressed in black during demonstrations, promoted the idea that the UK was on the brink of a ""race war"" and that a predatory elite was deliberately encouraging immigration in an attempt to destroy the native white population. The group claimed to be patriotic, but was hostile to all domestic institutions, the rule of law, the democratic process, and everyone who did not share its worldview. Politicians and other public servants were a particular focus of hatred. During one speech, senior National Action member Matthew Hankinson said they would ensure that ""traitors"" ended up ""hanging from lampposts"". ""We must be ruthless - and if innocent people are cut down in the process, then so be it,"" he said. Matthew Hankinson The organisation was openly genocidal and said that all Jewish and non-white people would have to go. In one document it declared: ""It is with glee that we will enact the final solution across Europe."" But National Action did not restrict itself to admiration for the Nazis. Its members also took inspiration from the Khmer Rouge, the brutal regime that ruled Cambodia in the late 1970s under the Marxist leader Pol Pot; the radical right-wing Norwegian terrorist and mass murderer Anders Breivik; and even the Islamic State group. Anders Breivik Online, the group announced: ""We are the white jihad"" and ""Our motto is 'Long Live Death!' because only those who are willing to die for their beliefs are truly alive."" The logic of such ideas ends in violence - and violence, both planned and executed, is what they generated. In 2015, Zack Davies, a 25-year-old member from Mold, North Wales, used a hammer and machete to attack a Sikh dentist in a Tesco store because of his skin colour. Davies shouted, ""White power"" during the assault, for which he was later convicted of attempted murder. He had earlier posed for a selfie in front of a National Action flag while holding a blade. Zack Davies The following year Jack Coulson, a then 17-year-old member from Bradford, West Yorkshire, was arrested by counter terrorism police after posting images of a homemade pipe-bomb on Snapchat, along with threats against Muslims. Coulson, who would be convicted of making explosives, had joined National Action months earlier and was associating with older members both in person and online. Jack Coulson dressed in a Nazi uniform On the day in June 2016 that Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered by the white supremacist Thomas Mair, the teenager took to social media to say: ""There's one less race traitor in Britain thanks to this man."" ""He's a hero, we need more people like him to butcher the race traitors,"" Coulson continued. An official National Action Twitter account also celebrated the murder, stating: ""Don't let this man's sacrifice go in vain,"" and ""Only 649 MPs to go #WhiteJihad."" National Action tweet By 2016, Christopher Lythgoe, a former regional leader for the North West, was heading up the whole group. Raymond and Davies remained influential figures, but it was Lythgoe, now 32, who sought to enforce structure and rigour on the entire organisation. He lived with his parents in Warrington, worked infrequently in warehouses, and spent much of his time trying to turn National Action into a paramilitary-style organisation. He drew up detailed manuals, explaining things like how to carry flags correctly, and sent hectoring emails to other members. In one, he wrote: ""Just a reminder guys that National Action now operates what I like to call a No-Deadweight Policy. That means everyone trains in case we need it. We don't carry anyone. No exceptions."" He added: ""Imagine what it will be like when we have 20, 30, 50 or more guys who can ALL punch unconscious an 18-stone adversary. AND we will fight as one disciplined body. That's what I would call formidable unit. So like I said, We all train."" Christopher Lythgoe Training included boxing, martial arts, and a series of outdoor training camps. One such camp - where participants were expected to ""drink mead and live like Vikings"" - ended in farce when one neo-Nazi ended up sleeping in a phone box to escape rain and snow. But one need not consider the group's paramilitary fantasies realistic to find them troubling and dangerous. The threat National Action posed came from the hatred it encouraged, which generated a very real threat to the general public and anyone chosen as a target by those it radicalised. A government assessment in late 2016 concluded the group was ""concerned in terrorism"", and described it as ""virulently racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic"". It became the first far-right group to be proscribed in this country since World War Two. The move, which made membership of National Action a criminal offence, was specifically linked to its glorification of terrorism and extreme violence. National Action promoting one of its ""conferences"" Ahead of the ban, the group's leadership came together via a secure conference call, including Lythgoe, founders Raymond and Davies, and regional organisers. Lythgoe insisted the group carry on as usual - just without the name or more obvious public trappings. In the days before the ban, he sent his followers a series of emails. ""Long term we'll keep moving forward just as we have been,"" stated one. Another, sent to the regional leaders, said: ""Make sure you maintain contact with ALL your members. Reassure them that they will be personally ok as long as they don't promote NA from Friday on. Make sure that they understand that the SUBSTANCE of NA is the people, our talents, the bonds between us, our ideas, and our sustained force of will. All of that will continue into the future. We're just shedding one skin for another.  All genuinely revolutionary movements in the past have needed to exist partly underground. These are exciting times."" One of those on Lythgoe's mailing list was Alex Deakin, leader for the Midlands. Less than two hours after getting the email, Deakin used the encrypted messaging app Telegram to create a chat group that became his main regional organising tool for National Action after the ban. He called it the Triple KKK Mafia, a reference to the Ku Klux Klan. Over time, the chat group would have as many as 21 people in it. He created another one - called Inner - which contained a select band of seven from the larger chat group. Alex Deakin Deakin, now 24, from Birmingham, was a university student who had been radicalised on the internet. In September 2016, after spending two years studying in Aberystwyth, he dropped out and transferred to a history course at the University of Coventry. He told one contact his path to National Action involved ""getting redpilled by forums, spending years arguing online, and then finally deciding to take action when this group impressed me"". Deakin regularly reported back to Lythgoe and co-founder Raymond, telling them about his efforts to recruit new members, organise existing ones, and spread National Action propaganda. Alex Deakin Messages in the year before the ban show the extent of his delusional ambitions. In an exchange about targeting working class cities, he wrote: ""We should move to radicalise these areas, turning them into NI [Northern Irish] style sectarian ghettoes would be the first target to fermenting race war."" In correspondence with Lythgoe, Deakin stated: ""Like the IRA and Viet Cong we'd need to have embedded local support among the communities we'd fight in; streets and cul-de-sacs would function as barracks as supportive locals would shelter us, and it would be necessary to fade into the background at moment's notice."" The nature of such conversations only intensified once the group had been proscribed. In the Midlands, the organisation ceased overt campaigning, but members continued to communicate, meet up, seek new recruits, and encourage one another's worst tendencies. There were explicit references to the the fact that National Action still existed. In one message, Deakin said: ""Anyway the Midlands group continues under the name Triple K Mafia."" In another, Adam Thomas wrote: ""So since NA has been destroyed, the leadership generally of NA agreed it's to be disbanded. No attempt at revival. But the Midlands branch of NA, which is just 17-20 of us, have decided to ignore this... Midlands will continue the fight alone."" Messages in the Telegram group, numbering in the thousands, show members using violent racist language, discussing their desire for a ""race war"", and fantasising about the murder of those they hated. Deakin wrote that all Jewish people should be ""burned"", and that Chinese and black people should be turned into ""biofuel"". A member from Wolverhampton, Darren Fletcher, 28, referred to Thomas Mair, the killer of Jo Cox, when he asked: ""Why aren't there more Mairs out there? We need a good few hundred of them to sort out these anti-white MPs."" Darren Fletcher and Adam Thomas Fletcher, a truck driver and old friend of Adam Thomas, had once been jailed after posting videos on YouTube of himself on stage at an extremist music event dressed in a KKK outfit, hanging a life-sized golliwog doll from a noose. When Fletcher wrote that people in government should be killed, he received support from Thomas, who said: ""I agree bump them off but there's 600MPs unless you take them all down in one go they will just replace each other."" Claudia Patatas, who studied to postgraduate level in Portugal before moving to the UK over a decade ago, had spent years as a marketing professional. In public she provided bland quotes to corporate journals, while in private she wrote messages exclaiming: ""All Jews must be put to death"" and ""bring back those concentration camps."" Claudia Patatas and a KKK flag in her home She told members of the group that ""Adolf is life"" and was enthusiastic about holding a celebration for Hitler's birthday, recalling one she had attended in Lisbon years earlier. ""We had a cake with the fuhrer face,"" she described, before adding, ""I did struggle to slice his face"". Claudia Patatas Perhaps the most dangerous member of the group was a serving lance corporal in the British Army. Mikko Vehvilainen, now 34, joined the Army in 2012, having earlier spent time in the navy in Finland, the homeland of his father. In an email to one friend, he wrote: ""I'm only in to learn useful combat skills."" The married father of young children, an adherent of a white supremacist interpretation of Christianity called Christian Identity, was a senior National Action member obsessed with ideas about the collapse of civilisation and racial war. Mikko Vehvilainen In a diary entry last year, beneath the heading ""key points for leadership meeting"", he referred to ""later stages terrorism, civil disorder, destruction of infrastructure and power grid"". In another document, he said there a was a need to be ""prepared to fight and die for your race in a possible last stand for our survival"". ""Every part of me wants war. There is no other way,"" he wrote in one message on Telegram. His personal weapons collection, stockpiled for what he appeared to regard as imminent conflicts, included legally held firearms, as well as knives, machetes, knuckle dusters, a crossbow, a bow and arrow, pepper spray, handcuffs, and a so-called war hammer bearing the Biblical inscription: ""There is no peace, says the Lord, for the wicked."" Vehvilainen's weapon collection - and photo of him performing a Nazi salute The solider, latterly based at the Army's Welsh headquarters in Powys, actively sought recruits from those serving under him in the Royal Anglian Regiment. Three men holding the rank of private were invited into the main Telegram group after Vehvilainen told Deakin they were ""committed"" Nazis. One of them, Mark Barrett, wrote racist messages in the chat group, and had Vehvilainen, another of the soldiers, and a National Action member called Nathan Pryke, over to his Army property where they spent an evening firing arrows at a burning cross in the back garden. Vehvilainen, who served in Afghanistan, was also keen that civilian neo-Nazis join him in the forces, telling them: ""If we get enough of us into the Army, we'll be in the right place when things start to collapse."" He wrote in the Inner chat group that National Action members should focus on gaining ""military and key civil positions"". Nathan Pryke Four National Action members in his circle had been, or were, attempting to join the Army: Alex Deakin, Adam Thomas, Nathan Pryke, a 27-year-old a van driver from Cambridgeshire, and Joel Wilmore, 24, originally from Lincolnshire, who had served in the Territorial Army before entering a sensitive job as an information security expert. This involved acting as an ""ethical hacker"" in order to test the strength of organisational IT systems. Vehvilainen advised Thomas and offered to act as a referee of good character. Thomas, in turn, asked if he could buy a gun from Vehvilainen and whether anybody would notice if assault rifles were stolen from his base. But, before anything more could happen, the group was disrupted. For several months, detectives from West Midlands Police had been investigating an incident in July 2016 during which several men had pasted National Action stickers at the Aston University campus in Birmingham. In spring 2017, some of the suspects were arrested, including Alex Deakin. Incriminating chat groups were found on his phone, and that of another man who cannot be named for legal reasons. After being released under investigation, Deakin sent a panicked email to several National Action contacts. ""My seized phone is full of texts that will mark me as an organizer,"" he wrote. ""I understand if you despise me for this sloppiness (it really couldn't have been worse if I tried)."" Alex Deakin Deakin's ""sloppiness"" led to three trials at Birmingham Crown Court this year, many details of which can only be reported now that the final one has concluded. The first, which ended in April, saw Deakin himself, Vehvilainen and soldier Mark Barrett stand trial accused of National Action membership. Barrett was acquitted, but his co-defendants were convicted and received eight-year prison sentences. The three had been arrested in September 2017, along with the other two soldiers in the chat group, both of whom were released without charge. Only Barrett elected to give evidence, telling the court that he had not joined National Action despite being in the Telegram chat group and that he regretted his racist postings. Alex Deakin and Mikko Vehvilainen Deakin was also convicted of two counts of possessing documents useful to someone preparing an act of terrorism - including bomb-making manuals and an instructional book for white extremists - which were found on his laptop. He was further convicted of distributing a terrorist publication, for sending a document called Ethnic Cleansing Operations to the National Action co-founder Ben Raymond and two other contacts. Vehvilainen was cleared of stirring up racial hatred for using a Christian Identity online forum to write racist posts. Among other things, he wrote: ""I have vowed to fight the Jew forever in any way possible,"" and used the word ""beasts"" to refer to black people. Referring to his position in the Army, he had written: ""There are ways around everything and I've simply learned to avoid beasts."" He added: ""The sooner they're eliminated the better."" It is understood that both Vehvilainen and Barrett have since been discharged from the Army. The other two arrested soldiers were disciplined but not discharged, although one has since left voluntarily. Lt Col Jackie Fletcher, from the Army personnel branch, described them as ""exceptional cases"". ""These are very rare in the Army,"" she said. ""The Army's value and standards are very clear for soldiers and any individual found to breach those value and standards will have action taken against them."" The second trial, which ended in May, saw Deakin and three other men convicted of stirring up racial hatred in relation to the sticker campaign at Aston University - Daniel Bogunovic, 27, a warehouse worker and beekeeper from Leicester, Chad Wiliams-Allen, 27, a pre-ban National Action member and welder from West Bromwich, as well as a man in his early 20s who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Chad Williams-Allen, Daniel Bogunovic and Alex Deakin In the third case, that of Thomas, Patatas and Bogunovic, three other defendants pleaded guilty to membership of National Action in pre-trial hearings. They were Darren Fletcher, Nathan Pryke, and Joel Wilmore. Wilmore also admitted to possessing terrorist information, namely a document called Homemade Molotov Cocktails. Thomas, who was also convicted of possessing a bomb-making manual, was the only one to give evidence. Adam Thomas, Claudia Patatas, Daniel Bogunovic, Darren Fletcher, Nathan Pryke and Joel Wilmore The former Amazon security guard admitted being a racist and told jurors he had been exposed to such beliefs from a young age, adding that his stepfather was in a ""white power band"" and had started shaving Thomas's head at the age of five. He also described telling a female Holocaust survivor, whom he visited with a government de-radicalisation mentor, that he ""couldn't see"" how she could have endured the WW2 Nazi death camps. Thomas told jurors that, aged 18, he went to Israel and considered converting to Judaism because it would have allowed him to join the Israeli military The BBC has spoken to people who knew Thomas in Israel. David Simpkins, who shared a room with him at the Machon Meir yeshiva in Jerusalem, said his roommate used the name Avi Ben Abraham. Simpkins said Thomas had described a ""horrible childhood which he characterised as a situation of constantly being bullied, growing up with far-right British extremists who were also neo-Nazis"". Thomas disclosed that he first ""started learning about Judaism to discover why he was supposed to hate them,"" Simpkins recalled. He described Thomas as ""extremely intelligent"" but said he had ""an extreme approach to Judaism"" and wanted to join a small fringe group which regards most Jewish people as heretics. ""The rabbis decided that Adam needed to deal with his childhood professionally and return to convert with a clear head,"" he said. ""He was making the common mistake many who desire conversion make, which is to replace one psychological extreme with another."" Avishai Grosser, who works with converts, told the BBC that Thomas, who ""knew big proportions of the Torah by heart"", dropped out of several conversion programmes and eventually ended up on the streets before returning to the UK. It is understood that, after he returned, he told people in far-right circles that his time in Israel related to an involvement with the white supremacist Christian Identity movement. It was around this time that he got to know Patatas through National Action chat groups. They met for the first time at a pub social in December 2016 and soon moved in together. Adam Thomas in Israel Before proscription, National Action may have been ""perceived as just one of those groups who incited racial hatred and were racist"", says Det Chief Supt Matt Ward from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. He explains how his team's understanding of the threat posed by National Action has ""changed considerably"" during their investigations. Events after it was banned, he says, show ""a really dangerous, well-structured organisation at the heart of a neo-Nazi ideology that seeks to divide communities, is preparing to instigate and wage a race war within the United Kingdom and has spent years acquiring skills, tactics, weapons, recruiting and training people to be able to do that."" As in the Midlands, National Action had continued operating covertly in the North West, but had continued more overtly in several other English regions and Scotland using the aliases NS131 and Scottish Dawn. There are ongoing inquiries into people associated with the group, and several trials have already taken place elsewhere in the UK. At the Old Bailey in July, Christopher Lythgoe and Matthew Hankinson, both from the North West, were convicted of membership offences in a trial that saw another man plead guilty to threatening to kill a female police officer, and preparing an act of terrorism by buying a machete in order to kill Labour MP Rosie Cooper. Mr Justice Jay, sentencing Lythgoe and Hankinson to eight and six years in prison respectively, said their ""truly evil and dystopian vision"" could never ""have been achieved through the activities of National Action, a very small group operating at the very periphery of far-right wing extremism"". But he said, ""The real risk to society inheres instead in the carrying out of isolated acts of terror,"" inspired by what he described as the group's ""perverted ideology"". What of the National Action founders who inspired such hatred? We found Ben Raymond and Alex Davies living at separate addresses in Swansea. Both were arrested in September 2017 on suspicion of membership of National Action but have been told they will not be charged. Raymond was also arrested on suspicion of possessing terrorist material and remains under investigation for that. The police enquiries relate to their involvement with the far-right group NS131, which had been created after National Action had been banned. Last year, it was also proscribed. NS131 promotional image The men have continued to make public pronouncements. Earlier this year, Davies used an online neo-Nazi radio station to call for far-right activists to engage in a campaign of ""direct action"" against the Labour MP who succeeded Jo Cox as the MP for Batley and Spen. Raymond used the same radio station to discuss the trial of Lythgoe and Hankinson while it was ongoing and declare the defendants ""innocent men"". The BBC asked both Raymond and Davies for an interview, but they declined. We wanted to ask whether they accept any responsibility for all that has happened and about their relationship with National Action members since proscription. For example, a private gym in Warrington set up by group leader Lythgoe for violent training sessions was made possible by Â£1,500 given to him by Davies - who then visited it along with members of the group after the ban. Raymond continued communicating with members of National Action, post-proscription, via encrypted emails and applications. He was an active member of both the Midlands Telegram groups - musing on racial theory, engaging in anti-Semitism, discussing his correspondence with neo-Nazis abroad, and lecturing the others on the threat from infiltrators. On the day National Action was banned, Raymond had emailed several contacts, including Deakin and Lythgoe, to say he was ""super excited about working on all the new projects"". Later chat messages show Deakin saying Raymond was responsible for designing propaganda material after proscription. A hidden webpage containing Raymond's designs over several years, which includes propaganda drawings depicting sexual violence, suggests he created logos for several proposed groups in the period after the National Action ban. Deakin also kept on reporting back to Raymond - in the same way he had done before proscription - sending him messages about, for example, building dossiers on ""problematic"" individuals and a sinister idea about creating fake ""rabidly anti-white propaganda"" and ""rabidly pro-Jewish propaganda to push people over the edge"". When the BBC returned to Swansea with a television camera and approached Raymond in the street outside his bedsit, he swore at us and fled inside, refusing to answer questions. This video can not be played  What will happen to the National Action network in the longer term is unclear. Already proscribed under two aliases - NS131 and Scottish Dawn - it may yet be banned under others, too. The Islamist group al-Muhajiroun, based around the notorious British radical preacher Anjem Choudary, has been proscribed under nine other names, but the network of individuals has persisted and been involved in many acts of terrorism. National Action is not the first violent neo-Nazi group in this country since WW2. In the 1960s, members of several organisations attacked synagogues and engaged in paramilitary-style training. The far-right group Combat 18 was later involved in multiple acts of violence and intimidation. In the late 1990s, the London nail bomber David Copeland was an activist in the now defunct National Socialist Movement. David Copeland who bombed the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho and other targets in London The neo-Nazi threat in this country, while persistent, is not large. But it is potent in that those radicalised by its ideas have given themselves to such a violent and hateful creed that some terrorist activity will inevitably follow. The lies espoused by the extreme right - of Aryan supremacy and global Jewish conspiracies - are out there, old ideas spread by modern means, their promoters emboldened in and by the fractious political climate. The danger also appears to be growing, with police reporting an increase in the number of foiled far-right terror plots - five since March 2017 - and the murder of Jo Cox and the Finsbury Park vehicle attack clear evidence of what radicalised individuals can do. Last month, the UK's most senior counter terrorism officer, Met Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, told MPs that around 80% of the 700 live terror investigations were focused on Islamist Jihadists, with around 20% now focused on others, including a ""significant number of right-wing ideological threats"". In the wake of the terrorist attacks in the UK last year, an official review recommended an increased role for MI5 in tackling extreme right-wing terrorism, with the aim being to ensure equivalence in how terrorism is dealt with, irrespective of the ideology that inspires it. Implementation of the recommendation has started, with the security service beginning to take the lead for an area that has previously been the preserve of the police.

The new parents and the neo-Nazi terror threat,"Three people have been convicted of belonging to the banned neo-Nazi group National Action. Adam Thomas, 22, and his partner Claudia Patatas, 38, were found guilty with Daniel Bogunovic, 27, of being members of the far-right group - which was proscribed under anti-terror laws after it celebrated the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox. UPDATE 18 December 2018: Thomas and Patatas have been sentenced to six-and-a-half years and five years in prison respectively, and Bogunovic to six years and four months. Three other men who pleaded guilty earlier in the case were also jailed. Here is the story of National Action and the threat posed by its members. It appeared to be a normal home. The property, in a quiet part of an Oxfordshire town, was occupied by a couple who had just welcomed their first child into the world. Neighbours sometimes saw the pair taking their baby out in a pram. The male, who often dressed in combat trousers, worked as a security guard. The woman - a part-time wedding photographer - had, until recently, worked in a clothes shop. But inside their house Adam Thomas and his Portuguese partner Claudia Patatas had created a disturbing world. Adam Thomas Their bedroom was strewn with weapons - machetes, crossbows, an axe under the bed, a Nazi-style dagger. In the hallway were pendants bearing a black sun - a symbol associated with the SS and the occult - and the insignia of the Ku Klux Klan. Cushions emblazoned with swastikas decorated the lounge. In the kitchen, there was a swastika-shaped pastry cutter. The fridge was adorned with a poster by the banned neo-Nazi group National Action, declaring 'Britain is ours - the rest must go'. Adam Thomas with his son A memory card hidden beneath a floorboard under the dining table contained several startling photographs of the couple. In one, Thomas holds the flag of Nazi Germany while Patatas cradles their baby. In another, mother and baby are with a different man, Darren Fletcher, who performs a Nazi salute while both adults hold the flag. Darren Fletcher, Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas Other images found on a mobile phone show Thomas dressed in the distinctive white costume of the KKK, looking down at his son through the eyeholes of a white, peaked hood. The baby, a little over a month old at the time, had been given the middle name Adolf by his parents - in tribute to the leader of Nazi Germany. The pictures were found by counter terrorism detectives who arrived at the property early in the morning of 3 January this year to arrest Thomas and Patatas for membership of National Action - a group that had been banned under terrorism legislation in December 2016. Alex Davies (l) and Ben Raymond National Action was founded in 2013 by Ben Raymond, now 29, and Alex Davies, now 24. At the time, Raymond, a recent politics graduate from the University of Essex and avowed neo-Nazi, was living in Bognor Regis. After university, he had drifted into a job as a double-glazing salesman and would go on to work at a job centre, assisting claimants. Much of his free time was spent online immersed in disturbing extreme right-wing content. He designed memes, edited videos, and wrote long diatribes, including for the obscure Integralist Party, which was seeking a ""nationwide fascist army"" for its ""racial religion that inspires and demands fanaticism"". Ben Raymond It was that online activity that first attracted Davies, a University of Warwick student from Carmarthen and member of the British National Party. By then, the party was in steep decline from its best ever performance in European elections four years earlier. The pair believed that, in recent years, British far-right organisations had diluted their message by seeking to appeal beyond their core support. National Action's founders determined that, in contrast, the group would be unashamedly racist and overtly neo-Nazi. Alex Davies It had all the characteristics of post-war neo-Nazism - hatred of non-white and Jewish people, a worldview entirely based on racism, veneration of white ""Aryans"", and lionisation of the Nazi era and its worst war criminals. Davies was eventually forced out of Warwick university for his far-right political activities and moved back to Wales, where he eventually found work as an insurance salesman. The pair believed young people across the UK would eagerly embrace the group's toxic blend of Hitler worship, Holocaust denial, and malicious conspiracy theories. In reality, it would never exceed 100 members and those it did attract were a disparate set of fanatics united by various deviancies and irrational hatreds. No attempt was made at engaging in democratic politics, with the organisation instead regarding itself as a youth-based street movement. Its logo was strikingly similar to the paramilitary arm of the Nazi party - the Sturmabteilung, or SA Recruitment focused on those in their teens and 20s, although some of those targeted were children of secondary school age. The group's strategy initially involved leafleting university campuses. But it soon turned to organising aggressive publicity stunts and city-centre demonstrations, with activities chronicled on the group's website and social media channels. As it grew, National Action developed into a clandestine network of small, regional networks, with senior figures in each cooperating at a national level. National Action regional map Members, who dressed in black during demonstrations, promoted the idea that the UK was on the brink of a ""race war"" and that a predatory elite was deliberately encouraging immigration in an attempt to destroy the native white population. The group claimed to be patriotic, but was hostile to all domestic institutions, the rule of law, the democratic process, and everyone who did not share its worldview. Politicians and other public servants were a particular focus of hatred. During one speech, senior National Action member Matthew Hankinson said they would ensure that ""traitors"" ended up ""hanging from lampposts"". ""We must be ruthless - and if innocent people are cut down in the process, then so be it,"" he said. Matthew Hankinson The organisation was openly genocidal and said that all Jewish and non-white people would have to go. In one document it declared: ""It is with glee that we will enact the final solution across Europe."" But National Action did not restrict itself to admiration for the Nazis. Its members also took inspiration from the Khmer Rouge, the brutal regime that ruled Cambodia in the late 1970s under the Marxist leader Pol Pot; the radical right-wing Norwegian terrorist and mass murderer Anders Breivik; and even the Islamic State group. Anders Breivik Online, the group announced: ""We are the white jihad"" and ""Our motto is 'Long Live Death!' because only those who are willing to die for their beliefs are truly alive."" The logic of such ideas ends in violence - and violence, both planned and executed, is what they generated. In 2015, Zack Davies, a 25-year-old member from Mold, North Wales, used a hammer and machete to attack a Sikh dentist in a Tesco store because of his skin colour. Davies shouted, ""White power"" during the assault, for which he was later convicted of attempted murder. He had earlier posed for a selfie in front of a National Action flag while holding a blade. Zack Davies The following year Jack Coulson, a then 17-year-old member from Bradford, West Yorkshire, was arrested by counter terrorism police after posting images of a homemade pipe-bomb on Snapchat, along with threats against Muslims. Coulson, who would be convicted of making explosives, had joined National Action months earlier and was associating with older members both in person and online. Jack Coulson dressed in a Nazi uniform On the day in June 2016 that Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered by the white supremacist Thomas Mair, the teenager took to social media to say: ""There's one less race traitor in Britain thanks to this man."" ""He's a hero, we need more people like him to butcher the race traitors,"" Coulson continued. An official National Action Twitter account also celebrated the murder, stating: ""Don't let this man's sacrifice go in vain,"" and ""Only 649 MPs to go #WhiteJihad."" National Action tweet By 2016, Christopher Lythgoe, a former regional leader for the North West, was heading up the whole group. Raymond and Davies remained influential figures, but it was Lythgoe, now 32, who sought to enforce structure and rigour on the entire organisation. He lived with his parents in Warrington, worked infrequently in warehouses, and spent much of his time trying to turn National Action into a paramilitary-style organisation. He drew up detailed manuals, explaining things like how to carry flags correctly, and sent hectoring emails to other members. In one, he wrote: ""Just a reminder guys that National Action now operates what I like to call a No-Deadweight Policy. That means everyone trains in case we need it. We don't carry anyone. No exceptions."" He added: ""Imagine what it will be like when we have 20, 30, 50 or more guys who can ALL punch unconscious an 18-stone adversary. AND we will fight as one disciplined body. That's what I would call formidable unit. So like I said, We all train."" Christopher Lythgoe Training included boxing, martial arts, and a series of outdoor training camps. One such camp - where participants were expected to ""drink mead and live like Vikings"" - ended in farce when one neo-Nazi ended up sleeping in a phone box to escape rain and snow. But one need not consider the group's paramilitary fantasies realistic to find them troubling and dangerous. The threat National Action posed came from the hatred it encouraged, which generated a very real threat to the general public and anyone chosen as a target by those it radicalised. A government assessment in late 2016 concluded the group was ""concerned in terrorism"", and described it as ""virulently racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic"". It became the first far-right group to be proscribed in this country since World War Two. The move, which made membership of National Action a criminal offence, was specifically linked to its glorification of terrorism and extreme violence. National Action promoting one of its ""conferences"" Ahead of the ban, the group's leadership came together via a secure conference call, including Lythgoe, founders Raymond and Davies, and regional organisers. Lythgoe insisted the group carry on as usual - just without the name or more obvious public trappings. In the days before the ban, he sent his followers a series of emails. ""Long term we'll keep moving forward just as we have been,"" stated one. Another, sent to the regional leaders, said: ""Make sure you maintain contact with ALL your members. Reassure them that they will be personally ok as long as they don't promote NA from Friday on. Make sure that they understand that the SUBSTANCE of NA is the people, our talents, the bonds between us, our ideas, and our sustained force of will. All of that will continue into the future. We're just shedding one skin for another.  All genuinely revolutionary movements in the past have needed to exist partly underground. These are exciting times."" One of those on Lythgoe's mailing list was Alex Deakin, leader for the Midlands. Less than two hours after getting the email, Deakin used the encrypted messaging app Telegram to create a chat group that became his main regional organising tool for National Action after the ban. He called it the Triple KKK Mafia, a reference to the Ku Klux Klan. Over time, the chat group would have as many as 21 people in it. He created another one - called Inner - which contained a select band of seven from the larger chat group. Alex Deakin Deakin, now 24, from Birmingham, was a university student who had been radicalised on the internet. In September 2016, after spending two years studying in Aberystwyth, he dropped out and transferred to a history course at the University of Coventry. He told one contact his path to National Action involved ""getting redpilled by forums, spending years arguing online, and then finally deciding to take action when this group impressed me"". Deakin regularly reported back to Lythgoe and co-founder Raymond, telling them about his efforts to recruit new members, organise existing ones, and spread National Action propaganda. Alex Deakin Messages in the year before the ban show the extent of his delusional ambitions. In an exchange about targeting working class cities, he wrote: ""We should move to radicalise these areas, turning them into NI [Northern Irish] style sectarian ghettoes would be the first target to fermenting race war."" In correspondence with Lythgoe, Deakin stated: ""Like the IRA and Viet Cong we'd need to have embedded local support among the communities we'd fight in; streets and cul-de-sacs would function as barracks as supportive locals would shelter us, and it would be necessary to fade into the background at moment's notice."" The nature of such conversations only intensified once the group had been proscribed. In the Midlands, the organisation ceased overt campaigning, but members continued to communicate, meet up, seek new recruits, and encourage one another's worst tendencies. There were explicit references to the the fact that National Action still existed. In one message, Deakin said: ""Anyway the Midlands group continues under the name Triple K Mafia."" In another, Adam Thomas wrote: ""So since NA has been destroyed, the leadership generally of NA agreed it's to be disbanded. No attempt at revival. But the Midlands branch of NA, which is just 17-20 of us, have decided to ignore this... Midlands will continue the fight alone."" Messages in the Telegram group, numbering in the thousands, show members using violent racist language, discussing their desire for a ""race war"", and fantasising about the murder of those they hated. Deakin wrote that all Jewish people should be ""burned"", and that Chinese and black people should be turned into ""biofuel"". A member from Wolverhampton, Darren Fletcher, 28, referred to Thomas Mair, the killer of Jo Cox, when he asked: ""Why aren't there more Mairs out there? We need a good few hundred of them to sort out these anti-white MPs."" Darren Fletcher and Adam Thomas Fletcher, a truck driver and old friend of Adam Thomas, had once been jailed after posting videos on YouTube of himself on stage at an extremist music event dressed in a KKK outfit, hanging a life-sized golliwog doll from a noose. When Fletcher wrote that people in government should be killed, he received support from Thomas, who said: ""I agree bump them off but there's 600MPs unless you take them all down in one go they will just replace each other."" Claudia Patatas, who studied to postgraduate level in Portugal before moving to the UK over a decade ago, had spent years as a marketing professional. In public she provided bland quotes to corporate journals, while in private she wrote messages exclaiming: ""All Jews must be put to death"" and ""bring back those concentration camps."" Claudia Patatas and a KKK flag in her home She told members of the group that ""Adolf is life"" and was enthusiastic about holding a celebration for Hitler's birthday, recalling one she had attended in Lisbon years earlier. ""We had a cake with the fuhrer face,"" she described, before adding, ""I did struggle to slice his face"". Claudia Patatas Perhaps the most dangerous member of the group was a serving lance corporal in the British Army. Mikko Vehvilainen, now 34, joined the Army in 2012, having earlier spent time in the navy in Finland, the homeland of his father. In an email to one friend, he wrote: ""I'm only in to learn useful combat skills."" The married father of young children, an adherent of a white supremacist interpretation of Christianity called Christian Identity, was a senior National Action member obsessed with ideas about the collapse of civilisation and racial war. Mikko Vehvilainen In a diary entry last year, beneath the heading ""key points for leadership meeting"", he referred to ""later stages terrorism, civil disorder, destruction of infrastructure and power grid"". In another document, he said there a was a need to be ""prepared to fight and die for your race in a possible last stand for our survival"". ""Every part of me wants war. There is no other way,"" he wrote in one message on Telegram. His personal weapons collection, stockpiled for what he appeared to regard as imminent conflicts, included legally held firearms, as well as knives, machetes, knuckle dusters, a crossbow, a bow and arrow, pepper spray, handcuffs, and a so-called war hammer bearing the Biblical inscription: ""There is no peace, says the Lord, for the wicked."" Vehvilainen's weapon collection - and photo of him performing a Nazi salute The solider, latterly based at the Army's Welsh headquarters in Powys, actively sought recruits from those serving under him in the Royal Anglian Regiment. Three men holding the rank of private were invited into the main Telegram group after Vehvilainen told Deakin they were ""committed"" Nazis. One of them, Mark Barrett, wrote racist messages in the chat group, and had Vehvilainen, another of the soldiers, and a National Action member called Nathan Pryke, over to his Army property where they spent an evening firing arrows at a burning cross in the back garden. Vehvilainen, who served in Afghanistan, was also keen that civilian neo-Nazis join him in the forces, telling them: ""If we get enough of us into the Army, we'll be in the right place when things start to collapse."" He wrote in the Inner chat group that National Action members should focus on gaining ""military and key civil positions"". Nathan Pryke Four National Action members in his circle had been, or were, attempting to join the Army: Alex Deakin, Adam Thomas, Nathan Pryke, a 27-year-old a van driver from Cambridgeshire, and Joel Wilmore, 24, originally from Lincolnshire, who had served in the Territorial Army before entering a sensitive job as an information security expert. This involved acting as an ""ethical hacker"" in order to test the strength of organisational IT systems. Vehvilainen advised Thomas and offered to act as a referee of good character. Thomas, in turn, asked if he could buy a gun from Vehvilainen and whether anybody would notice if assault rifles were stolen from his base. But, before anything more could happen, the group was disrupted. For several months, detectives from West Midlands Police had been investigating an incident in July 2016 during which several men had pasted National Action stickers at the Aston University campus in Birmingham. In spring 2017, some of the suspects were arrested, including Alex Deakin. Incriminating chat groups were found on his phone, and that of another man who cannot be named for legal reasons. After being released under investigation, Deakin sent a panicked email to several National Action contacts. ""My seized phone is full of texts that will mark me as an organizer,"" he wrote. ""I understand if you despise me for this sloppiness (it really couldn't have been worse if I tried)."" Alex Deakin Deakin's ""sloppiness"" led to three trials at Birmingham Crown Court this year, many details of which can only be reported now that the final one has concluded. The first, which ended in April, saw Deakin himself, Vehvilainen and soldier Mark Barrett stand trial accused of National Action membership. Barrett was acquitted, but his co-defendants were convicted and received eight-year prison sentences. The three had been arrested in September 2017, along with the other two soldiers in the chat group, both of whom were released without charge. Only Barrett elected to give evidence, telling the court that he had not joined National Action despite being in the Telegram chat group and that he regretted his racist postings. Alex Deakin and Mikko Vehvilainen Deakin was also convicted of two counts of possessing documents useful to someone preparing an act of terrorism - including bomb-making manuals and an instructional book for white extremists - which were found on his laptop. He was further convicted of distributing a terrorist publication, for sending a document called Ethnic Cleansing Operations to the National Action co-founder Ben Raymond and two other contacts. Vehvilainen was cleared of stirring up racial hatred for using a Christian Identity online forum to write racist posts. Among other things, he wrote: ""I have vowed to fight the Jew forever in any way possible,"" and used the word ""beasts"" to refer to black people. Referring to his position in the Army, he had written: ""There are ways around everything and I've simply learned to avoid beasts."" He added: ""The sooner they're eliminated the better."" It is understood that both Vehvilainen and Barrett have since been discharged from the Army. The other two arrested soldiers were disciplined but not discharged, although one has since left voluntarily. Lt Col Jackie Fletcher, from the Army personnel branch, described them as ""exceptional cases"". ""These are very rare in the Army,"" she said. ""The Army's value and standards are very clear for soldiers and any individual found to breach those value and standards will have action taken against them."" The second trial, which ended in May, saw Deakin and three other men convicted of stirring up racial hatred in relation to the sticker campaign at Aston University - Daniel Bogunovic, 27, a warehouse worker and beekeeper from Leicester, Chad Wiliams-Allen, 27, a pre-ban National Action member and welder from West Bromwich, as well as a man in his early 20s who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Chad Williams-Allen, Daniel Bogunovic and Alex Deakin In the third case, that of Thomas, Patatas and Bogunovic, three other defendants pleaded guilty to membership of National Action in pre-trial hearings. They were Darren Fletcher, Nathan Pryke, and Joel Wilmore. Wilmore also admitted to possessing terrorist information, namely a document called Homemade Molotov Cocktails. Thomas, who was also convicted of possessing a bomb-making manual, was the only one to give evidence. Adam Thomas, Claudia Patatas, Daniel Bogunovic, Darren Fletcher, Nathan Pryke and Joel Wilmore The former Amazon security guard admitted being a racist and told jurors he had been exposed to such beliefs from a young age, adding that his stepfather was in a ""white power band"" and had started shaving Thomas's head at the age of five. He also described telling a female Holocaust survivor, whom he visited with a government de-radicalisation mentor, that he ""couldn't see"" how she could have endured the WW2 Nazi death camps. Thomas told jurors that, aged 18, he went to Israel and considered converting to Judaism because it would have allowed him to join the Israeli military The BBC has spoken to people who knew Thomas in Israel. David Simpkins, who shared a room with him at the Machon Meir yeshiva in Jerusalem, said his roommate used the name Avi Ben Abraham. Simpkins said Thomas had described a ""horrible childhood which he characterised as a situation of constantly being bullied, growing up with far-right British extremists who were also neo-Nazis"". Thomas disclosed that he first ""started learning about Judaism to discover why he was supposed to hate them,"" Simpkins recalled. He described Thomas as ""extremely intelligent"" but said he had ""an extreme approach to Judaism"" and wanted to join a small fringe group which regards most Jewish people as heretics. ""The rabbis decided that Adam needed to deal with his childhood professionally and return to convert with a clear head,"" he said. ""He was making the common mistake many who desire conversion make, which is to replace one psychological extreme with another."" Avishai Grosser, who works with converts, told the BBC that Thomas, who ""knew big proportions of the Torah by heart"", dropped out of several conversion programmes and eventually ended up on the streets before returning to the UK. It is understood that, after he returned, he told people in far-right circles that his time in Israel related to an involvement with the white supremacist Christian Identity movement. It was around this time that he got to know Patatas through National Action chat groups. They met for the first time at a pub social in December 2016 and soon moved in together. Adam Thomas in Israel Before proscription, National Action may have been ""perceived as just one of those groups who incited racial hatred and were racist"", says Det Chief Supt Matt Ward from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. He explains how his team's understanding of the threat posed by National Action has ""changed considerably"" during their investigations. Events after it was banned, he says, show ""a really dangerous, well-structured organisation at the heart of a neo-Nazi ideology that seeks to divide communities, is preparing to instigate and wage a race war within the United Kingdom and has spent years acquiring skills, tactics, weapons, recruiting and training people to be able to do that."" As in the Midlands, National Action had continued operating covertly in the North West, but had continued more overtly in several other English regions and Scotland using the aliases NS131 and Scottish Dawn. There are ongoing inquiries into people associated with the group, and several trials have already taken place elsewhere in the UK. At the Old Bailey in July, Christopher Lythgoe and Matthew Hankinson, both from the North West, were convicted of membership offences in a trial that saw another man plead guilty to threatening to kill a female police officer, and preparing an act of terrorism by buying a machete in order to kill Labour MP Rosie Cooper. Mr Justice Jay, sentencing Lythgoe and Hankinson to eight and six years in prison respectively, said their ""truly evil and dystopian vision"" could never ""have been achieved through the activities of National Action, a very small group operating at the very periphery of far-right wing extremism"". But he said, ""The real risk to society inheres instead in the carrying out of isolated acts of terror,"" inspired by what he described as the group's ""perverted ideology"". What of the National Action founders who inspired such hatred? We found Ben Raymond and Alex Davies living at separate addresses in Swansea. Both were arrested in September 2017 on suspicion of membership of National Action but have been told they will not be charged. Raymond was also arrested on suspicion of possessing terrorist material and remains under investigation for that. The police enquiries relate to their involvement with the far-right group NS131, which had been created after National Action had been banned. Last year, it was also proscribed. NS131 promotional image The men have continued to make public pronouncements. Earlier this year, Davies used an online neo-Nazi radio station to call for far-right activists to engage in a campaign of ""direct action"" against the Labour MP who succeeded Jo Cox as the MP for Batley and Spen. Raymond used the same radio station to discuss the trial of Lythgoe and Hankinson while it was ongoing and declare the defendants ""innocent men"". The BBC asked both Raymond and Davies for an interview, but they declined. We wanted to ask whether they accept any responsibility for all that has happened and about their relationship with National Action members since proscription. For example, a private gym in Warrington set up by group leader Lythgoe for violent training sessions was made possible by Â£1,500 given to him by Davies - who then visited it along with members of the group after the ban. Raymond continued communicating with members of National Action, post-proscription, via encrypted emails and applications. He was an active member of both the Midlands Telegram groups - musing on racial theory, engaging in anti-Semitism, discussing his correspondence with neo-Nazis abroad, and lecturing the others on the threat from infiltrators. On the day National Action was banned, Raymond had emailed several contacts, including Deakin and Lythgoe, to say he was ""super excited about working on all the new projects"". Later chat messages show Deakin saying Raymond was responsible for designing propaganda material after proscription. A hidden webpage containing Raymond's designs over several years, which includes propaganda drawings depicting sexual violence, suggests he created logos for several proposed groups in the period after the National Action ban. Deakin also kept on reporting back to Raymond - in the same way he had done before proscription - sending him messages about, for example, building dossiers on ""problematic"" individuals and a sinister idea about creating fake ""rabidly anti-white propaganda"" and ""rabidly pro-Jewish propaganda to push people over the edge"". When the BBC returned to Swansea with a television camera and approached Raymond in the street outside his bedsit, he swore at us and fled inside, refusing to answer questions. This video can not be played  What will happen to the National Action network in the longer term is unclear. Already proscribed under two aliases - NS131 and Scottish Dawn - it may yet be banned under others, too. The Islamist group al-Muhajiroun, based around the notorious British radical preacher Anjem Choudary, has been proscribed under nine other names, but the network of individuals has persisted and been involved in many acts of terrorism. National Action is not the first violent neo-Nazi group in this country since WW2. In the 1960s, members of several organisations attacked synagogues and engaged in paramilitary-style training. The far-right group Combat 18 was later involved in multiple acts of violence and intimidation. In the late 1990s, the London nail bomber David Copeland was an activist in the now defunct National Socialist Movement. David Copeland who bombed the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho and other targets in London The neo-Nazi threat in this country, while persistent, is not large. But it is potent in that those radicalised by its ideas have given themselves to such a violent and hateful creed that some terrorist activity will inevitably follow. The lies espoused by the extreme right - of Aryan supremacy and global Jewish conspiracies - are out there, old ideas spread by modern means, their promoters emboldened in and by the fractious political climate. The danger also appears to be growing, with police reporting an increase in the number of foiled far-right terror plots - five since March 2017 - and the murder of Jo Cox and the Finsbury Park vehicle attack clear evidence of what radicalised individuals can do. Last month, the UK's most senior counter terrorism officer, Met Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, told MPs that around 80% of the 700 live terror investigations were focused on Islamist Jihadists, with around 20% now focused on others, including a ""significant number of right-wing ideological threats"". In the wake of the terrorist attacks in the UK last year, an official review recommended an increased role for MI5 in tackling extreme right-wing terrorism, with the aim being to ensure equivalence in how terrorism is dealt with, irrespective of the ideology that inspires it. Implementation of the recommendation has started, with the security service beginning to take the lead for an area that has previously been the preserve of the police.

The new parents and UK's neo-Nazi terror threatHow police closed in on the banned far-right group National Action and several of its members.Stories,"Three people have been convicted of belonging to the banned neo-Nazi group National Action. Adam Thomas, 22, and his partner Claudia Patatas, 38, were found guilty with Daniel Bogunovic, 27, of being members of the far-right group - which was proscribed under anti-terror laws after it celebrated the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox. UPDATE 18 December 2018: Thomas and Patatas have been sentenced to six-and-a-half years and five years in prison respectively, and Bogunovic to six years and four months. Three other men who pleaded guilty earlier in the case were also jailed. Here is the story of National Action and the threat posed by its members. It appeared to be a normal home. The property, in a quiet part of an Oxfordshire town, was occupied by a couple who had just welcomed their first child into the world. Neighbours sometimes saw the pair taking their baby out in a pram. The male, who often dressed in combat trousers, worked as a security guard. The woman - a part-time wedding photographer - had, until recently, worked in a clothes shop. But inside their house Adam Thomas and his Portuguese partner Claudia Patatas had created a disturbing world. Adam Thomas Their bedroom was strewn with weapons - machetes, crossbows, an axe under the bed, a Nazi-style dagger. In the hallway were pendants bearing a black sun - a symbol associated with the SS and the occult - and the insignia of the Ku Klux Klan. Cushions emblazoned with swastikas decorated the lounge. In the kitchen, there was a swastika-shaped pastry cutter. The fridge was adorned with a poster by the banned neo-Nazi group National Action, declaring 'Britain is ours - the rest must go'. Adam Thomas with his son A memory card hidden beneath a floorboard under the dining table contained several startling photographs of the couple. In one, Thomas holds the flag of Nazi Germany while Patatas cradles their baby. In another, mother and baby are with a different man, Darren Fletcher, who performs a Nazi salute while both adults hold the flag. Darren Fletcher, Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas Other images found on a mobile phone show Thomas dressed in the distinctive white costume of the KKK, looking down at his son through the eyeholes of a white, peaked hood. The baby, a little over a month old at the time, had been given the middle name Adolf by his parents - in tribute to the leader of Nazi Germany. The pictures were found by counter terrorism detectives who arrived at the property early in the morning of 3 January this year to arrest Thomas and Patatas for membership of National Action - a group that had been banned under terrorism legislation in December 2016. Alex Davies (l) and Ben Raymond National Action was founded in 2013 by Ben Raymond, now 29, and Alex Davies, now 24. At the time, Raymond, a recent politics graduate from the University of Essex and avowed neo-Nazi, was living in Bognor Regis. After university, he had drifted into a job as a double-glazing salesman and would go on to work at a job centre, assisting claimants. Much of his free time was spent online immersed in disturbing extreme right-wing content. He designed memes, edited videos, and wrote long diatribes, including for the obscure Integralist Party, which was seeking a ""nationwide fascist army"" for its ""racial religion that inspires and demands fanaticism"". Ben Raymond It was that online activity that first attracted Davies, a University of Warwick student from Carmarthen and member of the British National Party. By then, the party was in steep decline from its best ever performance in European elections four years earlier. The pair believed that, in recent years, British far-right organisations had diluted their message by seeking to appeal beyond their core support. National Action's founders determined that, in contrast, the group would be unashamedly racist and overtly neo-Nazi. Alex Davies It had all the characteristics of post-war neo-Nazism - hatred of non-white and Jewish people, a worldview entirely based on racism, veneration of white ""Aryans"", and lionisation of the Nazi era and its worst war criminals. Davies was eventually forced out of Warwick university for his far-right political activities and moved back to Wales, where he eventually found work as an insurance salesman. The pair believed young people across the UK would eagerly embrace the group's toxic blend of Hitler worship, Holocaust denial, and malicious conspiracy theories. In reality, it would never exceed 100 members and those it did attract were a disparate set of fanatics united by various deviancies and irrational hatreds. No attempt was made at engaging in democratic politics, with the organisation instead regarding itself as a youth-based street movement. Its logo was strikingly similar to the paramilitary arm of the Nazi party - the Sturmabteilung, or SA Recruitment focused on those in their teens and 20s, although some of those targeted were children of secondary school age. The group's strategy initially involved leafleting university campuses. But it soon turned to organising aggressive publicity stunts and city-centre demonstrations, with activities chronicled on the group's website and social media channels. As it grew, National Action developed into a clandestine network of small, regional networks, with senior figures in each cooperating at a national level. National Action regional map Members, who dressed in black during demonstrations, promoted the idea that the UK was on the brink of a ""race war"" and that a predatory elite was deliberately encouraging immigration in an attempt to destroy the native white population. The group claimed to be patriotic, but was hostile to all domestic institutions, the rule of law, the democratic process, and everyone who did not share its worldview. Politicians and other public servants were a particular focus of hatred. During one speech, senior National Action member Matthew Hankinson said they would ensure that ""traitors"" ended up ""hanging from lampposts"". ""We must be ruthless - and if innocent people are cut down in the process, then so be it,"" he said. Matthew Hankinson The organisation was openly genocidal and said that all Jewish and non-white people would have to go. In one document it declared: ""It is with glee that we will enact the final solution across Europe."" But National Action did not restrict itself to admiration for the Nazis. Its members also took inspiration from the Khmer Rouge, the brutal regime that ruled Cambodia in the late 1970s under the Marxist leader Pol Pot; the radical right-wing Norwegian terrorist and mass murderer Anders Breivik; and even the Islamic State group. Anders Breivik Online, the group announced: ""We are the white jihad"" and ""Our motto is 'Long Live Death!' because only those who are willing to die for their beliefs are truly alive."" The logic of such ideas ends in violence - and violence, both planned and executed, is what they generated. In 2015, Zack Davies, a 25-year-old member from Mold, North Wales, used a hammer and machete to attack a Sikh dentist in a Tesco store because of his skin colour. Davies shouted, ""White power"" during the assault, for which he was later convicted of attempted murder. He had earlier posed for a selfie in front of a National Action flag while holding a blade. Zack Davies The following year Jack Coulson, a then 17-year-old member from Bradford, West Yorkshire, was arrested by counter terrorism police after posting images of a homemade pipe-bomb on Snapchat, along with threats against Muslims. Coulson, who would be convicted of making explosives, had joined National Action months earlier and was associating with older members both in person and online. Jack Coulson dressed in a Nazi uniform On the day in June 2016 that Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered by the white supremacist Thomas Mair, the teenager took to social media to say: ""There's one less race traitor in Britain thanks to this man."" ""He's a hero, we need more people like him to butcher the race traitors,"" Coulson continued. An official National Action Twitter account also celebrated the murder, stating: ""Don't let this man's sacrifice go in vain,"" and ""Only 649 MPs to go #WhiteJihad."" National Action tweet By 2016, Christopher Lythgoe, a former regional leader for the North West, was heading up the whole group. Raymond and Davies remained influential figures, but it was Lythgoe, now 32, who sought to enforce structure and rigour on the entire organisation. He lived with his parents in Warrington, worked infrequently in warehouses, and spent much of his time trying to turn National Action into a paramilitary-style organisation. He drew up detailed manuals, explaining things like how to carry flags correctly, and sent hectoring emails to other members. In one, he wrote: ""Just a reminder guys that National Action now operates what I like to call a No-Deadweight Policy. That means everyone trains in case we need it. We don't carry anyone. No exceptions."" He added: ""Imagine what it will be like when we have 20, 30, 50 or more guys who can ALL punch unconscious an 18-stone adversary. AND we will fight as one disciplined body. That's what I would call formidable unit. So like I said, We all train."" Christopher Lythgoe Training included boxing, martial arts, and a series of outdoor training camps. One such camp - where participants were expected to ""drink mead and live like Vikings"" - ended in farce when one neo-Nazi ended up sleeping in a phone box to escape rain and snow. But one need not consider the group's paramilitary fantasies realistic to find them troubling and dangerous. The threat National Action posed came from the hatred it encouraged, which generated a very real threat to the general public and anyone chosen as a target by those it radicalised. A government assessment in late 2016 concluded the group was ""concerned in terrorism"", and described it as ""virulently racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic"". It became the first far-right group to be proscribed in this country since World War Two. The move, which made membership of National Action a criminal offence, was specifically linked to its glorification of terrorism and extreme violence. National Action promoting one of its ""conferences"" Ahead of the ban, the group's leadership came together via a secure conference call, including Lythgoe, founders Raymond and Davies, and regional organisers. Lythgoe insisted the group carry on as usual - just without the name or more obvious public trappings. In the days before the ban, he sent his followers a series of emails. ""Long term we'll keep moving forward just as we have been,"" stated one. Another, sent to the regional leaders, said: ""Make sure you maintain contact with ALL your members. Reassure them that they will be personally ok as long as they don't promote NA from Friday on. Make sure that they understand that the SUBSTANCE of NA is the people, our talents, the bonds between us, our ideas, and our sustained force of will. All of that will continue into the future. We're just shedding one skin for another.  All genuinely revolutionary movements in the past have needed to exist partly underground. These are exciting times."" One of those on Lythgoe's mailing list was Alex Deakin, leader for the Midlands. Less than two hours after getting the email, Deakin used the encrypted messaging app Telegram to create a chat group that became his main regional organising tool for National Action after the ban. He called it the Triple KKK Mafia, a reference to the Ku Klux Klan. Over time, the chat group would have as many as 21 people in it. He created another one - called Inner - which contained a select band of seven from the larger chat group. Alex Deakin Deakin, now 24, from Birmingham, was a university student who had been radicalised on the internet. In September 2016, after spending two years studying in Aberystwyth, he dropped out and transferred to a history course at the University of Coventry. He told one contact his path to National Action involved ""getting redpilled by forums, spending years arguing online, and then finally deciding to take action when this group impressed me"". Deakin regularly reported back to Lythgoe and co-founder Raymond, telling them about his efforts to recruit new members, organise existing ones, and spread National Action propaganda. Alex Deakin Messages in the year before the ban show the extent of his delusional ambitions. In an exchange about targeting working class cities, he wrote: ""We should move to radicalise these areas, turning them into NI [Northern Irish] style sectarian ghettoes would be the first target to fermenting race war."" In correspondence with Lythgoe, Deakin stated: ""Like the IRA and Viet Cong we'd need to have embedded local support among the communities we'd fight in; streets and cul-de-sacs would function as barracks as supportive locals would shelter us, and it would be necessary to fade into the background at moment's notice."" The nature of such conversations only intensified once the group had been proscribed. In the Midlands, the organisation ceased overt campaigning, but members continued to communicate, meet up, seek new recruits, and encourage one another's worst tendencies. There were explicit references to the the fact that National Action still existed. In one message, Deakin said: ""Anyway the Midlands group continues under the name Triple K Mafia."" In another, Adam Thomas wrote: ""So since NA has been destroyed, the leadership generally of NA agreed it's to be disbanded. No attempt at revival. But the Midlands branch of NA, which is just 17-20 of us, have decided to ignore this... Midlands will continue the fight alone."" Messages in the Telegram group, numbering in the thousands, show members using violent racist language, discussing their desire for a ""race war"", and fantasising about the murder of those they hated. Deakin wrote that all Jewish people should be ""burned"", and that Chinese and black people should be turned into ""biofuel"". A member from Wolverhampton, Darren Fletcher, 28, referred to Thomas Mair, the killer of Jo Cox, when he asked: ""Why aren't there more Mairs out there? We need a good few hundred of them to sort out these anti-white MPs."" Darren Fletcher and Adam Thomas Fletcher, a truck driver and old friend of Adam Thomas, had once been jailed after posting videos on YouTube of himself on stage at an extremist music event dressed in a KKK outfit, hanging a life-sized golliwog doll from a noose. When Fletcher wrote that people in government should be killed, he received support from Thomas, who said: ""I agree bump them off but there's 600MPs unless you take them all down in one go they will just replace each other."" Claudia Patatas, who studied to postgraduate level in Portugal before moving to the UK over a decade ago, had spent years as a marketing professional. In public she provided bland quotes to corporate journals, while in private she wrote messages exclaiming: ""All Jews must be put to death"" and ""bring back those concentration camps."" Claudia Patatas and a KKK flag in her home She told members of the group that ""Adolf is life"" and was enthusiastic about holding a celebration for Hitler's birthday, recalling one she had attended in Lisbon years earlier. ""We had a cake with the fuhrer face,"" she described, before adding, ""I did struggle to slice his face"". Claudia Patatas Perhaps the most dangerous member of the group was a serving lance corporal in the British Army. Mikko Vehvilainen, now 34, joined the Army in 2012, having earlier spent time in the navy in Finland, the homeland of his father. In an email to one friend, he wrote: ""I'm only in to learn useful combat skills."" The married father of young children, an adherent of a white supremacist interpretation of Christianity called Christian Identity, was a senior National Action member obsessed with ideas about the collapse of civilisation and racial war. Mikko Vehvilainen In a diary entry last year, beneath the heading ""key points for leadership meeting"", he referred to ""later stages terrorism, civil disorder, destruction of infrastructure and power grid"". In another document, he said there a was a need to be ""prepared to fight and die for your race in a possible last stand for our survival"". ""Every part of me wants war. There is no other way,"" he wrote in one message on Telegram. His personal weapons collection, stockpiled for what he appeared to regard as imminent conflicts, included legally held firearms, as well as knives, machetes, knuckle dusters, a crossbow, a bow and arrow, pepper spray, handcuffs, and a so-called war hammer bearing the Biblical inscription: ""There is no peace, says the Lord, for the wicked."" Vehvilainen's weapon collection - and photo of him performing a Nazi salute The solider, latterly based at the Army's Welsh headquarters in Powys, actively sought recruits from those serving under him in the Royal Anglian Regiment. Three men holding the rank of private were invited into the main Telegram group after Vehvilainen told Deakin they were ""committed"" Nazis. One of them, Mark Barrett, wrote racist messages in the chat group, and had Vehvilainen, another of the soldiers, and a National Action member called Nathan Pryke, over to his Army property where they spent an evening firing arrows at a burning cross in the back garden. Vehvilainen, who served in Afghanistan, was also keen that civilian neo-Nazis join him in the forces, telling them: ""If we get enough of us into the Army, we'll be in the right place when things start to collapse."" He wrote in the Inner chat group that National Action members should focus on gaining ""military and key civil positions"". Nathan Pryke Four National Action members in his circle had been, or were, attempting to join the Army: Alex Deakin, Adam Thomas, Nathan Pryke, a 27-year-old a van driver from Cambridgeshire, and Joel Wilmore, 24, originally from Lincolnshire, who had served in the Territorial Army before entering a sensitive job as an information security expert. This involved acting as an ""ethical hacker"" in order to test the strength of organisational IT systems. Vehvilainen advised Thomas and offered to act as a referee of good character. Thomas, in turn, asked if he could buy a gun from Vehvilainen and whether anybody would notice if assault rifles were stolen from his base. But, before anything more could happen, the group was disrupted. For several months, detectives from West Midlands Police had been investigating an incident in July 2016 during which several men had pasted National Action stickers at the Aston University campus in Birmingham. In spring 2017, some of the suspects were arrested, including Alex Deakin. Incriminating chat groups were found on his phone, and that of another man who cannot be named for legal reasons. After being released under investigation, Deakin sent a panicked email to several National Action contacts. ""My seized phone is full of texts that will mark me as an organizer,"" he wrote. ""I understand if you despise me for this sloppiness (it really couldn't have been worse if I tried)."" Alex Deakin Deakin's ""sloppiness"" led to three trials at Birmingham Crown Court this year, many details of which can only be reported now that the final one has concluded. The first, which ended in April, saw Deakin himself, Vehvilainen and soldier Mark Barrett stand trial accused of National Action membership. Barrett was acquitted, but his co-defendants were convicted and received eight-year prison sentences. The three had been arrested in September 2017, along with the other two soldiers in the chat group, both of whom were released without charge. Only Barrett elected to give evidence, telling the court that he had not joined National Action despite being in the Telegram chat group and that he regretted his racist postings. Alex Deakin and Mikko Vehvilainen Deakin was also convicted of two counts of possessing documents useful to someone preparing an act of terrorism - including bomb-making manuals and an instructional book for white extremists - which were found on his laptop. He was further convicted of distributing a terrorist publication, for sending a document called Ethnic Cleansing Operations to the National Action co-founder Ben Raymond and two other contacts. Vehvilainen was cleared of stirring up racial hatred for using a Christian Identity online forum to write racist posts. Among other things, he wrote: ""I have vowed to fight the Jew forever in any way possible,"" and used the word ""beasts"" to refer to black people. Referring to his position in the Army, he had written: ""There are ways around everything and I've simply learned to avoid beasts."" He added: ""The sooner they're eliminated the better."" It is understood that both Vehvilainen and Barrett have since been discharged from the Army. The other two arrested soldiers were disciplined but not discharged, although one has since left voluntarily. Lt Col Jackie Fletcher, from the Army personnel branch, described them as ""exceptional cases"". ""These are very rare in the Army,"" she said. ""The Army's value and standards are very clear for soldiers and any individual found to breach those value and standards will have action taken against them."" The second trial, which ended in May, saw Deakin and three other men convicted of stirring up racial hatred in relation to the sticker campaign at Aston University - Daniel Bogunovic, 27, a warehouse worker and beekeeper from Leicester, Chad Wiliams-Allen, 27, a pre-ban National Action member and welder from West Bromwich, as well as a man in his early 20s who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Chad Williams-Allen, Daniel Bogunovic and Alex Deakin In the third case, that of Thomas, Patatas and Bogunovic, three other defendants pleaded guilty to membership of National Action in pre-trial hearings. They were Darren Fletcher, Nathan Pryke, and Joel Wilmore. Wilmore also admitted to possessing terrorist information, namely a document called Homemade Molotov Cocktails. Thomas, who was also convicted of possessing a bomb-making manual, was the only one to give evidence. Adam Thomas, Claudia Patatas, Daniel Bogunovic, Darren Fletcher, Nathan Pryke and Joel Wilmore The former Amazon security guard admitted being a racist and told jurors he had been exposed to such beliefs from a young age, adding that his stepfather was in a ""white power band"" and had started shaving Thomas's head at the age of five. He also described telling a female Holocaust survivor, whom he visited with a government de-radicalisation mentor, that he ""couldn't see"" how she could have endured the WW2 Nazi death camps. Thomas told jurors that, aged 18, he went to Israel and considered converting to Judaism because it would have allowed him to join the Israeli military The BBC has spoken to people who knew Thomas in Israel. David Simpkins, who shared a room with him at the Machon Meir yeshiva in Jerusalem, said his roommate used the name Avi Ben Abraham. Simpkins said Thomas had described a ""horrible childhood which he characterised as a situation of constantly being bullied, growing up with far-right British extremists who were also neo-Nazis"". Thomas disclosed that he first ""started learning about Judaism to discover why he was supposed to hate them,"" Simpkins recalled. He described Thomas as ""extremely intelligent"" but said he had ""an extreme approach to Judaism"" and wanted to join a small fringe group which regards most Jewish people as heretics. ""The rabbis decided that Adam needed to deal with his childhood professionally and return to convert with a clear head,"" he said. ""He was making the common mistake many who desire conversion make, which is to replace one psychological extreme with another."" Avishai Grosser, who works with converts, told the BBC that Thomas, who ""knew big proportions of the Torah by heart"", dropped out of several conversion programmes and eventually ended up on the streets before returning to the UK. It is understood that, after he returned, he told people in far-right circles that his time in Israel related to an involvement with the white supremacist Christian Identity movement. It was around this time that he got to know Patatas through National Action chat groups. They met for the first time at a pub social in December 2016 and soon moved in together. Adam Thomas in Israel Before proscription, National Action may have been ""perceived as just one of those groups who incited racial hatred and were racist"", says Det Chief Supt Matt Ward from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. He explains how his team's understanding of the threat posed by National Action has ""changed considerably"" during their investigations. Events after it was banned, he says, show ""a really dangerous, well-structured organisation at the heart of a neo-Nazi ideology that seeks to divide communities, is preparing to instigate and wage a race war within the United Kingdom and has spent years acquiring skills, tactics, weapons, recruiting and training people to be able to do that."" As in the Midlands, National Action had continued operating covertly in the North West, but had continued more overtly in several other English regions and Scotland using the aliases NS131 and Scottish Dawn. There are ongoing inquiries into people associated with the group, and several trials have already taken place elsewhere in the UK. At the Old Bailey in July, Christopher Lythgoe and Matthew Hankinson, both from the North West, were convicted of membership offences in a trial that saw another man plead guilty to threatening to kill a female police officer, and preparing an act of terrorism by buying a machete in order to kill Labour MP Rosie Cooper. Mr Justice Jay, sentencing Lythgoe and Hankinson to eight and six years in prison respectively, said their ""truly evil and dystopian vision"" could never ""have been achieved through the activities of National Action, a very small group operating at the very periphery of far-right wing extremism"". But he said, ""The real risk to society inheres instead in the carrying out of isolated acts of terror,"" inspired by what he described as the group's ""perverted ideology"". What of the National Action founders who inspired such hatred? We found Ben Raymond and Alex Davies living at separate addresses in Swansea. Both were arrested in September 2017 on suspicion of membership of National Action but have been told they will not be charged. Raymond was also arrested on suspicion of possessing terrorist material and remains under investigation for that. The police enquiries relate to their involvement with the far-right group NS131, which had been created after National Action had been banned. Last year, it was also proscribed. NS131 promotional image The men have continued to make public pronouncements. Earlier this year, Davies used an online neo-Nazi radio station to call for far-right activists to engage in a campaign of ""direct action"" against the Labour MP who succeeded Jo Cox as the MP for Batley and Spen. Raymond used the same radio station to discuss the trial of Lythgoe and Hankinson while it was ongoing and declare the defendants ""innocent men"". The BBC asked both Raymond and Davies for an interview, but they declined. We wanted to ask whether they accept any responsibility for all that has happened and about their relationship with National Action members since proscription. For example, a private gym in Warrington set up by group leader Lythgoe for violent training sessions was made possible by Â£1,500 given to him by Davies - who then visited it along with members of the group after the ban. Raymond continued communicating with members of National Action, post-proscription, via encrypted emails and applications. He was an active member of both the Midlands Telegram groups - musing on racial theory, engaging in anti-Semitism, discussing his correspondence with neo-Nazis abroad, and lecturing the others on the threat from infiltrators. On the day National Action was banned, Raymond had emailed several contacts, including Deakin and Lythgoe, to say he was ""super excited about working on all the new projects"". Later chat messages show Deakin saying Raymond was responsible for designing propaganda material after proscription. A hidden webpage containing Raymond's designs over several years, which includes propaganda drawings depicting sexual violence, suggests he created logos for several proposed groups in the period after the National Action ban. Deakin also kept on reporting back to Raymond - in the same way he had done before proscription - sending him messages about, for example, building dossiers on ""problematic"" individuals and a sinister idea about creating fake ""rabidly anti-white propaganda"" and ""rabidly pro-Jewish propaganda to push people over the edge"". When the BBC returned to Swansea with a television camera and approached Raymond in the street outside his bedsit, he swore at us and fled inside, refusing to answer questions. This video can not be played  What will happen to the National Action network in the longer term is unclear. Already proscribed under two aliases - NS131 and Scottish Dawn - it may yet be banned under others, too. The Islamist group al-Muhajiroun, based around the notorious British radical preacher Anjem Choudary, has been proscribed under nine other names, but the network of individuals has persisted and been involved in many acts of terrorism. National Action is not the first violent neo-Nazi group in this country since WW2. In the 1960s, members of several organisations attacked synagogues and engaged in paramilitary-style training. The far-right group Combat 18 was later involved in multiple acts of violence and intimidation. In the late 1990s, the London nail bomber David Copeland was an activist in the now defunct National Socialist Movement. David Copeland who bombed the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho and other targets in London The neo-Nazi threat in this country, while persistent, is not large. But it is potent in that those radicalised by its ideas have given themselves to such a violent and hateful creed that some terrorist activity will inevitably follow. The lies espoused by the extreme right - of Aryan supremacy and global Jewish conspiracies - are out there, old ideas spread by modern means, their promoters emboldened in and by the fractious political climate. The danger also appears to be growing, with police reporting an increase in the number of foiled far-right terror plots - five since March 2017 - and the murder of Jo Cox and the Finsbury Park vehicle attack clear evidence of what radicalised individuals can do. Last month, the UK's most senior counter terrorism officer, Met Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, told MPs that around 80% of the 700 live terror investigations were focused on Islamist Jihadists, with around 20% now focused on others, including a ""significant number of right-wing ideological threats"". In the wake of the terrorist attacks in the UK last year, an official review recommended an increased role for MI5 in tackling extreme right-wing terrorism, with the aim being to ensure equivalence in how terrorism is dealt with, irrespective of the ideology that inspires it. Implementation of the recommendation has started, with the security service beginning to take the lead for an area that has previously been the preserve of the police.

Ministers 'voiced Brexit plan doubts in July',"Cabinet ministers in discussion at Chequers in July, when the Brexit plan was agreed Multiple cabinet ministers expressed significant doubts about the prime minister's preferred Brexit plan from the start, the BBC has learned. Parts of Theresa May's plan were described as ""worrying"", ""disappointing"" and ""concerning"" by members of her top team back in July. Mrs May is struggling to broker an agreement on Brexit with ministers. Two ministers have told the BBCthey believe there is little chance the deal would get Parliament's backing. One of them said it was ""self-harming"" for the PM to keep pursuing the same strategy. Pound falls as Brexit uncertainty rises My Brexit box: The people stockpiling food Brexit: All you need to know Mrs May is trying to arrange an agreement in cabinet on the current negotiations in time for a hoped-for summit in Brussels later this month. Her preferred plan for future relations with the EU after Brexit were agreed at Chequers - the prime minister's country retreat - in July, in a marathon cabinet meeting lasting nearly 12 hours. Afterwards, Mrs May said the cabinet had reached a ""collective"" agreement, although former Brexit secretary David Davis and ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson resigned from the Cabinet in protest at the plans 48 hours later. Mrs May speaks during the meeting at Chequers in July And, according to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, cabinet sources have now revealed there were widespread doubts about various aspects from many other ministers from the start, including from some former Remain supporters. For many of those present, she said that the Chequers deal was an undesirable compromise, rather than a set of proposals to which they were signing up with enthusiasm. One cabinet minister said the group endorsed the proposal ""with a very heavy heart"". This video can not be played There would be ""no problem"" if the UK asked the EU for a timed extension to the Brexit date Article 50 author Lord Kerr tells Radio 4's World at One Trade Secretary Liam Fox expressed strong doubts about elements of the plan for trading arrangements as they could harm the ability of the UK to do trade deals after Brexit. Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who backed Remain, is understood to have had some similar views, describing the proposal for a common rule book with the EU for parts of the economy as ""very worrying"" and suggesting that there should be a review of the arrangements after five years. The leader of the House of Lords, Baroness Evans, is understood to have agreed, telling her colleagues that she found it difficult to accept some aspects of the proposals, and might struggle to explain them in Parliament. Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey - Brexiteers who have both been reluctant to give public support for the plan - are said to have expressed significant unhappiness and questioned whether Brexiteer MPs would be able to support such a deal in Parliament. Please upgrade your browser Meanwhile, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is said to have warned his colleagues that as many as 40 Eurosceptic MPs might ""go on strike"". Sources close to him would not confirm that, but said he had been ""extremely cautious from the start"" about the Chequers proposal. And as has previously emerged, the leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, said that she ""hated"" the proposals and called on the prime minister to treat those who had voted for Brexit with respect. Chancellor Philip Hammond told his colleagues that the government was living on ""borrowed time"" because some businesses were hesitating over whether to invest in the UK. He argued for the Chequers approach to bring clarity as soon as possible. But he is understood to have questioned whether such a deal could actually be achieved, warning that the UK would have to persuade EU member states to defy the European Commission which is running the negotiation. Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Ministers 'want EU deal by end of month' And the Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson - also a former Remainer - said there were many concerns with the paper and it must be made clear it was as far as the government would be willing to compromise. Several ministers on both sides of the argument are understood to have called on the prime minister to be honest with the public about the shift in position towards a closer arrangement with the EU. Mrs May is trying to arrange an agreement in cabinet on the current negotiations in time for a hoped-for summit in Brussels later this month. A Number 10 spokesman said: ""Everyone has to move a little to get a deal that works for everyone on both sides of the argument."" But Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it appeared Mrs May had proceeded without the ""solid backing"" of her cabinet, having also declined to get Parliament's support for her negotiating objectives. Sir Keir also said the option of a fresh referendum was still ""on the table"", despite Labour's leader Jeremy Corbyn saying at the weekend that Brexit could not be stopped. This video can not be played ""All options are on the table"" if there is a no deal Brexit, Starmer tells Today In his column for the Daily Telegraph on Monday,Boris Johnson called the prime minister's deal,external""a recipe for continued strife, both in the Tory Party and the country"". And former cabinet minister John Whittingdale cast doubt on whether Mrs May could stay in office if Parliament rejected any deal she reached with the EU. ""I think if the PM's Brexit plan doesn't get through Parliament, I think it's quite difficult to see how the prime minister can continue because she has staked her credibility,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour.

Professor Green: Knife crime not a black issue,"Professor Green has said black youths as a whole are being ""criminalised"" over recent stabbings - and that in some places ""knife crime is white"". The rapper claimed the media had an ""agenda"" to ""bring back racially-profiled stop and search"" - but he does not think the practice works. Green, who was stabbed in 2009, blamed poverty for thegrowing problem. His comments come as a senior police officer said current rules on stop and search might be too restrictive. Home Office minister Nick Hurd told the Commons on Monday there were ""no plans"" to ""go back to random stop and search"", but the government would look at ways to reduce bureaucracy around it. Should stronger stop and search powers be used? London's 119 homicide victims of 2018 Violent crime 'could take a generation to solve' Professor Green spoke out onInstagram,externalafter being asked about knife crime on Monday's Good Morning Britain. He wrote: ""There had been a lot of reference to a statistic that it's largely black youths stabbing each other - what was left out was that this is only true of certain areas, as anyone with a brain can work out, in more densely white populated areas, the face of knife crime is white. ""That's never represented in the media. The fact that the face of knife crime they project nationally is black youths, as I said this morning implies institutional racism and criminalises a whole race, fitting their agenda to bring back racially-profiled stop and search."" He said all stop and search achieved was to cause ""more division, friction and lack of trust"" of police. While speaking on GMB, he added that while he was stabbed, he does not see himself as a victim. In London alone, there have been 119 homicides this year - including 69 fatal stabbings. Four of those happened in a five-day period this month. Professor Green said knife crime had been ""a growing problem for years with many different contributing factors"", with ""poverty at the top of the list"". ""Years of neglect"" have caused the current crisis, with social deprivation, lack of paternal role models, inequality in education and cuts to services all to blame, he added. He said he agreed with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan's comment that it might take a generation to solve the problem of knife crime. ""Stop and search isn't going to be a quick fix,"" he added. ""Children should never get to the point of carrying a knife - but society needs to move on a hell of a lot before that will happen."" Meanwhile, Adrian Hanstock - the National Police Chiefs' Council lead on stop and search and deputy chief constable of British Transport Police - has suggested the threshold for stops to take place could be lowered. He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One it was not currently a proposal, but discussions had been held about how to do things differently. ""What's behind this is there's a lot of call for officers up and down the country, not just in the cities, to use more stop and search to tackle violence,"" he said. ""We see every day knives and weapons and other items taken off the streets, and every one of those can save a life."" But Mr Hanstock added: ""If we are to make longstanding impact on these causes of violence, police use of stop and search will not be the single answer to this."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid is expected to outline plans in the coming weeks to make stop and search more efficient and reduce the bureaucracy around it. According toHome Office figures,external, there were 298,949 stop and searches carried out in England and Wales in the 2016-17 financial year. There were four for every 1,000 white people - compared with 29 for every 1,000 black people. The most recent census,external, in 2011, showed 86% of the population was white, with black ethnic groups making up 3.3%. The return of stop and search?

Neck scan 'can spot early dementia signs',"A five-minute scan could be used to spot people at risk of dementia before symptoms appear, researchers claim. Scientists used ultrasound scanners to look at blood vessels in the necks of more than 3,000 people and monitored them over the next 15 years. They found those with the most intense pulses went on to experience greater cognitive decline over the next decade than the other study participants. Researchers hope it may offer a new way to predict cognitive decline. Eye test 'could spot early dementia signs' Dementia exercise programmes 'don't work' An international team of experts, led by University College London (UCL), measured the intensity of the pulse travelling towards the brain in 3,191 people in 2002. A more intense pulse can cause damage to the small vessels of the brain, structural changes in the brain's blood vessel network and minor bleeds known as mini-strokes. Over the next 15 years, researchers monitored participants' memory and problem-solving ability. Those with the highest intensity pulse (the top quarter of participants) at the beginning of the study were about 50% more likely to show accelerated cognitive decline over the next decade compared with the rest of the participants, the study found. Researchers said this was the equivalent of about an extra one to one-and-half years of decline. Cognitive decline is often one of the first signs of dementia, but not everyone who experiences it will go on to develop the condition. Having a healthy diet, doing regular exercise and not smoking can all help to stave off dementia, evidence suggests Researchers said the test could provide a new way to identify people who are at risk of developing dementia, leading to earlier treatments and lifestyle interventions. Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, having a healthy diet, doing regular exercise and not smoking can all help to stave off dementia, evidence suggests. Dr Scott Chiesa, from UCL, said: ""Dementia is the end result of decades of damage, so by the time people get dementia it's too late to do anything. ""What we're trying to say is you need to get in as early as possible, identify a way to see who's actually progressing towards possibly getting dementia and target them."" However, the study, co-funded by the British Heart Foundation, does not contain data on which study participants went on to develop dementia. Researchers next plan to use MRI scans to check if people in the study also display structural and functional changes within the brain that may explain their cognitive decline. They also want to test whether the scan improves predictive risk scores for dementia which already exist. Dr Carol Routledge, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said it was not yet clear if the scan could improve the diagnosis of dementia. She added: ""What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important, and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia."" The study is being presented at the AHA Scientific Sessions conference,externalin Chicago. Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

Eight killed in covert Israel Gaza op,"Israel carried out air strikes when the firefight erupted Seven Palestinians, including a local militant commander, have been killed during a covert Israeli operation in Gaza, Palestinian officials say. An Israeli soldier was also killed and another wounded, the Israeli military said, after a firefight erupted. Palestinians said an Israeli unit travelling in a civilian vehicle had killed the Hamas commander. It was followed by rocket-fire into Israel, while on Monday a Palestinian mortar hit an Israeli bus. Initial reports say the vehicle was empty, although a 19-year-old was seriously hurt, Israel's ambulance service said. According to Palestinian sources, the Israeli unit was about 3km (2 miles) inside the Gaza Strip, which borders Israel, when it fired at Nur Barakeh, a commander of the Izzedine al-Qassam brigades, Hamas' military wing. The incident is reported to have happened east of Khan Younis, in the south of the territory. A gun battle erupted and Israeli tanks and aircraft opened fire in the area, witnesses said. Hamas commander Nur Barakeh's mother was seen at the morgue where his body was reportedly brought Six of the Palestinians killed belonged to Hamas - the militant Islamist group which controls the Gaza Strip - and the seventh was a member of the militant Popular Resistance Committees, AFP news agency cited Palestinian officials as saying. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a member of the special unit involved was killed and another was lightly wounded. In the wake of the clashes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his visit to Paris for events to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One and returned to Israel, his office said. Due to the secrecy of the operation, Israel has not revealed specific details about the mission. The IDF said though that the operation was ""not intended to kill or abduct terrorists, but to strengthen Israeli security"". The BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem says that according to a former Israeli general, the incident was likely to have been an intelligence gathering operation that went wrong. The exposure of such an operation by Israeli special forces inside Gaza would be extremely rare, he says. Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for the group, denounced the incident as a ""cowardly Israeli attack"". IDF chief Lt Gen Gadi Eisenkot said the Israeli unit had carried out ""a very meaningful operation to Israel's security"", without giving further details. The Israeli military said that after the clashes 17 rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israel and three were shot down. Life in the Gaza Strip Gaza protest image likened to famous painting Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and reinforced its power in the Gaza Strip after ousting West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' rival Fatah faction in clashes the following year. While Mr Abbas' umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has signed peace accords with Israel, Hamas does not recognise Israel's right to exist and advocates the use of violence against it. Schools have been ordered closed in Israeli border communities as a precaution Israel, along with Egypt, has maintained a blockade of Gaza since about 2006, in order, they say, to stop attacks by militants. Israel and Hamas have gone to war three times, and rocket-fire from Gaza and Israel air strikes against militant targets are a regular occurrence. Sunday night's incident comes after apparent progress in an Egyptian- and UN-brokered process to mediate after a series of escalations between the two sides in recent months. More than 200 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli forces since the end of March - most during weekly protests along the border at which thousands have expressed their support for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? Israel has said its soldiers have only opened fire in self-defence or on potential attackers trying to infiltrate its territory under the cover of the protests. One Israeli soldier was killed on the Gaza-Israel border by a Palestinian sniper in July.

Nationalism driving fake news in India,"Researchers gained unprecedented access to participants' phones to follow sharing behaviours A rising tide of nationalism in India is driving ordinary citizens to spread fake news, according to BBC research. The research found that facts were less important to some than the emotional desire to bolster national identity. Social media analysis suggested that right-wing networks are much more organised than on the left, pushing nationalistic fake stories further. There was also an overlap of fake news sources on Twitter and support networks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The findings come from extensive research in India, Kenya, and Nigeria into the way ordinary citizens engage with and spread fake news. Read the full report from India,external Read the full report from Kenya and Nigeria,external Participants gave the BBC extensive access to their phones over a seven-day period, allowing the researchers to examine the kinds of material they shared, whom they shared it with and how often. The research, commissioned by the BBC World Service and published today, forms part of ""Beyond Fake News"" - a series across TV, radio and digital that aims to investigate how disinformation and fake news are affecting people around the world. In all three countries, distrust of mainstream news outlets pushed people to spread information from alternative sources, without attempting to verify it, in the belief that they were helping to spread the real story. People were also overly confident in their ability to spot fake news. The sheer flood of digital information being spread in 2018 is worsening the problem. Participants in the BBC research made little attempt to query the original source of fake news messages, looking instead to alternative signs that the information was reliable. These included the number of comments on a Facebook post, the kinds of images on the posts, or the sender, with people assuming WhatsApp messages from family and friends could be trusted and sent on without checking. Widespread sharing of false rumours on WhatsApp has led to a wave of violence in India, with people forwarding on fake messages about child abductors to friends and family out of a sense of duty to protect loved ones and communities. This video can not be played The digital epidemic killing Indians According to a separate BBC analysis, at least 31 people have been killed in the last two years, and 24 people in the past year alone, in incidents involving rumours spread on social media or messaging apps. We examined one case in detail -the deaths of Nilotpal and Abhishek in Assam- while another reporter travelled to Mexico to see howWhatsApp rumours fuelled similar deadly violence there. The research in Africa suggested that national identity was insignificant in the spread of fake news. In Kenya, scams related to money and technology were a stronger driving force, contributing to around a third of stories shared on WhatsApp, while fake stories relating to terrorism and the army were widely shared in Nigeria. A year in fake news in Africa How big a problem is fake news in Africa? In both countries, health scares were prominent among widely shared fake news stories, and many news consumers visited both credible and fake news sources without distinguishing between them. Researchers spent hundreds of hours with 80 participants across the three countries, interviewing them at home about their media consumption as well as examining how they shared information via WhatsApp and Facebook during a seven-day period. They also conducted extensive analysis of how fake news spreads on Twitter and Facebook in India, to understand whether the spread of fake news was politically polarised. About 16,000 Twitter accounts and 3,000 Facebook pages were analysed. The results showed a strong and coherent promotion of right-wing messages, while left-wing fake news networks were loosely organised, if at all, and less effective. By Santanu Chakrabarti We set out with this research to try to answer the question of why ordinary citizens spread fake news - a little-understood part of the fake news equation. When a phenomenon is new or not very well understood, qualitative research techniques are useful. These techniques - in this case, in-depth interviews and up-close observation of sharing behaviours - allowed us to explore fake news with nuance, richness and depth. Because we wanted to know what was spreading in encrypted private networks such as WhatsApp, ethnographic approaches - visiting people at home - were essential. This is the first known research project in these countries that uses these methods to understand the fake news phenomenon at the level of ordinary citizens. It is also the first to use data science and network analysis techniques to understand how known sources of fake news are organised on Twitter and Facebook, and what their connections are with audiences. This story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us.

Berry needle scare 'motivated by spite',"My Ut Trinh was arrested in Queensland on Sunday An Australian woman accused of putting sewing needles inside strawberries in a high-profile sabotage case was motivated by spite, a court has heard. My Ut Trinh, 50, was arrested on Sunday following a nationwide police investigation that began in September. Ms Trinh had worked as a supervisor at a strawberry farm north of Brisbane, according to Queensland Police. The maximum prison term for contaminating goods in Australia was recently raised to 15 years. Ms Trinh faces seven counts, and has not said whether she will fight the charges. The ""unprecedented"" strawberry scare spread to every Australian state and later to New Zealand, raising public alarm. Police said there had been 186 reports of needle-contaminated strawberries since September, though 15 turned out to have been hoaxes. It is not yet clear how many of those Ms Trinh is alleged to have caused. On Monday, police described their investigation as ""far from over"". Australia's strawberry needle scare widens Apple and banana in Australia needle scares PM vows crackdown on fruit scare 'idiots' The court in Brisbane on Monday heard that Ms Trinh's DNA had been found on strawberries in the state of Victoria. ""The case that is put is that it is motivated by some spite or revenge,"" Magistrate Christine Roney said. ""She has embarked on a course over several months of putting a metal object into fruit."" Ms Trinh allegedly intended to cause financial harm to a farm where she had worked, reported Fairfax Media, citing court documents. The first cases emerged in Queensland, where a man was taken to hospital with stomach pains after eating strawberries. Shocked consumers reported finding sewing needles in strawberries Farmers were forced to dump tonnes of berries, and supermarkets pulled the fruit off sale. In response, Australia's government raised the maximum prison term for fruit tampering from 10 to 15 years. Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed to ""throw the book"" at anyone responsible, saying: ""It's not funny, putting the livelihoods of hard-working Australians at risk, and you are scaring children. And you are a coward and a grub."" On Monday Supt Jon Wacker, from Queensland Police, described it as a ""unique investigation impacting virtually every state and jurisdiction in Australia"". In Queensland, where the strawberry industry is worth A$130m (Â£72m; $93m) a year,external, the local government pledged A$1m to support the state's stricken farmers. A $100,000 reward was offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of perpetrators. Prosecutors said they opposed giving bail to Ms Trinh because she may face ""retribution"" in the community. However, Ms Roney said a bail application would not be considered until more information about the case was known.

Neo-Nazi accused 'had Anarchist Cookbook',"Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas gave their child the middle name Adolf, the trial has heard An alleged neo-Nazi terrorist who named his child after Hitler had bomb-making instructions on his computer, a court has heard. Adam Thomas, 22, allegedly possessed terrorist document The Anarchist Cookbook, which contained instructions on making ""viable"" explosives. Mr Thomas, along with his partner Claudia Patatas, 38, and Daniel Bogunovic, 27, is charged with being a member of extreme far-right group National Action (NA). All three deny being in the group. Birmingham Crown Court has heard the Oxfordshire couplegave their child the middle name Adolf in honour of the infamous dictator. It is also alleged Mr Thomas posed in a photo with the babywhile wearing Ku Klux Klan robesand that they keptmachetes, crossbows and other weaponryat their home. Sharon Broome, principal forensic investigator for the Government's Forensics Explosives Laboratory, said the ""cookbook"" contained ""credible"" and ""potentially viable"" guidance on making bombs. In her report, she said it would ""enable somebody to identify the material needed and follow a process to make component parts of an improvised explosive device"". ""You could actually make a device if you get the component parts by following the instructions,"" she said. The ""cookbook"" was found on a laptop at the couple's home with headings for making plastic explosives, dynamite, pipe-bombs and Molotov Cocktails. The court also heard more about NA's background. Professor Matthew Feldman, director of the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right, said social media accounts associated with the group voiced support forthe murder of Labour MP Jo Coxin June 2016. One said: ""Only 649 MPs to go,"" while the NA's north east group Twitter account posted: ""Vote Leave. Don't let this man's sacrifice be in vain. Jo Cox would have filled Yorkshire with more sub-humans."" NA also used the words of Jo Cox's killer Thomas Mair on its website: ""Death to traitors - freedom for Britain."" Ms Patatas and Mr Thomas, both of Waltham Gardens, Banbury, and Bogunovic, of Crowns Hills Rise, Leicester, deny being members of a banned group. Mr Thomas further denies a separate charge of having The Anarchist Cookbook. The trial continues.

Universal credit 'pushing up rent arrears',"This video can not be played Universal Credit experience: 'I've been left behind' Council tenants on universal credit have on average more than double the rent arrears of those still on housing benefit, a BBC investigation has found. In Flintshire, north Wales, one of the first counties to test the new payment, the council says rent arrears have gone up by Â£1m. One claimant there said a mistake left him with just Â£29 a month to live on. But the UK government said it had listened to concerns and universal credit was working well. The BBC contacted every local authority in the UK that has council homes about their arrears. The results from the 129 councils that responded showed the average amount owed by tenants claiming universal credit across the UK is Â£662.56. For those still on housing benefit it is Â£262.50 Flintshire council said this week that tenants on universal credit in the county owe on average four times as much rent as those on the old benefits. At times it has been even higher; in September it was six times as much. In the 18 months since universal credit was introduced in Flintshire, the council's rent arrears have increased by Â£1m, something officials say is largely due to the new benefit. Universal credit,external, which had cross-party support when it was first proposed, brings together six benefits, such as job seekers allowance, child tax credits and, crucially, housing benefit, into one payment. To mirror being paid a salary, it is paid once a month - in arrears. While this has worked for some, other claimants have said it is this delay in the payment, combined with confusion over the online application process, that has seen families left with no income for weeks, forced to turn to food banks and choose between paying bills or paying their rent. Universal credit was rolled out to job centres in Flintshire in April 2017, meaning the local authority is ahead of much of the UK. Eighteen months on, 23% of benefit claimants are now on universal credit in Flintshire, compared with about 10% nationally. Currently one million people across the UK claim the new benefit, a figure that will eventually rise to eight million. Experts and council chiefs are expressing alarm. Single dad James McDaid was left with just Â£30 a month after paying his rent One person caught up in the universal credit confusion is single dad James McDaid. He stopped work to look after his two-year-old son, and says he immediately ran into trouble when he made his first claim. He received Â£579 a month, out of which he had to pay Â£550 in rent, and then buy food and pay other bills. Unable to find out why his payment was so low and forced to turn to the local food bank to have enough to eat, Mr McDaid said he had to wait for months while his claim was processed. ""If there weren't places like this [food bank] you'd be in trouble,"" he said. ""It's quite distressing, you panic about things. ""It's not fair to have that amount of stress. It's just mayhem because you just don't know if you're going to end up on the street or not."" What is universal credit? Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? Why some people on universal credit struggle to budget monthly For fellow universal credit claimant Anthony Smith, the prospect of living on the streets is even closer. After struggling to cope with the online application process, and being sanctioned for missing meetings, which he accepts made things worse, Mr Smith owed Â£4,000 in rent when Panorama spoke to him. ""I can quite easily see myself being evicted,"" said Mr Smith, 63, who has worked all his adult life. ""I've even looked for somewhere to live and I've found a bridge where I can live. ""The only thing I'm not playing ball with is I can't use a computer. I'm left behind."" Not long after he was interviewed, Mr Smith was told he would be evicted. Anita (C) says her family struggled because of Universal Credit Partners Anita Igbinoba and Richard Onwuemene had to rely on universal credit when a car accident prevented Mr Onwuemene from working. The couple said because of the way the benefit is calculated monthly, their first payment left them short and struggling with bills. Ms Igbinoba said: ""That [Â£53] was all we got. We couldn't pay council tax which we owed, we couldn't pay rent. Nobody listened to us, the bills were just going up and up and up. We couldn't get out of it. ""I'd sell things around the house just to make money to put in the electric for that week."" Universal credit is different because the amount for rent is paid straight to claimants, rather than direct to the landlord, like housing benefit. For those who struggle to keep their finances in order - like Keith Barber who suffers from depression - it can lead to financial trouble. Keith Barber admits he is not good at budgeting ""There's a fair chance the council won't be getting it [the rent],"" said Mr Barber, 56, who lives in Deeside. ""I'm just terrible with money - I can't budget at all."" Keith has missed appointments with the Job Centre and his local council. He now owes more than Â£1,000 in rent and is also facing eviction. Neal Cockerton said Flintshire council was having to evict tenants who cannot keep up with their rent payments Neal Cockerton, head of housing at Flintshire council, is facing a double problem of tenants who cannot pay their rent and may have to be evicted, and a growing hole in the council's finances. In 2017 the authority's rent arrears stood at Â£1.6m. That figure is now more than Â£2m. Flintshire council said this week that those on universal credit in the countyowe an average of Â£1,473as opposed to tenants on the old benefits, who owe Â£334. Mr Cockerton and his colleagues now increasingly have to take the difficult decision to evict tenants who cannot keep up with their rent payments. Evictions have increased by 55% compared to the same time last year. Mum forced to use food bank 'so low' More time given for switch to Universal Credit ""We do undertake a lot of intensive support before we get to that stage (eviction), but there is a degree of inevitability,"" he said. ""There's a bit of an ostrich situation that develops - you put your head in the sand and it will go away. It won't go away, the rent has to be paid."" Because universal credit is claimed online, the council has also had to employ four new staff to help with applications and arrears, another cost at a time when budgets are stretched. The government has given them more funding to offset this, but the council said not only is it not enough, it is stopping in April 2019. Prof Paul Hickman said universal credit should probably be scrapped Panorama has also discovered that the government knew rent arrears caused by universal credit could be a problem. Prof Paul Hickman of Sheffield Hallam University was asked by the UK government to look into the progress of the new benefit. His study, in 2011, found only 8% of tenants who made seven or more rent payments managed to pay their rent in full. He said the UK government had these figures but still went ahead with universal credit. ""Were we ignored?"" said Prof Hickman. ""Some of what we said was listened to but I think they were so committed to the course of rolling out universal credit so in some senses, whatever we found they were going to continue to plough ahead. ""I think realistically given the billions that have been spent in terms of implementing it, it's not going to happen... but I would probably scrap it."" The government has delayed migrating the majority of claimants over to universal credit for another year, as well as announcing more money for improvements to the system. Employment minister Alok Sharma said the new benefit is working, and claimed the rise in rent arrears is only temporary. He said: ""Universal credit is working well. What we have is a system which is simpler, a system which people understand and ultimately makes sure they get into work faster and stay in work longer. ""After a period of time people will on average see those (rent) arrears coming down. But the key point here is to make sure that people get support in terms of funding, and that is why early this year we introduced a package worth one and a half billion pounds which means that anyone who's coming onto universal credit who is currently receiving housing benefit will get an extra two weeks of run-on - two weeks of extra money."" When questioned about direct payments to claimants, the minister said: ""We have listened and made sure that it is possible for direct payments to be made to their landlord and that is actually happening across the country.""

Will RossAfrica editor, BBC World Service People queuing at an ATM in Khartoum, Sudan An economic crisis is deepening in Sudan with long queues outside banks and ATMs because of an acute shortage of cash. When money is available people are being allowed to withdraw only small amounts. Soaring demand for cash has been caused by inflation and a lack of trust in the banking system. The currency has plummeted in value - there are now 50 Sudanese pounds to $1, compared with just six in January. Sudanese economist Abda Almahdi in Khartoum told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme that people who have been able to withdraw money have been converting it into US dollars or buying real estate and gold. Earlier this year there were nationwide protests over the rising cost of living. Sudan has suffered from a lack of foreign currency since losing three-quarters of its oil reserves when the south of the country seceded in 2011. While many places stock up on alcohol ahead of the Christmas period, a city council in South Africa is doing the opposite - and pouring away thousands of litres of alcohol. South African news website News24posted a video,externalon Thursday of law enforcement officers in Cape Town carrying out their annual task of disposing of thousands of cans and bottles of liquor confiscated over the past 12 months - a total of 16,000 this year. In addition to having their alcohol seized, people who drink at the city's beaches, swimming pools and other public spaces face fines of 500 rand ($36, Â£28). They then have three months to pick up their drink from a storage depot, but many do not. Almost 4,000 bottles were seized on New Year's day alone, according to Cape Town Councillor JP Smith. He added that while the council would prefer to sell the alcohol and invest the proceeds in the city, a number of obstacles had prevented this so far - including that the city could be accused of ""profiteering"" from confiscating alcohol, and that the council doesn't have an alcohol licence.

Loan withdrawn earlier over pregnant schoolgirl ban Athuman MtulyaBBC Africa, Dar es Salaam President Magufuli (R) said Hafez Ghanem (L) had assured him the World Bank loan was still available The World Bank will lend Tanzania a $300m (Â£243m) educational
loan, Tanzaniaâs presidency has said, amid a row over pregnant schoolgirls. The announcement was made after President John Magufuli met Hafez Ghanem, the World Bankâs vice-president for Africa, in Dar es Salaam. The loan was withdrawn earlier this week over Tanzania's
controversial policy of prohibiting teenage mothers from re-admission to school
after giving birth. However, a senior World Bank official told BBC Swahili on
Wednesday that the bank would be open to dialogue. The details of Fridayâs meeting have not been made public
but Mr Magufuli insisted the funds had never been withdrawn âas people who
donât wish us well were sayingâ. He also said Mr Ghanemâs visit confirmed that the bank âwould
not abandon Tanzaniaâ. Tanzania is currently facing growing international pressure
over human rights concerns (see earlier post). The European Union has said its ambassador to Tanzania was
forced to leave earlier this month because of pressure from the authorities for
voicing concern about a planned crackdown on gay people. The EUâs strongly worded statement came shortly after Denmark
had announced that it was withholding $9.8m in aid after ""unacceptable
homophobic comments"" from a senior politician and ally of the president. Michael KalokiBBC News, Nairobi Kenya has refused to back down on fines imposed against some of the country's top banks over inadequate anti-fraud mechanisms. In September, the Central Bank ordered five banks to pay penalties totalling $3.8m (Â£3m) for failing to report suspicious transactions. The fines were ordered after almost $100m was stolen from the state National Youth Service agency. Senior government officials have been charged in relation to the theft. Kenya's Central Bank has reviewed the response from five banks to its investigation
and concluded the submissions by the lenders were not sufficient to reverse the
penalties. The banks were also accused of approving large transactions without
the proper documents. Will RossAfrica editor, BBC World Service Cape Town has suffered its worst drought in a century The South African city of Cape Town is considering a novel approach to save water after its worst drought in a century: cutting down trees. A global
conservation organisation, The Nature Conservancy, has suggested that the city's water supply could
be significantly boosted if non-native tree species like pine, acacia and
thirsty eucalyptus from Australia were cleared from the land. It says getting rid of those species would
also be around 10 times cheaper than other proposals to prevent water
shortages, like building desalination plants, recycling waste water or tapping
the groundwater supply. Just months after severe rationing helped
ensure the taps in Cape Town didn't run dry, the dams supplying water to the
city are now three-quarters full. But experts warn that more severe
droughts are likely in the years ahead. There have been other unusual suggestions to solve the city's water crisis,including the use of icebergs. Milton NkosiBBC Africa, Johannesburg Sean Davison came to prominence after helping his mother to die in New Zealand South Africaâs
leading pro-euthanasia activist Sean Davison is facing a second charge of
murder. The 57-year-old New
Zealand-born forensic scientist is the founder of right-to-die
organisation DignitySA. He was arrested
in September this year in connection with the death in 2013 of his friend
Anrich Burger, who had become a quadriplegic after a car accident. Prosecutor Megan
Blows said in Cape Townâs Magistrate Court on Friday morning: âWe are in a
position to add another charge of murder. Needless to say, the charges are
provisional and may change.â He is accused
of intentionally killing Justin Varian in 2015 by placing a bag over his head
and administering helium. Mr Varian had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease some years before. Mr Davison became a campaigner for the
right to assisted dying after he was arrested in New Zealand in 2010 for
helping his 85-year-old mother, who was ill with terminal cancer, to die four
years earlier. Archbishop
Desmond Tutu gave him a character reference and wrote to the judge calling for leniency. In the late 1990s, he had helped South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, chaired by Archbishop Tutu, to identify the remains of
anti-apartheid activists. The forensic scientist served five months
of house
arrest in New Zealand after pleading guilty to assisted suicide, before returning
home to his family in South Africa. During his last
court appearance in September, his lawyer maintained he had not committed any
offence. He is currently
on bail, and the case has been postponed until 29 January to allow for further
investigations. Since the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi on 2 October, Saudi Arabia has come under heavy criticism, with calls for trade boycotts of the Gulf kingdom.

In September, a teacher at the LycÃ©e Pierre MendÃ¨s-France in PÃ©ronne asked her class to read extracts from Akli Tadjer's novelLe porteur de cartable(The Satchel-Carrier). It tells the story of the war in Algeria from the perspective of two children, one the son of an independence fighter, the other the son of a French colonist forced to flee Algeria. Some students, the teacher later told the writer in an email, refused to read the extracts. The teacher complained about some of her pupils' ""racist remarks"" and invited the French writer with Algerian roots to the school in the Somme region. He says he is going so he can ""understand how young people can think like that"". Algeria achieved independence from France in 1962 after a bloody war. Bitterness remains on both sides, with refugees and their descendants having had difficulty returning to Algeria.

asylum in Egypt through the UN refugee agency in 2017, but went missing on 10 October,the US-based rights group said,external. HRW's Jehanne Henry said:  Egyptian and Sudanese authorities co-operated in forcibly disappearing and returning an asylum-seeker to Sudan, in clear violation of international norms and the prohibitions on enforced disappearances, persecution, and torture.  Having unlawfully detained him for weeks, Sudan has now charged him with serious crimes that carry the death penalty. They should drop the charges and release him immediately.""  Mr Boshi disappeared after five armed men, believed to be Egyptian security agents, searched his apartment in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, witnesses told HRW. On 8 November, Sudanâs national security agency said he was being charged with espionage and crimes against the state. According to HRW, relatives and lawyers have not been permitted to visit him. Boshi, formerly a member of an opposition party, has been detained and beaten twice for his activism in the past, it adds. Ms Henry said his forced disappearance comes after warming relations between Sudan and Egypt, adding: âDiplomatic rapprochement should not come at the cost of human rights.  Silencing critics in this way will not solve Sudanâs problems; Sudan needs to uphold its international obligations and release Boshi immediately.â  Ten African migrants who became stuck in the snow trying to cross the Alps illegally on foot from Italy into France have been rescued.

policy chief Federica Mogherinisaid in a statement,external:  This unprecedented attitude is not in line with the long-established tradition of bilateral dialogue.  The EU calls on Tanzanian authorities to refrain from exerting undue pressure and limitations on diplomatic missions.""  In light of this and other recent moves to undermine ""human rights and the rule of law"", she said that the EU would now conduct a âcomprehensive reviewâ of its support to Tanzania. The European Union and its member states have noticed a shrinking of public space in Tanzania through the tightening of restrictions on the activities of civil society organisations, the media and many political parties.  The EU is deeply concerned about the deteriorating situation for LGBTI persons.""  The EUâs review may not come as a surprise to President John Magufuli, reports the BBCâs Leonard Mbali from Dar es Salaam. Earlier in the week, aWorld Bank official confirmed to BBC Swahili that the bank was withdrawing a scheduled $300m (Â£243m) educational loanover Tanzania's controversial policy of prohibiting teenage mothers from re-admission to school after giving birth. On Thursday,Denmark announced that is was withholding $9.8m in aidafter ""unacceptable homophobic comments"" from a senior politician and ally of the president. Our reporter says Mr Magufuliâs tough anti-corruption stance in 2015, when he took office, earned him international admiration. But his subsequent intolerance to the opposition and media seems to be eroding donorsâ confidence of his leadership. This is of concern for the economy as foreign aid accounts for almost half of the national budget, our reporter says. A Kenyan Catholic priest has been killed by armed men in South Sudan. The East African Jesuits said in a Facebook post that 62-year-old Victor-Luke Odhiambo was in the TV room a church residence in Cueibet in Gok State when they attacked in the early hours of Thursday morning. Father Odhiambo was the principle of Mazzolari Teachers College in Cueibet. The authorities in Gok said on Friday that three people had been arrested in connection with the killing,local Radio Tamazuj news website reports,external. The motive behind the killing is still not known. The East African Jesuits said the cleric had been working in South Sudan for about 10 years. Â© 2025 BBC.

A year in fake news in Africa,"The spread of fake news in Africa has been blamed for igniting ethnic violence, sowing confusion among voters and even causing currency fluctuations. As the BBC launches major new research into fake news in Africa, we break down five false stories that made a big impact on the continent in the past 12 months. 1. Nigerian presidential candidate 'endorsed by gay rights groups' When Atiku Abubakar was confirmed as a presidential candidate for the Nigerian elections in 2019, a fake Twitter account in the name of the opposition leader posted a message thanking the ""Association of Nigerian Gay Men (ANGAM)"" for its support.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. In the post, ""Mr Abubakar"" writes that the first thing he would do if he were to become president would be to scrap the country's controversial anti-gay legislation, signed into law by former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan in 2014. Homosexual acts are punishable by up to 14 years in jail in Nigeria, while gay marriage and displays of same-sex affection are also banned. A screengrab of the fake news story from a Nigerian blog After originally being shared on Twitter on 14 October, the story was picked up by two Nigerian blogs. Then 12 days later, two prominent Nigerian newspapers,The Nation,externaland theVanguard,external, both published stories with a very similar theme. They reported that an LGBT organisation called ""Diverse"" was also backing Mr Abubakar for president, considering him a truly ""liberal candidate"". A fake news story about a presidential candidate advocating for gay rights could be used to undermine them. Highly influential Muslim and Christian leaders in Nigeria, who were united in their support for the anti-gay legislation, could tell their followers not to vote for such a candidate. The Twitter account which was the source of the original story is not an official account for the politician Atiku Abubakar. This ishis real account,external, verified with a blue tick by Twitter. This video can not be played Fake news is often published on legitimate-looking websites There is also no evidence that the LGBT rights organisations quoted in the initial tweet, or the subsequent blogposts and newspaper articles, even exist. There are no official records of the organisations themselves, which would be illegal under Nigerian law anyway. And neither they nor their purported spokesperson (Spinky Victor Lee) existed online before the emergence of the first tweet in October, as detailed in thisfact-check,externalby the Agence France Press (AFP) news agency. 2. Top Kenya media personality shares fake praise CNN business presenter Richard Quest was in the Kenyan capital Nairobi in October filming for his TV show. Former news anchor and media personality Julie Gichuru posted on her Twitter account on 25 October to discuss how much Mr Quest was apparently enjoying his time in Kenya. She posted the following quote, attributing it to Mr Quest. ""Nothing beats the service industry in Kenya... Here I am surrounded by giraffes while having breakfast! In a country declared by the World Bank as the Preferred Investment Destination in Africa, what else can I ask for? KENYA IS MAGICAL!"" Julie has over a million followers on her verified Twitter account and 600,000 on Instagram, so within minutes thousands of people had seen what she had posted and believed it to be true. Many poked fun at her for falling for a hoax given her high profile and her long career in the media industry. The CNN journalist came across Julie's tweet and was quick to point out that he hadn't made any such statement. He replied to her original post. Allow Twitter content?

Somalis 'pushed into shallow grave' in Ethiopia In July, the US-based Ethiopian Satellite Television (ESAT) station broadcast a video which it said showed ethnic Oromos in Ethiopia pushing the bodies of ethnic Somalis into a shallow grave. It claimed that the footage was taken in Ethiopia's Oromia region, where there has beendeadly violencebetween the two groups this year. The film showed bodies being rolled into a shallow grave The BBC's Afaan Oromo language servicereported thatthe widespread circulation of the video on social media in Ethiopia resulted in deadly attacks on ethnic Oromo people living in neighbouring Djibouti and Somalia. Oromo refugees in neighbouring Djibouti told the BBC that they had been beaten and their shops looted because of the video. The same unverified video was first shared in Cameroon, some 3,000km (1,800 miles) west of Ethiopia, in June, when it was said to relate to thecurrent conflictbetween Anglophone separatists and the government. The version of the video which aired on ESAT TV without being verified had apparently also been doctored, with audio of what were supposedly Oromo youths chanting inserted on top of the video's original sound. As soon as it realised the video was fake, ESAT removed it from its platforms and issued anofficial apology,externalon its YouTube channel. There is no suggestion that ESAT TV doctored the video or broadcast it knowing it was fake. Correction 23 November: This article has been updated to make it clear that ESAT TV was not responsible for doctoring the footage, or that it knowingly broadcast a fake video. 4. South African President Jacob Zuma's ""resignation"" On 12 February, a correspondent for South Africa's national broadcaster SABCreported,externalthat then-President Jacob Zuma had agreed to resign. Citing ""authoritative sources"", Tshepo Ikaneng broke the story during a live report outside a high-level meeting of members from the ruling African National Congress (ANC), who were discussing his future. Another South African journalist uploaded the announcement on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Zuma had been under immense pressure over multiple corruption scandals and had faced repeated calls from his party to step down. The country was waiting on news of his possible resignation. The South African rand, which had gained about 1% on the expectation that Mr Zuma would resign on 12 February, gave up some of its gains after the spokesman dismissed the SABC report.

Mr Zuma's spokesperson came out todeny the reports,external, saying they were ""fake news"". But three days later, Mr Zumaresigned- this time for real. 5. Tanzanian leader 'backs polygamy to end prostitution' An article claiming Tanzanian President John Magufuli had told men to marry more than one wife as a way to end prostitution went viral. It said that the president had addressed a ""conference of about 14,000 men"" telling them that ""out of approximately 70 million Tanzanians, 40 million are women and only 30 million are men."" This scarcity of men was leading to an increase in prostitution and adultery among women, the article claimed the president had said. The initial story published in the English language Zambia Observer website in February 2018 didn't create much of a stir. But it was only when it was published in Swahili, the national language of Tanzania, on a website called nipasheonline.com that the story really started to gain momentum. From there it was posted on the popular JamiiForums website, where it became a hot topic of discussion and spread to other news websites in Kenya, Zambia, South Africa and Ghana. Tanzania's official government spokesperson condemned the storyon Twitter,externalin Swahili, saying the president never uttered such remarks and people should ignore them. A fact-check byBBC Swahiliexposed further reasons we know the article was untrue. In the fake article, ""Mr Magufuli"" refers to a population of 70 million, with 10 million more women than men. But the latestUN estimates,externalput the total population of Tanzania at just under 60 million, with no substantial gender disparity. The website where the fake article was posted may also have sounded familiar to readers of the prominent Tanzanian newspaper Nipashe. But it has no connection to the real website for that newspaper, whose official home on the web ishttps://www.ippmedia.com/sw/nipashe,external.

Climate protesters 'ready to be jailed',"Protesters lay chained together on the pavement outside the UK government's energy department Environment activists who have blockaded the UK's energy department in London say 22 people have been arrested during the protest. The Met Police confirmed at least eight protestors have been detained. The UK is seen as a leader in policies to reduce greenhouse gases and will soon be considering tougher targets. But the protesters say research suggests the chance of keeping the global temperature rise under a 2C danger threshold is just one in 20. The demonstrators blocked entry to the offices by lying chained together on the pavement, while some glued themselves to the doors of the department building. Further protests are planned through the week and the demonstrators believe the public will take them seriously, as they are willing to go to jail for their cause. UK steps towards zero-carbon economy Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Some demonstrators also glued themselves to the door of the building They compare themselves with the suffragettes, the anti-apartheid movement, the followers of Gandhi, and the US civil rights movement, although their critics point out that these groups didn't have the vote. They have declared Saturday as Extinction Rebellion Day â the day theyâll commit acts of civil disobedience in the hope of jolting governments round the world into stronger action. Gail Bradbrook says she wants to protect the planet for her children's sake One of the protesters, Gail Bradbrook - a mother of two from Stroud - said: âI want the planet protected for my children. âChange comes when people are willing to commit acts of peaceful civil disobedience. âFifty people in jail for a short time is likely to bring the ecological crisis into the public consciousness.â The first mass meeting of the organisation last month drew 1,000 people to Westminster and blocked roads for two hours. There were 15 arrests. The organisers insist that this weekâs actions will be non-violent. They say if protesters commit an illegal act, they must stay on the spot to face the police. The police told BBC News they expected disruption on Saturday and were prepared for any level of protest. A member of the London Mayorâs office wondered privately if the protesters thought that freeing protesters from cycle locks was a good use of police time. Lizia Wolf said she felt compelled to act But Lizia Wolf told BBC News she felt compelled to act. âThe facts and figures are easily accessible if you have the stomach to look, but here within Extinction Rebellion and certainly with myself, is an offer of friendship, guidance and mutual grief. âThe first step towards creating the changes necessary for survival - and towards solving any problem in general - is to acknowledge the utterly terrifying situation we are in.â The protestersâ short-term aims are to cancel what they call âcontradictoryâ projects they say will actually increase emissions in the UK, such as the third runway at Heathrow, fracking and the Â£30bn roads programme. Their long-term aims are to: Oblige cabinet members to âtell the truthâ about the seriousness of the environmental crisis Make the UK carbon neutral by 2025 (the government is considering 2050 as a date for that) Set up a Peopleâs Assembly of ordinary citizens to decide priorities for reshaping the economy so that protecting the climate becomes Number One priority The aim of persuading some cabinet members to speak out may possibly be achievable. But experts say achieving a zero-emissions economy by 2025 isnât in any scenario. It would need a revolution in transport, home insulation, energy efficiency, agriculture and more. Setting up an assembly of mostly randomly selected citizens to take charge of the great economic shift will surely not be accepted by politicians. Tiana Jacout says she is happy to give up her freedom for the cause At the media launch of Extinction Rebellion, one young woman teared up, asking whether runaway climate change was an acceptable choice, when it was suggested that their demands were unlikely to be met. Another protester, Tiana Jacout, 31, from Bristol, told BBC News: âFinally! Someone has given us all permission to rage against the idea that we are barrelling towards extinction. âWe have been invited to decide, between those unbearable nights of watching the slow-moving car crash that is how humanity treats the world, or standing up for the world we know is possible. âI am happy to give up my freedom for the idea of that, that others can see a better world."" The protesters were boosted bya letter from 100 academics in the Guardian,externalâ including the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams. It said the failure of politicians to tackle climate breakdown and the growing extinction crisis means âthe 'social contract' has been brokenâ¦ [and] it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the governmentâs inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself.â Despite uncertainties in forecasts about the rate of heating, many senior scientists working on environmental change are genuinely alarmed by the huge risks mankind is taking. But can the UK really de-carbonise by 2025? Three professors concerned about the issue - Peter Cox, Jim Skea and Piers Forster - did not believe the timetable demanded by the Extinction Rebellion was possible. To the protesters, this wonât matter much. Theyâre harnessing new media to shake up what they see as societyâs complacency. They say failing to protect the climate isnât an option.

Trio guilty of Nazi group membership,"Claudia Patatas and Adam Thomas named their baby Adolf out of ""admiration"" for Hitler A couple who named their baby after Adolf Hitler have been found guilty of being members of a banned terrorist group. Adam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, from Banbury, along with Daniel Bogunovic, 27, from Leicester, were convicted of being in National Action. Birmingham Crown Court heard the couple gave their child the middle name Adolf in honour of the Nazi leader. Jurors saw images of Thomas in Ku Klux Klan robes while cradling his baby. The Neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action, founded in 2013, was outlawed under anti-terror legislation three years later after it celebratedthe murder of Labour MP Jo Cox. Prosecutors said the Midlands chapter of the group ""shed one skin for another"" and ""rebranded"" after being banned. They said the case was about ""a specific type of terror...born out of fanatical and tribal belief in white supremacy"". Thomas told the court that the pictures showing him wearing KKK clothing were ""just play"", but he admitted being a racist. Thomas was also found guilty of having a copy of terrorist manual the Anarchist Cookbook. Daniel Bogunovic, Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas stayed in National Action after it was banned Thomas and Patatas had two machetes, one with a serrated 18in (46cm) blade, in the bedroom where their baby son slept. A police search of their home in January also found one of two crossbows just a few feet from the baby's crib, the jury was told. Also found was a pastry cutter shaped like a swastika in a kitchen drawer, as well as pendants, flags and clothing emblazoned with symbols of the Nazi-era SS and National Action. Nazi-themed goods on Amazon marketplace Is National Action a threat to the UK? National Action co-founder confronted by the BBC YouTube attacked over Neo-Nazi video Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said a deleted Skype log was recovered from Thomas's laptop. He said the messages sent between two parties spoke of National Action being ""destroyed"", with its leaders agreeing to disband with ""no attempt at revival"". The group was founded in 2013 by Ben Raymond, now 29, and Alex Davies, now 24 It was intended to be an explicitly neo-Nazi party Raymond was a politics graduate from the University of Essex, and Davies was a Welsh former member of the British National Party National Action shunned democratic politics, regarding itself instead as a youth-based street movement It is believed it never had more than 100 members Its activities involved leafleting university campuses, aggressive publicity stunts and city-centre demonstrations In 2015, 25-year-old member Zack Davies used a hammer and machete to attack a Sikh dentist and was jailed for attempted murder After the murder of Jo Cox in 2016, an official National Action Twitter account posted: ""Only 649 MPs to go #WhiteJihad"" The group was banned later that year after the government concluded it was ""concerned in terrorism"" It became the first far-right group to be proscribed in this country since World War Two Reading from the log, Mr Jameson said: ""But the Midlands branch of NA, which is just 17-20 of us, have decided to ignore this and we've renamed ourselves the Thule Combat League. ""Traitors. Midlands will continue the fight alone."" Jurors reached unanimous verdicts after 12 hours of deliberating. The three defendants will be sentenced on 14 December. Patatas was given bail, while Thomas and Bogunovic were remanded in custody. Earlier this year Darren Fletcher, 28, from Wolverhampton; Nathan Pryke, 27, from March, Cambridgeshire; and Joel Wilmore, 24, from Stockport; also pleaded guilty to being in National Action. Jurors were shown a picture showing Adam Thomas in the robes of the Ku Klux Klan A swastika-shaped pastry cutter was found in the home of Patatas and Thomas Det Ch Supt Matt Ward, from West Midlands Police, said the defendants ""were not simply racist fantasists; we now know they were a dangerous, well-structured organisation"". He added: ""Their aim was to spread neo-Nazi ideology by provoking a race war in the UK, and they had spent years acquiring the skills to carry this out. ""Unchecked, they would have inspired violence and spread hatred and fear across the West Midlands."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the convictions were a ""significant success"" for the police. He said: ""We are determined to tackle the threat presented by extreme right-wing terrorism, as we are all forms of terrorism, which is why this government banned National Action in 2016."" The new parents and the UK's neo-Nazi terror threat 'Nazi' accused admits being a racist 'Nazi' posed in 'KKK robes with baby' Neo-Nazi accused 'had Anarchist Cookbook' Crossbow 'found near baby Adolf's crib' Dad 'posed in KKK robes with baby Adolf' 'Neo-nazi' couple named baby after Hitler HM Courts & Tribunals Service UK's 'first automotive resort' in Oxfordshire town approved Plans for vacant trading estate to be used as car park near shopping centre Calls that 'national inquiry now needed' for Oxford grooming gangs Public invited to join meeting on Oxfordshire health services Boy threatens dad with bread knife after 12 years in foster care No need for public inquiry on Oxford grooming gang, says council Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Why PM's deal may be impossible,"Opponents of the prime minister's Brexit deal are found outside and inside her cabinet It is no secret that Theresa May is struggling to get her cabinet on board. Seven days ago it felt that the ingredients for concluding this vital stage of the Brexit deal were there, waiting perhaps for the political moment to feel right. But a week on, tortured negotiations continue both between the UK and the EU, and between Downing Street and those who gather at Number 10 for the weekly cabinet meeting. And perhaps you shouldn't be surprised at how reluctant the cabinet is to sign up. The simple explanation of why they aren't all gladly rushing to back exactly what the prime minister has been planning?Many of them didn't like it much from the start, and some of them don't believe it has a chance of passing Parliament now. This is not just about the problems of the Irish border, but aboutthe prime minister's overall preferred plan for Brexit, brokered in the heat of the summer at her Chequers country retreat. Leadsom: UK must not be trapped in backstop Thornberry: New referendum 'still an option' Minister Jo Johnson quits over Brexit There's no secret that the proposals were unpopular with the big Brexiteers. Thedramatic departures of David DavisandBoris Johnsonsaw to that. But what is only now clear from cabinet sources is just how widespread the discontent was - expressed not just by Eurosceptics but by former Remainers too. And the frustrations from months ago are unquestionably part of the reason why there is such a stalemate now. Two cabinet ministers last night told the BBC there was little chance that the deal as currently planned would get through parliament. One of them said it was ""self-harming"" for the prime minister to keep pursuing the same strategy. Sources have described how multiple cabinet ministers expressed significant doubts from the start. Elements of the so-called Chequers proposals were described as ""worrying"", ""disappointing"", and ""concerning"" by different members of the prime minister's top team, as the press waited in sweltering heat outside at the end of the grand estate's very, very long drive, across the other side of what actually was, joking apart, a field of wheat. Theresa May outlines her Brexit plan at Chequers And what's really notable is how some former Remainers - including Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - were candid about their fears too. This was not just an exercise in Brexiteers sounding off, but ministers from across the Tory party pointing to deficiencies in the proposed deal. UK must be able to end backstop, says Fox DUP leader urges PM to 'reflect' on EU deal Chancellor Philip Hammond has questioned whether the EU will agree the deal I've also been told that several ministers, on both sides of the argument, are understood to have called on the prime minister to be honest with the public about the shift in position towards a closer arrangement with the EU. Months on, I've lost count of the number of times ministers and advisers in government have expressed frustration at how they perceive Theresa May has failed to do that. Even for some of her backers, her strongest selling point should be being upfront about the fact she is trying hard to find a middle course, not to be the ideologue making crazy promises. Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon But around Westminster, there is deep frustration on the Tory backbenches that she rarely seems willing to make that case, always sticking to a few tight lines that concede only the bare minimum about what she is trying to do. Of course, the Chequers meeting did ultimately give the prime minister's plan its backing. Ministers like the chancellor and the business secretary were clear that the risk of no deal was simply not worth taking. But from what sources have described it is extremely clear that for many of those present, the Chequers proposals were a deeply undesirable compromise, rather than a plan they were agreeing to with any enthusiasm. One senior minister told me most of those present signed up ""with a very heavy heart"". A Number 10 spokesman said: ""Everyone has to move a little to get a deal that works for everyone on both sides of the argument."" But the roots of the current impasse at home surely lie in much of the cabinet's view at that time. If they didn't like it much then, why would they like it much now, let alone help the prime minister fight for it? With the EU reluctant to budge, and Parliament deeply unconvinced, what was a deeply unappetising compromise may yet prove an impossible one.

Pound falls as uncertainty rises,"The pound has sunk in volatile trading after reports that a Brexit deal was near were downplayed by UK officials. Downing Street said ""substantial issues"" still need to be resolved as negotiators try to secure an agreement over the UK's exit from the EU. The pound fell almost 1% against the dollar to $1.286, whilst against the euro it was 0.2% lower at â¬1.142. Analysts said the pound's movements over the next week would depend on how the Brexit talks developed. The pound initially sagged in morning trading amid increasing disarray in the cabinet over the UK's exit from the EU, before briefly recovering on hopes of a deal and then later sinking again as those hopes were downplayed. ""While some European officials are still sounding optimistic that an EC-UK deal can be struck in the coming weeks, the market has grown more sceptical,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. Mrs May is trying to rally supportamong cabinet ministers for her Brexit proposal in time for a hoped-for summit in Brussels later this month. On Friday,Transport Minister Jo Johnsonbecame the latest government figure to quit his post over Brexit, arguing that UK was ""on the brink of the greatest crisis"" since World War Two. Ministers 'voiced Brexit plan doubts in July' Why May's Brexit deal may be impossible Brexit: All you need to know Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon, told the BBC that the pound's weakness against the dollar was ""obviously related to the uncertainty over the weekend"", but added: ""At least half of it is actually about dollar strength and the expectation that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in December."" The resurgent dollar also hit the euro, down 0.7% against the greenback on Monday to $1.1251, having earlier touched a 17-month low.

"Ministers lying about badger cull, say vets","A campaign group of vets has accused Defra and its ministers of telling ""barefaced lies"" about the effectiveness of one of its badger culls. The claim is contained in a letter from the group to the chief vet. It asks her to ensure the department retracts ""insupportable claims that its badger cull policy is working"". A spokesman for Defra said all statements had been ""absolutely correct"". Dr Iain McGill, a veterinary surgeon and director of Prion Interest Group, told BBC News that claims by Defra (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) that the badger cull in Somerset and Gloucestershire were working were not supported by scientific evidence. ""According to Defra's figures, they claim that they calculated that the incidence [of TB in cattle] has reduced. ""But their calculations are unclear and deliberately opaque. And, indeed, the current situation in the cull zone says there is an increased prevalence. ""So, either their figures were calculated on an extremely inaccurate basis and they've got it very badly wrong, or they have actually gerrymandered those figures to make it look as if the incidence is falling when the evidence clearly shows that the prevalence has gone up. ""Badger culling has not worked. They are issuing barefaced lies in this matter."" Has Defra shown badger culling works? 'Fake science used to back badger culls' Badger cull plan 'crazy scheme' The letter to chief vet Dr Christine Middlemiss goes on to accuse Farming Minister George Eustice of giving misleading comments in September about a report produced by Defra's own scientists at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). Mr Eustice had said: ""Today's figures showing reductions in TB cases in Somerset and Gloucestershire,externalare evidence that our strategy for dealing with this slow-moving, insidious disease is delivering results."" However, the  APHA report he quotes from explicitly states, ""these data alone cannot demonstrate whether the badger control policy is effective in reducing bovine TB in cattle"". This video can not be played The science behind the badger cull was established in 1990s On 29 October, Defra went further in a statement to BBC Radio 4's Farming Today programme when it indicated that the alleged reduction in TB cases was due to the badger culls: ""The findings published in September showed that initial [badger] culls in the Higher Risk Area (HRA) have had a positive impact on disease incidence."" The department has not mentioned that instances of TB have been rising in a cull area in Dorset. Dr Chris Cheeseman is former head of Defra's wildlife epidemiology unit and advised the department on its TB strategy for more than 40 years. Now retired, he is able to speak freely about the badger cull policy. ""Defra has been cherry-picking the science since they started culling,"" he told BBC News. ""The fact that they are rolling it out on such a vast scale is a travesty of the available science."" In response, a Defra statement said: ""The latest statistics showed reductions in new outbreaks of bovine TB in the initial cull areas, an encouraging sign that the steps we have taken have had a positive impact. ""Based on this scientific data, Minister Eustice was absolutely correct to describe this progress as encouraging."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove commissioned an independent expert review earlier this year of Defra's efforts to control cattle TB - which will be published tomorrow. Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test Dr McGill's group has also raised concerns that new research adds to evidence that a skin test widely used by the department to detect the presence of TB in cattle is much less effective than claimed. On Defra's TB Hub, it is stated that effectiveness ""lies between 52% and 100%,externalwith an average of about 80% sensitivity at standard interpretation"". But two new research papers indicate that the average effectiveness may be much lower, between 50% and 60% at best. Jan Bayley of the Animal Welfare Group, which is campaigning against the cull in Gloucestershire, says that Defra is missing many cases of TB in cattle with these tests. She said: ""Farmers are being told that their herds are TB-free. They then go down with disease three or six months later and they automatically assume it's got to be badgers. ""Defra is really not explaining to farmers that there is a high probability that those herds are still infected."" Defra conceded in a paragraph ofa consultation paper published in 2016,external- but not widely publicised - that most new TB cases in high-risk areas were probably due to infected cattle: ""This substantial probability of 'residual' herd infection contributes to the high rate of recurrence seen in the high-risk areas, where nearly 60% of TB breakdowns (TB cases) occur in herds."" Much of the new work on the effectiveness of the skin test was conducted by Defra's own scientists at APHA in Surrey. Defra declined a request by BBC News to speak directly to the researchers involved, although the department's press officers did offer to mediate written questions. A spokesperson explained that it was against the civil service code for civil servants to speak to journalists without the permission of ministers. This includes instances where the research is publicly funded and published in peer-reviewed journals. Former Defra scientist Dr Chris Cheeseman said he regarded this as a misuse in the application of the civil service code: ""When I was a scientist working for governments, I always maintained the principle that I stuck to the truth. ""I think it's outrageous that the government should gag in any way scientists who work for them, either independently or directly. I think that's completely unacceptable in a democracy."" Defra responded: ""Any requests to interview civil servants are handled in line withthe civil service code,external. This states that civil servants must not make any public statement which might draw upon experience in their official capacity without the prior approval of their department. ""As a starting point, the views of the civil servant as to whether they would consider accepting the request would be taken into account.""

UK Cycle Network 'unsafe for children',"Almost half of the UK's flagship cycling routes are unsafe for a child of 12 to use, a transport charity says. Sustrans says poor surfaces, traffic, and too many barriers are making more than 7,500 miles of tracks inaccessible to young users, and other groups. ""There may as well be a 'no entry' sign on their local path,"" the group's chief executive Xavier Brice said. The group is calling for an overhaul of the 16,575 miles of cycle routes ""to make the network safer for everyone"". It says its long-term goal is to make the network traffic-free and ""safe for a 12-year-old to use on their own"". A route being safe for a 12-year-old is a safety benchmark set by the UK government. But according to Sustrans, two-thirds of the network is on the road - including nearly 2,000 miles of A and B roads. What is stopping women from cycling? 'Lost' cycle ways found on Street View The Paths for Everyone report, a review and independent audit of the network commissioned by Sustrans, classified 42% of the UK's Cycle Network as ""very poor"". As well as being unsafe for children, it says thousands of miles of cycle routes are unsuitable for those with mobility issues and the less physically active. The charity - which itself owns 500 miles of the network - says improvements could be made, including: doubling the number of paths away from cars, from 5,000 to 10,000 miles diverting all routes off busy and fast-moving roads onto quieter routes removing or redesigning 16,000 barriers, to improve accessibility improved safety at road and rail junctions introducing wider, better surfaced paths It says these improvements would cost Â£2.8bn and would lead to the number of users rising from 4.4 million in 2017 to 8.4 million. The review has highlighted 50 so-called ""activation projects"" which Sustrans aims to see completed by 2023, at a cost of Â£60 million. These include: rerouting the National Route 5 between Flint and Connah's Quay in North Wales to circumvent a major A road and create a new traffic-free path following the coastline bridging the River Bann in Northern Ireland to allow cyclists to complete the 113-mile Lap the Lough circuit, ending the current 16-mile detour realigning the National Route 76 in Stirling to avoid the multi-lane Manor Powis roundabout on the A907 Cycling and walking minister Jesse Norman said the cycle network was a great asset for cyclists and walkers but the report showed more needed to be done to make it fully accessible. Earlier in the year, the government announced Â£1m to repair and upgrade sections of the routes. The Scottish Government has committed Â£7m towards the development and maintenance of the paths in Scotland.

Firms 'struggling to recruit migrant staff',"Firms seeking staff are being hit by labour shortages, with a ""reversal"" in the number of migrants in UK workplaces, says HR body the CIPD. As Brexit approaches, the CIPD says the shortage of both EU and non-EU migrants reflects a falling interest in the UK as a destination for migrant workers. And it said research among over 1,000 employers suggested that vacancies are becoming harder to fill. The squeeze is leading employers to increase pay rates, said the CIPD. While the short-term outlook for employment remains strong, labour and skills shortages are accelerating, says the institute. According to the latest official data, the number of non-UK-born workers in the UK decreased by 58,000 between April to June last year and the same period this year, with 40,000 of these non-EU-born workers. This compares with an increase of 263,000 for the same period between 2016 and 2017. ""The data implies that the pendulum has swung away from the UK as an attractive place to live and work for non-UK-born citizens, especially non-EU citizens, during a period of strong employment growth and low unemployment,"" said Gerwyn Davies of the CIPD. ""This has heightened recruitment difficulties for some employers. ""It also underlines the risk that more non-UK-born citizens and employers will be discouraged from using the post-Brexit system if more support is not provided and it is not made simpler, fairer and more affordable; especially for lower-skilled roles. ""Against the backdrop of a tight labour market, failure to do this will heighten recruitment difficulties and could lead to negative consequences for existing staff, such as higher workloads, and loss of business or orders for firms."" Looking ahead, the CIPD says that the UK labour supply looks set to be further constrained from 2021 when migration restrictions for EU citizens are introduced, especially for lower-skilled workers. It says that employers express concern that the main route for recruiting EU citizens to fill lower-skilled roles that was recently proposed by the Migration Advisory Committee won't be enough to satisfy their recruitment needs. It is likely that the current points-based system for non-EU immigrants will be adopted for EU citizens from 2021. However, the report found a third of employers who employ non-EU citizens say the administrative burden of using the points-based system is too great.

Ministers 'want deal by end of month',"Senior ministers have agreed they want to reach a Brexit deal with the EU by the end of November, sources say. ""Everyone saw the difficulties of leaving it longer,"" a senior cabinet source told the BBC. Meanwhile, the BBC has seen a detailed suggested timetable of how the government could try to sell a deal to MPs and the public. It includes speeches from Theresa May and support from business figures and foreign leaders. Kuenssberg: A plan for presenting a Brexit deal? In full: The notes of a plan for selling Brexit deal Ireland tells the UK to stick to its commitments The notes, which the government has dismissed, suggest the cabinet had hoped to review a Brexit withdrawal deal when it met earlier. Sources say a final deal was not presented to the cabinet but that ministers agreed they want a deal to be done this month and they could meet again later this week. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March but the two sides have not yet agreed on the terms of its departure, with the Irish border proving the main sticking point. If a deal can be reached with the EU in time, Mrs May will then need to persuade her party - and the rest of Parliament - to support it in a key Commons vote. The notes seen by the BBC outline how ministers could present the deal, saying: ""The narrative is going to be measured success, that this is good for everyone but won't be all champagne corks popping."" They refer to a speech by Mrs May to the CBI, saying: ""We have delivered on the referendum."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And they go on to talk about the government ""lining up 25 top business voices...and lots of world leaders eg Japanese PM to tweet support for the deal"". It suggests the government would hope to declare they had made decisive progress and to get the deal through Parliament in less than three weeks. Car parts plants to close on Brexit worries But a government spokesman said: ""The misspelling and childish language in this document should be enough to make clear it doesn't represent the government's thinking. ""You would expect the government to have plans for all situations - to be clear, this isn't one of them."" The spokesman did not deny there were advanced plans for building support for a deal if and when it is concluded. Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit select committee, said Mrs May should concentrate on securing a deal rather than on how to sell an agreement that was not yet done. ""When you get a deal, you can think about how you are going to tell people about it,"" he told the BBC. Earlier, No 10 said the prime minister assured ministers that the cabinet would meet before the UK agreed to any deal on the terms of the UK's exit. The withdrawal deal is said to be 95% complete but the tricky bit is proving to be how to honour the commitment by both sides to guarantee no new hard border in Ireland. There is disagreement on whether this ""backstop"" should apply to Northern Ireland, or the whole of the UK - and on whether it should be time-limited or revoked by the UK. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has dismissed claims that he might resign At the cabinet meeting it is understood ministers discussed the mechanism for governing the backstop and who should decide when it no longer applied. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is understood to have set out the legal position for an independent review mechanism for the backstop. He is believed to have told ministers there is a legal ""spectrum"" of what is possible to prevent the UK from being trapped ""in limbo"". The Irish border is an issue because after Brexit it will become the UK's land border with the rest of the EU, which has a single market and customs union so products do not need to be checked when they pass between member states. EU negotiator Michel Barnier told a Belgian broadcaster that the Irish border remained the main hurdle to be overcome but if enough progress is made he would recommend that a summit is convened to finalise the deal. Meanwhile, the government has published the criteria for allocating scarce permits for British truckers who need to drive in the EU after Brexit. The permits will be shared out based on: vehicle emissions, number of international journeys in the previous year, number of international journeys as a percentage of all journeys, type of goods transported and an element of chance. The Department for Transport,externaldocument says the permits would be required for a no deal scenario BUT might also be required after the future economic partnership is agreed, depending on the type of deal.

wanted to be assured of security before returning to the remote desert region. Will RossAfrica editor, BBC World Service People queuing at an ATM in Khartoum, Sudan An economic crisis is deepening in Sudan with long queues outside banks and ATMs because of an acute shortage of cash. When money is available people are being allowed to withdraw only small amounts. Soaring demand for cash has been caused by inflation and a lack of trust in the banking system. The currency has plummeted in value - there are now 50 Sudanese pounds to $1, compared with just six in January. Sudanese economist Abda Almahdi in Khartoum told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme that people who have been able to withdraw money have been converting it into US dollars or buying real estate and gold. Earlier this year there were nationwide protests over the rising cost of living. Sudan has suffered from a lack of foreign currency since losing three-quarters of its oil reserves when the south of the country seceded in 2011. While many places stock up on alcohol ahead of the Christmas period, a city council in South Africa is doing the opposite - and pouring away thousands of litres of alcohol. South African news website News24posted a video,externalon Thursday of law enforcement officers in Cape Town carrying out their annual task of disposing of thousands of cans and bottles of liquor confiscated over the past 12 months - a total of 16,000 this year. In addition to having their alcohol seized, people who drink at the city's beaches, swimming pools and other public spaces face fines of 500 rand ($36, Â£28). They then have three months to pick up their drink from a storage depot, but many do not. Almost 4,000 bottles were seized on New Year's day alone, according to Cape Town Councillor JP Smith. He added that while the council would prefer to sell the alcohol and invest the proceeds in the city, a number of obstacles had prevented this so far - including that the city could be accused of ""profiteering"" from confiscating alcohol, and that the council doesn't have an alcohol licence.

Loan withdrawn earlier over pregnant schoolgirl ban Athuman MtulyaBBC Africa, Dar es Salaam President Magufuli (R) said Hafez Ghanem (L) had assured him the World Bank loan was still available The World Bank will lend Tanzania a $300m (Â£243m) educational
loan, Tanzaniaâs presidency has said, amid a row over pregnant schoolgirls. The announcement was made after President John Magufuli met Hafez Ghanem, the World Bankâs vice-president for Africa, in Dar es Salaam. The loan was withdrawn earlier this week over Tanzania's
controversial policy of prohibiting teenage mothers from re-admission to school
after giving birth. However, a senior World Bank official told BBC Swahili on
Wednesday that the bank would be open to dialogue. The details of Fridayâs meeting have not been made public
but Mr Magufuli insisted the funds had never been withdrawn âas people who
donât wish us well were sayingâ. He also said Mr Ghanemâs visit confirmed that the bank âwould
not abandon Tanzaniaâ. Tanzania is currently facing growing international pressure
over human rights concerns (see earlier post). The European Union has said its ambassador to Tanzania was
forced to leave earlier this month because of pressure from the authorities for
voicing concern about a planned crackdown on gay people. The EUâs strongly worded statement came shortly after Denmark
had announced that it was withholding $9.8m in aid after ""unacceptable
homophobic comments"" from a senior politician and ally of the president. Michael KalokiBBC News, Nairobi Kenya has refused to back down on fines imposed against some of the country's top banks over inadequate anti-fraud mechanisms. In September, the Central Bank ordered five banks to pay penalties totalling $3.8m (Â£3m) for failing to report suspicious transactions. The fines were ordered after almost $100m was stolen from the state National Youth Service agency. Senior government officials have been charged in relation to the theft. Kenya's Central Bank has reviewed the response from five banks to its investigation
and concluded the submissions by the lenders were not sufficient to reverse the
penalties. The banks were also accused of approving large transactions without
the proper documents. Will RossAfrica editor, BBC World Service Cape Town has suffered its worst drought in a century The South African city of Cape Town is considering a novel approach to save water after its worst drought in a century: cutting down trees. A global
conservation organisation, The Nature Conservancy, has suggested that the city's water supply could
be significantly boosted if non-native tree species like pine, acacia and
thirsty eucalyptus from Australia were cleared from the land. It says getting rid of those species would
also be around 10 times cheaper than other proposals to prevent water
shortages, like building desalination plants, recycling waste water or tapping
the groundwater supply. Just months after severe rationing helped
ensure the taps in Cape Town didn't run dry, the dams supplying water to the
city are now three-quarters full. But experts warn that more severe
droughts are likely in the years ahead. There have been other unusual suggestions to solve the city's water crisis,including the use of icebergs. Milton NkosiBBC Africa, Johannesburg Sean Davison came to prominence after helping his mother to die in New Zealand South Africaâs
leading pro-euthanasia activist Sean Davison is facing a second charge of
murder. The 57-year-old New
Zealand-born forensic scientist is the founder of right-to-die
organisation DignitySA. He was arrested
in September this year in connection with the death in 2013 of his friend
Anrich Burger, who had become a quadriplegic after a car accident. Prosecutor Megan
Blows said in Cape Townâs Magistrate Court on Friday morning: âWe are in a
position to add another charge of murder. Needless to say, the charges are
provisional and may change.â He is accused
of intentionally killing Justin Varian in 2015 by placing a bag over his head
and administering helium. Mr Varian had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease some years before. Mr Davison became a campaigner for the
right to assisted dying after he was arrested in New Zealand in 2010 for
helping his 85-year-old mother, who was ill with terminal cancer, to die four
years earlier. Archbishop
Desmond Tutu gave him a character reference and wrote to the judge calling for leniency. In the late 1990s, he had helped South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, chaired by Archbishop Tutu, to identify the remains of
anti-apartheid activists. The forensic scientist served five months
of house
arrest in New Zealand after pleading guilty to assisted suicide, before returning
home to his family in South Africa. During his last
court appearance in September, his lawyer maintained he had not committed any
offence. He is currently
on bail, and the case has been postponed until 29 January to allow for further
investigations. Since the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi on 2 October, Saudi Arabia has come under heavy criticism, with calls for trade boycotts of the Gulf kingdom. The effects of this outrage are rippling all the way to South Africa, whose defence industry could suffer if ties with Riyadh are strained, as the BBCâs Africa Security Correspondent Tomi Oladipo explains: This video can not be played Khashoggi, South African arms and the Saudis - Explained Video journalist: Mike Onyiego Akli Tadjer was due to meet 25 pupils from the school A novelist whose book was rejected by French teenagers because of its Algerian theme is due to visit their school and meet them face to face. In September, a teacher at the LycÃ©e Pierre MendÃ¨s-France in PÃ©ronne asked her class to read extracts from Akli Tadjer's novelLe porteur de cartable(The Satchel-Carrier). It tells the story of the war in Algeria from the perspective of two children, one the son of an independence fighter, the other the son of a French colonist forced to flee Algeria.

fraudster Kweku Adoboli has received a warm welcome by relatives after his
arrival in Ghana. The
38-year-old former UBS trader was deported on Wednesday from the UK, where
he had lived for 26 years, despite a long campaign to keep him in Britain. He
arrived in Ghana on a Kenyan Airways flight, accompanied by five UK guards, and was
met by members of his extended family at the airport. Mr
Adoboli served four years of a seven-year sentence for a Â£1.4bn
($1.8bn) fraud and was released in 2015. Ghanaâs
Daily Graphic says when he arrived at the family home in Tema, an hourâs drive
outside the capital, Accra,he was served with local dishes of âakpleâ and âfetridetsiâ,externalâ plus a chilled beer. The
UK authorities say foreign nationals sentenced to more than four years in
prison are subject to automatic deportation. His
supporters had argued that given the amount of time he had spent in the UK, he
should have been entitled to British citizenship. Ghanaian-American rapper turned director Blitz Bazawule was in London for the UK premiere of The Burial of Kojo at Film Africa.

Congo have shot dead two students during protests in the capital,
Kinshasa. On Monday students at Kinshasa University
held a demonstration calling for classes to resume as lecturers were on strike
over pay. It turned violent and one student
was shot by the police. When students learnt on Thursday the
student had died, they started rioting on the campus. The Congolese police confirmed that
a second student was then shot dead. A spokesman said 12 police officers
were injured and buildings as well as vehicles were vandalised.

MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa said protesters had ""opened themselves for attacks"" Zimbabwe's opposition leader has apologised after appearing to insult people who protested over allegations of fraud in the election held on 30 July. Six people were shot dead two days after the poll in clashes with security forces. The same day, MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa said he had won the popular vote and that ""manipulation"" would not prevent his victory. He has refused to accept the final election result, announced on 3 August, in which President Emmerson Mnangagwa narrowly avoided a second-round run-off with 50.7% of the vote. But on Thursday Mr Chamisa told journalists the demonstrations had been ""stupid"". The vote was the first since long-time leader Robert Mugabe was ousted from power last year. A seven-member independent commission of inquiry has begun hearing testimony to establish who was to blame for the protests and the fatalities. Mr Chamisa has been called to appear before the commission next week. Read the BBC News story for more. Mohamed Boshi remained critical of the government on Facebook after his move to Cairo in 2017 Human Rights Watch (HRW) has called for Sudan to release a 35-year-old
activist after his secret rendition from Egypt. Mohamed Boshi, a vocal critic of the government, had sought
asylum in Egypt through the UN refugee agency in 2017, but went missing on 10 October,the US-based rights group said,external. HRW's Jehanne Henry said:  Egyptian and Sudanese authorities co-operated in forcibly disappearing and returning an asylum-seeker to Sudan, in clear violation of international norms and the prohibitions on enforced disappearances, persecution, and torture.  Having unlawfully detained him for weeks, Sudan has now charged him with serious crimes that carry the death penalty. They should drop the charges and release him immediately.""  Mr Boshi disappeared after five armed men, believed to be Egyptian security agents, searched his apartment in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, witnesses told HRW. On 8 November, Sudanâs national security agency said he was being charged with espionage and crimes against the state. According to HRW, relatives and lawyers have not been permitted to visit him. Boshi, formerly a member of an opposition party, has been detained and beaten twice for his activism in the past, it adds. Ms Henry said his forced disappearance comes after warming relations between Sudan and Egypt, adding: âDiplomatic rapprochement should not come at the cost of human rights.  Silencing critics in this way will not solve Sudanâs problems; Sudan needs to uphold its international obligations and release Boshi immediately.â  Ten African migrants who became stuck in the snow trying to cross the Alps illegally on foot from Italy into France have been rescued.

The EUâs review may not come as a surprise to President John Magufuli, reports the BBCâs Leonard Mbali from Dar es Salaam.

"Israelis 'kill Hamas commander' in GazaPalestinians say seven people were killed and Israel confirms a soldier died in ""operational activity"".Middle East","Israel carried out air strikes when the firefight erupted Seven Palestinians, including a local militant commander, have been killed during a covert Israeli operation in Gaza, Palestinian officials say. An Israeli soldier was also killed and another wounded, the Israeli military said, after a firefight erupted. Palestinians said an Israeli unit travelling in a civilian vehicle had killed the Hamas commander. It was followed by rocket-fire into Israel, while on Monday a Palestinian mortar hit an Israeli bus. Initial reports say the vehicle was empty, although a 19-year-old was seriously hurt, Israel's ambulance service said. According to Palestinian sources, the Israeli unit was about 3km (2 miles) inside the Gaza Strip, which borders Israel, when it fired at Nur Barakeh, a commander of the Izzedine al-Qassam brigades, Hamas' military wing. The incident is reported to have happened east of Khan Younis, in the south of the territory. A gun battle erupted and Israeli tanks and aircraft opened fire in the area, witnesses said. Hamas commander Nur Barakeh's mother was seen at the morgue where his body was reportedly brought Six of the Palestinians killed belonged to Hamas - the militant Islamist group which controls the Gaza Strip - and the seventh was a member of the militant Popular Resistance Committees, AFP news agency cited Palestinian officials as saying. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a member of the special unit involved was killed and another was lightly wounded. In the wake of the clashes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his visit to Paris for events to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One and returned to Israel, his office said. Due to the secrecy of the operation, Israel has not revealed specific details about the mission. The IDF said though that the operation was ""not intended to kill or abduct terrorists, but to strengthen Israeli security"". The BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem says that according to a former Israeli general, the incident was likely to have been an intelligence gathering operation that went wrong. The exposure of such an operation by Israeli special forces inside Gaza would be extremely rare, he says. Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for the group, denounced the incident as a ""cowardly Israeli attack"". IDF chief Lt Gen Gadi Eisenkot said the Israeli unit had carried out ""a very meaningful operation to Israel's security"", without giving further details. The Israeli military said that after the clashes 17 rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israel and three were shot down. Life in the Gaza Strip Gaza protest image likened to famous painting Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and reinforced its power in the Gaza Strip after ousting West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' rival Fatah faction in clashes the following year. While Mr Abbas' umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has signed peace accords with Israel, Hamas does not recognise Israel's right to exist and advocates the use of violence against it. Schools have been ordered closed in Israeli border communities as a precaution Israel, along with Egypt, has maintained a blockade of Gaza since about 2006, in order, they say, to stop attacks by militants. Israel and Hamas have gone to war three times, and rocket-fire from Gaza and Israel air strikes against militant targets are a regular occurrence. Sunday night's incident comes after apparent progress in an Egyptian- and UN-brokered process to mediate after a series of escalations between the two sides in recent months. More than 200 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli forces since the end of March - most during weekly protests along the border at which thousands have expressed their support for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? Israel has said its soldiers have only opened fire in self-defence or on potential attackers trying to infiltrate its territory under the cover of the protests. One Israeli soldier was killed on the Gaza-Israel border by a Palestinian sniper in July.

Rail company wants more women driversSoutheastern says it wants 40% of applications for driver vacancies to come from women.England,"Kelly-Joe Ballard say she always wanted to be a train driver Rail companies have launched campaigns to recruit more women train drivers. Southeastern, which serves London, Kent and East Sussex, said fewer than 5% of its drivers were women and it wants 40% of applicants to be women by 2021. Its train services director Ellie Burrows said: ""It's no longer the case that little boys play with toy trains and little girls play with dolls."" Train driver Kelly-Joe Ballard said there ""isn't anything stopping a woman from becoming a train driver"". ""I think it's a society perception that train driving is seen as a male profession,"" she added. Mrs Ballard, 40, worked as a bus driver for six years before becoming a train driver with Southeastern in 2016. She said passengers were ""surprised"" when they ask her if she is the driver, but said there was no reason why women should not be train drivers. ""I don't feel gender really comes into it. I love the job, I work with fantastic people, I've never been treated differently because I'm a woman. ""There is more of a male domination but I think that society is changing and women are coming forward in all job roles,"" she added. Helen Dickerson is Greater Anglia's first female yard controller Southeastern said it had 51 women train drivers and had introduced initiatives to encourage more women to apply for a variety of roles. Ms Burrows said ""society has moved on"" and added that railways should not be male-dominated. Rail firm Greater Anglia also described the industry as ""male-dominated"" and said fewer than 5% of its train drivers were women. The company, which serves the east of England, has launched an internal recruitment campaign and recently appointed its first female yard controller. Helen Dickerson, who is responsible for train movements at its Norwich depot, said: ""There are more than 100 men at Crown Point [depot] and I am the only woman working in a front-line engineering role."" Greater Anglia said 22% of its employees were women, which was ""something the company is working to address along with the rest of the industry"". Southeastern's trains run between London, Kent and East Sussex Southern rail said it was ""pushing hard to make the industry more attractive to female applicants"". The operator said 30% of its trainee drivers this year were women, up from 18% in 2017. West Midlands Railway said about 10 of its 700 train drivers were women. But a spokeswoman said it had no plans to run a recruitment campaign aimed specifically at women ""as we welcome applications from all genders and backgrounds to work for us"". Baby born on board high-speed train Meet Thomas the Tank Engine's new female friends What's wrong with doing make-up on a train? Aslef said train drivers were ""predominantly made up of heterosexual white men aged over 35"". A spokesman for the train drivers' union said until recently train companies had ""proved reluctant to employ many women"". ""We want the rail industry to reflect the society it serves, a society comprised of men and women, regardless of ethnicity, age, sexual orientation or any other ideologies, who each day perform a vital job moving passengers and freight around Britain,"" he added. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, said it had ""committed to increasing diversity by 20% by 2020 because our railway needs to attract the brightest and best talent and better represent the people it is there to serve"".

Australia berry scare 'motivated by spite',"My Ut Trinh was arrested in Queensland on Sunday An Australian woman accused of putting sewing needles inside strawberries in a high-profile sabotage case was motivated by spite, a court has heard. My Ut Trinh, 50, was arrested on Sunday following a nationwide police investigation that began in September. Ms Trinh had worked as a supervisor at a strawberry farm north of Brisbane, according to Queensland Police. The maximum prison term for contaminating goods in Australia was recently raised to 15 years. Ms Trinh faces seven counts, and has not said whether she will fight the charges. The ""unprecedented"" strawberry scare spread to every Australian state and later to New Zealand, raising public alarm. Police said there had been 186 reports of needle-contaminated strawberries since September, though 15 turned out to have been hoaxes. It is not yet clear how many of those Ms Trinh is alleged to have caused. On Monday, police described their investigation as ""far from over"". Australia's strawberry needle scare widens Apple and banana in Australia needle scares PM vows crackdown on fruit scare 'idiots' The court in Brisbane on Monday heard that Ms Trinh's DNA had been found on strawberries in the state of Victoria. ""The case that is put is that it is motivated by some spite or revenge,"" Magistrate Christine Roney said. ""She has embarked on a course over several months of putting a metal object into fruit."" Ms Trinh allegedly intended to cause financial harm to a farm where she had worked, reported Fairfax Media, citing court documents. The first cases emerged in Queensland, where a man was taken to hospital with stomach pains after eating strawberries. Shocked consumers reported finding sewing needles in strawberries Farmers were forced to dump tonnes of berries, and supermarkets pulled the fruit off sale. In response, Australia's government raised the maximum prison term for fruit tampering from 10 to 15 years. Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed to ""throw the book"" at anyone responsible, saying: ""It's not funny, putting the livelihoods of hard-working Australians at risk, and you are scaring children. And you are a coward and a grub."" On Monday Supt Jon Wacker, from Queensland Police, described it as a ""unique investigation impacting virtually every state and jurisdiction in Australia"". In Queensland, where the strawberry industry is worth A$130m (Â£72m; $93m) a year,external, the local government pledged A$1m to support the state's stricken farmers. A $100,000 reward was offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of perpetrators. Prosecutors said they opposed giving bail to Ms Trinh because she may face ""retribution"" in the community. However, Ms Roney said a bail application would not be considered until more information about the case was known.

Ministers 'misleading on badger cull',"A campaign group of vets has accused Defra and its ministers of telling ""barefaced lies"" about the effectiveness of one of its badger culls. The claim is contained in a letter from the group to the chief vet. It asks her to ensure the department retracts ""insupportable claims that its badger cull policy is working"". A spokesman for Defra said all statements had been ""absolutely correct"". Dr Iain McGill, a veterinary surgeon and director of Prion Interest Group, told BBC News that claims by Defra (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) that the badger cull in Somerset and Gloucestershire were working were not supported by scientific evidence. ""According to Defra's figures, they claim that they calculated that the incidence [of TB in cattle] has reduced. ""But their calculations are unclear and deliberately opaque. And, indeed, the current situation in the cull zone says there is an increased prevalence. ""So, either their figures were calculated on an extremely inaccurate basis and they've got it very badly wrong, or they have actually gerrymandered those figures to make it look as if the incidence is falling when the evidence clearly shows that the prevalence has gone up. ""Badger culling has not worked. They are issuing barefaced lies in this matter."" Has Defra shown badger culling works? 'Fake science used to back badger culls' Badger cull plan 'crazy scheme' The letter to chief vet Dr Christine Middlemiss goes on to accuse Farming Minister George Eustice of giving misleading comments in September about a report produced by Defra's own scientists at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). Mr Eustice had said: ""Today's figures showing reductions in TB cases in Somerset and Gloucestershire,externalare evidence that our strategy for dealing with this slow-moving, insidious disease is delivering results."" However, the  APHA report he quotes from explicitly states, ""these data alone cannot demonstrate whether the badger control policy is effective in reducing bovine TB in cattle"". This video can not be played The science behind the badger cull was established in 1990s On 29 October, Defra went further in a statement to BBC Radio 4's Farming Today programme when it indicated that the alleged reduction in TB cases was due to the badger culls: ""The findings published in September showed that initial [badger] culls in the Higher Risk Area (HRA) have had a positive impact on disease incidence."" The department has not mentioned that instances of TB have been rising in a cull area in Dorset. Dr Chris Cheeseman is former head of Defra's wildlife epidemiology unit and advised the department on its TB strategy for more than 40 years. Now retired, he is able to speak freely about the badger cull policy. ""Defra has been cherry-picking the science since they started culling,"" he told BBC News. ""The fact that they are rolling it out on such a vast scale is a travesty of the available science."" In response, a Defra statement said: ""The latest statistics showed reductions in new outbreaks of bovine TB in the initial cull areas, an encouraging sign that the steps we have taken have had a positive impact. ""Based on this scientific data, Minister Eustice was absolutely correct to describe this progress as encouraging."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove commissioned an independent expert review earlier this year of Defra's efforts to control cattle TB - which will be published tomorrow. Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test Dr McGill's group has also raised concerns that new research adds to evidence that a skin test widely used by the department to detect the presence of TB in cattle is much less effective than claimed. On Defra's TB Hub, it is stated that effectiveness ""lies between 52% and 100%,externalwith an average of about 80% sensitivity at standard interpretation"". But two new research papers indicate that the average effectiveness may be much lower, between 50% and 60% at best. Jan Bayley of the Animal Welfare Group, which is campaigning against the cull in Gloucestershire, says that Defra is missing many cases of TB in cattle with these tests. She said: ""Farmers are being told that their herds are TB-free. They then go down with disease three or six months later and they automatically assume it's got to be badgers. ""Defra is really not explaining to farmers that there is a high probability that those herds are still infected."" Defra conceded in a paragraph ofa consultation paper published in 2016,external- but not widely publicised - that most new TB cases in high-risk areas were probably due to infected cattle: ""This substantial probability of 'residual' herd infection contributes to the high rate of recurrence seen in the high-risk areas, where nearly 60% of TB breakdowns (TB cases) occur in herds."" Much of the new work on the effectiveness of the skin test was conducted by Defra's own scientists at APHA in Surrey. Defra declined a request by BBC News to speak directly to the researchers involved, although the department's press officers did offer to mediate written questions. A spokesperson explained that it was against the civil service code for civil servants to speak to journalists without the permission of ministers. This includes instances where the research is publicly funded and published in peer-reviewed journals. Former Defra scientist Dr Chris Cheeseman said he regarded this as a misuse in the application of the civil service code: ""When I was a scientist working for governments, I always maintained the principle that I stuck to the truth. ""I think it's outrageous that the government should gag in any way scientists who work for them, either independently or directly. I think that's completely unacceptable in a democracy."" Defra responded: ""Any requests to interview civil servants are handled in line withthe civil service code,external. This states that civil servants must not make any public statement which might draw upon experience in their official capacity without the prior approval of their department. ""As a starting point, the views of the civil servant as to whether they would consider accepting the request would be taken into account.""

Original Sooty TV puppets to be auctioned,"A 1960s Sooty and a 1970s puppet from the TV hit show are both up for sale Sooty fans have the chance to buy the ultimate toy memorabilia - original hand puppets from the TV shows. Two puppets owned by father and son, Harry and Matthew Corbett, will be auctioned along with Sooty's magic wand. One was used by Matthew Corbett in his last stage show in London in 1977. The other was given to Eunice Weston in 1960 after Harry Corbett stayed at her parents' bed and breakfast pub in Clacton, Essex, while performing. Eunice Weston was given her Sooty puppet by Harry Corbett who stayed at her parents' bed and breakfast Mrs Weston, now 69, was living with her parents who ran the Robin Hood pub. ""I didn't really speak to him very much,"" the 69-year-old said. ""I was only 11, quite shy and used to scuttle off to school. So, I was delighted at the end of the week when he gave me the Sooty puppet. ""Sooty was huge back then. At that time everyone only had three TV channels - and everyone watched Sooty."" Sootyturned 70 in Julyand - together with his friends Sweep and Soo - have delighted generations of children. Mrs Weston's puppet, which was made to measure Harry's hand, has an estimated auction value of Â£1,000 to Â£1,500. In September, an original puppet used by Harry Corbett on TV in the 1950s sold for Â£14,500. Rising above the bullies on the catwalk Is this the Birmingham Banksy? Rail company wants more women drivers The 1997 Matthew Corbett puppet, which comes with magic wand, could fetch between Â£2,000-Â£3,000, said Hansons Auctioneers. The Sooty-wand combo up for sale belongs to Rob Smith, 37, from Tewkesbury and his wife Suzie, 35 who are selling it to raise money for a new wheelchair for her. They bought it in 2011 as it was being sold to raise money for Whizz-Kidz, a charity close to their hearts which provides wheelchairs for disabled children. Auctioneer Charles Hanson said: ""I hope I can make good use of Sooty's magic wand and deliver another strong result. ""The interest in this iconic children's character is huge,"" he added.

Rail company wants more women drivers,"Kelly-Joe Ballard say she always wanted to be a train driver Rail companies have launched campaigns to recruit more women train drivers. Southeastern, which serves London, Kent and East Sussex, said fewer than 5% of its drivers were women and it wants 40% of applicants to be women by 2021. Its train services director Ellie Burrows said: ""It's no longer the case that little boys play with toy trains and little girls play with dolls."" Train driver Kelly-Joe Ballard said there ""isn't anything stopping a woman from becoming a train driver"". ""I think it's a society perception that train driving is seen as a male profession,"" she added. Mrs Ballard, 40, worked as a bus driver for six years before becoming a train driver with Southeastern in 2016. She said passengers were ""surprised"" when they ask her if she is the driver, but said there was no reason why women should not be train drivers. ""I don't feel gender really comes into it. I love the job, I work with fantastic people, I've never been treated differently because I'm a woman. ""There is more of a male domination but I think that society is changing and women are coming forward in all job roles,"" she added. Helen Dickerson is Greater Anglia's first female yard controller Southeastern said it had 51 women train drivers and had introduced initiatives to encourage more women to apply for a variety of roles. Ms Burrows said ""society has moved on"" and added that railways should not be male-dominated. Rail firm Greater Anglia also described the industry as ""male-dominated"" and said fewer than 5% of its train drivers were women. The company, which serves the east of England, has launched an internal recruitment campaign and recently appointed its first female yard controller. Helen Dickerson, who is responsible for train movements at its Norwich depot, said: ""There are more than 100 men at Crown Point [depot] and I am the only woman working in a front-line engineering role."" Greater Anglia said 22% of its employees were women, which was ""something the company is working to address along with the rest of the industry"". Southeastern's trains run between London, Kent and East Sussex Southern rail said it was ""pushing hard to make the industry more attractive to female applicants"". The operator said 30% of its trainee drivers this year were women, up from 18% in 2017. West Midlands Railway said about 10 of its 700 train drivers were women. But a spokeswoman said it had no plans to run a recruitment campaign aimed specifically at women ""as we welcome applications from all genders and backgrounds to work for us"". Baby born on board high-speed train Meet Thomas the Tank Engine's new female friends What's wrong with doing make-up on a train? Aslef said train drivers were ""predominantly made up of heterosexual white men aged over 35"". A spokesman for the train drivers' union said until recently train companies had ""proved reluctant to employ many women"". ""We want the rail industry to reflect the society it serves, a society comprised of men and women, regardless of ethnicity, age, sexual orientation or any other ideologies, who each day perform a vital job moving passengers and freight around Britain,"" he added. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, said it had ""committed to increasing diversity by 20% by 2020 because our railway needs to attract the brightest and best talent and better represent the people it is there to serve"".

Michelin action group in first meeting,"The group includes politicians, business leaders and trade union representatives An action group tasked with saving the jobs of Michelin workers in Dundee has met for the first time. The tyre manufacturer announced last week it would be closing its factory in the city which employs more than 800 people. Politicians, business leaders and trade union representatives are among those making up the task force. Scotland's Economy Secretary Derek Mackay told the BBC he thought Michelin could still have a future in Dundee. What next for Michelin's Dundee plant? Michelin workers' shock at factory closure A dark day in Dundee How the designer tyre is hitting Michelin Michelin workers were told last Tuesday that the plant would close by mid-2020. The French firm said the Dundee site, which specialised in smaller tyres, had suffered because of a shift in the market towards low-cost products from Asia. Workers were told of the factory's closure at a meeting last Tuesday The news has sent shockwaves through Dundee where the firm is thought to be worth more than Â£40m to the local economy. Local people have been making tyres at its Balvodie factory since the early 1970s and it is now the largest industrial employer in the city. Mr Mackay said the new action group would ""explore all options"" for the plant. Speaking on the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland radio programme, he said: ""We are open to a range of ideas at this point in time."" Mr Mackay said that when he met Michelin executives they did not want to revisit the decision of closing production in Dundee, however he said they were still ""interested in what was going on in Scotland"". He added: ""I think it is possible that Michelin still has a future in Dundee, and that's what we have to convince them of."" The economy secretary said: ""I think there is a willingness to hear us out, and they've said they have never had a government so constructive and positive in these circumstances. ""So I see that as a window of opportunity, I see that as a positive, to do everything that we can to explore every possible avenue to try to retain as many jobs at Dundee as we can."" The action group will be led by Scottish Enterprise chief executive Steve Dunlop and Dundee City Council leader John Alexander. Mr Mackay, Scotland Secretary David Mundell and John Reid, director of Michelin's Dundee site, will also be involved. Mr Mackay said Michelin executives have said they will meet him again in about three weeks time, when he will present them with any proposition that the action group has developed.

Analysis: Why May's deal may be impossible,"Opponents of the prime minister's Brexit deal are found outside and inside her cabinet It is no secret that Theresa May is struggling to get her cabinet on board. Seven days ago it felt that the ingredients for concluding this vital stage of the Brexit deal were there, waiting perhaps for the political moment to feel right. But a week on, tortured negotiations continue both between the UK and the EU, and between Downing Street and those who gather at Number 10 for the weekly cabinet meeting. And perhaps you shouldn't be surprised at how reluctant the cabinet is to sign up. The simple explanation of why they aren't all gladly rushing to back exactly what the prime minister has been planning?Many of them didn't like it much from the start, and some of them don't believe it has a chance of passing Parliament now. This is not just about the problems of the Irish border, but aboutthe prime minister's overall preferred plan for Brexit, brokered in the heat of the summer at her Chequers country retreat. Leadsom: UK must not be trapped in backstop Thornberry: New referendum 'still an option' Minister Jo Johnson quits over Brexit There's no secret that the proposals were unpopular with the big Brexiteers. Thedramatic departures of David DavisandBoris Johnsonsaw to that. But what is only now clear from cabinet sources is just how widespread the discontent was - expressed not just by Eurosceptics but by former Remainers too. And the frustrations from months ago are unquestionably part of the reason why there is such a stalemate now. Two cabinet ministers last night told the BBC there was little chance that the deal as currently planned would get through parliament. One of them said it was ""self-harming"" for the prime minister to keep pursuing the same strategy. Sources have described how multiple cabinet ministers expressed significant doubts from the start. Elements of the so-called Chequers proposals were described as ""worrying"", ""disappointing"", and ""concerning"" by different members of the prime minister's top team, as the press waited in sweltering heat outside at the end of the grand estate's very, very long drive, across the other side of what actually was, joking apart, a field of wheat. Theresa May outlines her Brexit plan at Chequers And what's really notable is how some former Remainers - including Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - were candid about their fears too. This was not just an exercise in Brexiteers sounding off, but ministers from across the Tory party pointing to deficiencies in the proposed deal. UK must be able to end backstop, says Fox DUP leader urges PM to 'reflect' on EU deal Chancellor Philip Hammond has questioned whether the EU will agree the deal I've also been told that several ministers, on both sides of the argument, are understood to have called on the prime minister to be honest with the public about the shift in position towards a closer arrangement with the EU. Months on, I've lost count of the number of times ministers and advisers in government have expressed frustration at how they perceive Theresa May has failed to do that. Even for some of her backers, her strongest selling point should be being upfront about the fact she is trying hard to find a middle course, not to be the ideologue making crazy promises. Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon But around Westminster, there is deep frustration on the Tory backbenches that she rarely seems willing to make that case, always sticking to a few tight lines that concede only the bare minimum about what she is trying to do. Of course, the Chequers meeting did ultimately give the prime minister's plan its backing. Ministers like the chancellor and the business secretary were clear that the risk of no deal was simply not worth taking. But from what sources have described it is extremely clear that for many of those present, the Chequers proposals were a deeply undesirable compromise, rather than a plan they were agreeing to with any enthusiasm. One senior minister told me most of those present signed up ""with a very heavy heart"". A Number 10 spokesman said: ""Everyone has to move a little to get a deal that works for everyone on both sides of the argument."" But the roots of the current impasse at home surely lie in much of the cabinet's view at that time. If they didn't like it much then, why would they like it much now, let alone help the prime minister fight for it? With the EU reluctant to budge, and Parliament deeply unconvinced, what was a deeply unappetising compromise may yet prove an impossible one.

More victims found in California wildfires,"This video can not be played California wildfires continue to rage The death toll in wildfires sweeping California has risen to 31, with more than 200 people still missing, officials have said. Six more people were confirmed killed in the Camp Fire in the north of the state, taking the toll there to 29. That fire now equals the deadliest on record in California - the 1933 Griffith Park disaster in Los Angeles. In the south, the Woolsey Fire has claimed two lives as it damaged beach resorts including Malibu. In pictures: Wildfire rages in Malibu Watch: Aerial footage shows devastation 'Three minutes separated me from death' An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes to avoid three major blazes in the state. With strengthening winds threatening to spread the flames,California Governor Jerry Brown has urged President Donald Trump to declare a major disaster,external, a move that would harness more federal emergency funds. The appeal came a day after Mr Trump threatened to cut funding for California, blaming the fires on poor forest management. Harold Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, called the president's comments ""reckless and insulting"". Allow Twitter content?

Emergency teams have been sifting through the remains of more than 6,700 homes and businesses burned down in the town of Paradise. The town and surrounding area bore the brunt of the inferno, which started in nearby forest on Thursday. Celebrity homes destroyed by wildfires Kim K dedicates award to firefighters Animals caught in wildfire destruction At a news conference late on Sunday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said the bodies of five people had been found in their burned-out homes and a sixth was found inside a vehicle. He said that at least 228 people were still unaccounted for, adding that DNA testing equipment was being sent should it be required to help identify victims. The mayor of Paradise, Jody Jones, gave the BBC an update on the situation in the town. ""Most of the residential [area] is gone. I would say 90%,"" she said. ""I had an opportunity to go up there and take a look for myself. Just about everyone I know lost their home."" The fire is the most destructive in the state's history and the joint deadliest. It has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials said. ""Containment"" refers to a physical barrier around a fire that stops it spreading - such as a river, or a shallow, 10ft(3m)-wide trench dug by fire crews. If a fire is 100% contained, this means it has containment lines around its whole perimeter. However - the fire may still burn for days or weeks to follow. Police said suspected looters were arrested in Paradise on Saturday, and may have been trying to impersonate Forest Service workers. The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials said. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. This video can not be played Fleeing through flames: ""I'm so scared right now... so terrified"" Looting was also reported in the southern fire area over the weekend. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties razed by the flames. Hollywood actor Gerard Butler shared a picture of a charred house on Twitter, writing: ""Returned to my house in Malibu after evacuating. Heartbreaking time across California."" He thanked firefighters for their ""courage, spirit and sacrifice"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills, where the HBO series Westworld is filmed, was also destroyed. Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly On Saturday, firefighters used a respite from strong winds to drop fire retardant in a bid to strengthen firebreaks. But officials warned that winds of up to 70mph (112km/h) are expected over the coming days, meaning fires could spread quickly and unexpectedly. ""Winds are already blowing. They are going to blow for the next three days. Your house can be rebuilt but you can't bring your life back,"" said Los Angeles County fire chief Daryl Osby. Homes and vehicles left in Paradise, Butte County, were all but destroyed by the wildfires Fire retardant is dropped on to the Woolsey Fire near Malibu The Woolsey Fire is only 10% contained Luxury beachfront homes in Malibu have been claimed by the fire Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn. But experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. The current fires are being blamed on a combination of climate change and weather conditions. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The experts who start fires to study them Why can't California control its wildfires? The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. Population density has been growing in areas that used to be sparsely inhabited And then there's climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs, and less reliable rainfall. Citing the role of a warming climate, Governor Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal."" Musician Neil Young made the same link, writing on his website: ""I have lost my home before to a California wildfire, now another.""

Pound falls as Brexit uncertainty rises My Brexit box: The people stockpiling food Brexit: All you need to know Mrs May is trying to arrange an agreement in cabinet on the current negotiations in time for a hoped-for summit in Brussels later this month. Her preferred plan for future relations with the EU after Brexit were agreed at Chequers - the prime minister's country retreat - in July, in a marathon cabinet meeting lasting nearly 12 hours. Afterwards, Mrs May said the cabinet had reached a ""collective"" agreement, although former Brexit secretary David Davis and ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson resigned from the Cabinet in protest at the plans 48 hours later. Mrs May speaks during the meeting at Chequers in July And, according to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, cabinet sources have now revealed there were widespread doubts about various aspects from many other ministers from the start, including from some former Remain supporters. For many of those present, she said that the Chequers deal was an undesirable compromise, rather than a set of proposals to which they were signing up with enthusiasm. One cabinet minister said the group endorsed the proposal ""with a very heavy heart"". This video can not be played There would be ""no problem"" if the UK asked the EU for a timed extension to the Brexit date Article 50 author Lord Kerr tells Radio 4's World at One Trade Secretary Liam Fox expressed strong doubts about elements of the plan for trading arrangements as they could harm the ability of the UK to do trade deals after Brexit. Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who backed Remain, is understood to have had some similar views, describing the proposal for a common rule book with the EU for parts of the economy as ""very worrying"" and suggesting that there should be a review of the arrangements after five years. The leader of the House of Lords, Baroness Evans, is understood to have agreed, telling her colleagues that she found it difficult to accept some aspects of the proposals, and might struggle to explain them in Parliament. Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey - Brexiteers who have both been reluctant to give public support for the plan - are said to have expressed significant unhappiness and questioned whether Brexiteer MPs would be able to support such a deal in Parliament.

Sources close to him would not confirm that, but said he had been ""extremely cautious from the start"" about the Chequers proposal. And as has previously emerged, the leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, said that she ""hated"" the proposals and called on the prime minister to treat those who had voted for Brexit with respect. Chancellor Philip Hammond told his colleagues that the government was living on ""borrowed time"" because some businesses were hesitating over whether to invest in the UK. He argued for the Chequers approach to bring clarity as soon as possible. But he is understood to have questioned whether such a deal could actually be achieved, warning that the UK would have to persuade EU member states to defy the European Commission which is running the negotiation. Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Ministers 'want EU deal by end of month' And the Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson - also a former Remainer - said there were many concerns with the paper and it must be made clear it was as far as the government would be willing to compromise. Several ministers on both sides of the argument are understood to have called on the prime minister to be honest with the public about the shift in position towards a closer arrangement with the EU. Mrs May is trying to arrange an agreement in cabinet on the current negotiations in time for a hoped-for summit in Brussels later this month. A Number 10 spokesman said: ""Everyone has to move a little to get a deal that works for everyone on both sides of the argument."" But Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it appeared Mrs May had proceeded without the ""solid backing"" of her cabinet, having also declined to get Parliament's support for her negotiating objectives. Sir Keir also said the option of a fresh referendum was still ""on the table"", despite Labour's leader Jeremy Corbyn saying at the weekend that Brexit could not be stopped. This video can not be played ""All options are on the table"" if there is a no deal Brexit, Starmer tells Today In his column for the Daily Telegraph on Monday,Boris Johnson called the prime minister's deal,external""a recipe for continued strife, both in the Tory Party and the country"". And former cabinet minister John Whittingdale cast doubt on whether Mrs May could stay in office if Parliament rejected any deal she reached with the EU. ""I think if the PM's Brexit plan doesn't get through Parliament, I think it's quite difficult to see how the prime minister can continue because she has staked her credibility,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour.

Wildfires in pictures,"Fierce wildfires are burning through Northern and Southern California - destroying buildings and forcing more than 250,000 residents to flee. Evacuation orders were put in place in several towns and cities as winds of up to 50mph (80km/h) fanned three major blazes. In the north, a deadly wildfire called Camp Fire has destroyed the town of Paradise. Woolsey Fire and Hill Fire in the south have ripped through areas west of Los Angeles like the beach resort of Malibu, which is home to many Hollywood stars. Among the towns to receive evacuation orders was Thousand Oaks, wherea gunman killed 12 people in the busy Borderline Bar and Grill on Wednesday. A vineyard near Thousand Oaks burned overnight Firefighters have been struggling to contain the wildfires, which are being stoked by strong winds Tens of thousands of people were evacuated ahead of Woolsey Fire's arrival in Ventura County Thousands of residents packed the Pacific Coast Highway to head south or take refuge on beaches, along with their horses and other pets. The Woolsey Fire, which started on Thursday, has charred some 35,000 acres (14,200 hectares) around Los Angeles. On Friday, the flames jumped Highway 101 and headed into coastal areas. Entire homes, businesses and a hospital have been destroyed in California ""Fire is now burning out of control and headed into populated areas of Malibu,"" officials said.

"More victims found in California wildfiresSix more bodies are found in the north of the state, taking the death toll to 31 with 200 missing.US & Canada","This video can not be played California wildfires continue to rage The death toll in wildfires sweeping California has risen to 31, with more than 200 people still missing, officials have said. Six more people were confirmed killed in the Camp Fire in the north of the state, taking the toll there to 29. That fire now equals the deadliest on record in California - the 1933 Griffith Park disaster in Los Angeles. In the south, the Woolsey Fire has claimed two lives as it damaged beach resorts including Malibu. In pictures: Wildfire rages in Malibu Watch: Aerial footage shows devastation 'Three minutes separated me from death' An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes to avoid three major blazes in the state. With strengthening winds threatening to spread the flames,California Governor Jerry Brown has urged President Donald Trump to declare a major disaster,external, a move that would harness more federal emergency funds. The appeal came a day after Mr Trump threatened to cut funding for California, blaming the fires on poor forest management.

Emergency teams have been sifting through the remains of more than 6,700 homes and businesses burned down in the town of Paradise. The town and surrounding area bore the brunt of the inferno, which started in nearby forest on Thursday. Celebrity homes destroyed by wildfires Kim K dedicates award to firefighters Animals caught in wildfire destruction At a news conference late on Sunday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said the bodies of five people had been found in their burned-out homes and a sixth was found inside a vehicle. He said that at least 228 people were still unaccounted for, adding that DNA testing equipment was being sent should it be required to help identify victims. The mayor of Paradise, Jody Jones, gave the BBC an update on the situation in the town. ""Most of the residential [area] is gone. I would say 90%,"" she said. ""I had an opportunity to go up there and take a look for myself. Just about everyone I know lost their home."" The fire is the most destructive in the state's history and the joint deadliest. It has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials said. ""Containment"" refers to a physical barrier around a fire that stops it spreading - such as a river, or a shallow, 10ft(3m)-wide trench dug by fire crews. If a fire is 100% contained, this means it has containment lines around its whole perimeter. However - the fire may still burn for days or weeks to follow. Police said suspected looters were arrested in Paradise on Saturday, and may have been trying to impersonate Forest Service workers. The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials said. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. This video can not be played Fleeing through flames: ""I'm so scared right now... so terrified"" Looting was also reported in the southern fire area over the weekend. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties razed by the flames. Hollywood actor Gerard Butler shared a picture of a charred house on Twitter, writing: ""Returned to my house in Malibu after evacuating. Heartbreaking time across California."" He thanked firefighters for their ""courage, spirit and sacrifice"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills, where the HBO series Westworld is filmed, was also destroyed. Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly On Saturday, firefighters used a respite from strong winds to drop fire retardant in a bid to strengthen firebreaks. But officials warned that winds of up to 70mph (112km/h) are expected over the coming days, meaning fires could spread quickly and unexpectedly. ""Winds are already blowing. They are going to blow for the next three days. Your house can be rebuilt but you can't bring your life back,"" said Los Angeles County fire chief Daryl Osby. Homes and vehicles left in Paradise, Butte County, were all but destroyed by the wildfires Fire retardant is dropped on to the Woolsey Fire near Malibu The Woolsey Fire is only 10% contained Luxury beachfront homes in Malibu have been claimed by the fire Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn. But experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. The current fires are being blamed on a combination of climate change and weather conditions. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The experts who start fires to study them Why can't California control its wildfires? The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. Population density has been growing in areas that used to be sparsely inhabited And then there's climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs, and less reliable rainfall. Citing the role of a warming climate, Governor Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal."" Musician Neil Young made the same link, writing on his website: ""I have lost my home before to a California wildfire, now another."" ""We are vulnerable because of climate change; the extreme weather events and our extended drought is part of it."" California wildfires continue to rage.

Plea in unsolved murder of mum and son,"Renee and Andrew MacRae disappeared in November 1976 The sister of a woman who was murdered 42 years ago along with her young son, has made an emotional appeal for information in the unsolved case. Renee, 36, and three-year-old Andrew MacRae disappeared on 12 November 1976. Mrs MacRae's car was found later that same day on fire in a lay-by on the A9 south of Inverness. Her sister, Morag Govans, said: ""Even after the passage of time I believe that there are people who know what happened to Renee and Andrew."" This video can not be played Morag Govans says she is seeking justice for her sister Renee She added: ""I will never give up hope of getting justice for them both."" Police Scotland has also renewed its appeal for information. Its new plea includes a request for the author of an anonymous letter sent to police in 1982 to get in touch. Renee MacRae's BMW car was found on fire in a lay-by south of Inverness Blood was found in the boot of the car Posted to Northern Constabulary, the letter included details of activity at an unnamed quarry on 12 November 1976. Missing boy pram appeal on 45th birthday Quarry search for missing mother and child Two quarries in the Highlands have been searched on various occasions as part of the police investigation. Dalmagarry Quarry is close to where Mrs MacRae's BMW was found, while Leanach Quarry is at Culloden Moor near Inverness. On the evening of her disappearance Mrs MacRae, who was estranged from her husband Gordon, had set off with her youngest of her two sons, Andrew, to meet her lover Bill McDowell, Mr MacRae's married accountant. He told police they never met. Making her appeal for information, Ms Govans said: ""More than four decades on the pain of losing Renee and Andrew doesn't ease. Not a day goes past that both are not in my thoughts. ""Andrew was just three-years-old, a mischievous and fun loving wee boy. It is impossible to take in that his life was brought so cruelly to an end at such a young age. ""He would have turned 45 in October and I often wonder what he would have been doing now with the life that he was never given the chance to build. ""Renee was a compassionate and caring mother. Both Andrew and his elder brother Gordon were her life. She adored them and was so proud of her boys. ""Gordon was only eight and has lost the love and guidance of his mum and brother."" Renee and Andrew MacRae were headed for Perth when they vanished Searches involving police and volunteers were made in 1976 near where Mrs MacRae's car was found She added: ""I appeal for anyone with any information to come forward and for others to examine their conscience to end 42 years of pain and anguish to allow us to grieve for Renee and Andrew."" Det Insp Brian Geddes said modern policing techniques, including forensic science, were being applied to the unsolved murders. He said Police Scotland's Major Investigations Team was ""pouring through every single item"" the force held on the case in a bid to identify new lines of inquiry and develop any existing lines of inquiry. The officer said: ""All the indications are that Renee and Andrew came to harm 42 years ago and as such this is being progressed as a murder investigation. ""The initial investigation and the various reviews and re-investigations since 1976 appear to have been very thorough and have generated a great deal of material."" Renee and Andrew MacRae: Timeline Police working on the case in the 1970s 17:00, 12 November 1976:After dropping off her eldest son, Gordon, at Mr MacRae's home, Mrs MacRae and Andrew leave Inverness for Perth. 22:00, 12 November 1976:Mrs MacRae's BMW car is found on fire by a passing bus driver about 12 miles (19km) south of Inverness. The car is parked on a loop road that was being used as a lay-by during the construction of then new A9 trunk road. Blood is found in the boot of the car. But there is no sign of the mother and son and police begin what would become one of the UK's longest missing persons investigations. 1976:In the fortnight following 12 November, more than 100 police officers and large numbers of volunteers search moorland around the site of where the car was discovered. RAF Canberra aircraft make wider sweeps of the area. 1977:Divers search flooded Leanach Quarry, a known fly-tipping spot, near Inverness. August 2004:Police return to Dalmagarry Quarry, which was searched at the time of the mother and son's disappearance. Northern Constabulary drafts in internationally experienced forensic archaeologists and anthropologists to sift 35,000 tonnes of soil from the disused quarry, near the lay-by where Mrs MacRae's car was discovered, but no sign of the mother and son is found. New tests are also carried out in a laboratory in Aberdeen on traces of blood found in the boot of the BMW. 2016:A report naming a suspect who may have killed the pair is sent by Northern Constabulary to prosecutors but they decide there is insufficient evidence to take action. October 2018:For about a week, Police Scotland divers examine Leanach Quarry using a remotely operated vehicle. 9 October:To mark Andrew's 45th birthday, police release a photograph of him and an image of the Silver Cross pram owned by his mother. Officers appeal for sightings of the pram on and around 12 November 1976. Det Insp Brian Geddes added: ""Our goals are to bring a person, or persons, to justice and to locate the remains of Renee and Andrew in order to bring some form of closure to Morag and the rest of the family. ""We will draw on the investigative expertise from within our organisation and beyond, and I have assured Morag and her family that everyone involved in the investigation is fully committed and will leave no stone unturned in a bid to find the answers the family deserve."" Police at Leanach Quarry at Culloden Moor in October this year Det Insp Geddes said the person or persons responsible for the murders were likely to ""have enjoyed a life"", adding that this was something denied to the mother and her son. He went on: ""With that in mind I would again appeal to anyone who has information, even if they are not sure if it is important, to come forward and contact us. ""Specifically, I want to take this opportunity to appeal to someone who wrote anonymously to Northern Constabulary in 1982 regarding information surrounding activity at an unnamed quarry on 12 November 1976. ""It appears that this person had moved away from the area in the subsequent years. If you recognise yourself as the writer of this letter then I urge you to get in touch with the investigation team."" Clues from the past? A newspaper appeal for information on Renee and Andrew MacRae following their disappearance Witnesses in 1976 told of police of seeing someone dragging a sheep near the A9 - Mrs MacRae was wearing a sheepskin coat the day she disappear - while another witness said they saw a man with a pushchair. During the early days of the investigation, a police sergeant and a digger driver described encountering a strong smell during an examination of Dalmagarry Quarry. Police returned to the quarry in 2004. Over a period of three weeks, tonnes of earth and 2,000 trees were excavated and removed at a cost of more than Â£100,000. Nothing but crisp packets, some men's clothing and animal bones were reportedly found. Det Insp Geddes said the passing of 42 years was ""undeniably a long time"", but was not a barrier to justice. He added: ""Someone out there knows what happens to Renee and Andrew and I hope this appeal today serves as a reminder that it is never too late to come forward with information."" ""Anyone who believes they can assist Police is asked to contact 101 or you can e-mail a dedicated inbox at SCDHOLMESInverness@scotland.pnn.police.uk.""

Adnan Ashraf Jarral, 35, and his son, Usman Adnan Jarral, died when their people carrier was in collision with a car that had been in a police pursuit in Sheffield on Friday night. Mr Jarral's uncle, Shafqat Mirza, said his nephew was ""humble and polite"". Husband and wife Miroslave Duna, 50, and Vlasta Dunova, 41, were also in the car and died in the crash.

Last deaths of World War One,"Military funeral corteges were a common sight for communities during World War One On 11 November 1918, as news of the end of World War One spread across the world, the parents of Wilfred Owen received notice that their son had been killed in action. The second lieutenant, who would become known as one of England's greatest war poets, had died while trying to lead his men across a canal at Ors seven days earlier. He was one of thousands of servicemen killed in the last month of the war, and their deaths, coming as they did so close to the end of hostilities, seem to have a particularly heartbreaking quality. The University of Oxford'sprofessor emeritus of English Jon Stallworthy wrote in 2004,externalthat the ""socially concerned"" poets of the 1930s gave Owen ""the status of saint and martyr"", adding that he ""came to represent a generation of innocent young men sacrificed - as it seemed to a generation in unprecedented rebellion against its fathers - by guilty old men"". However, Gervase Phillips, Manchester Metropolitan University's principal lecturer in history, said the reaction at the time was quite different. ""Authors often point to the peculiar poignancy that when the Owens received the telegram informing them of Wilfred's death, all the church bells were sounding to mark the Armistice. ""Yet to those who had lived through the conflict, and experienced so much loss, I am not sure these deaths were felt any more keenly."" Wilfred Owen was killed after returning to the front following treatment for shell shock Hindsight also attributes huge significance to Owen's death, but it must be remembered that, at the time, he was not well-known and so the tragedy was felt only by his family and friends - and they were far from alone in experiencing such grief. Capt Robert Bartholomew, who was the editor of the wartime Canadian Hospital News, read about the death of his only son in a newspaper three months before the end of the war. An account of what happened next,externalstated that the news caused him to have a nervous breakdown and drop into a ""severe depression"" due to the ""mental shock"". He had previously written that the parents of those killed would feel ""sorrow and pain"", but would also ""be able to look back with a feeling of pride and say: 'They died for God, for King and Country'"". And despite his severe reaction to the loss of his son, that sentiment did not seem to change, as a few weeks after hearing the news, an editorial in the publication declared with pride that ""sons have died by thousands and will continue to die by thousands if necessary, until victory is assured"". The Armistice came into effect at 11:00 on 11 November 1918 Mr Phillips said while a modern reader might judge such a stance as bravado, and more widely see those deaths in the final months of the war as futile, it was important to remember there was no ""unconditional surrender"" at the end of the war and an Allied victory was far from assured until its very last moments. He said the Armistice ""was not certain until about 05:00 on the morning of the 11th"", though talk of it had been ""widespread throughout the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) since at least 9 November"". ""Think of the ending of the war as a process, rather than a distinct moment,"" the academic said. ""Bulgaria agreed an armistice with the Allies on 30 September, the Ottoman Empire agreed one on 30 October and the Habsburgs (the rulers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) on 3 November. ""The 'direction of travel' was clear, [but] the Germans still hoped to negotiate the best possible terms for a ceasefire right up until the end. ""So the BEF's victory at the [second] Battle of the Sambre on 4 November, where Owen was killed, the American advance to the heights overlooking Sedan and the French capture of the strategic railhead at Hirson by 9 November, were all instrumental in persuading the German delegation to agree to the Armistice."" Confirming the actual number of Allied deaths in the run-up to the Armistice is problematic. Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire, a book published in 1922, listed 6,064 deaths between 1 and 11 November 1918, with a further 2,008 men listed as missing, but the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's (CWGC) database now records 15,002 graves with death dates in those 11 days. Mr Phillips said ""recordkeeping at the front was, inevitably, suspect [as] it wasn't a great environment for bureaucracy, and trying to establish the record retrospectively, on the basis of documentation that may be incomplete or inaccurate, is no easy task"". He said thousands of soldiers ""effectively disappeared"" towards the end of the war and ""very often no-one knew exactly what had befallen them or precisely when"". ""Some subsequently turned up - in a hospital or perhaps in a POW camp - but many were simply recorded as 'missing, presumed killed' - and they still are.""

Sgt Hugh Cairns was killed after capturing a machine-gun at Valenciennes on 2 November, while two days later, 2nd Lt James Kirk andActing Lt Col James Marshalldied in the same action as Owen. Lt Kirk was killed while supporting troops crossing the Oise canal, and Col Marshall died leading his men across a bridge on the waterway. Bugle marks centenary of war poet's death Danny Boyle to stage WW1 beach memorial WW1: One of the last men to die But far from being seen as needless, their deaths were recorded in the press with the same pride as any of the hundreds that had come before and were welcomed in the same way as the others by the general public, Mr Phillips said. Such a reaction was understandable, given that the end of the war came as something of a surprise to most of both those who were fighting and their families. Mr Philips said the most surprising thing was ""how suddenly the war stopped on the dot"". An account by Gen Sir Archibald Montgomery recorded that ""the firing, which had been heavy all the morning, continued until three minutes to 11:00 when it ceased for a short period and then broke out in a final crash"". He also recorded the ""final act"" of a German machine-gunner, who, at two minutes to 11:00, had ""fired off a complete belt without pause"", before standing, taking off his his helmet, bowing and walking ""slowly to the rear"". The news of the Armistice was greeted with relief and delight by troops However, Mr Phillips said the war had been a ""brutalising business"" and there were also ""some instances"" where there was ""a desire not to stop fighting"". An account of the BEF's 8th Division's actions includes details of a company coming across an occupied German post at precisely 11:00. ""The men were persuaded with difficulty to refrain from attacking it,"" the account records, adding that it was ""their earnest contention being that no-one needs know anything about it and that it seemed a pity not to kill a few more Germans while they had the chance"". It also must be remembered that the war continued to claim lives after the Armistice. News of the ceasefire took time to filter to all the areas involved, and fighting continued for some time after 11:00 in places such as Russia and Mesopotamia (an area that covers parts of modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey). A large number of soldiers also succumbed to wounds or illness in the days and weeks following the end of the war. The CWGC database lists 10,991 graves with death dates between 12 and 30 November 1918 and a further 47,510 listed between 1 December 1918 and 10 January 1920, the day the Treaty of Versailles, the formal document that officially ended the war, came into effect. And so the Armistice might have silenced the guns, but it did not entirely stop the fatalities.

Actress who fundraised for own funeral diesShirley Hellyar said she wanted to spare her parents the burden as they had already buried one child.Tyne & Wear,"Shirley Hellyar - pictured at the Baftas in 2017 - had a part in the Netflix film Outlaw King starring Chris Pine A terminally ill woman who raised nearly Â£7,000 for her own funeral after being given weeks to live has died. Shirley Hellyar, 40, from Glasgow, thought she had beaten cancer and travelled to Newcastle to celebrate. She suffered chest pains while visiting friends in October and was told she had less than five weeks to live. The actress said her family had already lost her brother when he was 16 and added ""no parents should have to have funerals for all their children"". She was recently cast as a villager in a Netflix production called Outlaw King, starring Hollywood actor Chris Pine, and had said she hoped to see it broadcast. However, she died on Wednesday - two days before its general release. A statement on her fundraising page said Miss Hellyar ""unfortunately passed away in her sleep"" at St Oswald's Hospice in Gosforth, Newcastle, surrounded by family and friends. ""Shirley was very grateful for everyone's help and donations which made her last few weeks so much better,"" the statement said. ""She said that all the help she had received restored her faith in human kindness. Thank you all once again."" This video can not be played An actress has died after raising Â£7,000 for her funeral Miss Hellyar was first diagnosed with lymphoblastic lymphoma after developing a tumour on her lung in 2017. By September this year, she said the tumour had shrunk and she was well enough to travel to Newcastle where she had lived for years and used to work as a sexual health worker. Just before her death Miss Hellyar said: ""My parents have already had to lose a child - they lost my brother [in 1999], so they've had this sad story before. ""The idea that again they'd been left in this situation again just broke my heart. Nobody should be planning their own funeral and organising stuff but if I can take the pressure off and make it more bearable for my parents, I'll do that."" Miss Hellyar said she had hoped to see the Netflix production before she died More than 300 people donated Â£6,956 to help her parents Elizabeth and Gordon pay for her funeral and help towards their travel costs from Scotland. Many donors left messages of support, while some offered to provide services at the funeral or places for her family to stay in Newcastle. One donor, Martin Robson, said he did not know Miss Hellyar but posted: ""I heard your story on Radio Newcastle and was so shocked at your story and how sad it was for you. ""I sat there numb and in tears whilst hearing you talk of your cancer, well done for being so brave and I hope the money you raised will give you the beautiful, loving funeral you deserve."" Another donor Sharon Rae wrote: ""A brave courageous lady. So very sorry to hear of her passing.""

'My grandfather lied to fight': WW1 stories 100 years onVideoVideoSilence at the Cenotaph and tributes on beachesVideoVideoBeach images honour World War One soldiersThe eight brothers who fought in WW1AudioAudioPoet laureate reads her special Armistice Day poem,"Emma Silk's grandfather, pictured in the photo she holds, lied about his age to join the war in 1917. He was only 17 ""I want to honour the memory of my grandfather - what he did for our freedom,"" says Emma Silk, grand-daughter of Harold Victor Silk, who lost his left arm in battle the day before Armistice Day. Emma was one of 10,000 people given the chance to take part in the People's Procession - a parade through London's streets on the 11th of the 11th, usually the reserve of the military. Exactly 100 years to the day, WWI ended and cheering crowds gathered in Parliament Square and Trafalgar Square where they clambered on to the backs of the stone lions and lit a bonfire at the foot of Nelson's Column. Today, the mood of jubilation has been replaced with a quiet pride and an awe at what our ancestors sacrificed for our freedom. The grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and great uncles killed in bloody and bitter battles - their names remembered but often the circumstances of death still unknown. The mother whose son - barely a man - never returned from the front; the young woman whose sweetheart went missing in action; the baby who was never to know his father. Each one of the 10,000 people walking the length of the Mall towards the Cenotaph has a story to share - a name to remember, a photo in a pocket and often a medal pinned to their winter coat. Many speak of the differences between then and now - the stiff upper lip of the last century, the generations who stayed silent about the impact war had on them and the buttoned-up manner of handling grief. They tell their families' stories, blinking back tears in the low November sun. Even as years pass and the generation gap widens, the emotional connection does not appear to lessen. Roger Miles, 69, a retired interior designer from West Sussex, tells the extraordinary story that he only unearthed - almost by chance - four years ago. His grandfather, Archie Miles, was wounded in the Battle of Cambrai, probably as the Germans launched a counter-attack. Nation marking centenary of WW1's end In pictures: Armistice Day Armistice Day events held around the world His wife, Amelia, was told to get to France to be by her dying husband's side, which she did. But as he lay dying, back home in Worthing their three-month-old baby son Tommy was also dying from whooping cough and pneumonia. The two died on the same day. Roger, a man of faith, said: ""I like to think, maybe, Archie carried Tommy up with him."" Asked if he's marching for them, he replies: ""I'm really here to honour the courage of my grandmother. ""She was obviously traumatised and remained a widow for the rest of her life."" Jeremy Cripps, who attended with his wife Carol and daughter Jessica, wore his grandfather's medals Robert Malin was working at St Pancras Hotel when war was declared. At 27, he was sent to the front and given the job of bearer to send in stretchers and carry away the wounded. But he went beyond the call of duty, says his grandson, Jeremy Cripps, 64, a children's charity boss from South Shields. In the Battle of Amiens, in France, in the last 100 days of war, Robert Malin went out under fire many times to bring back the wounded. Among them was Raymond Trustram, an officer, who made it out but died later from his injuries. Robert Malin, left, went out with a stretcher under fire to save the wounded, including Officer Raymond Trustram, pictured here as a schoolboy In an extraordinary letter of thanks, the officer's father wrote to Robert Malin to commend his ""gallant act"" and invite him to visit them. ""I thank you very much for what you did and feel sure you did everything possible,"" he wrote. Robert Malin was later decorated for bravery. ""Just pinning on the medals makes me feel emotional,"" says his grandson, Jeremy. Jane Harman tells John Parr's story to children in school assemblies Like so many on the parade, Jane Harman only knows the story of John Parr - the very first British soldier to die in WWI - after significant digging. She pulls out her folder of archived documents - copies of the 1901 Census, birth certificates, letters - to tell a story to leave you dumbstruck. John Parr is no relation but he was briefly a pupil at the primary school where she worked. A North Finchley boy, he was 17 when he died two days before the start of the Battle of Mons. It was 21 August 1914 but it was to be another eight months before his mother found out he was dead. In a heartbreaking letter to the War Office, sent in October 1914, she wrote that she had heard from one of his ""chums"" that he had been shot down in Mons. ""I'm very anxious as it is now 10 weeks. If anything has happened to him by this time, someone would have wrote [sic] to me."" ""You just can't imagine that,"" says Jane, a teacher in north London who has been telling his story to children in school assemblies. ""It's important the stories aren't forgotten,"" she says. ""What I've found heartwarming is how respectful all the children are - even children as young as six."" In pictures: Armistice Day The last deaths of World War One What do white poppies represent?

The eight brothers who fought in WW1AudioAudioPoet laureate reads her special Armistice Day poem,"The eight brothers were aged from 43 to 20 when they enlisted Thousands of soldiers fought and died alongside family members in World War One, but Thomas and Eliza Everton watched as all eight of their sons went off to battle. Only one of the couple's boys did not come home. The rarity of the family's situation prompted The Privy Council to send a letter in 1915 on behalf of King George V thanking the parents for their sons' contribution to the war. Signed by the keeper of the Privy purse, it said the King had ""heard with much interest"" about the brothers. ""I am commanded to express to you The King's congratulations and to assure you that His Majesty much appreciates the spirit of patriotism which prompted this example, in one family, of loyalty and devotion to their Sovereign and Empire,"" it read. The framed letter with photos of each serving son has been passed down through generations of the Birmingham family. ""Eight sons all serving at the same time - it's unique, outstanding,"" said John Jones, 76, whose wife Rita is Eliza's great-granddaughter. ""And they were all volunteers. They weren't youngsters - it's tremendous stuff."" Thomas and Eliza Everton pictured alongside their letter from the King Thomas John Everton, born in 1851, married Eliza and went on to have eight sons and two daughters. Originally from Chaddesley Corbett in Worcestershire, Thomas and Eliza Everton moved to Birmingham in search of work but employment was scarce and they fell on hard times. In 1881, Mrs Everton ended up in a workhouse in Aston with her five eldest children after they were evicted from their home. It was not for too long and the family were reunited when Mr Everton secured a job with the City of Birmingham council as a pavier and a house in Bordesley Green. Then came the summer of 1914 and on 4 August, Britain declared war on Germany. Realising a bigger army was needed, Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, made a direct appeal to the men of Britain. So keen was the family to help the war effort, all eight brothers, who at the time the war began ranged in age from 20 to 43, enlisted at some stage. The eldest, Alfred, and his younger brother Francis were married and left their families behind. The women the war turned yellow Sikh soldier statue honours WW1 dead The mother who lost three sons in WW1 All eight served in different regiments and they all saw front line action. Francis, who was known in later life by his middle name Frederick, sent beautifully embroidered silk postcards home from the front line to his wife Gertrude, who he had married in April 1914, just a few months before war broke out. 'A Kiss from France' on a silk postcard sent to Frederick's wife Gertrude Postcards were exchanged between Frederick and his wife Gertrude while he fought on the front line Sadly, the heartfelt messages he wrote in pencil have rubbed off over time. Thirteen months into the war, tragedy struck when the second eldest brother, Thomas William, was killed in action. He died on 25 September 1915 in the Battle of Loos at the age of 38. Frederick Everton served in World War One along with his seven brothers A few months later, in June 1916, Frederick was given 14 days' leave from battle to return to his wife after the death of their daughter Lillian, who was 21 months old. But as the war reached its end, the rest of the Everton brothers came home to their families, and were decorated for their contributions to their country. ""They must have been stars of that community,"" said Mr Jones of the returning heroes. Alfred: Born 1871. Married with one son and two daughters. Served in the Royal Field Artillery, as a gunner Sergeant. Enlisted in August 1914. Was discharged with three war medals. Rosina: Born 1875. Thomas William: Born 1877. Served in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as Lance Corporal. Killed in action in the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915. He had previously been listed in north Africa in 1897 for which he received five war medals. He also has a commonwealth grave in France. Francis Frederick: Born 1879. Served in the Royal Garrison Artillery. Married Gertrude Griffiths on 2 May 1914. Rita's mother, Gertrude Rose was born. He was discharged in February 1919 and was awarded three war medals. Died in June 1949. Edwin Charles: Born 1880. Served in the Royal Berkshire Regiment as Corporal. Enlisted July 1915. Discharged in August 1918 with four war medals. Frederick Arthur: Born 1886. Served as Acting Sergeant in the Royal Engineers. Discharged in March 1919 with three war medals. Eliza: Born 1888. Named after their mother. Albert: Born 1891. Served as a gunner in The Worcestershire Regiment. Enlisted in August 1916 suffered a gun shot wound and was discharged in June 1917 with three war medals. Howard: Born 1892. Served in the Duke of Cornwall Light Infantry, then later the Royal Dublin Fusiliers as a Private. Enlisted in August 1914 and discharged with four medals in February 1919. George: Born 1894. Served in the Manchester Regiment. Enlisted in May 1914 and was discharged with four war medals. Linda Withey - Mr and Mrs Jones's daughter, and Frederick Everton's great-granddaughter - said she imagined her ancestors to have been ""quietly proud but at the same time matter of fact with getting on and getting by with everyday life"" during the war. ""For them to have kept the document sent on behalf of the King in such pristine condition and for it to have survived to this day it must have been something that was both treasured but also a reminder that at least one was killed in action,"" she added. ""I also recall being shown these documents on several occasions as a child so it was clearly something that was a matter of pride. ""They were keen to keep the memory of the service given to King and country."" Like so many soldiers who returned from front line action, Francis Frederick Everton never spoke about the horrors he had seen and endured through the war. He lived through World War Two watching one of his daughters, Joan, go through the anguish of seeing her fiancÃ© go to fight but thankfully return safely. Frederick Everton (right) at the wedding of his daughter Joan to Arthur a few years before he died Mrs Jones recalls going to visit her grandfather Frederick every Saturday with her mother Gertrude Rose. ""He was quite a quiet and reserved man (but he was) always there every Saturday,"" she said. Mrs Withey said she had always been aware of the history of her great-grandfather and his brothers. ""Mum said he [Frederick] was a very stout and quite stern man, as was usual at the time I guess.""

Burned to death because of a rumour on WhatsAppA year in fake news in Africa,"A host of mobile phones were raised aloft to capture the moment Ricardo and Alberto were set on fire Rumoursof child abductorsspread through WhatsApp in a small town in Mexico. The rumours were fake, but a mob burned two men to deathbefore anyone checked. On August 29, a little after midday, Maura Cordero, the owner of an arts and crafts shop in the small town of AcatlÃ¡n in the central Mexican state of Puebla, noticed an unusual number of people gathering outside the municipal police station next to her shop. Cordero, 75, moved closer to the door and peered out. Dozens of people were outside the police station on Reforma Street, the town's main thoroughfare, and the crowd was swelling. Soon there would be more than a hundred people. Cordero could not remember seeing such a crowd in AcatlÃ¡n outside of a holiday. As she watched, a police car passed her shop bearing two men into the small jail house. The car was followed by more people and cries went up from the crowd accusing the two men who were taken into the jail house of being child abductors. From behind a narrow metal gate at the entrance to the station, police replied that the men were not child abductors but minor offenders. They were minor offenders, the officers said again and again, as the crowd grew in size. Inside the station sat 21-year-old Ricardo Flores, who had grown up just outside AcatlÃ¡n but moved to Xalapa, 250km to the north east, to study law, and his uncle Alberto Flores, a 43-year-old farmer who had lived for decades in a small community just outside AcatlÃ¡n. Ricardo had recently returned to AcatlÃ¡n to visit relatives, who said the two men went to the centre of town that day to buy construction supplies to finish work on a concrete block water well. Police said there was no evidence the men had committed any crime, and that they had been taken into the station for ""disturbing the peace"" after they were accosted by local residents. But the mob outside the station on Reforma Street was in the grip of a different version of events, a story stirred up somewhere unknown and spread through the private messaging app WhatsApp. ""Please everyone be alert because a plague of child kidnappers has entered the country,"" said the message that pinged from phone to phone. ""It appears that these criminals are involved in organ trafficking... In the past few days, children aged four, eight and 14 have disappeared and some of these kids have been found dead with signs that their organs were removed. Their abdomens had been cut open and were empty."" Sighted near an elementary school in a nearby community called San Vicente Boqueron, Ricardo and Alberto became the child abductors conjured up by collective fear, and news of their arrest spread just as the rumours of the child abductors had. The crowd that descended on the police station was whipped up in part by Francisco Martinez, a long-time resident of AcatlÃ¡n known as ""El Tecuanito"". According to police, Martinez was among those who spread messages on Facebook and Whatsapp accusing Ricardo and Alberto. Outside the police station, he began to livestream events on Facebook via his phone. ""People of AcatlÃ¡n de Osorio, Puebla, please come give your support, give your support,"" he said into the camera. ""Believe me, the kidnappers are now here."" As Martinez attempted to rally the town, another man, identified by the police only as Manuel, climbed up onto the roof of the colonial-style town hall building next to the police station, and rang the bells of the government office to alert locals that the police were planning to release Ricardo and Alberto. A third man, Petronilo Castelan â ""El Paisa"" â used a loudspeaker to call on the citizens to contribute money to buy petrol to set the two men on fire, and he walked through the crowd to collect it. Life carries on in AcatlÃ¡n, at the spot where Ricardo and Alberto Flores burned to death In her shop, Maura Cordero watched with fright, until she heard from someone outside that they should run because the crowd would set the men on fire. Dear God, she thought, this is not possible. Moments later, the crowd coalesced into a mob with one goal. The narrow gate at the entrance to the police station was wrenched open and Ricardo and Alberto Flores were dragged out. As people held their phones aloft to film, the men were pushed to the floor at the base of four stone steps and savagely beaten. Then the petrol that was brought earlier was poured on them. Eyewitnesses believe Ricardo was already dead from the beating, but his uncle Alberto was still alive when they set the two men on fire. Video footage shows his limbs moving slowly as the flames licked around them. The blackened bodies remained on the ground for two hours after they were burned, while state prosecutors made their way from Puebla City to AcatlÃ¡n, and the reek of the petrol remained in the air. Petra Elia Garcia, Ricardo's grandmother, was called to the scene to identify the men, and she said tears were still on Alberto's cheeks when she arrived. ""Look what you did to them!"" she shouted at the remnants of the mob, which had begun to disperse. ""It was one of the most horrific things that ever happened in AcatlÃ¡n,"" said Carlos Fuentes, a driver who works from a taxi stand near the police station. ""The columns of smoke could be seen from every point in the town."" Ricardo Flores' father, Jose Guadalupe, looks over his family's ranch in AcatlÃ¡n The road that runs into AcatlÃ¡n is lined on either side by maize and marigold fields. Mango, fig and walnut trees grow from vast plots of land owned by local farmers. The town is nestled in the heart of the Mixteca highlands and is known as the ""Pearl of the Mixteca region"" â a reference to the Mixtecs Mesoamerican indigenous groups that first settled in the region centuries ago. Most families in AcatlÃ¡n depend on remittances sent to them by relatives who have migrated to the United States. Like many other towns in Mexico, it has seen thousands of its citizens leave to head north in search of better opportunities. Among those migrants in the early 2000s were Maria del Rosario Rodriguez and Jose Guadalupe Flores, who moved north in the hope of providing better living conditions for their two young sons left behind, Jose Guadalupe Jr and his younger brother Ricardo. The two boys, aged seven and three, stayed behind with their grandmother, Petra Elia Garcia, in Xalapa in the state of Veracruz. Their parents, Maria and Jose Guadalupe, moved from city to city in the US before making their home in the east coast city of Baltimore. Maria became a domestic worker and Jose Guadalupe a construction worker, and they had a third child and called her Kimberley. Via Facebook and Facetime, they kept in constant communication with their two sons at home. Few people in AcatlÃ¡n would talk about the violence that day Maria with baby Ricardo at the family home in AcatlÃ¡n Then on 29 August, Maria received a string of Facebook messages which seemed at first like a bad dream. A close friend in AcatlÃ¡n was telling her that her son Ricardo had been arrested and was suspected of child abductions. It was a mistake, she thought. Ricardo would never be involved with such a thing. But the messages kept coming. Then came a link to a livestream on Facebook, and when she clicked on it she saw a mob, then she saw her son and his brother in law being beaten by the mob. In vain, she posted a comment on the livestream. ""Please don't hurt them, don't kill them, they're not child kidnappers,"" she recalled writing. But her message had no effect and she watched in horror as the men were doused in petrol, and the same technology that allowed a man in AcatlÃ¡n to summon a mob to kill her son allowed her to watch him die. Later that day, Maria, Jose Guadalupe, and Kimberley returned to AcatlÃ¡n for the first time in more than a decade. There they met Jazmin Sanchez, Alberto's widow, who had also watched the events unfold on Facebook. For decades Jazmin and Alberto had lived just 14km outside AcatlÃ¡n, in Xayacatlan de Bravo. Every day, Alberto went to work in the Maize fields he had planted on the land he owned in nearby Tianguistengo. When he died he left behind a small, half-built house in Tianguistengo, as well as the wife and three daughters he was building it for. ""He was a good man, he didn't deserve to die the way he did,"" said Jazmin, clutching a cap, a belt, and a wallet that had belonged to her late husband. Maria and Jose Guadalupe returned to another small house in Tianguistengo which they had left for their sons when they set out for the US. Standing at the back of the house, Maria recalled her son. He liked butterflies and running through the maize fields around the house. He left to study law because he wanted to defend people from injustices. ""They took him from us and he didn't even leave a child behind for us to take care of,"" she said. Jazmin Sanchez, Alberto's widow, hands her daughter a marigold flower on their family's ranch in AcatlÃ¡n Alberto Flores was a father to three girls, including Xiamara Kaori Flores In AcatlÃ¡n, the family was met with a wall of silence. With the exception of Maura Cordero, the shop owners on Reforma Street said they were out of town when the violence happened, or that they shut their shops and fled, or that they never opened in the first place that day, which was not a holiday. ""No one wants to talk about it,"" said Fuentes, the taxi driver. ""And the people who were directly involved are already gone."" According to state authorities, five people have now been charged with instigating the crime and four more with carrying out the murder. Martinez, who broadcast the livestream, Castelan, who called for petrol, and the man identified as Manuel, who rang the bells, were among the five. But the remaining two alleged instigators, and the four suspects charged with the murder were on the run, police said. The day after Ricardo and Alberto died, a funeral service was held in AcatlÃ¡n. Maria believed there were eyewitnesses to the crime among the crowd who gathered at the service. ""Look how you killed them! You all have children! And I want justice for my loved ones!"" she shouted as tears rolled down her cheeks and the cameras from the local and national TV stations filmed. Now the family lives in fear in AcatlÃ¡n, Maria said. They are afraid to go to the market. ""I lost my grandson who was like my son,"" said Ricardo's grandmother. ""They accused them of being criminals, with no proof."" Maria still cannot understand why the mob was swept up in the lie. ""Why didn't they check? No children were kidnapped, no one filed a formal complaint. It was fake news,"" she said. Jose Guadalupe Flores, 45, his daughter Kimberly, 10, in AcatlÃ¡n A man rings the church bells in the town, the same bells that were rung that day to rally the mob Ricardo and Alberto Flores's deaths in small-town Mexico were not isolated. Rumours and fake news stories on Facebook and WhatsApp have fomented fatal violence in India, Myanmar and Sri Lanka, to name just three. In India, as in Mexico, the technology â WhatsApp is an encrypted private messaging app that lets people send messages to large groups â has upgraded time-old rumours about child abductors for the 21st Century, allowing them to spread faster and farther with less accountability. WhatsApp, which was bought by Facebook for $19bn in 2014, has been linked to a wave of lynchings across India, often fuelled by fake stories of child abductors. In the state of Assam in June, in an incident frighteningly similar to that in AcatlÃ¡n,Abhijit Nath and Nilotpal Das were beaten to death by a mob of 200. Both WhatsApp and Facebook are widely used for news consumption in Mexico, according to a 2018 report by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. According to the same report, 63% of internet users in Mexico say they are either very concerned or extremely concerned about the spread of fake news. ""The digital platforms serve as instantaneous vehicles to channel the best and the worst of us, including our fears and prejudices,"" said Manuel Guerrero, the director of the School of Communication at Mexico's Universidad Iberoamericana. ""And that becomes more evident in the absence of effective authorities that can guarantee our safety,"" he said. Maria del Rosario Rodriguez, holds her son's phone. She can not bear to look at the fake rumours which led to his death On 30 August, the day after Ricardo and Alberto died in AcatlÃ¡n, residents of the town of San Martin Tilcajete in the southern state of Oaxaca attempted to lynch a group of seven men, a group of housepainters, who were falsely accused of being child kidnappers. That day, police officers were able to rescue the men. But the same day, in Tula in central Hidalgo state, the grisly scene from AcatlÃ¡n repeated itself when two innocent men were accused of being child abductors, beaten, and burned to death. Beyond Mexico, in Ecuador, on 16 October, two men and a woman arrested for allegedly stealing 200 US dollars were killed by a mob after a message circulated on WhatsApp falsely accusing them of being child snatchers. And on 26 October, a mob in Colombia's capital Bogota killed a man who was falsely accused in WhatsApp messages of being linked to the kidnapping of a child. Because of WhatsApp's ironclad end-to-end encryption, the origin of anything shared on the app is impossible to trace. The company resisted calls in July from the Indian government to break its encryption and allow authorities to track messages. Jose Gil, the deputy minister for Information and Cyber Intelligence in Mexico City, oversees his team WhatsApp has taken steps to try and stem the tide, adding a label to messages that have been forwarded and limiting the number of groups messages can be forwarded to 20 worldwide and to five in India. ""We believe the challenge of mob violence requires action from technology companies, civil society, and governments,"" the company told the BBC. ""We've stepped up user education about misinformation and provided training for law enforcement on how to use WhatsApp as a resource in their community."" A spokesman for Facebook told the BBC the platform ""did not want our services to be used to incite violence"". ""Earlier this year we identified and removed videos showing mob violence in the Mexican state of Puebla, and we have updated our policies to remove content that could lead to real-world harm,"" the spokesman said. ""We will continue to work with tech companies, civil society, and governments to fight the spread of content that has the potential to cause harm."" At least 10 state governments in Mexico, including Puebla's, have now launched information campaigns alerting citizens to the wave of fake social media messages about child abductions, and Mexico City's cyber police have created chat groups on Whatsapp to allow direct communication with residents of at least 300 neighbourhoods across the capital. Citizens ask the police via the groups to verify stories and police use the groups in turn to gather evidence against those who spread fake news. Also on the team's remit: identity theft, extortion attempts, and human trafficking. ""We believe that of every 10 crimes, technology is used in nine,"" said Jose Gil the deputy minister for Information and Cyber Intelligence in Mexico City. ""Social media can really alter a community through the spread of false information that many of us perceive as truthful, because it's being sent by people we trust,"" he said. ""Society really needs to evaluate what is true and what is false, and decide what is trustworthy and what is not."" A lack of effective law enforcement and culture of impunity in Mexico made rumours inciting violence ""pure dynamite"", said Tatiana Clouthier, a member of parliament in the country's Chamber of Deputies. The lynchings in AcatlÃ¡n had weighed privacy and freedom of expression against a terrible cost, she said. ""But to what do we give priority? We have to give priority to freedom of expression, but where is the limit? And that's a topic that none of us want to get into because nobody wants to curtail freedom of expression, but we cannot allow disinformation. The situation we are facing is very dangerous."" On 24 October in the afternoon, a group of around 30 relatives of Ricardo and Alberto gathered under the sun at the Church of the Calvary in AcatlÃ¡n for a memorial service. The priest prayed for both families and blessed two metallic crosses that they had brought. The service lasted for an hour, and then the families walked half a kilometre carrying the crosses to the place they had avoided for the past two months. Ricardo's father, Jose Guadalupe, placed the crosses by the stone steps where Ricardo and Alberto died, and the group stood for a while in silence on a quiet afternoon on the main street in town. ""It was very painful to be in the same place that the bodies were left charred,"" Ricardo's mother Maria said later. ""All of this happened because of rumours and because people were carried away by those rumours."" Those rumours still exist on Maria's phone - and perhaps on other phones all across the town and beyond â but she cannot bear to look at them now or show them to anyone else. The day of the memorial, she made a pledge with Alberto's widow Jazmin to visit the site of the lynching once a week and replenish the votive candles they had left by the crosses. ""The crosses should remain there forever,"" she said, ""so the people of AcatlÃ¡n may see and remember what they did.""
