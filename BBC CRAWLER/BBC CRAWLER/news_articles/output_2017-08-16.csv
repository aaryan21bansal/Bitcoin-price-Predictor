Teenagers to find out A-level results,"Boys results have overtaken girls in top grades in this year's A-levels Top A-level grades have increased for the first time in six years, as teenagers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland get their results. A* and A grades were awarded to 26.3% of entries - up by 0.5 percentage points compared with last year - with boys overtaking girls in top grades. There was a fall in the top grades for 13 subjects in England with new content and now assessed only by final exams. The number of university places allocated so far has dropped this year. In A* and A grades, boys have moved ahead of girls, with 26.6% of boys getting these results compared with 26.1% of girls, reversing a 0.3% gap last year. The change is significant because girls outperform boys at every stage of their education, and have been performing better at the top grades at A-levels for 17 years. There have been suggestions this could reflect the introduction of the new style of A-level exam. As results were being received, the Ucas admissions body said 416,000 university places had so far been confirmed - down 2% on the same point last year. University applications from the UK and European Union countries have fallen compared with last year and there is a demographic dip in the number of 18 year olds. Many universities, including in the prestigious Russell Group, will still have places on offer through the clearing system, which matches people looking for places with vacancies on courses. Good results day for Grenfell Tower pupils Malala gets A-level results and place at Oxford Manchester Arena victim had won university place A-level agony? We answer your questions Universities use chatbot to help with clearing Many other options than university Northern Ireland more than 30% get top grades Top A-level grades rise in Wales What's new about this year's A-levels Lenny Henry has been taking calls to clearing at Birmingham City University Pupils at a secondary school close to the Grenfell Tower fire in London received their AS-level results. Four pupils from Kensington Aldridge academy died in the fire and 50 were made homeless. But in this year's results, more than 40% of the pupils achieved A to B grades. Head teacher David Benson said: ""The pupils have been incredible."" Pupils from Kensington Aldridge Academy have been ""incredible"", says head teacher Changes to the qualifications system in England mean 13 A-level subjects this year have been decided solely by final exams, with no link to coursework or AS-levels taken after the first year of study. The overall results remain broadly similar to last year, with over a quarter of entries receiving top grades. The proportion of the highest A* grades has nudged up by 0.2% to 8.3%. The overall A* to E pass rate is marginally down at 97.9%. But in those new-style A-level subjects, including history, English, psychology, physics, chemistry and biology, there were 0.7% fewer A* and A grades overall. Some 24.3% of entries attained the top grades in these subjects. Exam boards said the fall in results reflected a lower-achieving group of candidates, rather than the exams being made ""more challenging"". In previous years, when more candidates sat AS levels as the first stage of the exam, some poorer performing pupils would have been ""weeded out"", said Mark Bedlow, director of regulation at exam board OCR. This video can not be played Universities Minister tells Today that the tuition fees system in place is ""fair and effective"" Leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, Geoff Barton, said that when AS-levels no longer contributed to final A-level grades, schools were increasingly likely to abandon the exam. AS-level entries have fallen by more than 40% this year, and Mr Barton said he regretted this ""narrowing"" of options. But changes to A-level exams, including updated content, were defended by John Blake, head of education at the Policy Exchange think tank. He said they had been designed to end a culture within schools of pupils repeatedly resitting exams to get the best grade.  This was painful and time-consuming for teachers and pupils, he claimed. There has been a new format for many A-levels this year ""It led to less teaching time and made it harder to get a proper grasp of the subject."" But there have been concerns from pupils who have been the first to take these revised exams. A survey of A-level students from the Student Room website found worries about a lack of textbooks and practice papers for the new style of exams. Alex Scharaschkin, director of research and compliance at AQA board, said: ""We do sympathise and understand it's an anxious time for students who are the first to go into these first qualifications."" He said some groups of pupils will have adapted to the changes easily, while others would have found it more difficult. Schools minister Nick Gibb said: ""We want everyone, regardless of background, to be able to fulfil their potential and for many, A levels are the pathway to a university degree. ""The increase in entries to facilitating subjects, those that give students the greatest choice of options at university, mean even more young people will have access to all the opportunities higher education provides. ""There has been a strong uptake in core subjects, such as maths, which continues to be the most popular A level with maths and further maths having nearly 25 per cent more entries than in 2010.""

Trump ends business groups as CEOs quit,"This video can not be played What Trump said versus what I saw - by the BBC's Joel Gunter President Trump has said he is scrapping two business councils after more bosses quit over his handling of violent clashes in Virginia. Business leaders left the White House manufacturing council after the backlash against how he reacted to the far-right rally last weekend. The clashes culminated in a woman's death and nearly 20 wounded when a car ploughed into a crowd of anti-fascists. Mr Trump's reaction has sparked outrage and generated global headlines. His announcement on Twitter came as the heads of 3M, Campbell Soup, Johnson & Johnson and United Technologies announced their resignations on Wednesday. A White House meltdown in the making Business mutiny leaves Trump isolated Mr Trump said: ""Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both."" Before Mr Trump's announcement, the Strategy and Policy Forum announced it was a joint decision to disband the council. Businesses have been under pressure to distance themselves from Mr Trump over his handling of the clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia. On Monday, Mr Trump belatedly condemned the white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups that rallied in a small Virginia town on Sunday. But in a rancorous news conference on Tuesday he backtracked and again blamed left-wing counter-protesters for the violence too. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a member of the Strategy and Policy Forum, released a separate statement on Wednesday saying he strongly disagreed with Mr Trump's recent statements, adding that ""fanning divisiveness is not the answer"". This video can not be played Does Trump react to some hate crimes faster than others? ""Constructive economic and regulatory policies are not enough and will not matter if we do not address the divisions in our country. It is a leader's role, in business or government, to bring people together, not tear them apart,"" he said. Denise Morrison of Campbell Soup Co said she could not continue to participate in the advisory panel after Mr Trump's comments. Activists had called on Campbell Soup, among other firms, to take action. America - diminished and dismissed What made Trump remarks so offensive? Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter The calculus for business leaders working with the Trump administration has changed quickly. After the Charlottesville violence, Ken Frazier of Merck abandoned the president's manufacturing council and quickly drew the president's Twitter ire. At that point there was some media speculation - through unnamed ""corporate leaders"" - that the wise move would be to wait out the storm rather than pick a fight with the president. Companies like Boeing and General Motors had tangled with the president in the past, and they (and their stock prices) generally ended up the worse for it. This time was different. As more corporate chiefs headed to the exit, the riskier move - from a business as well as political perspective - became staying put. The president, despite further tweets and verbal swipes, was unable to staunch the bleeding. His rhetorical gymnastics on the Charlottesville situation only made matters worse. In the corporate world, there's always talk of ""leading indicators"" - tell-tale signs that help predict what's to come. Is the collapse of the Trump regime's corporate entente a sign his fortunes are in a tailspin? Or is the man who ascended to the presidency without their help perfectly capable of staying there now that they've abandoned him? Allow Twitter content?

The president was under pressure to explicitly condemn white supremacists who were behind Saturday's far-right rally, where violent clashes left a woman dead and nearly 20 people injured. The rally, supported by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, was in protest of the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. But Mr Trump reversed course on Tuesday and instead appeared to defend the rally's organisers. He condemned the driver of the car who rammed into a crowd of counter protesters and killed a woman, but said those who had marched in defence of the statue had included ""many fine people"". Mr Trump's remarks were welcomed by David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. At a memorial service in Charlottesville for Heather Heyer, who was killed in the weekend clashes, her mother delivered a powerful message. ""They killed my child to shut her up. Well guess what, you just magnified her,"" she said before the crowd erupted into a standing ovation. This video can not be played Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's mother: 'They tried to kill my child to shut her up' Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has faced accusations of racism in the past, said the government may press hate crime charges against the man accused of driving his car and killing Ms Heyer. Speaking in Miami about undocumented immigration, he said: ""In no way can we accept or apologise for racism, bigotry, hatred, violence, and those kind of things that too often arise in our county"". Vice-President Mike Pence, who has been on a diplomatic tour of South America, said he was cutting his trip short to return to the US after a visit to Panama. He told reporters travelling with him that he stands by Mr Trump's words. Former CIA director John Brennan said in a letter to CNN that Mr Trump's words are ""despicable"", ""dangerous"" and ""a national disgrace"". He added that ""we will not allow the few to divide the many"". Two Republican ex-presidents also weighed in. In remarks implicitly critical of President Trump, George HW Bush and son George W Bush called on the US to ""reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism and hatred in all forms"". Their joint statement adds to a growing chorus of Republicans condemning Mr Trump's opinions on race.

Lost ring found on carrot 13 years later,"A Canadian woman got an extra carrot with her diamond ring when it was found in her vegetable patch 13 years after she lost it. Mary Grams, 84, was devastated when she lost the ring while weeding on the family farm in Alberta in 2004. But she had kept the ring's loss a secret from all but her son for more than a decade. On Monday, her daughter-in-law discovered the secret - and the ring - when she pulled up a lumpy carrot. The carrot had grown straight through the ring, enabling it to be plucked out after many years hiding in the soil. She had decided not to tell her husband when she lost it, out of embarrassment, but she told her son. She went out and bought a slightly cheaper replacement ring, and carried on as if nothing had happened. ""Maybe I did the wrong thing, but you get so worked up,"" she said. No one was the wiser, until this week when her daughter-in-law Colleen Daley decided she wanted some carrots for supper. Mary Grams with her diamond ring-carrot Ms Daley, who now lives on the farm where Mrs Grams used to live, went to harvest vegetables in the garden. Lo and behold, she spotted the ring while washing a rather lumpy carrot. Her son instantly knew who the ring must belong to, and called his mother. Looking back, Mrs Grams said she wishes she had told her husband, who died five years ago. He was a joker, she said, and probably would have found this whole situation pretty funny. Now that she has it back, she said she will be more careful. ""If I am going outside or anything I am going to put it in a safe space. That is what I should have done,"" she said. This is not the first time someone has found a diamond ring on a carrot. In 2011, a Swedish woman found her wedding ring 16 years after she lost it.

"Mum can ditch child's name, court rules","A woman can get rid of her child's middle name because of its ""association with a notorious public figure"", a judge has ruled. The mother argued the name, which cannot be known for legal reasons, was ""infected with bad connotations"". The father objected to the change as he preferred the middle name, but a family court ruled it could be dropped. At a previous hearing, a judge said continued use of the name ""would damage the child's emotional welfare"". Could I name my child Adolf? The child's father had appealed against a decision from a less senior judge, but Judge Mark Rogers dismissed this. In a family court in Lincoln, the judge said the name was ""not eccentric or in itself offensive"". But he ruled the ""association"" was enough to allow the mother to drop the middle name. Judge Rogers added: ""The child is most commonly known by the first name but the father uses both and says he favours the middle name."" The judge did not reveal the child's name or sex or the parents' identities in his ruling. 8 unusual celebrity baby names that preceded X Ã A-12 The place where children can be very unlucky with their names Can celebrities change their name?

MP Champion quits over rape article,"Labour shadow minister Sarah Champion has quit the party's front bench after criticism over a newspaper article she wrote about grooming gangs. The Rotherham MP wrote in the Sun on Friday that ""Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls"". She has now apologised for her ""extremely poor choice of words"" and quit as shadow equalities minister. Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would not ""demonise any particular group"". Ms Champion's article was written after 17 men were convicted of forcing girls in Newcastle to have sex. The men, who were mostly British-born, were from Iraqi, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iranian and Turkish communities. In interviews following the convictions, the Labour MP said such crimes involved ""predominately Pakistani men"" and said a fear of being called racist was hampering the authorities' investigations. She then wrote the Sun article, which also included the line: ""These people are predators and the common denominator is their ethnic heritage."" The online version of Ms Champion's article Among the article's critics was fellow Labour MP Naz Shah, who said it was ""irresponsible"" and ""setting a dangerous precedent"". Following the backlash, Ms Champion sought to distance herself from the article, claiming it had been altered, something denied by the newspaper. Announcing she was stepping down, Ms Champion said: ""I apologise for the offence caused by the extremely poor choice of words in the Sun article on Friday. ""I am concerned that my continued position in the shadow cabinet would distract from the crucial issues around child protection which I have campaigned on my entire political career. ""It is therefore with regret that I tender my resignation as shadow secretary of state for women and equalities."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn reacts to the resignation of Labour frontbencher Sarah Champion Mr Corbyn said he accepted Ms Champion's resignation, saying his party would not ""blame any particular group or demonise any particular group [and] the issue is one of safety of individuals."" He added he was looking forward to working with her in the future because she is ""totally committed to protecting vulnerable women"". The MP's Sun column followedan interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programmein which she warned that people were not raising potential cases of child abuse as they feared being labelled racist. She wrote: ""Britain has a problem with British-Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls. ""There. I said it. Does that make me a racist? Or am I just prepared to call out this horrifying problem for what it is?"" In the newspaper, the column was accompanied by another article by former Sun political editor Trevor Kavanagh, which referred to ""the Muslim Problem"". Mr Kavanagh's article was condemned in an open letter signed by more than 100 MPs, including Ms Champion herself, who said she was horrified that an ""extreme Islamaphobic"" column had quoted her. A spokeswoman for the Sun said: ""Sarah Champion's column, as it appeared on Friday, was approved by her team and her adviser twice contacted us thereafter to say she was 'thrilled' with the piece and it 'looked great'. ""Indeed, her only objection after the article appeared was her belief that her picture byline looked unflattering. Her office submitted five new pictures for further use."" Communities Secretary Sajid Javid suggested that Ms Champion had been sacked and criticised the Labour leader, tweeting: ""Corbyn wrong to sack Sarah Champion. We need an honest open debate on child sexual exploitation, including racial motivation."" Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said in a tweet: ""Telling the truth about tough issues is now impossible in the modern Labour Party. Pathetic."" Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission said it was a ""real shame that a respected advocate of equality"" had stepped down over, what it described as an ""oversensitivity about language"".

A White House meltdown in the making,"At some point during the campaign last year, most Republicans came to the conclusion that Donald Trump was like nuclear energy. His was a force that, if properly harnessed, could power their party for a generation. And so the party embraced Mr Trump. Republican functionaries like Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer joined the White House team. The nuclear dragon would be tamed. But after nearly seven months the depth of their miscalculation may be growing too obvious to ignore. Without adequate controls, everything Mr Trump touches could end up radioactive. ""I think his ability to effectively govern is dwindling by the hour,"" CNN Jim Acostaquotes,externala Republican leadership source as saying. Veteran reporter Carl Bernsteinsays,externalthat high-level Republican, conservative, and military officials are privately saying that Mr Trump is ""unfit to be president"". Bush presidents wade into Trump furore America - diminished and dismissed What made Trump remarks so offensive? As party officials stare at the glowing crater left from the president's latest meltdown, they are left wondering. What now? What next? At least so far, many Republicans have opted for the path of least resistance. They make stern condemnations of white supremacists and the hate that motivated the violence in Charlottesville - in carefully worded statements and tweets - hoping it will provide political shelter from the ongoing storm. This video can not be played 'Amoral' president leaves world stunned When it comes to taking aim at the president himself, however, Mr Trump is He Who Must Not Be Named. Their criticism is oblique and the condemnation implied. They may whisper uncomfortable views in private, but publicly they watch their words. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan - who had plenty of experience distancing himself from Mr Trump during the campaign - provides a standard example of the manoeuvre. ""We must be clear,"" he tweets. ""White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity."" He then returned to tweeting about Republican tax policy.

Others are caught in a political whipsaw, alternating criticism and praise for a president who, once again, seems to change his administration's position based on pique or whim.

This video can not be played What Trump said versus what BBC journalists saw According toa count,externalby the liberal website ThinkProgress, just 14 other Republicans in Congress, out of 292, have made similarly explicit condemnations of the president so far. Those who haven't put out any kind of statement, however, risk getting pressed by reporters for their take. Whenone journalist asked,externalWisconsin Senator Ron Johnson what the president should say about the Charlottesville violence, he responded: ""You tell me"", adding that he wanted to move on. That's a sentiment most Republicans probably share, but thanks to the president's combative press conference on Tuesday, ""moving on"" seems unlikely at least for now. Within the administration officials are treading even more carefully. Chief of Staff John Kelly may have been caught by cameras repeatedly wincing during Tuesday's press conference, but he's back on the job today. Trump's chief of staff glanced down at his feet throughout the Tuesday press conference Gary Cohn - the president's top economic advisor who stood nearby as the president issued his remarks in Trump Tower - reportedly told friends he was ""disgusted"" and ""upset"" by the president's actions - but not so much that he would speak on the record. Perhaps the reason why many Republicans are watching their words when it comes to the president is they have seen this film before. During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump said undocumented Mexican migrants were criminals and rapists, he belittled Mr McCain's Vietnam War record, he insulted the parents of a Muslim US soldier killed in Iraq, he mocked a Hispanic beauty pageant contestant's weight, and a decade-old recorded emerged in which he boasted about using his celebrity status to sexually harass women. After each of these episodes - and many more - Republicans eyed each other nervously and prepared to bolt for the exits, but Mr Trump eventually recovered. The storm passed, and in the end he prevailed. A neon sign in Guam makes light of recent nuclear tensions with North Korea ""This too shall pass"" isn't always a balm for the distraught. Sometimes it's a warning. It's a stern message for those who would doubt or abandon the president. AHuffPost/YouGov poll,externalconducted after the Charlottesville unrest (but before Mr Trump's Tuesday press conference) could also give clues as to why conservatives are taking pause. Fully 77% of Trump voters think the president ""did enough"" to condemn white nationalist violence in Charlottesville. Two-thirds of them had no problem with the president's delay in mentioning neo-Nazis and white supremacists by name. Perhaps most remarkably, 48% of Trump voters think the Charlottesville white nationalists either ""have a point"" (37%) or were ""mostly right"" (11%). And 68% of Trump voters see ""a lot of discrimination"" against white people in the US. Protests raged outside Trump Tower during Trump's visit Why draw the ire of a president known to keep close tabs on his friends and foes, Republicans may think, when the party's core voters largely still stand by his side, even through this latest political furore. It's a calculation, however, that Mr Trump's corporate chieftans didn't have to make. After they abandoned the White House in growing numbers, the president was forced to announce his economic advisory boards were being shuttered. Neither is political expediency a concern for much of the conservative media, which is showing growing signs of tiring of the presidential drama. While some - like The National Review - have largely remained in the #neverTrump camp, the Federalist had often come to the president's defence. Until now. ""I don't think Trump is going to resign any time soon,"" says Robert Tracinski, a senior writer for the website. ""But he needs to be left hanging out there all on his own without support from anyone in his party (or from anyone in the right-leaning media). He is a vortex of destruction, and the only way to survive is to get everything we love as far away from him as possible."" Mr Trump is a survivor. He outlasted all of his political opponents and bested many of his critics and naysayers. But a day of reckoning for Republicans could be fast approaching. Follow Anthony Zurcheron Twitter,external.

Minimum Wage workers win Â£2m compensation,"Argos has already admitted failing to pay the minimum wage Workers whose bosses failed to pay the National Minimum Wage are to be refunded a record Â£2m, the government has revealed. In its latest ""name and shame"" campaign, it lists 230 employers which have not complied with the law. In total 13,000 employees have received - or will receive - compensation for their loss of pay. Among the worst offenders was the retailer Argos, as well as hairdressers and beauty treatment businesses. About 50 employers in the hospitality sector - including two fish and chip shops - were fined for not paying the minimum wage, or the National Living Wage for those aged over 25. Hundreds of firms failing to pay minimum wage The National Living Wage and you However the largest fine, of Â£800,000, was levied on Argos. In FebruaryArgos admittedfailing to pay 37,000 staff an average of Â£64 each. However, only a third of those are included in the latest figures, as the others were no longer working for the company at the time. Employees had been required to attend briefings before their shifts started, but without being paid. They also had to undergo security searches after their shifts ended. Sainsbury's, which bought Argos a year ago, has already apologised for the mistake. ""I am pleased to say the issue was resolved quickly, and processes have been updated to ensure this cannot happen again,"" said John Rogers, the chief executive of Argos. Despite the government's apparent success in cracking down on pay, it is thought that hundreds of thousands of workers are still not getting their legal entitlement. In October last year theOffice for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalthe number of people whose pay was below the headline rate of the NMW was 362,000. However that number includes workers whose pay levels are perfectly legal. For example, those who have accommodation or other benefits supplied as part of the job. The TUC said the problem was still far from being solved. ""We know there are more wage-dodging employers out there,"" said Frances O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary. ""TUC research suggests there are at least a quarter of a million workers being cheated out of the minimum wage."" The current rate for the National Living Wage is Â£7.50 per hour. The adult rate for the National Minimum Wage is Â£7.05 for those between 21 and 24.

Snake found on pineapple in shopping,"The cat-eyed snake, also known as a frog spawn snake, is from Costa Rica A snake has been rescued after being found on a pineapple in a man's shopping in Edinburgh. The cat-eyed snake, also known as a frog spawn snake, from Costa Rica, was found by the man once he got home to his house in Tryst Park. He had bought the pineapple from an Aldi store on Tuesday. The snake, which has been named Ricky by the Scottish SPCA, is now being cared for by experts at Butterfly World in Edinburgh. Catherine Atterton, of the Scottish SPCA, said, ""It's not every day that we get called out to attend to snakes found in peculiar places. ""I know not long ago there was a wee lizard found on a head of broccoli so I was quite excited to see what had stowed away on this pineapple. ""We named him Ricky, as he's come all the way from Costa Rica. He's in a good condition and is now being cared for by experts at Butterfly World in Edinburgh. ""We're glad we were called out as without proper care Ricky wouldn't survive our climate. Now he'll be able to recuperate from his adventures."" An Aldi spokeswoman said: ""This is the first time we, or our supplier, who supplies all major supermarkets, have received a complaint of this nature. ""All our fresh pineapples are transported in cold storage with additional processes in place to prevent such issues occurring.

Stranded: What happens if you can't pay your way home?,"The story of 16-year-old India Ballancore, who was gifted the Â£85 cost of a train ticket home by a kind-hearted stranger after she had missed her service, has captured the imagination of people on social media. ""This has always beena story about human kindness and if nothing else, encourage others to look after one another,"" India's mother Andrea said. But what help is there for people who find themselves in a similar situation, who have no money to get home and no-one to help them? Most of us have missed a train, either through our own fault or because of rail delays and cancellations. But what happens when your ticket is not flexible and you can't get another train home? In the case of minors like India who have missed their train and have no money for a replacement ticket, and would otherwise be stranded, train companies will arrange for a friend or a relative to pay for a ticket at another station. This also applies to other ""vulnerable"" people - such as the elderly, those with mobility or mental health difficulties or victims of crime. Alternatively, if the station you are at has an electronic ticket machine, a friend or family member can purchase a ticket online and you can collect it by typing in the booking code. But beware, this only works for some rail franchises, carriers like Virgin require you to have the bank card you ordered the tickets with on collection. There also may be a delay in the electronic code becoming active for other franchises. In cases where train operators are to blame for you missing a train - such as when a last service is cancelled or delays on a connecting service cause you to miss it - the company has a responsibility to arrange alternative transport. This can be a taxi, a bus or another train service with a separate operator. If this is not possible, it will, if it ""reasonably can"", arrange overnight accommodation. The campaign group Rail Future says travellers who find themselves in this situation should ask whoever is on duty at the station to arrange alternative transport. If there are no staff around, you should complain to the train's operator and seek compensation, the group says. It recommends keeping receipts, recording with precise times what happened, and even taking photos of customer information screens. If you have found yourself stuck with no cash and no phone to contact someone to help you out, your best bet might be a police station. Police Scotland will help those who are stranded by giving them a cash amount from its petty cash fund if a relative lodges money at another police station. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) said it was unlikely that police stations in England and Wales would get involved in money in quite the same way, but did advise people who find themselves completely stranded to get in touch with a police officer or go to a police station. Police stations can help stranded people get in touch with their families if they have no other means of contact. It's a situation that can easily catch drivers out. You put a full tank of petrol into your car, only to realise you've left your cash and bank cards at home. What happens next? Do the forecourt staff siphon the fuel out of your tank? Is your car towed until you come up with the money? Luckily, staff do not go to these extremes. Petrol stations have a ""no means of payment"" form, where customers fill in their personal details and - dependent on company policy - have between 24 and 48 hours to return to pay for fuel. The Dartford Crossing allows people to pay up to 24 hours late You find yourself driving towards a toll crossing, but don't have the right means of payment. It's something that can easily catch out new drivers or people unfamiliar with a certain route, especially in the past when many crossings either did not accept card payments or required you to have the exact change. Nowadays, more crossings do accept cards or allow you to pay later at home if you don't have the right means of payment. The Severn bridges between England and Wales also allow you to pay after crossing, although the tolls are now set to bescrapped entirelyby the end of 2018. At the Dartford Crossing, between Kent and Essex, the physical tolls themselves have been removed, but a payment still needs to be made within 24 hours of using the crossing, either online, by phone or post. It is every holiday-maker's worst nightmare. What do you do if your cash and passport is stolen or lost while you are abroad? Luckily, the Foreign Office can help. Embassies across the world have the ability to issue emergency travel documents in order to get travellers back to the UK. In some cases, consular services can also help Britons who have got into trouble abroad get home through repatriation service. The Foreign Office will pay for the costs of getting stranded travellers home, and potentially money for lodgings before a flight, but these fees will have to be repaid once they return to the UK. The government will not charge people under 18 to be repatriated.

Bush presidents wade into Trump furore,"This video can not be played Does Trump react to some hate crimes faster than others? Former Presidents George HW Bush and George W Bush have called on the US to ""reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism and hatred in all forms"". They are the latest Republican figures to weigh in on the backlash to Donald Trump's latest remarks blaming ""both sides"" for violent clashes in Virginia. It culminated with a woman's death and nearly 20 wounded when a car ploughed into a crowd at the far-right rally. On Wednesday, Mr Trump disbanded his jobs councils amid an exodus of CEOs. Representatives from companies like Merck, Under Armour, and Intelhad quit the groupover Mr Trump's reaction to the events in Charlottesville. Trump disbands business councils Republican elected officials around the country expressed outrage when Mr Trump appeared to defend the organisers. ""As we pray for Charlottesville, we are reminded of the fundamental truths recorded by that city's most prominent citizen in the Declaration of Independence: we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights,"" a statement from the two former presidents said. ""We know these truths to be everlasting because we have seen the decency and greatness of our country."" The violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday have sparked a heated debate on US race relations. America - diminished and dismissed What made Trump remarks so offensive? This video can not be played Nine statues have been removed since 2016 A public memorial for Heather Heyer, the woman who was fatally struck by a car that ploughed into a group of anti-racism protesters, was held on Wednesday in Charlottesville. Her mother, Susan Bro, delivered a powerful speech calling on people to ""find a way to make a difference"". She added it was ""just the beginning of Heather's legacy, not the end"". ""They killed my child to shut her up. Well guess what, you just magnified her,"" she said before the crowd erupted into a standing ovation. ""I'd rather have my child, but by golly, if I'm going to give her up, we're going to make it count,"" she said. Joint statements by the two living Republican former presidents are rare The fallout from Mr Trump's comments on Tuesday continued in Washington, where Republican lawmakers reacted angrily. Many echoed House SpeakerPaul Ryan who said,external: ""White supremacy is repulsive.. There can be no moral ambiguity."" May to Trump: Far-right must be condemned Antifa: Left-wing militants on the rise Trump fans speculation on Bannon's future ""I think there is blame on both sides,"" Mr Trump told reporters at a tense press conference at Trump Tower in New York. This video can not be played 'What Trump said versus what I saw' Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter For some top Republicans lately, Donald Trump is He Who Cannot Be Named. They find it easy to condemn white supremacists and the hate that motivated the violence in Charlottesville, but when it comes time to single the president out for blame - up to and including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan - the criticism becomes oblique and the condemnation implied. Administration officials are treading even more carefully. Chief of Staff John Kelly may have repeatedly winced on Tuesday, but he's back on the job today. Gary Cohn, the president's senior-most economic adviser, reportedly told friends he was ""disgusted"" by the president's actions - but not so much that he would speak out on the record. Perhaps some Republicans - with an eye on polls showing his support among the party faithful largely holding strong - are reluctant to draw the ire of a president known to keep close tabs on his friends and foes. While outrage over the president's response to Charlottesville has reached a frenzied pitch, storms like this have erupted before and moved on, leaving Mr Trump still standing. ""This too shall pass"" isn't always a balm for the distraught. It can also be a warning. ""You had a group on one side that was bad. You had a group on the other side that was also very violent. Nobody wants to say that. I'll say it right now."" ""What about the alt-left that came charging... at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? (...) There are two sides to a story,"" Mr Trump said in response to one reporter. Who is the car-ramming attack suspect? Charlottesville victim 'a strong woman' Lincoln Memorial defaced with profanity When is it right to remove a statue? He condemned the driver of the car, but said those who had marched in defence of the statue had included ""many fine people"". His comments were said to have caught senior White House officials off guard. Following the news conference, the White House sent a set official talking points to Republican congressmen, urging them to say Mr Trump was ""entirely correct"" in his latest remarks on Charlottesville. ""Despite the criticism, the President reaffirmed some of our most important Founding principles: We are equal in the eyes of our Creator, equal under the law, and equal under our Constitution,"" a bullet point read. What was new chief of staff John Kelly thinking during the news conference? Mr Trump's remarks were welcomed by David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, whotweeted,external: ""Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa."" But many others strongly condemned the comments. British Prime Minister Theresa Maysaid on Wednesdayit was important to condemn far-right views ""wherever we hear them"". ""I see no equivalence between those who propound fascist views and those who oppose them,"" she said. Of the reactions of some 55 Republican and Democrat politicianscollected by the Washington Post,external, only the spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, Kayleigh McEnany, expressed her support.

BBC and C4 in spat over Bake Off slot,"Bake Off has three new presenters when it returns later this month The BBC is moving its new cooking show to avoid a clash with The Great British Bake Off when it launches on Channel 4. Channel 4 has poached Bake Off from the BBC and has scheduled the new series to open at 20:00 BST on Tuesday 29 August. The Big Family Cooking Showdown is on BBC Two at the same time on Tuesdays - but it will now move to Thursdays. The BBC said Channel 4's choice to move Bake Off from its previous Wednesday slot would be a ""surprise"" for viewers who ""may see this as a cynical move"". However, Channel 4 said: ""We made the decision about where to schedule The Great British Bake Off a few months after acquiring it and we haven't moved it since then. ""It is in the original Tuesday evening slot where the majority of past series have played."" Bake Off has been shown on Wednesdays for the past three years, but was on Tuesdays from 2010-2013. The Big Family Cooking Showdown started on BBC Two on Tuesday A BBC spokeswoman said: ""Channel 4's decision to move Bake Off from its long-term traditional Wednesday slot will be a surprise to many viewers who may see this as a cynical move. ""We never intended for our new cookery show to clash with theirs. ""There is room for both and we don't, in this instance, see any public value in two public service broadcasters going head to head in this way."" She said moving The Big Family Cooking Showdown was ""in the best interest of viewers"". The new series of Bake Off will start with cake week - one of the traditional challenges when the show was on the BBC. Judge Paul Hollywood has moved with the show from the BBC and will be joined in the tent by Prue Leith. They have set 30 challenges for the 12 amateur bakers, which will be shown over 10 weeks. The Channel 4 listings give a taste of what is to come in the first offering: ""The Bake Off begins with cake week, and sees the bakers take on a fruity signature challenge. ""Next, Prue sets her first technical - a children's tea party favourite - and everyone is out to impress the new judge. ""And for their final challenge comes the trickiest showstopper ever set in the first week of Bake Off: an illusion cake. Creating these mind-blowing illusion cakes will test their baking and design skills to the limit. Paul and Prue want to see what the bakers - and their cakes - are made of."" Comedian Noel Fielding and QI host Sandi Toksvig are the new hosts. The BBC lost the contract to broadcast The Great British Bake Off last year after Love Productions, the makers of the show, signed a three-year deal with Channel 4. Mary Berry, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins subsequently decided not to move with the programme. The Big Family Cooking Showdown debuted on BBC Two on 15 August, hosted and judged by former Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain, presenter Zoe Ball, TV cook Rosemary Shrager and chef Giorgio Locatelli.

Holidaymaker caught in rip current dies,"The two other swimmers remain in hospital but are not seriously injured A 27-year-old holidaymaker has died and two others are in hospital after being caught in a rip current off the coast of Cornwall. The three swimmers were swept out to sea off Crantock beach, near Newquay, just before 19:30 BST on Tuesday. They were rescued by two local surfers and airlifted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital at Treliske. The man was pronounced dead a short time later. His family has been informed, police said. The other two swimmers, aged 17 and 18, remain in hospital but are not believed to be seriously injured. Crantock is known for its strong currents due to a river which runs across the beach Leigh Hallam, who saw the rescue from Pentire Point which overlooks the beach and called 999, said he saw seven men swimming when they started getting dragged out to sea. ""Four of them scrambled on the rocks but three of them kept getting dragged out,"" he said. ""I was shouting to some paddleboarders and surfers to grab them and I was shouting to the three guys to swim sideways out of the rip but they were unresponsive."" An HM Coastguard Search and Rescue helicopter along with two RNLI Lifeboats and the Coastguard Rescue Team from Newquay, police and ambulance, were sent to the incident. Two lifeguards rescued 11 bodyboarders at Crantock beach earlier this month Crantock is known for its strong currents due to a river which runs across the beach. On 4 August 11 bodyboarders were rescued from a strong current by RNLI lifeguards. Crantock is on the north coast of Cornwall just outside Newquay RNLI Lifeguard supervisor John Steadman said after that incident: ""Crantock beach has some unpredictable currents at the moment due to the topography of the beach constantly changing. ""The river is still running across the length of the beach which causes lateral currents at certain stages of the tide."" Safety advice if you get caught in a rip current Don't try to swim against it or you'll get exhausted. If you can stand, wade don't swim. If you can, swim parallel to the shore until free of the rip and then head for shore. Always raise your hand and shout for help. Source: RNLI How rip currents work.

Trump disbands business councils,"This video can not be played What Trump said versus what I saw - by the BBC's Joel Gunter President Trump has said he is scrapping two business councils after more bosses quit over his handling of violent clashes in Virginia. Business leaders left the White House manufacturing council after the backlash against how he reacted to the far-right rally last weekend. The clashes culminated in a woman's death and nearly 20 wounded when a car ploughed into a crowd of anti-fascists. Mr Trump's reaction has sparked outrage and generated global headlines. His announcement on Twitter came as the heads of 3M, Campbell Soup, Johnson & Johnson and United Technologies announced their resignations on Wednesday. A White House meltdown in the making Business mutiny leaves Trump isolated Mr Trump said: ""Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both."" Before Mr Trump's announcement, the Strategy and Policy Forum announced it was a joint decision to disband the council. Businesses have been under pressure to distance themselves from Mr Trump over his handling of the clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia. On Monday, Mr Trump belatedly condemned the white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups that rallied in a small Virginia town on Sunday. But in a rancorous news conference on Tuesday he backtracked and again blamed left-wing counter-protesters for the violence too. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a member of the Strategy and Policy Forum, released a separate statement on Wednesday saying he strongly disagreed with Mr Trump's recent statements, adding that ""fanning divisiveness is not the answer"". This video can not be played Does Trump react to some hate crimes faster than others? ""Constructive economic and regulatory policies are not enough and will not matter if we do not address the divisions in our country. It is a leader's role, in business or government, to bring people together, not tear them apart,"" he said. Denise Morrison of Campbell Soup Co said she could not continue to participate in the advisory panel after Mr Trump's comments. Activists had called on Campbell Soup, among other firms, to take action. America - diminished and dismissed What made Trump remarks so offensive? Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter The calculus for business leaders working with the Trump administration has changed quickly. After the Charlottesville violence, Ken Frazier of Merck abandoned the president's manufacturing council and quickly drew the president's Twitter ire. At that point there was some media speculation - through unnamed ""corporate leaders"" - that the wise move would be to wait out the storm rather than pick a fight with the president. Companies like Boeing and General Motors had tangled with the president in the past, and they (and their stock prices) generally ended up the worse for it. This time was different. As more corporate chiefs headed to the exit, the riskier move - from a business as well as political perspective - became staying put. The president, despite further tweets and verbal swipes, was unable to staunch the bleeding. His rhetorical gymnastics on the Charlottesville situation only made matters worse. In the corporate world, there's always talk of ""leading indicators"" - tell-tale signs that help predict what's to come. Is the collapse of the Trump regime's corporate entente a sign his fortunes are in a tailspin? Or is the man who ascended to the presidency without their help perfectly capable of staying there now that they've abandoned him? Allow Twitter content?

The president was under pressure to explicitly condemn white supremacists who were behind Saturday's far-right rally, where violent clashes left a woman dead and nearly 20 people injured. The rally, supported by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, was in protest of the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. But Mr Trump reversed course on Tuesday and instead appeared to defend the rally's organisers. He condemned the driver of the car who rammed into a crowd of counter protesters and killed a woman, but said those who had marched in defence of the statue had included ""many fine people"". Mr Trump's remarks were welcomed by David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. At a memorial service in Charlottesville for Heather Heyer, who was killed in the weekend clashes, her mother delivered a powerful message. ""They killed my child to shut her up. Well guess what, you just magnified her,"" she said before the crowd erupted into a standing ovation. This video can not be played Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's mother: 'They tried to kill my child to shut her up' Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has faced accusations of racism in the past, said the government may press hate crime charges against the man accused of driving his car and killing Ms Heyer. Speaking in Miami about undocumented immigration, he said: ""In no way can we accept or apologise for racism, bigotry, hatred, violence, and those kind of things that too often arise in our county"". Vice-President Mike Pence, who has been on a diplomatic tour of South America, said he was cutting his trip short to return to the US after a visit to Panama. He told reporters travelling with him that he stands by Mr Trump's words. Former CIA director John Brennan said in a letter to CNN that Mr Trump's words are ""despicable"", ""dangerous"" and ""a national disgrace"". He added that ""we will not allow the few to divide the many"". Two Republican ex-presidents also weighed in. In remarks implicitly critical of President Trump, George HW Bush and son George W Bush called on the US to ""reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism and hatred in all forms"". Their joint statement adds to a growing chorus of Republicans condemning Mr Trump's opinions on race.

Walnut wipeout whips up chocolate storm,"First it was Toblerone that shrank, followed by packets of Maltesers. But has the maker of the Walnut Whip gone too far in removing the famous nuts from a new version of the chocolate? Nestle is launching three new varieties of the Walnut Whip - its oldest chocolate brand - without a nut on their peak. The new Whips (without the Walnut prefix) will not replace the traditional walnut-topped version, which will still be available in a single pack year round - and a multi-pack at Christmas too. ""Walnut Whip remains on sale alongside our new vanilla, caramel and mint versions,"" a Nestle spokeswoman confirmed to the BBC. ""This means there is something for consumers wanting to try something new, as well as for long-standing fans of our century-old walnut product."" The new flavours reflected Nestle's desire ""to extend the Whip range"", she said. However, importer Helen Graham said that strong global demand for walnuts, together with a poor crop in Chile last year and the falling value of the pound has led to a rise in prices of about a fifth. She told the BBC: ""Many nuts have risen considerably in price... USA Walnuts have been steadily increasing and are over 20% higher than they were last year. ""The new crop is not available until January, so prices will remain high until then."" The new Whips products are being sold in packs of three with the walnut version remaining in its single packs. The Nestle spokeswoman said: ""As the original version, with a long history, Walnut Whips are being sold slightly differently, in the same way as they traditionally have been for more than a century. ""They will continue to be sold as a single treat as they have been ever since their launch in 1910. They will also be sold in larger six packs at Christmas, when consumers want to be able to purchase them in larger quantities."" The news has provoked a mixed reaction on social media with some Twitter users unhappy that their favourite treat has been changed, but others very pleased because they said they always removed the nut anyway. The new walnut-less Whips The Walnut Whip was launched in 1910 by Duncan's of Edinburgh. In the past, Nestle has claimed that one is eaten every two seconds in the UK. The chocolate was in the news in 2007 when Ken Livingstone, then Mayor of London, said people living in the capital would not pay more than 38p a week for the 2012 Olympics - the treat's cost at the time. ""To get the Games for the price of a Walnut Whip a week is a bargain,"" he said. There was controversy last November when thespaces between the triangular chunks on a bar of Tobleronewere made bigger. Its US maker, Mondelez, said it had made the decision to do that rather than raise the price ""to keep the product affordable for our customers"". Later in the month, a food retail expert spotted thatthe weight of a packet of Maltesers had shrunkfrom 121g to 103g. Manufacturers Mars said it wanted to ensure its customers could obtain its chocolate brands ""at the best value for money"".

Fire Brigade advised on Grenfell upgrade,"The inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire will include the design, construction and refurbishment as well as the response of the London Fire Brigade The London Fire Brigade was closely consulted over the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower that included the installation of flammable cladding, the BBC has learned. Documents seen by the BBC say there was ""close liaison"" between the fire brigade and the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (TMO). Firefighters were shown the ""fire safety features of the building"". A fire brigade spokesman said it did not ""sign off"" the refurbishment. The fire brigade's role in the refurbishment, which was completed in July 2016, would be covered by the public inquiry into the disaster, he said. Police believe at least 80 people died when the tower was engulfed in fire on 14 June. The fire started in a fridge-freezer, but the cladding and insulation surrounding the building following a refurbishment has also come under scrutiny, with experts saying a more fire-resistant type could have been used. Robert Atkinson, the leader of the Labour opposition group on Kensington and Chelsea Council, said he was ""completely gobsmacked"" by the revelation of the brigade's involvement in the refurbishment, adding: ""I find this absolutely extraordinary and potentially very important. ""I really think we now need to make sure that the role of the fire people before the fire is looked into, and I hope that the judge and the inquiry will look at that very carefully."" The terms of reference for the inquiry were announced on Tuesday 15 August. Chaired by retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick, it will cover the design, construction and refurbishment of Grenfell Tower as well as the response of the London Fire Brigade. Structural engineer Paul Follows says the revelation regarding the involvement of the fire brigade is ""quite shocking"" bearing in mind the lessons learned about previous tower block fires Two building experts also called for the public inquiry to investigate the role of the fire brigade in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower. Geoff Wilkinson, a fire expert and building inspector, told the BBC: ""What I find slightly bizarre is the fact that the fire has occurred in the way it has, given the fact that the Tenant Management Organisation seem to have taken a fairly responsible approach in involving the fire service in that process."" Paul Follows, a consulting structural engineer, said he found the revelation ""quite shocking"" bearing in mind the lessons learned about previous tower block fires that involved types of external cladding. He told the BBC it was important the inquiry examined the role of the London Fire Brigade, adding: ""It would be very very important, I believe, in a wide-ranging inquiry, to ask all of these questions and a lot more of the fire brigade, what they were asked, what information they were given."" Most Grenfell residents not yet rehoused Who were the victims? 111 buildings fail latest fire test Visual guide to what happened Grenfell judge makes recommendations to PM Documents seen by the BBC show ""close liaison"" between the Tenant Management Organisation and the London Fire Brigade ""throughout the duration of the project"". One TMO document revealed how, at the conclusion of the project, operational firefighters from the local fire station had attended an onsite briefing ""where the contractor demonstrated the fire safety features of the building"". Following the Adair Tower fire in 2015, the fire brigade issued a series of enforcement notices that required the TMO to undertake fire safety improvements The BBC has learned that the fire brigade was invited to liaise over the refurbishment following a fire at another of the TMO's tower blocks in North Kensington in October 2015. Firefighters had to rescue about 50 people from Adair Tower, in Appleford Road, after a blaze broke out in a third-floor flat. Sixteen people received hospital treatment. Following the blaze, the fire brigade issued a series of enforcement notices that required the Tenant Management Organisation to undertake a number of fire safety improvements at Adair Tower and a second block nearby, Hazelwood Tower. The TMO declined to comment. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) said it did not ""sign off"" the refurbishment - adding that its legal powers limit the service to act only on ""internal fire safety problems such as compromised fire doors and combustible materials on staircases"". A spokesman said: ""While firefighters regularly visit local buildings to familiarise themselves with the layout and the firefighting equipment such as hydrants, this is not the same as making a detailed inspection of a building refurbishment especially when many of the changes would sit outside of our powers."" He added he could not confirm the exact contact the LFB had with the TMO regarding Grenfell Tower because the public inquiry had begun.

Trump defeated by trumpet app creator,"iTrump was a follow-up app to iBone, a trombone simulator An app developer appears to have prevailed in a long-running trademark war against the US president's business operation. The creator of iTrump first clashed with the Trump Organizationin January 2011,external, when the billionaire's lawyers alleged the trumpet simulator's name falsely suggested a link to the tycoon. After defeating this claim, the developer then went on the attack. And this resulted,externalin the company losing a key trademark of its own last week. On 11 August, the US Trademark Trial and Appeal Board cancelled the New York-headquartered company's exclusive right to use ""Trump"" in relation to entertainment services, including reality TV shows. The ruling followed earlier victories by San Francisco-based Tom Scharfeld, in which he prevented the Trump Organization from owning the exclusive right to use ""Trump""in connection with,externalcomputer games, golf-related mobile apps and music streaming. Trademarks are the distinctive name or symbol used to identity a product made by a manufacturer or a good distributed by a dealer. Trademark law is generally concerned with avoiding consumer confusion regarding the origin or manufacturer of a product. To trademark an existing word, the applicant needs to demonstrate they have given it new meaning and that there would not be grounds for confusion with other marks. The Bloomberg news agencywas first to report,externallast week's development. It brings to anend the legal action,externalbetween Mr Scharfeld's company Spoonjack and the US president's conglomerate, assuming neither side launches a fresh claim. Donald Trump passed control of his business to his two eldest sons after becoming the US president Mr Scharfeld had represented himself, which required teaching himself about trademark law. He told Bloomberg that he believed Mr Trump's legal team ""didn't seem to respect that I could do this"". ""I just wanted to be treated fairly,"" he said.

Man held in Chloe Ayling kidnap case,"This video can not be played Chloe Ayling: ""I've been through a terrifying experience"" The brother of the alleged captor of British model Chloe Ayling has been arrested, police have said. Michal Konrad Herba, 36, was held on a European Arrest Warrant at an address in Tividale, West Midlands. He is the brother of suspect Lukasz Pawel Herba, who is being held by Italian police after Ms Ayling was allegedly kidnapped in Milan. Ms Ayling, 20, was allegedly abducted and held by a group calling itself ""Black Death"" for five days. Michal Herba was arrested in a joint operation by West Midlands Police and East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) and is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on 17 August. It is alleged thatkidnappers attempted to sell Ms Aylingonline for Â£230,000. Ms Ayling, from Coulsdon, south London, arrived in Milan on 10 July for a photo shoot. There, Italian police say she was attacked by two men, drugged with ketamine and abducted, apparently to be sold in an online auction. She is believed to have been transported in a bag to an isolated village near Turin, Italy, but was released on July 17. Ms Ayling's lawyer Francesco Pesce has said she was told she would be sold in the Middle East ""for sex"". Speaking after the alleged abduction, Ms Ayling said she feared for her life throughout the ""terrifying experience"". ""I'm incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release,"" she said. Italian police documents revealed that suspect Lukasz Herba said he had got involvedin order to raise money for cancer treatment. A Polish national, who lives in Oldbury in the West Midlands, he told investigators he drove her to the British consulate in Milan and released her before the sale went ahead. The National Crime Agency and EMSOU said it was providing specialist support to the Italian police as part of the investigation.

May to Trump: Far-right must be condemned,"This video can not be played Theresa May: Leaders should always 'condemn' far-right Theresa May has said it is important to condemn far-right views ""wherever we hear them"" as she was asked about Donald Trump's response to clashes in the United States. The PM said: ""I see no equivalence between those who propound fascist views and those who oppose them."" President Trump has faced criticism for blaming both sides for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. A woman was killed when a car hit people opposed to a far-right rally. Republicans angered at Trump stance Day of reckoning in Charlottesville Corbyn: Trump comments 'not enough' The UK prime minister added: ""I think it is important for all those in positions of responsibility to condemn far-right views wherever we hear them."" She was speaking on a visit to Britain's new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, in Portsmouth, her first engagement since her summer holiday. Asked about Mr Trump's response to the Charlottesville incidents, she said: ""As I made clear at the weekend following the horrendous scenes that we saw in Charlottesville, I absolutely abhor the racism, the hatred and the violence that we have seen portrayed by these groups. ""The United Kingdom has taken action to ban far-right groups here, we have proscribed certain far-right groups here in the United Kingdom. ""And there is no equivalence."" After widespread criticism of his initial response, Mr Trump had condemned white supremacist groups on Monday. But at a press conference on Tuesday, he said there was ""blame on both sides"". ""You had a group on one side that was bad,"" he said. ""You had a group on the other side that was also very violent. Nobody wants to say that. I'll say it right now."" Donald Trump says there was 'blame on both sides' Leading figures in Mr Trump's Republican party have reacted angrily to his latest comments, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying: ""White supremacy is repulsive.. There can be no moral ambiguity."" Two of Mrs May's ministers, Sajid Javid and Sam Gyimah, attacked Mr Trump's response in Tweets on Wednesday. ""The 'leader of the free world' loses moral authority when he cannot call fascism by its name,"" Mr Gyimah wrote. Mr Javid said he had learned as a child that neo-Nazis were ""bad"" and anti-Nazis ""good"" and it was ""pretty obvious"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson tweeted: ""The president of the United States has just turned his face to the world to defend Nazis, fascists and racists. For shame."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn echoed Mrs May's insistence there is no equivalence between fascists and their opponents as he criticised Mr Trump. Speaking on a visit to Cumbria, he said: ""I can find nothing decent about anything the KKK or Nazis say or have ever said. ""Surely for goodness sake have we not learnt the lessons of what happened in the earlier part of the 20th Century, surely we have learned the lessons of the brave people that marched from Selma to Montgomery, there can be no return to those days. ""I hope president Trump will recognise he is the president of the United States. And that includes all of the people of the United States."" A number of Labour MPs have called on Mrs May's offer of a visit with state honours for Mr Trump to be withdrawn. Shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith tweeted: ""A state visit by #DonaldTrump would shame this country and betray all we stand for. Theresa May should revoke the invitation immediately."" Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood said Mr Trump's comments were ""sickening"" and a ""new low"". Senior Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, the former chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the visit should be postponed until 2020 - after the next US presidential election - and should have as its centrepiece the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim fathers arriving in America. He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""I think that's the right way forward out of what is undoubtedly going to be a very difficult situation and very probably a very big public order problem as well. ""It then becomes much more about the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim fathers, rather than Donald Trump. ""And I think it then respects the relationship between our two nations and you take the element of Donald Trump as far as you can out of the visit."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said it would be ""completely wrong"" for Mr Trump's state visit to the UK to go ahead. ""Donald Trump has shown he is unable to detach himself from the extreme right and racial supremacists,"" he added.

'Hero' denies Arena bank card theft,"Chris Parker was reported to have comforted a seriously injured girl and a woman who died in his arms A man who was hailed a hero after the Manchester Arena attack has denied stealing a bank card and mobile phone at the venue on the night of the blast. Chris Parker, 33, of no fixed address, was charged with two counts of theft on Tuesday. He was remanded into custody following the hearing at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court. Mr Parker was previously reported to have comforted a seriously injured girl and a woman who died in his arms. He was charged with stealing a purse and contents from Pauline Healey, whose 14-year-old granddaughter Sorrell Leczkowski, from Leeds, died in the explosion. Mr Parker is also said to have taken a mobile phone from a different teenage girl. He will next appear at Manchester Crown Court on 13 September.

'New solution' for post-Brexit Irish border,"The future management of the Irish border is one of three main priorities in UK-EU Brexit talks The government has said there must be an ""unprecedented solution"" for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit. Apaper detailing its proposals,externalfocuses on the need to avoid a hard border. The government stresses there should be no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts, at the border,which has almost 300 crossing points. Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as ""a fantasy frontier"". The government's paper does not envisage CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it. Reaction to UK's Brexit paper on Ireland Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? Analysis: No cross-border tariffs for small firms Reality Check: Ireland's border and Brexit Instead, the government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that will share a land border with an EU state post-Brexit. This video can not be played Farming on the border The future management of that border is a highly sensitive issue and is one of three main priorities in UK-EU Brexit negotiations. Northern Ireland Office officials say 80% of firms in Northern Ireland are small or medium sized and engaged in local business rather than international trade. If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade. Such firms might be required to declare their import and export businesses online. This video can not be played Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire insists to Today the proposals are realistic The government has repeated its desire to maintain the Common Travel Area and the rights of UK and Irish citizens, and to uphold the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, of which the UK is a co-guarantor. Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to reassure nationalists living in Northern Ireland. ""No one voted to end the special ties between the UK and Ireland, or to undermine the unique arrangements between Ireland and Northern Ireland which have underpinned the peace process and have been in place well before our membership of the EU,""  she said. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he broadly agreed with the position paper's ""aspirational"" principles. ""They reflect a lot of the language that the Irish government has been using, actually, in terms of maintaining the status quo, frictionless borders,"" he said. Adam Fleming, BBC Brussels Reporter The European Commission responded to the publication of the UK paper by saying there had to be a political deal to protect the Good Friday Agreement before a discussion could begin on technical measures. The paper is full of language and examples designed to soothe the EU about its worries. Michel Barnier said the Good Friday Agreement must be guaranteed. The UK said it would be. The Common Travel Area, which allows free movement between the UK and Ireland, is enshrined in an EU Treaty and letting it continue wouldn't be illegal under European Law. One British official said privately that if no agreement is reached, EU rules would compel the Irish government to introduce the hard border it does not want. Labour's spokesman on Northern Ireland, Stephen Pound, said an ID card system would have to be introduced to manage immigration after Brexit. ""The idea of having a CGI, virtual reality border is nonsense, it's just a pipe dream but the second thing is it's about goods, it's not about people,"" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he had discussed the issue at length with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier during a meeting in Brussels, in which he said there must be no hard border. ""I hope there can now be negotiations to make sure there is a continuation of absolute free movement between the Republic and Northern Ireland,"" he said. Critics argue the re-introduction of the hard border would severely damage the Northern Ireland peace process and have a negative economic impact. A European Commission spokeswoman said: ""We must discuss how to maintain the Common Travel Area and protect, in all of its dimensions, the Good Friday Agreement. ""It is essential that we have a political discussion on this before looking at technical solutions."" The position paper forms part of the government's negotiations with the European Union, ahead of the UK leaving the EU in March 2019. As revealed on Tuesday, Brexit SecretaryDavid Davis wants a limited transition periodto implement any new customs arrangements, including considerations relating to the ""unique circumstances"" of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The government ruled out suggestions of concentrating border checks at Irish Sea crossings Both the UK and Irish governments have repeatedly stated their opposition to a hard border, but the situation is complicated as the UK intends to leave the EU's customs union. The position paper sets out two ""broad approaches"" to future customs arrangements that the UK hopes will help to prevent physical customs posts along the Irish border. The suggestions are a ""new customs partnership"" or a ""highly streamlined customs arrangement"". The partnership model would ""align"" customs approaches between the UK and the EU, resulting in ""no customs border at allbetween the UK and Ireland,"" the paper claims. This video can not be played One road crosses the border four times in 10 minutes, but can you spot where the crossings are? The paper suggests the second, ""highly-streamlined"" arrangement could include: A continued waiver on submitting entry/exit declarations Continued membership of the Common Transit Convention to help Northern Ireland and Irish companies transit goods A new ""trusted trader"" arrangement for larger businesses A ""cross-border trade exemption"" which would mean no new customs processes at all for smaller traders The paper also dismisses the idea of a customs border in the Irish Sea, saying it would be economically and constitutionally unviable. It recognises that all this needs to be negotiated with the EU, in the hope that the border between the EU and the UK will be as ""seamless"" as possible. The government has repeatedly said it does not want to go back to the borders of the past Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said he did not accept that the EU would be unwilling to facilitate the government's proposals. ""If you look at what [EU chief negotiator] Michel Barnier has said... there is a recognition that there will need to be specific arrangements in relation to customs and other elements in terms of creating that frictionless border,"" he said. Customs union, free trade area and single market - an explainer Reality Check: What is a customs union? A quick guide to the Brexit negotiations Brexit: All you need to know ""There is a shared objective that we have, that the EU has and the Irish government has, in finding that solution."" Â£13.6bn worth of goods exported to the Republic of Ireland from Great Britain in 2016 Â£9.1bn worth of goods exported to Great Britain from the Republic of Ireland in 2016 Â£10.7bn worth of goods from Northern Ireland were sold in Great Britain in 2015 Â£2.7bn worth of goods from Northern Ireland were exported to the Republic of Ireland in 2015 More than 80% of cross-border trade on the island of Ireland is by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) The Ulster Unionist Party welcomed the government's position paper, while Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster said it was a ""constructive step"". ""It is clear the government has listened to voices in Belfast, Dublin, Brussels and London about how the United Kingdom's only EU land border could be managed after we exit the EU,"" said Mrs Foster, NI's former first minister. However, Sinn FÃ©in northern leader Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland was ""a fleeting concern for the British government, we are collateral damage"". ""What we need to see is the Irish government acting in the national interest and defending the rights of those people here in the north that voted to stay with the European Union,"" she said. Earlier this year, residents from border communities held a protest at Stormont Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), said the government seemed to be ""effectively playing for more time"". Countries in the customs union do not impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods. Every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad. So, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee. Other goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs. The UK has said it is leaving the EU's customs union because as a member it is unable to strike trade deals with other countries.

Length of Big Ben silence to be reviewed,"The House of Commons says it will look again at the length of time Big Ben will be silenced during renovation work after ""concerns"". The bell is to be put out of use - except for special occasions - for four years on Monday to allow repairs to the surrounding Elizabeth Tower. Parliament said it had to protect workers carrying out the renovations. But Prime Minister Theresa May said ""it can't be right"" that the famous bongs will not be heard again until 2021. How do you take a good photo of Big Ben? Parliament defends silencing of Big Ben She said Speaker John Bercow should ""urgently"" review the proposals. Now, in a statement, the House of Commons has said: ""When Parliament returns, in light of concerns expressed by a number of MPs, the House of Commons Commission will consider the length of time that the bells will fall silent. ""Of course, any discussion will focus on undertaking the work efficiently, protecting the health and safety of those involved, and seeking to ensure resumption of normal service as soon as is practicable given those requirements."" A Commons spokesman said the bells would cease to ring on Monday, following the chimes at noon, as planned. But he added: ""Big Ben's bongs are an integral part of parliamentary life and we will ensure that they can resume their role as the nation's timekeeper as soon as possible."" Asked about the plan to silence the bells for four years - which has been strongly criticised in some sections of the press - Mrs May said: ""Of course we want to ensure people's safety at work but it can't be right for Big Ben to be silent for four years. ""And I hope that the Speaker, as the chairman of the House of Commons Commission, will look into this urgently so that we can ensure that we can continue to hear Big Ben through those four years."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would miss the sound of Big Ben, but that the welfare of people working alongside it should come first. He added: ""So if we have to miss Big Ben in reality for a while so that work can be done, well, that's something we have to go through. ""It's not a national disaster or catastrophe."" A Commons spokesman said ""starting and stopping Big Ben is a complex and lengthy process"" and it would not be possible to continue ringing the bells for the entire period. He added: ""The whole process takes around half a day to complete. ""Following a thorough assessment, experts have concluded that it would not be practical or a good use of public money to start and stop the bells each day, particularly as we cannot fully predict the times that staff will be working on this project."" The Commons Commission is responsible for maintenance of the Palace of Westminster. Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, a member of the commission, has written to the Commons director general to ask about the cost and practicality of ""ringing them more frequently"" during the repair works. He said: ""It would not be possible for them to continue to be rung every 15 minutes as is currently the case, that would not be practical, but it may be perhaps practical and it may be financially viable to ring them more frequently than is currently being proposed."" The Â£29m restoration was signed off in 2015 by the Commons Administration Committee, which advises the commission, as well as the Lords Administration and Works Committee and the Commons Finance Committee. But Mr Brake said MPs did not know the full extent of the shutdown when they agreed the repair plans. Last year the House of Commons said the bells would have to be switched off for ""several months"" to allow the repair work to take place. On Monday, it was revealed this would involve a much longer period of silence, with the bells only being switched back on for important events like New Year and Remembrance Sunday. This led to press criticism, and Brexit Secretary David Davis described the move as ""mad"". Defending itself, Parliament said that ""prolonged exposure to the chimes would pose a serious risk to the hearing"" of those working on the project.

What will Brexit do to this 310-mile border?," “Kilnasaggart Bridge” was a whispered curse on the lips of train travellers in the days of Northern Ireland’s Troubles. It nudges up close to the border that separates the six counties of Ulster in the United Kingdom from the Republic of Ireland. The bridge was such a popular target for IRA bombers that uninterrupted travel from north to south was often impossible. A groan would go up as the tinny tannoy announced that, because of problems on the line, all passengers would disembark at the Newry halt, travel by bus across the border and then clamber back on the train at Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland. We trundled on, we trundled off. It added at least an hour and more like two to the journey. So much for the “express”. But at least we knew we had crossed the border. Now, commuters sip posh coffee and sail past this once troubled spot, blissfully unaware of where the north ends, and where the Republic of Ireland begins. The border is there, but it is not there and the bombs are history. Drive along the modern motorway that links Belfast to Dublin and the only clue that you have crossed is the subtle switch from signposts in miles to those in kilometres. Keen-eyed, you might spot the change in the markings on the sides of the road. It is a child’s guessing game - north or south, are we there, aren’t we here? About 50 years ago, it was easier. The good roads were in Northern Ireland - you knew you had hit the Republic when the potholes rattled the car. The road signs in the south were more dramatic than the north. They came in sets and block capitals: SLOW; SLOWER; SLOWER STILL. The Killeen border checkpoint near Newry, 1987 This border is 310 miles (499km) long and meanders from Carlingford Lough in the east to Lough Foyle in the west. It was never a neat line. It is a squiggle across the map of Ireland – like an awkward child taking their crayon for a walk. That line divides rivers, slices fields, cuts bridges in two and even, occasionally, divides the odd house. Carlingford Lough marks the easternmost point of the border There are homes where you can have your breakfast in the north and go to sleep in the south. There are places where mobile phone reception in just one house fluctuates between north and south. The days of the Troubles are behind us - days lived in the dark shadow of watchtowers and turrets are vanished. But now the UK is getting ready to leave the EU, and the people of the borderlands are uneasy. Up to 35,000 people commute across the border every day. Hospital patients and schoolchildren and cross-border workers are among those who have to make the daily journey. None of them wants a hard border, but the EU has stressed that there will have to be some form of customs control. What is a “soft” border? Will thousands of people find themselves cursing daily in long queues at border points? The village of Muff lies close to the border between Donegal and County Londonderry. During the Troubles, cars queued at the Army checkpoint, where twitchy young soldiers with rifles rattled out the usual questions. Where are you coming from? Where are you going to? Get out and open your boot, sir. Then it was on down a twist in the road and the Irish customs men were on their marks waiting to catch the locals with the contraband. Now, you’d hardly know you were crossing. A black corrugated hut at the old customs post is boarded up - weeds sprout from the chimney. Over the bridge and you’re into the one-street village. It is tiny but boasts four petrol stations. The Derry-Donegal crossing point at Muff There is what used to be an old Irish ballroom - a big, squat building called Borderland. When Derry city burned in riots and bombings, Borderland was the escape – the dance hall down the road, where you jived your way into another world. Marie Lindsay was born in Muff, but the city of Derry is centre stage in her heart. She lives in the hills just outside the village and has a foot in both camps. Each morning she gets into her car in Donegal, in the Republic, and drives up through a little wood. Then it’s on through a housing estate and into Derry, where she’s principal of a girls' school, St Mary’s College. Marie Lindsay, principal of St Mary's College, Derry She has lived her life along this border. Like thousands of others, she feels she has a double identity. Marie Lindsay in the art room at St Mary's College “I’m Donegal, born and bred. Donegal is in my DNA, but Derry is my home city, I feel I belong there,” she says. Her journey to work is seamless these days – down what was once an “unapproved” road - spiked, so that people could not drive across. As the Troubles in Northern Ireland escalated in the 1970s, the Army and police blocked and cratered the smaller roads to make all but the approved checkpoint routes impassable, and to stop paramilitaries crossing. Lindsay has known a hard border - the interminable waits at checkpoints. They were dark days that no-one really wants to recall. She has now grown used to peace and the ease of life. The spot marking the border is often nearly invisible On the evening drive home from work, she points out the spot where you have crossed. “The road signs switch from miles to kilometres, the road markings change, but that’s it,” she says. She carries two purses – a sterling purse for the north and a euro purse for the south. But both sides take each other’s currency at a decent rate. Many people carry two mobile phones – one north, one south. Talk to any of the girls in St Mary’s, says Lindsay, and you’ll soon find they have roots in Donegal – a granny in Malin, an aunty from Carndonagh. All down the years, city dwellers have taken a Sunday drive from Northern Ireland over the border to feast their eyes on the beauty of Five Fingers Strand, to nurse a pint in Buncrana, to treat the children to a ride on the swing boats by the shore. But the links amount to much more than a Sunday stroll. There are good schools in the city of Derry and the health service is free. Many people in Donegal send their children to school north of the border or are treated by the National Health Service -  some officially, some unofficially. There are pressing questions about students. Many from Northern Ireland travel to university in Dublin, Galway and Cork. Others from the Republic of Ireland cross the border to go to Queen’s in Belfast and to Derry’s Magee College and the North West Regional College. Magee College campus, Derry Lindsay is also concerned for the Donegal students who cross the border to go to the city’s further education college. “They could end up having to make the 40-minute drive to Letterkenny whereas before it was just 10 to 15 minutes into college in Derry.” On 23 June, 76p bought you one euro, but by the second week after the Brexit vote, that figure had shot up to 86p. It would reach a high of 90p last October, before falling back slightly since. For all those living in Donegal and working in Derry, the value of their sterling pay packets has plunged. In recent years, Lindsay’s Donegal village has played host to young families from Northern Ireland, lured by affordable housing. It has been a breath of fresh air – new life for the local primary school, tills ringing in the shops, a bustling community in the border village. But Brexit is making border folk start to think twice. Betty Holmes, Donegal Action for Cancer Care Betty Holmes is a member of Donegal Action for Cancer Care. The group is based in the Republic of Ireland but campaigns to access nearby health facilities in Northern Ireland. She is passionate about getting the best cancer care close at hand. It’s a deeply personal campaign. Her father died of lung cancer a week after her seventh birthday - he had never smoked. Her mother died from breast cancer three years later. When a new state-of-the-art radiotherapy centre opened recently in Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry, there was a sigh of relief from families on both sides of the border. No more two-hour treks over the mountain pass from Derry to Belfast for those living with cancer in Northern Ireland’s western region. No more five-hour treks from Donegal to Galway for cancer patients living in the Republic of Ireland. “It is a good 308km to Galway and what sort of a journey is that when there is radiotherapy sitting a few miles across the border?” asks Holmes. The journey to Altnagelvin Hospital is as little as 45 minutes from the top end of Donegal at Malin Head, she says. The Irish government has invested in the new services in Northern Ireland. The Prince of Wales opened Altnagelvin's new cancer centre earlier this month Agreements in place between the UK and Irish governments mean there are currently places for 385 cancer patients coming across the border. But Brexit weighs heavily on Betty Holmes’s mind. “Our concern is what happens in three to five years when the real effect of Brexit is starting to be felt,” she says. If you are the parent of one of the children from Northern Ireland who would travel to Dublin for paediatric cardiac care, then you might be asking what impact Brexit could have for those children?” “Will the Irish government be in a position to pay what [is set] down as the cost of treating a cancer patient at Altnagelvin? Will that number be reduced from 385 to 200 initially and will it go down from there?” The sharing of medical services across the border is not a one-way street. “If you are the parent of one of the children from Northern Ireland who would travel to Dublin for paediatric cardiac care, then you might be asking what impact Brexit could have for those children?” Ciaran Crilly woke up to the news of Brexit last June  and immediately worried about his business. Just up from Cloughoge church on the Newry border, where the Army posts once cast long shadows on the high hill, is the sweet factory – a family business set up in the 1970s. Ten years before that Ciaran Crilly’s father, Peter, left for a sugary fact-finding mission, taking in the Mars factory in Slough, and then Blackpool to uncover the secret of getting the name through the stick of rock. In the 1970s, as the Troubles raged in Northern Ireland, he came home, put his head down and set up a business. Now his son has the reins. Before Spanish holidays were the norm, the Crillys made seaside rock, selling it from Portrush in Northern Ireland to Bundoran and Bray in the Republic. This was the time when traditional sweets - bags of clove rock, bull’s eyes and brandy balls - still cast their spell. On both sides of the border, they still love their sweets. But Brexit was a blow. “It was terrible. Our business has been going superbly this last 10 years, year-on-year growth, no issues. Then you have this shock and you ask why did it need to happen?” Ciaran Crilly, Crillys Sweets The company was doing 75% of its business with the Republic of Ireland. When the UK exits Europe, if a trade deal isn’t reached, it could potentially face a 30% tariff in line with World Trade Organisation rules. That would be a worst-case scenario, says Crilly, but possible. For a while, Crilly considered upping sticks and moving a few miles down the road to set up in the Republic. Instead, they decided to stay put and look at new markets. In January, Crilly’s Sweets had a stand at a trade show in Germany and picked up business in Australia and China. They have been inundated with requests. Every emigrant craves the comforting taste of home. “We gained a lot of business through expats in Australia. People miss the kola cubes, pear drops, clove rock, mixed balls and even the jelly babies and wine gums,” he says. And, given the response from across the globe, perhaps Brexit could prove a blessing. But it’s an anxious time. “Half of our staff are from EU countries, such as Latvia and Poland. Will they stay?” Crilly doesn’t know. Drive on for an hour along the border and it’s sheep day at Enniskillen mart. The yard is a long line of muddy Land Rovers hauling trailers full of sheep and ewes. Men in flat caps, jeans and wellington boots meander about. Denzil Brady is 84 but wiry and keen-eyed. In all his years working on his father's farm in the hills around Enniskillen, he has had little time for the European Union. Denzil Brady “They're the greatest set of rogues in Brussels,” he says. “They have farms nearly out of business with the whole pile of paperwork. “With all those regulations, I fear for the young farmers in their 40s and how they'll suffer lives of misery.” Hugh Maguire has a different view. He has farmed for more than 50 years up by the famous Marble Arch Caves. His land straddles the border and he's had his share of headaches. He has cows and sheep, but some of them belong to the north and some belong to the Republic. It makes for two sets of paperwork and a few headaches. Woe betide the Irish sheep that sets a hoof over the border and vice versa. But Maguire believes the EU did a lot of good and Brexit is not welcome. He remembers the old days of smuggling across the border. He remembers the hard border, the checkpoints and queues and he just asks himself what lies ahead now. It could be a big step backwards, he says. “Farmers cannot farm without the European single farm payment,” he says. This is the agricultural subsidy payment, based on the area of a farmer's land, to offset the cost of producing food. James Johnston is the mart director - it's a family business that goes back to his grandfather's day. He's a young man and he admits that, personally, he is no fan of Europe. At its heart, [the EU]'s quite an undemocratic system. So I can understand reasons for pulling out.” “The EC originally was very good in terms of promoting free trade and promoting peace and security within Europe. “But I do think it has overstepped the mark as it has grown. Legislation-wise, it has just mushroomed. At its heart, it's quite an undemocratic system. So I can understand reasons for pulling out,”  he says. “However, where we are, here in this part of Ireland, in Fermanagh, we border with four of the southern counties, an open border is absolutely critical to peace and general well-being on both sides - free movement of people and goods.” Johnston argues that it must be maintained, however Brexit pans out. He'd like a more open border with the Republic of Ireland even than exists now. “It's exceptionally difficult, virtually impossible to bring livestock across the border, sell them in this mart and for traders to buy them and bring them home again. “It's easier for us to send cattle from the mart here to England and Scotland after a sale than to send them 10 or 12 miles down the road a stone's throw away across the southern border.” The problem lies with animal health and biosecurity, he says. Different policies exist on each side of the border. And now there will be more change. For farmers, the best-case scenario would be a post-Brexit free trade agreement, says Phelim O'Neill, a markets specialist for the Irish Farmers Journal. The worst-case scenario would see a very heavy tariff on agriculture products traded between the UK and the EU. “In terms of where will hit hard for Northern Ireland, somewhere between a quarter and a third of milk produced in Northern Ireland dairy farms goes to Ireland for processing,” he says. “So if you are one of those farmers, your milk will be hit with a very high tariff – it would not be viable to send it. “It is the same for sheep. About 400,000 sheep each year go from NI to factories in Ireland for processing. If the WTO tariffs apply, then it simply would not be viable.” Colm McKenna People who own petrol stations along the border know all about boom and bust - trade depends on currency fluctuations and significantly lower fuel duty rates in the Republic of Ireland. Enda McColgan, manager of the Texaco in Muff, says 90% of the garage’s customers come from Northern Ireland to top up. Business is booming. There was one stage when demand was so great they even had to employ somebody to manage the traffic on the road outside. Enda McColgan: Business is booming Garage owner Colm McKenna remembers bombings, the checkpoints and the days of soldiers in ditches. “If we had a hard border then we’d be going back 30 years in six weeks to six months,” he says. It’s not hard to imagine who might target such a border, he points out. Some have warned that a hard border could be used as a justification for violence by dissident republicans who do not support the current peace agreements in Northern Ireland. Kevin Melarkey Not far away, at another crossing, Kevin Melarkey is the egg man on the border at Bridgend near Derry. He's there at the farm shop seven days a week - in a small hut - selling eggs and bags of spuds. He has a good thick coat and a pair of mountain boots to keep out the cold. When he gets a minute, he can stand outside his hut and rest his eyes on the blue hills of Donegal. He's too young to remember much more than the queues at the checkpoints on a Sunday when half of the city decamped across the border to Buncrana or to buy cheap petrol. Like everyone else, he does not know what Brexit will bring. “We're in limbo, it's just a waiting game,” he sighs. Brexit and border changes will be more significant for Northern Ireland, says Katie Daughen, head of Brexit Research and Support Services to the British/Irish Chamber of Commerce. Every year 31% of NI exports are to the Republic and 27% of its imports come from there. The main sector to be affected is food and agriculture. “It’s worth over £4.5bn to the economy in the north and it’s by far the most exposed.” Katie Daughen: Changes will be more significant north of the border Daughen lists a couple of examples of the all-island nature of the economy: • Wheat grown in the south is processed in north•    40% of chicken produced in the south is processed in the north One of Ireland’s most famous exports faces similar problems. Guinness is brewed in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland. But it’s sent north of the border to be bottled or canned before returning to Dublin for export to the world. But it is not all doom and gloom.  There are opportunities out there too. The border’s disappearance was a gradual shift - like ice melting. After the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, things moved slowly. But the dragon’s teeth  - ugly concrete blocks squatting on hundreds of country roads linking north and south -  were suddenly yanked. The soldiers in their camouflage passed out of view. In 2003, they took away the checkpoint at Newry. They pulled down the ugly iron cage, the military turret high on the hill above the church at Cloughoge. The tower above Cloughoge The people who felt safer for the presence of the Army on the hilltop called it a watchtower. Those who resented the Army, and their high power cameras, preferred “spy post”. It was close to that Newry border where Lord Justice Gibson and his wife Cecily were killed by an IRA bomb in 1987. 1987: Wreckage from the explosion which killed Lord Justice Gibson and his wife A year later, Robin and Maureen Hanna and their son, David, six, died in an IRA explosion after crossing the border. The family from Hillsborough in the north were returning from holiday when their vehicle was mistaken for one belonging to a senior judge. The big military turret went up on the hill after that. It was a stretch of road that became a no-man’s land between north and south. It was not a place for a friendly chat - there was tension in the air, the soldiers were edgy. Crossings were never easy. Many resented the waiting and the questioning. People were afraid they might get caught up, a sitting target for a bomber. Or scared that a soldier might even get trigger happy. But there was another side to the old border too. The game of “catch me if you can” with the customs officers still raises a smile. A customs post on the Belfast-Dublin road in the 1950s Butter was cheaper  on one side – hide it in the pram and sit the child on top. It was all the sweeter for being illicit. Young couples from the north took the train to Dublin to buy the wedding ring. There are tales of dangling the ring out of the train window on a thread on the way home to evade the keen eye of the customs man. In Fermanagh, drive down past the town of Enniskillen and on to the border towns of Belcoo and Blacklion and you see how past and present merge. The stone bridge marks the crossing point between north and south. The bus stop in Belcoo has two sets of signs – a blue and white sign for the Ulsterbus and a green one with a greyhound for Bus Éireann. The street signs are in both English and Irish. Harold Johnston has an old-fashioned shop just over the bridge in Blacklion. His grandmother opened it in 1901. “She was a trained seamstress and had five dressmakers upstairs at one time. She used to do wedding dresses and red flannel petticoats.” A century later, her grandson presides over an Aladdin’s cave. It is a drapery and a clothes shop and a wool shop and whatever you like. The shoe boxes are piled high, there are rolls of oilskin tablecloth propped up. From the door, Johnston can look left to where the customs post and Irish gardaí once stood, checking the cars coming south. “There were 43 guards and six sergeants at that border,” he says. “We had 24-hour cover and two shifts. We had patrol cars patrolling the back roads. “They were stationed in the barracks on the left.  The young lads were sent up from Dublin for training along the border.” In the 1930s, the Depression hit hard but on 3 September 1939 trade exploded on his side of the bridge when war was declared. “They were putting restrictions in the north and it was scarcity this and scarcity that. But we had lots of butter and sugar.” Harold Johnston Smuggling was rife. Johnston tells a story about the undertaker in Blacklion in the Republic who was running short on shrouds, but had a friend across the border in Belcoo who knew another man that could get him some. The problem was getting them over the bridge from north to south. “Yer man came into the bar in Blacklion and said the parcel had arrived and he had it with him,” Johnston says. “So he went into the kitchen and he had on a coat three times too big and he opened it and he had put all the shrouds on himself and walked over the border like that. “As he took the shrouds off in the kitchen at the back, yer man looked at him and said: ‘It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a man taking a shroud off’.” During the Troubles, there were just 20 official border crossings between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The British Army shut down, spiked or cratered the rest. With peace, the country relaxed, breathed a sigh of relief, and unspiked the roads. Trade and business became more fluid – it blossomed. Businesses in Northern Ireland set up offices in the Republic and vice versa. Seamus Leheny from the Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association knows the pain of those whose businesses may be disrupted by Brexit. An Irish revenue commissioner has said up to 8% of freight crossing the border might be subject to checks after Brexit. With a minimum of 6,000 lorries trundling over the border every day, you begin to see the scale of the problem. “That makes at least 500 lorries that could be checked every day,"" says Leheny. ""Added to that is the thought that drivers selected for checking might have to drive away from the main flow of traffic to a specific post – and distance costs money. Even if there are to be checks it doesn't necessarily follow that there will be a string of traditional border posts with long queues of lorries. The head of the Irish tax authorities has said he is ""practically 100% certain"" there will be no new customs posts along the border after Brexit. Niall Cody said businesses, however, must assume there will be “some form of customs” post-Brexit - it might be that people would be allowed to make declarations online. Ongoing analysis of cross-border trade increasingly shows that most goods transported between the jurisdictions will not need to be physically checked, Cody suggested. Still, there are those who might be less than scrupulous and could take advantage by shipping goods into Belfast and straight into the EU via Dublin – without paying the tariffs. Then, think about the large retailers who treat the island of Ireland as an entity – one market. They get the goods to Belfast, use distribution centres to sort and store, and send them on by lorry on to Galway, Cork and Dublin. “They may ship directly rather than go through a whole bureaucratic process. Jobs could be lost in Northern Ireland,” Leheny says. Eamon O'Farrell, a former customs officer in Donegal who spent 30 years patrolling the border, says the Irish authorities are “ill equipped” to deal with border checks. It's not the main roads, it's the hundreds of unapproved roads. “I cannot figure out how they're going to do this with the resources that I understand they have,” he says. “You wouldn't get 12 people across the whole border who know where the actual border is. We're talking about the revenue risk, tax evasion, various types of smuggling - goods and people.” On the ground, people are thinking ahead. There are cross-border meetings and countless committees working out the logistics of a border that is longer than the length of the island of Ireland. At government level, civil servants in London are getting their heads around the conundrum of Northern Ireland. One thing that looks likely to continue is the Common Travel Area (CTA), the bilateral UK-Ireland agreement that allows for free movement of UK and Irish citizens between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The arrangement allows Irish and UK citizens the right to work, to access public services and to vote in certain elections, and Brexit Secretary David Davis has described the continuation of the CTA as ""non-negotiable"". Jane Morrice, former head of the European Commission office in Northern Ireland, helped broker the Good Friday Agreement during her time as a politician. She wants to maintain the status quo on the island of Ireland. She is proposing that Northern Ireland should have honorary membership of the EU after the UK's departure. “We've made such good progress since the Good Friday Agreement. Removing the border and removing borders in mind as well as geographically has been hugely successful and we cannot allow ourselves to halt that or reverse it in any way,” she says. “The role played by the EU in the peace process was instrumental.” Border dwellers are hardy as the weeds and thistles sprouting from the old huts at the customs posts. They have come through partition and war and the Troubles. Harold Johnston tells the story of a villager in the 1920s who travelled up the road to Enniskillen in Northern Ireland for his groceries every week. Partition hit home on the very day of his weekly shop. On his return journey, a fresh new customs hut had sprung up at the border and a man in a starched uniform was waiting for him. “You can’t bring those goods into the Free State,” said the customs man. “But I always have,” said the man. “Well, you can’t now,” said the new officer. The man turned back for a sit and a think in nearby Belcoo, Northern Ireland. What did he do? Johnston pauses and smiles. “He sat and waited for the customs officer to shut up shop for the night and sure didn’t he just walk over the border.” There is always a way. Built with Shorthand"
Trump fuels speculation on Bannon's future,"""We'll see"" - with two words President Donald Trump has shovelled grist into Washington DC's rumour mill, which is filled with chatter that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is a marked man. The so-called Trump whisperer has proved himself one of the administration's great survivors - so far. Steve Bannon, the chief White House strategist, is Death warmed up. By that I mean the characterisation of him by the US comedy circuit - literally as ""Death"" - is in stark contrast to the persona he projects when you meet him privately. He's full of surprises, and he has an infectious laugh. I've spoken with him on a number of occasions over the past few months. We've chatted about Nigel Farage, who led the Brexit campaign in the UK, and a variety of other topics: he doesn't drink, as I learned. He likes English tea (""a cuppa,"" he says). Still, he has a wicked reputation - and has frequently been cast as a malevolent force in the West Wing by those outside of the administration and by insiders, too. The anti-Bannon contingent includes Rupert Murdoch, the Fox News founder who's repeatedly lobbied the president,according to the New York Times,external, for the strategist to be sacked. At a news conference in New York on Tuesday, President Trump was asked whether he had confidence in Mr Bannon. And his tepid answer can't have been very reassuring to the White House chief strategist. ""I like him,"" said the president. ""He's a good man, he's not a racist, I can tell you that. ""He's a good person. He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard. ""But we'll see what happens with Mr Bannon."" Other White House officials are watching as closely as everyone else. One of the president's aides has previously told me in a despairing tone that Mr Bannon supported the ""deconstruction of the administrative state"". The aide looked at me as if to say: how do you work with someone like that? Mr Bannon pushed hard for the dismantling of the system and the trashing of the elites. He argued that this unconventional approach was the best way to improve economic conditions and employment prospects for ordinary working people in the US, the voters who helped propel Mr Trump into the White House. Mr Bannon sees the world in stark terms. He has been a strong proponent of the America First agenda, along with stricter border and immigration policies. The power structure at the White House has been constantly changing, but Mr Bannon was a key player in the administration from the beginning and has influenced the president on these policies in a significant manner. White House TVs drown out shouting Decoding the Trump 'war room' photograph Who is Donald Trump's chief strategist? Mr Bannon has apparently been at odds with so-called moderates in the administration, a group that includes the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser, and Gary Cohn, the director of the national economic council, both of whom want to take a more measured approach to changing the government. In contrast, Mr Bannon has pushed for upheaval. He kept a whiteboard in his West Wing office, coveredin scribbled-out goals,externalsuch as ""Suspend immigration from terror prone regions"". He was known for the way that he trashed the press,telling reporters they had been ""humiliated"",externalby the Democratic defeat in the autumn, and he encouraged the president to demonise the media. He's also been accused of encouraging or at least tolerating racist, nationalist views among those who make up the president's base of support. Mr Bannon's ideological leanings are nothing new. He supported radical political reform while he was the head of Breitbart News,a website he described as,externala ""platform for the alt-right"", a movement that included the Ku Klux Klan and other white nationalist groups. He pushed for the same agenda while he was working on Mr Trump's presidential campaign. Mr Bannon has millions of admirers, people who see the world in the way he does and also want to wreak havoc on the Washington establishment. One of the most important ones is Rebekah Mercer. The daughter of a New York investor, Robert Mercer, she has known Mr Bannon for years and helped to fund his enterprises. Robert Mercer, as the New Yorker's Jane Mayerhas documented,external, is an enigmatic libertarian and a key force behind Mr Trump's victory. Mr Bannon revelled in the populist uprising of Mr Trump and continued to stir things up after he won. At a rally for the president in Melbourne, Florida, in February, Mr Bannon looked on the crowd with a smile. He is polite (he's from the South) and charismatic, and White House aides have invariably tended to gravitate towards him. Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff, used to bound up to Mr Bannon in a crowd, as if he were afraid he might miss something. A bear of a man, Mr Bannon looked rumpled when he travelled with the president, and he'd often smooth down his hair with his hand, trying to make himself more presentable. Still his hair always looked messy. Once we were supposed to meet in the West Wing at night. It was after 10pm on a Friday, and I waited outside the building. The place was quiet, and the lights from the building cast strange shadows on the ground.  As it turned out, he worked late into the night (""still grinding,"" he texted me) and then, House-of-Cards style, disappeared into the darkness. It's not clear whether Mr Bannon will ever be sacked. It's also not certain what the impact of his departure would be on the administration. He could marshal the dark forces of the internet and his Breitbart audience, swinging a wrecking ball at the Trump presidency. Some analysts believe the president will keep Mr Bannon at the White House because he's afraid that he'd do too much damage if he were thrown out. But there are other possibilities: if he left the White House on good terms, Mr Bannon could go back to Breitbart and push for policy changes in the administration from a strong position in the conservative media. Or he could simply disappear into the night, as I've seen him do in the past.

Elvis still earning a fortune 40 years after his death,"If Elvis was still alive he would be 82 When a downward-spiralling Elvis Presley died 40 years ago on 16 August 1977, a cynical music industry insider was overheard to remark that it was a ""smart career move"". Apocryphal tale or not, death has given a lucrative boost to the selling power of not just Elvis, but also Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie and a host of other music legends. It has also enabled a number of entrepreneurial fans of the artists in question to make a good living from selling memorabilia and other things connected to their idols. Elvis's legacy and monetary worth remain immensely strong in particular -according to Forbes' list of top earning dead stars he earned $27m (Â£21m) in 2016,external, and sold one million albums. Aged just 42 when he died of a heart attack, the singer's notorious love of unhealthy food could not have helped. His favourite sandwich was said to consist of two slices of fried bread, with crispy bacon and fried bananas, smothered in jam and peanut butter. The Elvis Presley All Time Favourite Sandwich on sale in Randers Graceland sold 11,000 such sandwiches to visitors last year - but it was not Graceland, Memphis, Elvis' former home, rather Graceland Randers in Denmark. The tourist attraction in northern Denmark is owned by Danish-born super-fan Henrik Knudsen, 53, who built a copy of the original Graceland mansion to keep the rock 'n' roller's legend alive in Scandinavia. ""I was 13 when he died, and I couldn't say it was a shock, as I wasn't that deep into him at the time, but what I recognised was this was something big,"" says Henrik, an honorary citizen of Memphis, who has visited Graceland in the US some 100 times. ""This could have been royalty. This could have been a president."" After establishing a successful Elvis fan club, his Danish replica of Graceland opened in 2011. Henrik can vividly remember when Elvis died 40 years ago It cost Â£2.8m to build the house, with museum in the basement, a function room, merchandise store, and a diner, but within six years Henrik had made enough money to pay back his investors. Yet with success came a lawsuit from Elvis Presley Enterprises, the corporate body created by the Elvis Presley Trust to manage worldwide licensing of Elvis-related products and ventures, for infringement of the Graceland trademark. In December 2015 Graceland Randers was renamed Memphis Mansions, and Henrik declines to discuss the legal aspects. Elvis Presley signature sandwich - 69 Danish krone ($10.90; Â£8.42) Entry price - DKK 99 adults, DKK 69 children 12 to 17, under-12s free 150,000 visitors last year Sells officially licensed Elvis products - such as CDs, DVDs, LPs, merchandise, autographs Another Elvis fanatic who makes a living from his hero is London-based Sid Shaw, the owner of website Elvisly Yours, which sells Elvis-related memorabilia and products to fans in more than 50 countries. Over the years he has sold mugs, costume jewellery, magazines, books, posters, badges, t-shirts, plates, magnets, Elvis sunglasses and tapestries, among others. 'I first heard Elvis on Radio Luxembourg. And that was the only place you could hear pop music [at the time],"" says Sid, now 71. Sid Shaw (left) sells a variety of Elvis-related memorabilia ""Elvis came on and was totally different to anything else, so I became a fan then."" Sid started making busts of Elvis in 1977, the year of his death, and in 1978 set up a fan club. ""In those days, the Elvis Presley estate didn't have a trademark, so I applied for the trademark 'Elvis', and I was told you can't get it because it is generic,"" he recalls. ""So I applied for the next best thing which is 'Elvisly Yours'... and I got it."" Some of the Elvis-related items for sale on Elvisly Yours The phrase Elvisly Yours is the way Elvis fans around the world sign their letters. Sid says to protect himself legally he has acquired a further 38 trade marks in the UK and Europe. At the other end of the online memorabilia scale, eBay says current demand for material related to the King has seen 12 Elvis-related items sold every hour over the last three months, covering everything from mugs to masks. And there are nearly 70,000 current listings for Elvis memorabilia on the site. Entry price - $57.50 (Â£44.50) adults, $51.75 over 62s and youths 13 to 17, $27 children 7 to 12, under 6s free 500,000 visitors a year 4,000 visitors a day in July Contributes $150m a year to Memphis economy While Elvis fans are mainly of the same generation that grew up with him, others - such as reggae legend Bob Marley - have more cross-generational appeal. In Marley's case he has also become synonymous with Jamaica, helping boost tourism there. ""Bob Marley is more than a native son, he is an icon,"" says Jamaica's director of tourism Paul Pennicook. Bob Marley's name is synonymous with that of Jamaica The Marley legacy is overseen by The Bob Marley Group (Jamaica), which is owned by his family, and includes the Bob Marley Museum. Located in Kingston, the Jamaican capital, the museum was formerly Marley's home, and was purchased in 1975. It was transformed into a museum after his 1981 death, and attracts more than 36,000 visitors a year. Entry costs are $25 per adult, $12 per child aged four to 12 years, and $5 per student with valid Jamaican school ID. The Bob Marley Museum is based in the reggae icon's home Meanwhile, products on sale related to the reggae icon include Marley Coffee, a House of Marley audio equipment range, and One Love ice-cream. Once a star dies, original memorabilia associated with them tends to climb in price. Katherine Schofield, head of the entertainment department at UK auction house Bonhams, says: ""We tend to see a knee-jerk reaction in the market following the death of a collectible artists. ""It takes a bit longer for the market to settle, and we can then see more accurately if prices look likely to stay higher."" David Bowie items are in demand at auction Since David Bowie's death in January 2016 she says there have been high prices for items related to the trend-setting musician, and ""high quality lots coming on to the market"". Truffle Shuffle, a firm which produces images on t-shirts, has also noted that death can boost sales. ""When Bowie died, just like with his music, sales of merchandise tripled, with fans looking to get something to remind them of a cultural icon,"" says Claire Wood, head buyer at TruffleShuffle.com. Meanwhile, Australian street artist Jimmy C (aka James Cochrane), sold limited edition prints of a Bowie wall mural in Brixton, London, he had created in 2013. The 44-year-old sold about 120 prints for Â£180 each with 20% going to Cancer Research UK. ""The print is connected to my artwork as much as it is to Bowie, or to be more specific, the artwork was a personal interpretation of Bowie,"" he says. Jimmy C's Bowie mural became a focus of mourning after the musician's death ""I believe it is legitimate for me to sell decent quality prints of my own artwork."" But be warned, estates are always on the look-out for anything that crosses from homage into copyright infringement. ""Our action against piracy is an ongoing one,"" says the Bob Marley Foundation. ""We continue to encourage the public to do the right thing and report any illegal use of the image of the reggae icon.""

How to turn a hit TV show into an international success,"The Brazilian version of UK reality TV programme Come Dine With Me is presented by a puppet parrot If you happen to switch on the TV in Brazil then you might come across a four-hour live talk show presented by a popular celebrity and her puppet parrot. The programme includes pre-recorded video clips, which the parrot and presenter then discuss. So far, so foreign television. But what you may well not realise is that these clips are actually the Brazilian version of British reality TV programme Come Dine With Me. In the UK, the popular programme shows a group of four amateur chefs competing against each other to host a dinner party for each other. The format ""felt particularly British,"" says Mike Beale, head of global development at ITV Studios, the company behind the programme. Yet when the south American country bought the local rights from ITV Studios the programme changed pretty dramatically. Brazil is just one example of how hit game shows, reality shows and dramas produced in one country are being bought and adapted for scores of countries around the world in a global trade worth billions of pounds a year. The reality cooking show Come Dine With Me has been adapted in more than 40 markets, including, most recently, Mongolia Since Come Dine With Me began in 2005, local variations of the show have been produced in more than 40 countries. When the format was sold to France, the producers eliminated the tongue-in-cheek social commentary and turned it into a straightforward cooking competition. ""It was about how does food taste, not who has the nicest home or who gave the best entertainment,"" says Mr Beale. The programme's global expansion is a great example of the television formats industry which has grown rapidly since the late 1990s. In Europe alonethe market was estimated to be worth,external$2.9bn (Â£2.2bn; 2.5bn euros) in 2013, but the industry has become increasingly competitive as a growing number of countries produce their own formats, challenging top exporters such as the UK. Major networks are also struggling to create global hits like they once did, while most of the really big formats on TV, such as Masterchef and Big Brother, are decades old. Your Face Sounds Familiar, screened on ITV, is based on a Spanish talent show BBC Worldwide is behind the formats Strictly Come Dancing - produced internationally as Dancing With the Stars - and Bake Off, which have been adapted in 54 and 25 international countries, respectively. Sumi Connock, creative director of formats at BBC Worldwide, says the most successful global formats tend to be based around ""universal themes"" that viewers anywhere can relate to, such as cooking, dating or dancing. ""They also have really identifiable elements so you can distinguish them from other shows and they have to answer an audience need,"" she says. ""At the moment there is a real trend for warmth, and the feel-good factor so shows like Bake Off and Pitch Battle are doing well - although there was a time when shows with a meaner edge seemed to do well."" Foreign formats are attractive to networks because they are programme ideas that have already been shown to work, says Ed Waller, an analyst at media research firm C21. In essence, networks are ""outsourcing risk"" to countries such as the UK or US, which may have better funded broadcasters with stronger track records of developing successful shows, he says. Strictly Come Dancing has been produced in 54 markets including Brazil However, Mr Waller says that while in the 1990s and 2000s there were relatively few suppliers of ideas for international formats, that has now ""completely changed"". ""You have many more networks developing for the international market and creating their own intellectual property,"" he says. ""As a result many more formats now change hands - although they tend not to reach as many countries or stay on our screens for as long."" The German version of The Great Bake Off has been very popular New countries have entered the fray too. The UK has long been the world's top exporter of ideas, followed by the US and the Netherlands, but countries such as Scandinavia, South Korea, Israel and Argentina have all become serious players too. Recent examples include the South Korean dramas The Good Doctor and Somewhere Between, which were sold to major US network ABC last year. And Spanish talent show Tu Cara me Suena has been adapted in 40 countries, including the UK, where it airs as Your Face Sounds Familiar. Mr Beale says production companies generally try to keep formats recognisably the same as they move from country to country, so they keep their ""special sauce"". However, formats are commonly changed to reflect budget sizes or local customs, says professor Jean Chalaby, an expert in formats at City University. A contestant on the German version of Bake Off made a cake out of meat For instance, talent shows in countries like Spain and Italy are often stretched out to last three or four hours while they might last only an hour in the UK or US. The judges on such programmes also tend to be less cruel in smaller countries, such as New Zealand, than in bigger ones like the UK or US. ""The humiliating first rounds are taken off in smaller countries as there is more of a sense of a community,"" he says.

Where's hot? This summer's most popular holiday spots Read more global trade series here. Of course, formats don't always work when adapted for new markets, with comedy and drama being particularly hard to pull off. Some ideas simply don't translate, as seen with the controversial teen drama Skins. It lasted seven series in the UK but just one when it was adapted for MTV in the US. Mr Beale says that what all production companies want is to create ""evergreen"" formats that can be brought back time and time again. Such programmes become global brands, offering recurring royalties and spin-off opportunities such as events and merchandise. Gordon Ramsay's new Hell's Kitchen Restaurant, due to open in Las Vegas this year, is one such example. Creating such hits has become harder in the current climate. ""If a network doesn't like a cooking programme they just go for another one. It's a buyers' market,"" says Mr Beale. Another problem producers face is copycatting as it is very hard to protect a format's intellectual property. The best protection for this, says Mr Beale, is having a market-leading idea to begin with so anything that comes behind you ""won't look as good"". ""You've got to be pragmatic"". ""We're in a global society and you have to accept that people will copy you. You just need to become the best very quickly,"" he adds.

Freetown: A disaster waiting to happen?,"Sierra Leone suffers floods on a regular basis Freetown is a city squeezing itself into the small space between the mountains and the sea, in a country with the highest annual rainfall in Africa. In August - the height of the rainy season - an average of 539.9mm falls on Sierra Leone's capital. So it comes as no surprise that Freetown is a city used to flooding. But Monday's rain brought with ita disaster which left hundreds dead, and will no doubt be followed by finger-pointing and blame shifting. Was it simply the effects of climate change and geography, or something more avoidable? ""Yes, the floods and mudslide were caused by nature. But they could have been avoided or at least mitigated,"" the BBC's Umaru Fofana wrote on his Facebook page. ""If we hurt the environment, the environment will fight back. If we fail to plan, we plan to fail. It's that simple."" Freetown was first established in the late 1700s, a home for freed slaves from the US and UK. Its position was chosen not for what was on land, however, but what the sea could offer: the world's third largest natural harbour. As a result, Freetown ended up in an area of heavily-forested mountains, which has not been accommodating for a growing population - currently around the million mark. 'Trump forest' climate change project gains momentum Climate change shifts timing of European floods ""It is the highest density of people I have ever seen,"" said Olivia Acland, a freelance journalist based in Freetown. ""The amount of people when you walk through the streets, and the traffic. There are just people everywhere."" Freetown is built in the hills Many of those people live in the city's informal settlements, of which there are more than 60, according toSlum Dwellers International.,external Here, tiny tin homes packed with large families can be seen squeezed on the banks of rivers, the sides of mountains, on the edge of the sea. But, says Jamie Hitchen, of the Africa Research Institute, it is not just the city's poorest residents who are building their homes in areas which are contributing to the flooding risk. Some of the city's wealthier residents are also responsible for the deforestation destabilising the soil, tempted higher into the hills by the cooler air and impressive views of the Peninsula Forest area, near to where the mudslide occurred. ""It is happening at both levels,"" Mr Hitchen said. ""Unfortunately, the impact [of disasters] is on the poorer residents."" The government is aware of the problem - and how it might increase as the effects of climate change begin to take hold. Two years ago, Mohamed Bah, deputy director of Sierra Leone's Environment Protection Agency (EPA), warned ""irresponsible actions taken on the hills will affect the city greatly"". ""Until we stop dumping waste into drainages, until we stop clearing the trees, we will always face severe consequences of climate change,"" he told Sierra Leone'sStandard Times Newspaper.,external And yet, Mr Hitchen feels there is a lack of political will to deal with the issue head on. There are about 60 informal settlements in Freetown ""The ideas have been put forward, the failure has been in terms of political action,"" he said. Mr Hitchen added: ""There is technically a moratorium on building in the area of the Peninsula Forest. That is there in writing, but not in any kind of enforcement."" Abdulai Baraytay, a spokesperson for Sierra Leone's president, told the BBC's Newsday programme the EPA had spoken to residents about the danger two weeks earlier, and tried to put some trees in - but said they had been chased away. Mr Baraytay also pointed to earlier attempts to move people out of harm's way. After the last major flooding in 2015, Sierra Leone's government did make an effort to move people living in one settlement to somewhere safer and more spacious on the outskirts of the city. ""But they rented [the homes] out and came back to the slum,"" he said. Mr Hitchen had a different view on why they returned: to find work. ""They provided houses, but they did not connect them to the grid - they did not connect them to jobs,"" Mr Hitchen said. There is another problem contributing to the flooding: the rubbish blocking the drains. ""There is no clearing of waste, the drains fill up. Everyone is saying it's not our responsibility,"" Mr Hitchen said. ""But even if they addressed the issue of waste collection, there is nowhere for it to go. Both Freetown's dump sites should have been closed in 2009."" This video can not be played Sierra Leone mudslides: Rescue and recovery operation in Freetown But despite the unique challenges of Freetown. this is not just a problem in Sierra Leone. The2009 Unjust Water report,externalfound examples of worsening floods in Ghana, Uganda, Mozambique and Kenya. It was generally, the report concluded, caused by ""the growing occupation of floodplains, increased runoff from hard surfaces, inadequate waste management and silted up drainage"" - all factors said to contribute to the problem in Freetown. Professor Ian Douglas, co-author of the report and University of Manchester professor, told the BBC: ""You have several related problems about vulnerability relating to informal settlements. ""One, people can only find vacant land to build their shelters in dangerous places, like river flood plains, ""Two, urban development up stream increases the rate at which the water rushes down in to the flood plain,exacerbatingthe danger by excavating in to hillsides. ""Three, encroachment on the flood plan by municipal works and major developments leads to the waters being left with narrow spaces to flow through, therefore flowing more quickly and with more energy to pick up debris."" When it comes to flooding then. climate change is simply another contributing factor.

Can tech solve the Brexit border puzzle?,"There are two competing visions of how goods will flow in and out of the UK after Brexit. Either the M20 will become a lorry park as endless customs checks at Dover choke the motorway. Or technology will help create frictionless borders and exporters will hardly notice any change. The truth, according to those who have studied the issue, is somewhere between the two. So, can technology solve the border puzzle? Right now there are no customs checks at Dover or other borders with EU countries. After Brexit there will be - unless the idea floated by the UK of an invisible border gets a better reception in Europe than it has today. Whatever the nature of the UK's trading relationship with the EU after we leave, it seems certain that there will be added bureaucracy for both companies and the government, but technology should lighten the load. Even if there are no tariff barriers between the UK and the EU, companies will probably have to show where their goods have originated, otherwise this country could be used to get something like New Zealand lamb onto the continent without any limits. Not necessarily - they can be conducted at factories before the goods depart, and much of the paperwork will in fact be digital, carried out online. If the UK sticks with the EU's safety and quality standards, there will have to be checks to make sure goods match up to those benchmarks and that doesn't have to be done at a port or border. But it will all depend on improved IT systems. Yes, but they are fairly old. Brexit Secretary David Davis says a new system will be in place by early 2019. It appears he is referring to the upgrade of HMRC's customs processing system, Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (Chief), which is more than 20 years old and was due to be replaced even before the Brexit vote. The new system is called CDS - Customs Declaration Service - and is being developed in part by IBM. HMRC admits that it may now have to accommodate five times as many customs declarations as originally envisaged, but says it's confident that it will be ready in time. Not quite. Last month the National Audit Office said HMRC faced ""some significant challenges to deliver the programme within the current timetable"" and gave it an amber risk rating. But even if the system is up and running with all exporters on board, that won't be enough to create a frictionless border. Ports like Dover will need to install new technology, including number plate recognition, to match the lorries driving on and off ferries with the customs declarations lodged in the CDS system. This is not cutting edge technology and is in use elsewhere in the world, but HMRC seems dubious that it will be in place by March 2019 and says it would benefit from an implementation period. More exporters will also be pressed to become AEOs - Authorised Economic Operators -  taking advantage of an existing system which many large companies use to speed up the customs process. Other solutions being floated include using the blockchain technology which underpins cryptocurrencies to make the sharing of data about exports much simpler, and employing artificial intelligence to decide where random checks on shipments crossing the borders should be targeted. But with the deadline for getting back control of the UK's borders just 18 months away, such innovative technology ideas are not priorities for the civil servants entrusted with this task. In fact, making sure there are no traffic jams in Dover will be more about the arts of management, politics and the law than technology.

'Tiffany' rings cost Costco $19.4m,"US wholesaler Costco is facing a $19.4m (Â£15m) bill for damages after jewellery chain Tiffany sued it for infringing its trademark by selling ""Tiffany"" engagement rings. The ruling by a US district judge is the latest twist in a long-running legal battle going back to 2013. Costco, which is to appeal against the decision, argues that ""Tiffany"" is now a generic term for the rings. But it has now been told it must call them ""Tiffany-style"" instead. The dispute centres on the sale of solitaire-style rings, comprising a diamond mounted on a single band with six prongs. Costco, which had sold 2,500 of them, put them on display with the label ""Tiffany"", although they were not in fact made by the jeweller. An earlier court ruling in October 2016 ordered Costco to pay $5.5m in compensatory damages and $8.25m in punitive damages. But in a further court decision on Monday, the compensation was increased to $11.1m, while the amount of punitive damages still stands. Kate Swaine, a partner at law firm Gowling WLG, said: ""This damages award may seem excessive given that only 2,500 products were sold, but if it can be argued that an infringement is blatant and where it relates to such a well-known brand, the claimant is entitled to seek punitive damages. ""Brand owners will welcome this decision as an indication of the risk that third parties run in trying to make associations with famous brands."" The cheapest engagement ring on Tiffany's US website currently costs $12,000 (Â£9,300) while customers can buy one from Costco's website for only $380 (Â£295).

PM: Silencing Big Ben until 2021 is wrong,"The House of Commons says it will look again at the length of time Big Ben will be silenced during renovation work after ""concerns"". The bell is to be put out of use - except for special occasions - for four years on Monday to allow repairs to the surrounding Elizabeth Tower. Parliament said it had to protect workers carrying out the renovations. But Prime Minister Theresa May said ""it can't be right"" that the famous bongs will not be heard again until 2021. How do you take a good photo of Big Ben? Parliament defends silencing of Big Ben She said Speaker John Bercow should ""urgently"" review the proposals. Now, in a statement, the House of Commons has said: ""When Parliament returns, in light of concerns expressed by a number of MPs, the House of Commons Commission will consider the length of time that the bells will fall silent. ""Of course, any discussion will focus on undertaking the work efficiently, protecting the health and safety of those involved, and seeking to ensure resumption of normal service as soon as is practicable given those requirements."" A Commons spokesman said the bells would cease to ring on Monday, following the chimes at noon, as planned. But he added: ""Big Ben's bongs are an integral part of parliamentary life and we will ensure that they can resume their role as the nation's timekeeper as soon as possible."" Asked about the plan to silence the bells for four years - which has been strongly criticised in some sections of the press - Mrs May said: ""Of course we want to ensure people's safety at work but it can't be right for Big Ben to be silent for four years. ""And I hope that the Speaker, as the chairman of the House of Commons Commission, will look into this urgently so that we can ensure that we can continue to hear Big Ben through those four years."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would miss the sound of Big Ben, but that the welfare of people working alongside it should come first. He added: ""So if we have to miss Big Ben in reality for a while so that work can be done, well, that's something we have to go through. ""It's not a national disaster or catastrophe."" A Commons spokesman said ""starting and stopping Big Ben is a complex and lengthy process"" and it would not be possible to continue ringing the bells for the entire period. He added: ""The whole process takes around half a day to complete. ""Following a thorough assessment, experts have concluded that it would not be practical or a good use of public money to start and stop the bells each day, particularly as we cannot fully predict the times that staff will be working on this project."" The Commons Commission is responsible for maintenance of the Palace of Westminster. Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, a member of the commission, has written to the Commons director general to ask about the cost and practicality of ""ringing them more frequently"" during the repair works. He said: ""It would not be possible for them to continue to be rung every 15 minutes as is currently the case, that would not be practical, but it may be perhaps practical and it may be financially viable to ring them more frequently than is currently being proposed."" The Â£29m restoration was signed off in 2015 by the Commons Administration Committee, which advises the commission, as well as the Lords Administration and Works Committee and the Commons Finance Committee. But Mr Brake said MPs did not know the full extent of the shutdown when they agreed the repair plans. Last year the House of Commons said the bells would have to be switched off for ""several months"" to allow the repair work to take place. On Monday, it was revealed this would involve a much longer period of silence, with the bells only being switched back on for important events like New Year and Remembrance Sunday. This led to press criticism, and Brexit Secretary David Davis described the move as ""mad"". Defending itself, Parliament said that ""prolonged exposure to the chimes would pose a serious risk to the hearing"" of those working on the project.

Trump draws party ire with Virginia line,"This video can not be played Does Trump react to some hate crimes faster than others? Former Presidents George HW Bush and George W Bush have called on the US to ""reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism and hatred in all forms"". They are the latest Republican figures to weigh in on the backlash to Donald Trump's latest remarks blaming ""both sides"" for violent clashes in Virginia. It culminated with a woman's death and nearly 20 wounded when a car ploughed into a crowd at the far-right rally. On Wednesday, Mr Trump disbanded his jobs councils amid an exodus of CEOs. Representatives from companies like Merck, Under Armour, and Intelhad quit the groupover Mr Trump's reaction to the events in Charlottesville. Trump disbands business councils Republican elected officials around the country expressed outrage when Mr Trump appeared to defend the organisers. ""As we pray for Charlottesville, we are reminded of the fundamental truths recorded by that city's most prominent citizen in the Declaration of Independence: we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights,"" a statement from the two former presidents said. ""We know these truths to be everlasting because we have seen the decency and greatness of our country."" The violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday have sparked a heated debate on US race relations. America - diminished and dismissed What made Trump remarks so offensive? This video can not be played Nine statues have been removed since 2016 A public memorial for Heather Heyer, the woman who was fatally struck by a car that ploughed into a group of anti-racism protesters, was held on Wednesday in Charlottesville. Her mother, Susan Bro, delivered a powerful speech calling on people to ""find a way to make a difference"". She added it was ""just the beginning of Heather's legacy, not the end"". ""They killed my child to shut her up. Well guess what, you just magnified her,"" she said before the crowd erupted into a standing ovation. ""I'd rather have my child, but by golly, if I'm going to give her up, we're going to make it count,"" she said. Joint statements by the two living Republican former presidents are rare The fallout from Mr Trump's comments on Tuesday continued in Washington, where Republican lawmakers reacted angrily. Many echoed House SpeakerPaul Ryan who said,external: ""White supremacy is repulsive.. There can be no moral ambiguity."" May to Trump: Far-right must be condemned Antifa: Left-wing militants on the rise Trump fans speculation on Bannon's future ""I think there is blame on both sides,"" Mr Trump told reporters at a tense press conference at Trump Tower in New York. This video can not be played 'What Trump said versus what I saw' Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter For some top Republicans lately, Donald Trump is He Who Cannot Be Named. They find it easy to condemn white supremacists and the hate that motivated the violence in Charlottesville, but when it comes time to single the president out for blame - up to and including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan - the criticism becomes oblique and the condemnation implied. Administration officials are treading even more carefully. Chief of Staff John Kelly may have repeatedly winced on Tuesday, but he's back on the job today. Gary Cohn, the president's senior-most economic adviser, reportedly told friends he was ""disgusted"" by the president's actions - but not so much that he would speak out on the record. Perhaps some Republicans - with an eye on polls showing his support among the party faithful largely holding strong - are reluctant to draw the ire of a president known to keep close tabs on his friends and foes. While outrage over the president's response to Charlottesville has reached a frenzied pitch, storms like this have erupted before and moved on, leaving Mr Trump still standing. ""This too shall pass"" isn't always a balm for the distraught. It can also be a warning. ""You had a group on one side that was bad. You had a group on the other side that was also very violent. Nobody wants to say that. I'll say it right now."" ""What about the alt-left that came charging... at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? (...) There are two sides to a story,"" Mr Trump said in response to one reporter. Who is the car-ramming attack suspect? Charlottesville victim 'a strong woman' Lincoln Memorial defaced with profanity When is it right to remove a statue? He condemned the driver of the car, but said those who had marched in defence of the statue had included ""many fine people"". His comments were said to have caught senior White House officials off guard. Following the news conference, the White House sent a set official talking points to Republican congressmen, urging them to say Mr Trump was ""entirely correct"" in his latest remarks on Charlottesville. ""Despite the criticism, the President reaffirmed some of our most important Founding principles: We are equal in the eyes of our Creator, equal under the law, and equal under our Constitution,"" a bullet point read. What was new chief of staff John Kelly thinking during the news conference? Mr Trump's remarks were welcomed by David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, whotweeted,external: ""Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa."" But many others strongly condemned the comments. British Prime Minister Theresa Maysaid on Wednesdayit was important to condemn far-right views ""wherever we hear them"". ""I see no equivalence between those who propound fascist views and those who oppose them,"" she said. Of the reactions of some 55 Republican and Democrat politicianscollected by the Washington Post,external, only the spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, Kayleigh McEnany, expressed her support.

Aircraft carrier arrives in home port,"This video can not be played The moment HMS Queen Elizabeth entered Portsmouth Harbour The UK's new Â£3bn aircraft carrier has docked in its home port. HMS Queen Elizabeth entered Portsmouth Harbour for the first time at about 07:10 BST following extensive preparations at the naval base. The 65,000-tonne ship has been undergoing sea trials since setting sail from Rosyth dockyard in Fife, where it was built, in June. The 900ft (280m) long carrier cannot currently deploy planes but flying trials are due to begin next year. Prime Minister Theresa May met Capt Jerry Kyd while on board the carrier Addressing crew members and contractors on the flight deck, Prime Minister Theresa May said the carrier was a ""true testament to British ship building and design"". ""Britain truly has the best sailors, marines and officers in the world. And I believe you deserve the very best equipment and that it what we have with HMS Queen Elizabeth,"" she said. ""This ship is the symbol of the United Kingdom as a great global maritime nation. Clearly she is a stunning piece of 21st Century engineering."" Live: New aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth arrives in home port Crowds gathered on Southsea seafront for HMS Queen Elizabeth's arrival Spectators who gathered on the shoreline to watch the ship's arrival saw flypasts of Royal Navy helicopters, the first featuring a Sea King, two MK2 Merlins and two MK3 Merlins which were then joined by two Hawk jets. A flotilla of craft followed the behemoth aircraft carrier as she sailed into the Solent before heading into Portsmouth, where, at its narrowest point, there was less than 66ft (20m) clearance on each side. An 820ft (250m) exclusion zone was enforced by armed police in small boats and a no-fly zone was put in place to prevent the flying of drones around the harbour. The ship's available company stood at the edge of the vessel, with officers and family members also lining the jetty to welcome the ship. Louise Bond, 30, from Fareham, whose husband, Petty Officer Greg Bond, 33, is serving on board, said: ""It's my first homecoming, it's brilliant, I was up at 2.30am, first in line. ""It's amazing, I wouldn't miss it for the world."" Road closures,externalwere put in place in Old Portsmouth, Southsea seafront and parts of the city centre. Isle of Wight, Gosport and cross-channel ferry services also altered timetables. Preparations for the arrival of the future flagship of the fleet, and its 700 crew, saw more than 20,000 items ranging froma human skull to sea mines dredged upfrom Portsmouth Harbour. The Ministry of Defence said specialist dredging vessels had removed 3.2 million cubic metres of sediment - the equivalent to 1,280 Olympic swimming pools - during the dredging operation carried out to deepen the harbour mouth to enable the Queen Elizabeth to reach Portsmouth naval base. Speaking on board before the journey in to Portsmouth, Capt Jerry Kyd said he felt a ""huge amount of pride"" ahead of the vessel berthing in its home port. ""It sends the right signals to our allies and indeed potentially to our enemies that we mean business. ""The armed forces are fundamentally an insurance policy for the country and you can't just, at the flick of a switch, decide that you need these capabilities."" The ship has been undergoing sea trials off the Scottish coast and sailed with the USS George HW Bush and her carrier strike group, during Exercise Saxon Warrior earlier this month. F-35B Lightning fighter jets are due to make their first trial flights from the carrier's deck next year with 120 aircrew currently training in the US. HMS Queen Elizabeth sailed into Portsmouth following extensive preparations at the naval base. HMS Queen Elizabeth is still far from being a fully functioning aircraft carrier. But she now looks and feels less of a giant construction project and more like a warship. For the last seven weeks she's been undergoing sea trials. They've tested everything from the propulsion system to the sewage processing plant. The ship's five galleys have been churning out more than 3,000 meals a day for the 700 crew and additional contractors on board. According to the captain, Jerry Kyd, the tests have gone ""really well"" for what he admits is a ""prototype"". But even he suggests that they'll need more manpower when she's fully operational. The slightly larger US Nimitz class carriers have a crew of more than 4,000. HMS Queen Elizabeth's first deployment is still a long way off. Though helicopters have been landing on her massive deck - the size of three football pitches - it will be another year before the new F35s will begin flight trials. And HMS Queen Elizabeth won't be fully operational until 2023. HMS Queen Elizabeth: Everything you need to know.

UK unemployment falls to new 42-year low,"Unemployment in the UK fell by 57,000 in the three months to June,official figures show,external, bringing the jobless rate down to 4.4% - its lowest since 1975. The squeeze on real incomes continues to grow, though at a slower pace. Average weekly earnings increased by 2.1% compared with a year earlier - slightly higher than last month's 2% increase. But withinflation standing at 2.6%, real earnings still fell by 0.5%, the ONS figures showed. At 75.1%, the proportion of people in work is the highest it has been since 1971 - partly due to the introduction of a later state pension age for women. There were 32.07 million people in work in the three months to June - 338,000 more than for the same period last year. ""The employment picture remains strong, with a new record high employment rate and another fall in the unemployment rate. Despite the strong jobs picture, however, real earnings continue to decline,"" said Office for National Statistics senior labour market statistician Matt Hughes. Analysis Andy Verity, economics correspondent Pay rises improved, up by 2.1% (excluding bonuses) compared with a consensus prediction of 2%. Maybe the economic theory was right after all - and pay is now ticking up because labour markets are tight. It remains, however, a long way short of what would be required to trigger the sort of wage-price spiral about which central bankers have been hyper-vigilant since the 1970s. That employees are prepared to accept wages that shrink by a tiny bit less than they did the last time these figures came out does not exactly bespeak a dramatic new assertion of workers' bargaining power. Read more from Andy here Jobs were created in the construction, accommodation and food services sectors and transport and storage industries. Pay rises improved, up by 2.1% (excluding bonuses) compared with a consensus prediction of 2%. The increase prompted some economists to suggest that wages may finally be responding to an economy which is closing in on full employment. It remains, however, a long way short of what would be required to trigger the sort of wage-price spiral about which central bankers have been hyper-vigilant since the 1970s. That employees are prepared to accept wages that shrink by a tiny bit less than they did the last time these figures came out does not exactly bespeak a dramatic new assertion of workers' bargaining power. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics said the figures gave some signs that the tighter labour market was leading to a recovery in wage growth. ""Inflation is likely to fall back next year as the impact of the drop in the pound dwindles. What's more, the tightness of the labour market should deliver further rises in nominal wage growth over the coming quarters,"" she said. The poundroseagainst both the dollar and the euro following the positive news on jobs, recovering some of the ground lost on Tuesday, before losing most of those gains. However, productivity - or output per worker - continued to decline, the ONS said, issuing preliminary figures for the second quarter. Productivity was 0.1% lower than in the first quarter and ""remains at around the same level as its pre-downturn peak"". The number of non-UK nationals employed in the UK workforcecontinued to increase,external, rising 109,000 to 3.56 million compared to a year earlier. Within that non-UK nationals from in the EU continued to rise, while workers from outside the EU decreased by 18,000 from a year ago.

What will Brexit do to this 499km border?," “Kilnasaggart Bridge” was a whispered curse on the lips of train travellers in the days of Northern Ireland’s Troubles. It nudges up close to the border that separates the six counties of Ulster in the United Kingdom from the Republic of Ireland. The bridge was such a popular target for IRA bombers that uninterrupted travel from north to south was often impossible. A groan would go up as the tinny tannoy announced that, because of problems on the line, all passengers would disembark at the Newry halt, travel by bus across the border and then clamber back on the train at Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland. We trundled on, we trundled off. It added at least an hour and more like two to the journey. So much for the “express”. But at least we knew we had crossed the border. Now, commuters sip posh coffee and sail past this once troubled spot, blissfully unaware of where the north ends, and where the Republic of Ireland begins. The border is there, but it is not there and the bombs are history. Drive along the modern motorway that links Belfast to Dublin and the only clue that you have crossed is the subtle switch from signposts in miles to those in kilometres. Keen-eyed, you might spot the change in the markings on the sides of the road. It is a child’s guessing game - north or south, are we there, aren’t we here? About 50 years ago, it was easier. The good roads were in Northern Ireland - you knew you had hit the Republic when the potholes rattled the car. The road signs in the south were more dramatic than the north. They came in sets and block capitals: SLOW; SLOWER; SLOWER STILL. The Killeen border checkpoint near Newry, 1987 This border is 310 miles (499km) long and meanders from Carlingford Lough in the east to Lough Foyle in the west. It was never a neat line. It is a squiggle across the map of Ireland – like an awkward child taking their crayon for a walk. That line divides rivers, slices fields, cuts bridges in two and even, occasionally, divides the odd house. Carlingford Lough marks the easternmost point of the border There are homes where you can have your breakfast in the north and go to sleep in the south. There are places where mobile phone reception in just one house fluctuates between north and south. The days of the Troubles are behind us - days lived in the dark shadow of watchtowers and turrets are vanished. But now the UK is getting ready to leave the EU, and the people of the borderlands are uneasy. Up to 35,000 people commute across the border every day. Hospital patients and schoolchildren and cross-border workers are among those who have to make the daily journey. None of them wants a hard border, but the EU has stressed that there will have to be some form of customs control. What is a “soft” border? Will thousands of people find themselves cursing daily in long queues at border points? The village of Muff lies close to the border between Donegal and County Londonderry. During the Troubles, cars queued at the Army checkpoint, where twitchy young soldiers with rifles rattled out the usual questions. Where are you coming from? Where are you going to? Get out and open your boot, sir. Then it was on down a twist in the road and the Irish customs men were on their marks waiting to catch the locals with the contraband. Now, you’d hardly know you were crossing. A black corrugated hut at the old customs post is boarded up - weeds sprout from the chimney. Over the bridge and you’re into the one-street village. It is tiny but boasts four petrol stations. The Derry-Donegal crossing point at Muff There is what used to be an old Irish ballroom - a big, squat building called Borderland. When Derry city burned in riots and bombings, Borderland was the escape – the dance hall down the road, where you jived your way into another world. Marie Lindsay was born in Muff, but the city of Derry is centre stage in her heart. She lives in the hills just outside the village and has a foot in both camps. Each morning she gets into her car in Donegal, in the Republic, and drives up through a little wood. Then it’s on through a housing estate and into Derry, where she’s principal of a girls' school, St Mary’s College. Marie Lindsay, principal of St Mary's College, Derry She has lived her life along this border. Like thousands of others, she feels she has a double identity. Marie Lindsay in the art room at St Mary's College “I’m Donegal, born and bred. Donegal is in my DNA, but Derry is my home city, I feel I belong there,” she says. Her journey to work is seamless these days – down what was once an “unapproved” road - spiked, so that people could not drive across. As the Troubles in Northern Ireland escalated in the 1970s, the Army and police blocked and cratered the smaller roads to make all but the approved checkpoint routes impassable, and to stop paramilitaries crossing. Lindsay has known a hard border - the interminable waits at checkpoints. They were dark days that no-one really wants to recall. She has now grown used to peace and the ease of life. The spot marking the border is often nearly invisible On the evening drive home from work, she points out the spot where you have crossed. “The road signs switch from miles to kilometres, the road markings change, but that’s it,” she says. She carries two purses – a sterling purse for the north and a euro purse for the south. But both sides take each other’s currency at a decent rate. Many people carry two mobile phones – one north, one south. Talk to any of the girls in St Mary’s, says Lindsay, and you’ll soon find they have roots in Donegal – a granny in Malin, an aunty from Carndonagh. All down the years, city dwellers have taken a Sunday drive from Northern Ireland over the border to feast their eyes on the beauty of Five Fingers Strand, to nurse a pint in Buncrana, to treat the children to a ride on the swing boats by the shore. But the links amount to much more than a Sunday stroll. There are good schools in the city of Derry and the health service is free. Many people in Donegal send their children to school north of the border or are treated by the National Health Service -  some officially, some unofficially. There are pressing questions about students. Many from Northern Ireland travel to university in Dublin, Galway and Cork. Others from the Republic of Ireland cross the border to go to Queen’s in Belfast and to Derry’s Magee College and the North West Regional College. Magee College campus, Derry Lindsay is also concerned for the Donegal students who cross the border to go to the city’s further education college. “They could end up having to make the 40-minute drive to Letterkenny whereas before it was just 10 to 15 minutes into college in Derry.” On 23 June, 76p bought you one euro, but by the second week after the Brexit vote, that figure had shot up to 86p. It would reach a high of 90p last October, before falling back slightly since. For all those living in Donegal and working in Derry, the value of their sterling pay packets has plunged. In recent years, Lindsay’s Donegal village has played host to young families from Northern Ireland, lured by affordable housing. It has been a breath of fresh air – new life for the local primary school, tills ringing in the shops, a bustling community in the border village. But Brexit is making border folk start to think twice. Betty Holmes, Donegal Action for Cancer Care Betty Holmes is a member of Donegal Action for Cancer Care. The group is based in the Republic of Ireland but campaigns to access nearby health facilities in Northern Ireland. She is passionate about getting the best cancer care close at hand. It’s a deeply personal campaign. Her father died of lung cancer a week after her seventh birthday - he had never smoked. Her mother died from breast cancer three years later. When a new state-of-the-art radiotherapy centre opened recently in Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry, there was a sigh of relief from families on both sides of the border. No more two-hour treks over the mountain pass from Derry to Belfast for those living with cancer in Northern Ireland’s western region. No more five-hour treks from Donegal to Galway for cancer patients living in the Republic of Ireland. “It is a good 308km to Galway and what sort of a journey is that when there is radiotherapy sitting a few miles across the border?” asks Holmes. The journey to Altnagelvin Hospital is as little as 45 minutes from the top end of Donegal at Malin Head, she says. The Irish government has invested in the new services in Northern Ireland. The Prince of Wales opened Altnagelvin's new cancer centre earlier this month Agreements in place between the UK and Irish governments mean there are currently places for 385 cancer patients coming across the border. But Brexit weighs heavily on Betty Holmes’s mind. “Our concern is what happens in three to five years when the real effect of Brexit is starting to be felt,” she says. If you are the parent of one of the children from Northern Ireland who would travel to Dublin for paediatric cardiac care, then you might be asking what impact Brexit could have for those children?” “Will the Irish government be in a position to pay what [is set] down as the cost of treating a cancer patient at Altnagelvin? Will that number be reduced from 385 to 200 initially and will it go down from there?” The sharing of medical services across the border is not a one-way street. “If you are the parent of one of the children from Northern Ireland who would travel to Dublin for paediatric cardiac care, then you might be asking what impact Brexit could have for those children?” Ciaran Crilly woke up to the news of Brexit last June  and immediately worried about his business. Just up from Cloughoge church on the Newry border, where the Army posts once cast long shadows on the high hill, is the sweet factory – a family business set up in the 1970s. Ten years before that Ciaran Crilly’s father, Peter, left for a sugary fact-finding mission, taking in the Mars factory in Slough, and then Blackpool to uncover the secret of getting the name through the stick of rock. In the 1970s, as the Troubles raged in Northern Ireland, he came home, put his head down and set up a business. Now his son has the reins. Before Spanish holidays were the norm, the Crillys made seaside rock, selling it from Portrush in Northern Ireland to Bundoran and Bray in the Republic. This was the time when traditional sweets - bags of clove rock, bull’s eyes and brandy balls - still cast their spell. On both sides of the border, they still love their sweets. But Brexit was a blow. “It was terrible. Our business has been going superbly this last 10 years, year-on-year growth, no issues. Then you have this shock and you ask why did it need to happen?” Ciaran Crilly, Crillys Sweets The company was doing 75% of its business with the Republic of Ireland. When the UK exits Europe, if a trade deal isn’t reached, it could potentially face a 30% tariff in line with World Trade Organisation rules. That would be a worst-case scenario, says Crilly, but possible. For a while, Crilly considered upping sticks and moving a few miles down the road to set up in the Republic. Instead, they decided to stay put and look at new markets. In January, Crilly’s Sweets had a stand at a trade show in Germany and picked up business in Australia and China. They have been inundated with requests. Every emigrant craves the comforting taste of home. “We gained a lot of business through expats in Australia. People miss the kola cubes, pear drops, clove rock, mixed balls and even the jelly babies and wine gums,” he says. And, given the response from across the globe, perhaps Brexit could prove a blessing. But it’s an anxious time. “Half of our staff are from EU countries, such as Latvia and Poland. Will they stay?” Crilly doesn’t know. Drive on for an hour along the border and it’s sheep day at Enniskillen mart. The yard is a long line of muddy Land Rovers hauling trailers full of sheep and ewes. Men in flat caps, jeans and wellington boots meander about. Denzil Brady is 84 but wiry and keen-eyed. In all his years working on his father's farm in the hills around Enniskillen, he has had little time for the European Union. Denzil Brady “They're the greatest set of rogues in Brussels,” he says. “They have farms nearly out of business with the whole pile of paperwork. “With all those regulations, I fear for the young farmers in their 40s and how they'll suffer lives of misery.” Hugh Maguire has a different view. He has farmed for more than 50 years up by the famous Marble Arch Caves. His land straddles the border and he's had his share of headaches. He has cows and sheep, but some of them belong to the north and some belong to the Republic. It makes for two sets of paperwork and a few headaches. Woe betide the Irish sheep that sets a hoof over the border and vice versa. But Maguire believes the EU did a lot of good and Brexit is not welcome. He remembers the old days of smuggling across the border. He remembers the hard border, the checkpoints and queues and he just asks himself what lies ahead now. It could be a big step backwards, he says. “Farmers cannot farm without the European single farm payment,” he says. This is the agricultural subsidy payment, based on the area of a farmer's land, to offset the cost of producing food. James Johnston is the mart director - it's a family business that goes back to his grandfather's day. He's a young man and he admits that, personally, he is no fan of Europe. At its heart, [the EU]'s quite an undemocratic system. So I can understand reasons for pulling out.” “The EC originally was very good in terms of promoting free trade and promoting peace and security within Europe. “But I do think it has overstepped the mark as it has grown. Legislation-wise, it has just mushroomed. At its heart, it's quite an undemocratic system. So I can understand reasons for pulling out,”  he says. “However, where we are, here in this part of Ireland, in Fermanagh, we border with four of the southern counties, an open border is absolutely critical to peace and general well-being on both sides - free movement of people and goods.” Johnston argues that it must be maintained, however Brexit pans out. He'd like a more open border with the Republic of Ireland even than exists now. “It's exceptionally difficult, virtually impossible to bring livestock across the border, sell them in this mart and for traders to buy them and bring them home again. “It's easier for us to send cattle from the mart here to England and Scotland after a sale than to send them 10 or 12 miles down the road a stone's throw away across the southern border.” The problem lies with animal health and biosecurity, he says. Different policies exist on each side of the border. And now there will be more change. For farmers, the best-case scenario would be a post-Brexit free trade agreement, says Phelim O'Neill, a markets specialist for the Irish Farmers Journal. The worst-case scenario would see a very heavy tariff on agriculture products traded between the UK and the EU. “In terms of where will hit hard for Northern Ireland, somewhere between a quarter and a third of milk produced in Northern Ireland dairy farms goes to Ireland for processing,” he says. “So if you are one of those farmers, your milk will be hit with a very high tariff – it would not be viable to send it. “It is the same for sheep. About 400,000 sheep each year go from NI to factories in Ireland for processing. If the WTO tariffs apply, then it simply would not be viable.” Colm McKenna People who own petrol stations along the border know all about boom and bust - trade depends on currency fluctuations and significantly lower fuel duty rates in the Republic of Ireland. Enda McColgan, manager of the Texaco in Muff, says 90% of the garage’s customers come from Northern Ireland to top up. Business is booming. There was one stage when demand was so great they even had to employ somebody to manage the traffic on the road outside. Enda McColgan: Business is booming Garage owner Colm McKenna remembers bombings, the checkpoints and the days of soldiers in ditches. “If we had a hard border then we’d be going back 30 years in six weeks to six months,” he says. It’s not hard to imagine who might target such a border, he points out. Some have warned that a hard border could be used as a justification for violence by dissident republicans who do not support the current peace agreements in Northern Ireland. Kevin Melarkey Not far away, at another crossing, Kevin Melarkey is the egg man on the border at Bridgend near Derry. He's there at the farm shop seven days a week - in a small hut - selling eggs and bags of spuds. He has a good thick coat and a pair of mountain boots to keep out the cold. When he gets a minute, he can stand outside his hut and rest his eyes on the blue hills of Donegal. He's too young to remember much more than the queues at the checkpoints on a Sunday when half of the city decamped across the border to Buncrana or to buy cheap petrol. Like everyone else, he does not know what Brexit will bring. “We're in limbo, it's just a waiting game,” he sighs. Brexit and border changes will be more significant for Northern Ireland, says Katie Daughen, head of Brexit Research and Support Services to the British/Irish Chamber of Commerce. Every year 31% of NI exports are to the Republic and 27% of its imports come from there. The main sector to be affected is food and agriculture. “It’s worth over £4.5bn to the economy in the north and it’s by far the most exposed.” Katie Daughen: Changes will be more significant north of the border Daughen lists a couple of examples of the all-island nature of the economy: • Wheat grown in the south is processed in north•    40% of chicken produced in the south is processed in the north One of Ireland’s most famous exports faces similar problems. Guinness is brewed in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland. But it’s sent north of the border to be bottled or canned before returning to Dublin for export to the world. But it is not all doom and gloom.  There are opportunities out there too. The border’s disappearance was a gradual shift - like ice melting. After the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, things moved slowly. But the dragon’s teeth  - ugly concrete blocks squatting on hundreds of country roads linking north and south -  were suddenly yanked. The soldiers in their camouflage passed out of view. In 2003, they took away the checkpoint at Newry. They pulled down the ugly iron cage, the military turret high on the hill above the church at Cloughoge. The tower above Cloughoge The people who felt safer for the presence of the Army on the hilltop called it a watchtower. Those who resented the Army, and their high power cameras, preferred “spy post”. It was close to that Newry border where Lord Justice Gibson and his wife Cecily were killed by an IRA bomb in 1987. 1987: Wreckage from the explosion which killed Lord Justice Gibson and his wife A year later, Robin and Maureen Hanna and their son, David, six, died in an IRA explosion after crossing the border. The family from Hillsborough in the north were returning from holiday when their vehicle was mistaken for one belonging to a senior judge. The big military turret went up on the hill after that. It was a stretch of road that became a no-man’s land between north and south. It was not a place for a friendly chat - there was tension in the air, the soldiers were edgy. Crossings were never easy. Many resented the waiting and the questioning. People were afraid they might get caught up, a sitting target for a bomber. Or scared that a soldier might even get trigger happy. But there was another side to the old border too. The game of “catch me if you can” with the customs officers still raises a smile. A customs post on the Belfast-Dublin road in the 1950s Butter was cheaper  on one side – hide it in the pram and sit the child on top. It was all the sweeter for being illicit. Young couples from the north took the train to Dublin to buy the wedding ring. There are tales of dangling the ring out of the train window on a thread on the way home to evade the keen eye of the customs man. In Fermanagh, drive down past the town of Enniskillen and on to the border towns of Belcoo and Blacklion and you see how past and present merge. The stone bridge marks the crossing point between north and south. The bus stop in Belcoo has two sets of signs – a blue and white sign for the Ulsterbus and a green one with a greyhound for Bus Éireann. The street signs are in both English and Irish. Harold Johnston has an old-fashioned shop just over the bridge in Blacklion. His grandmother opened it in 1901. “She was a trained seamstress and had five dressmakers upstairs at one time. She used to do wedding dresses and red flannel petticoats.” A century later, her grandson presides over an Aladdin’s cave. It is a drapery and a clothes shop and a wool shop and whatever you like. The shoe boxes are piled high, there are rolls of oilskin tablecloth propped up. From the door, Johnston can look left to where the customs post and Irish gardaí once stood, checking the cars coming south. “There were 43 guards and six sergeants at that border,” he says. “We had 24-hour cover and two shifts. We had patrol cars patrolling the back roads. “They were stationed in the barracks on the left.  The young lads were sent up from Dublin for training along the border.” In the 1930s, the Depression hit hard but on 3 September 1939 trade exploded on his side of the bridge when war was declared. “They were putting restrictions in the north and it was scarcity this and scarcity that. But we had lots of butter and sugar.” Harold Johnston Smuggling was rife. Johnston tells a story about the undertaker in Blacklion in the Republic who was running short on shrouds, but had a friend across the border in Belcoo who knew another man that could get him some. The problem was getting them over the bridge from north to south. “Yer man came into the bar in Blacklion and said the parcel had arrived and he had it with him,” Johnston says. “So he went into the kitchen and he had on a coat three times too big and he opened it and he had put all the shrouds on himself and walked over the border like that. “As he took the shrouds off in the kitchen at the back, yer man looked at him and said: ‘It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a man taking a shroud off’.” During the Troubles, there were just 20 official border crossings between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The British Army shut down, spiked or cratered the rest. With peace, the country relaxed, breathed a sigh of relief, and unspiked the roads. Trade and business became more fluid – it blossomed. Businesses in Northern Ireland set up offices in the Republic and vice versa. Seamus Leheny from the Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association knows the pain of those whose businesses may be disrupted by Brexit. An Irish revenue commissioner has said up to 8% of freight crossing the border might be subject to checks after Brexit. With a minimum of 6,000 lorries trundling over the border every day, you begin to see the scale of the problem. “That makes at least 500 lorries that could be checked every day,"" says Leheny. ""Added to that is the thought that drivers selected for checking might have to drive away from the main flow of traffic to a specific post – and distance costs money. Even if there are to be checks it doesn't necessarily follow that there will be a string of traditional border posts with long queues of lorries. The head of the Irish tax authorities has said he is ""practically 100% certain"" there will be no new customs posts along the border after Brexit. Niall Cody said businesses, however, must assume there will be “some form of customs” post-Brexit - it might be that people would be allowed to make declarations online. Ongoing analysis of cross-border trade increasingly shows that most goods transported between the jurisdictions will not need to be physically checked, Cody suggested. Still, there are those who might be less than scrupulous and could take advantage by shipping goods into Belfast and straight into the EU via Dublin – without paying the tariffs. Then, think about the large retailers who treat the island of Ireland as an entity – one market. They get the goods to Belfast, use distribution centres to sort and store, and send them on by lorry on to Galway, Cork and Dublin. “They may ship directly rather than go through a whole bureaucratic process. Jobs could be lost in Northern Ireland,” Leheny says. Eamon O'Farrell, a former customs officer in Donegal who spent 30 years patrolling the border, says the Irish authorities are “ill equipped” to deal with border checks. It's not the main roads, it's the hundreds of unapproved roads. “I cannot figure out how they're going to do this with the resources that I understand they have,” he says. “You wouldn't get 12 people across the whole border who know where the actual border is. We're talking about the revenue risk, tax evasion, various types of smuggling - goods and people.” On the ground, people are thinking ahead. There are cross-border meetings and countless committees working out the logistics of a border that is longer than the length of the island of Ireland. At government level, civil servants in London are getting their heads around the conundrum of Northern Ireland. One thing that looks likely to continue is the Common Travel Area (CTA), the bilateral UK-Ireland agreement that allows for free movement of UK and Irish citizens between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The arrangement allows Irish and UK citizens the right to work, to access public services and to vote in certain elections, and Brexit Secretary David Davis has described the continuation of the CTA as ""non-negotiable"". Jane Morrice, former head of the European Commission office in Northern Ireland, helped broker the Good Friday Agreement during her time as a politician. She wants to maintain the status quo on the island of Ireland. She is proposing that Northern Ireland should have honorary membership of the EU after the UK's departure. “We've made such good progress since the Good Friday Agreement. Removing the border and removing borders in mind as well as geographically has been hugely successful and we cannot allow ourselves to halt that or reverse it in any way,” she says. “The role played by the EU in the peace process was instrumental.” Border dwellers are hardy as the weeds and thistles sprouting from the old huts at the customs posts. They have come through partition and war and the Troubles. Harold Johnston tells the story of a villager in the 1920s who travelled up the road to Enniskillen in Northern Ireland for his groceries every week. Partition hit home on the very day of his weekly shop. On his return journey, a fresh new customs hut had sprung up at the border and a man in a starched uniform was waiting for him. “You can’t bring those goods into the Free State,” said the customs man. “But I always have,” said the man. “Well, you can’t now,” said the new officer. The man turned back for a sit and a think in nearby Belcoo, Northern Ireland. What did he do? Johnston pauses and smiles. “He sat and waited for the customs officer to shut up shop for the night and sure didn’t he just walk over the border.” There is always a way. Built with Shorthand"
Birmingham bin strike called off,"This video can not be played Birmingham's refuse workers vow to clear rubbish backlog A long-running bin strike in Birmingham has been called off. Conciliation service Acas said the action had been suspended amid negotiations between Unite and the city council to bring the seven-week dispute to an end. The city council agreed certain posts would not be made redundant and Acas said bin collections could now resume. Union officials said in return they would recommend staff considered accepting rota changes. More from Birmingham and the Black Country Why did the workers go on strike? Refuse workers have been striking since 30 June, leading to a backlog of bin collections A statement said the council and Unite had made sufficient progress in their talks to allow the industrial action to be paused. The statement said both parties would continue to discuss how the bin collection service could be improved and what savings could be made. It also said Unite had also agreed in principle to recommend its members accept work pattern changes, including considering a five-day working week instead of the current four days. Residents in Northfield Road, Harborne, celebrated their rubbish bags' ""50th birthday"" earlier this week to mark 50 days since their rubbish was last collected Unite said it had achieved victory in the bin dispute. It said the council had accepted the refuse workers' case and restored the jobs of grade three workers, who are responsible for safety at the back of refuse vehicles. The city sighs with relief as the dispute ends, but there have been casualties. The biggest is on Birmingham City Council's side. It appears to have given up a central part of the plan to modernise its waste service - the scrapping of grade three refuse workers on bin wagons. They were being offered jobs elsewhere but unions said it amounted to potential pay cuts of up to Â£5,000. The council said that was untrue and had seemed firm on the idea that to achieve the efficiencies needed, grade threes had to go. Unite has hailed it a victory, saying the council has accepted its point of view. It has however made a smaller concession on its own part that it will ""consider"" a five day working week rather than the current four. Council leader John Clancy appears to have been pivotal in this relatively swift development following seven weeks of stalemate, with the union saying he has ""worked very hard and travelled the extra mile to achieve this solution, despite the reservations of some top council officials"". Assistant general secretary Howard Beckett said: ""We are very pleased that we have reached the stage where we can suspend the industrial action while we hold further talks about the future of the refuse service. Waste spilling from bin bags in Avon Street, Sparkhill ""I know this news will be greatly welcomed by the people of Birmingham as they look forward to their bins being collected again on a regular and seamless basis. I would like to thank them for their understanding over recent weeks."" The strike action, which consisted of two or three-hour stoppages during a daily shift, had been set to last until 21 September - with talk of it possibly lasting until Christmas. The amount of rubbish left in some streets led to residents taking action to clear up the waste themselves. A Birmingham City Council spokeswoman said there was still a backlog of uncollected waste because of the strike and it was therefore still in a contingency phase. She said the council would resume regular collections as soon as it was able to. In a statement, the council said the Acas statement did not represent the council's official position as the matter still had to be considered by cabinet members at a special meeting on 24 August. Volunteers the Bearded Broz faced criticism for cleaning up the streets themselves Volunteersthe Bearded Broz cleaned up 45 tonnes of wastein the Yardley area, leading them to be called scabs by the Morning Star newspaper.

'New solution' for Irish border post Brexit,"The future management of the Irish border is one of three main priorities in UK-EU Brexit talks The government has said there must be an ""unprecedented solution"" for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit. Apaper detailing its proposals,externalfocuses on the need to avoid a hard border. The government stresses there should be no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts, at the border,which has almost 300 crossing points. Critics say the proposals lack credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as ""a fantasy frontier"". The government's paper does not envisage CCTV cameras or number plate recognition technology at the border, or set back from it. Reaction to UK's Brexit paper on Ireland Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? Analysis: No cross-border tariffs for small firms Reality Check: Ireland's border and Brexit Instead, the government is arguing for a wide-ranging exemption under which small and medium-sized businesses will not have to comply with any new customs tariffs. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that will share a land border with an EU state post-Brexit. This video can not be played Farming on the border The future management of that border is a highly sensitive issue and is one of three main priorities in UK-EU Brexit negotiations. Northern Ireland Office officials say 80% of firms in Northern Ireland are small or medium sized and engaged in local business rather than international trade. If the proposals are accepted, customs officials envisage using a mix of technology and physical checks to monitor the compliance of bigger businesses engaged in international trade. Such firms might be required to declare their import and export businesses online. This video can not be played Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire insists to Today the proposals are realistic The government has repeated its desire to maintain the Common Travel Area and the rights of UK and Irish citizens, and to uphold the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, of which the UK is a co-guarantor. Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to reassure nationalists living in Northern Ireland. ""No one voted to end the special ties between the UK and Ireland, or to undermine the unique arrangements between Ireland and Northern Ireland which have underpinned the peace process and have been in place well before our membership of the EU,""  she said. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said he broadly agreed with the position paper's ""aspirational"" principles. ""They reflect a lot of the language that the Irish government has been using, actually, in terms of maintaining the status quo, frictionless borders,"" he said. Adam Fleming, BBC Brussels Reporter The European Commission responded to the publication of the UK paper by saying there had to be a political deal to protect the Good Friday Agreement before a discussion could begin on technical measures. The paper is full of language and examples designed to soothe the EU about its worries. Michel Barnier said the Good Friday Agreement must be guaranteed. The UK said it would be. The Common Travel Area, which allows free movement between the UK and Ireland, is enshrined in an EU Treaty and letting it continue wouldn't be illegal under European Law. One British official said privately that if no agreement is reached, EU rules would compel the Irish government to introduce the hard border it does not want. Labour's spokesman on Northern Ireland, Stephen Pound, said an ID card system would have to be introduced to manage immigration after Brexit. ""The idea of having a CGI, virtual reality border is nonsense, it's just a pipe dream but the second thing is it's about goods, it's not about people,"" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he had discussed the issue at length with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier during a meeting in Brussels, in which he said there must be no hard border. ""I hope there can now be negotiations to make sure there is a continuation of absolute free movement between the Republic and Northern Ireland,"" he said. Critics argue the re-introduction of the hard border would severely damage the Northern Ireland peace process and have a negative economic impact. A European Commission spokeswoman said: ""We must discuss how to maintain the Common Travel Area and protect, in all of its dimensions, the Good Friday Agreement. ""It is essential that we have a political discussion on this before looking at technical solutions."" The position paper forms part of the government's negotiations with the European Union, ahead of the UK leaving the EU in March 2019. As revealed on Tuesday, Brexit SecretaryDavid Davis wants a limited transition periodto implement any new customs arrangements, including considerations relating to the ""unique circumstances"" of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The government ruled out suggestions of concentrating border checks at Irish Sea crossings Both the UK and Irish governments have repeatedly stated their opposition to a hard border, but the situation is complicated as the UK intends to leave the EU's customs union. The position paper sets out two ""broad approaches"" to future customs arrangements that the UK hopes will help to prevent physical customs posts along the Irish border. The suggestions are a ""new customs partnership"" or a ""highly streamlined customs arrangement"". The partnership model would ""align"" customs approaches between the UK and the EU, resulting in ""no customs border at allbetween the UK and Ireland,"" the paper claims. This video can not be played One road crosses the border four times in 10 minutes, but can you spot where the crossings are? The paper suggests the second, ""highly-streamlined"" arrangement could include: A continued waiver on submitting entry/exit declarations Continued membership of the Common Transit Convention to help Northern Ireland and Irish companies transit goods A new ""trusted trader"" arrangement for larger businesses A ""cross-border trade exemption"" which would mean no new customs processes at all for smaller traders The paper also dismisses the idea of a customs border in the Irish Sea, saying it would be economically and constitutionally unviable. It recognises that all this needs to be negotiated with the EU, in the hope that the border between the EU and the UK will be as ""seamless"" as possible. The government has repeatedly said it does not want to go back to the borders of the past Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said he did not accept that the EU would be unwilling to facilitate the government's proposals. ""If you look at what [EU chief negotiator] Michel Barnier has said... there is a recognition that there will need to be specific arrangements in relation to customs and other elements in terms of creating that frictionless border,"" he said.

""It is clear the government has listened to voices in Belfast, Dublin, Brussels and London about how the United Kingdom's only EU land border could be managed after we exit the EU,"" said Mrs Foster, NI's former first minister. However, Sinn FÃ©in northern leader Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland was ""a fleeting concern for the British government, we are collateral damage"". ""What we need to see is the Irish government acting in the national interest and defending the rights of those people here in the north that voted to stay with the European Union,"" she said. Earlier this year, residents from border communities held a protest at Stormont Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), said the government seemed to be ""effectively playing for more time"". Countries in the customs union do not impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods. Every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad. So, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee. Other goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs. The UK has said it is leaving the EU's customs union because as a member it is unable to strike trade deals with other countries.

Trump again blames violence on both sides,"This video can not be played ""What about the 'alt-left',"" Trump asked US President Donald Trump has again blamed both sides for the violent unrest in Charlottesville, Virginia, which left one protester dead and others injured. In a statement on Monday, he had condemned white supremacists. But in New York on Tuesday he also blamed left-wing supporters for charging at the ""alt-right"". His latest comments drew swift criticism, including from many in his Republican party. Many echoed Senator John McCain'sview,external: ""There is no moral equivalency between racists & Americans standing up to defy hate & bigotry"". Charlottesville victim was 'a strong woman' Antifa: Left-wing militants on the rise BBC reporter at the scene in Charlottesville The right-wing march had been organised to protest against the proposed removal of a statue of General Robert E Lee, who commanded the pro-slavery Confederate forces during the American Civil War. The event drew white supremacy groups. Violence broke out after they were confronted by anti-racism groups. A car ploughed into one group of anti-racism protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others. Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter On Monday, Donald Trump's condemnation of the far-right came from advisers counselling him on what was politically necessary to defuse the growing storm following the Charlottesville violence. On Tuesday, the president said what he really thought. Although he initially explained away the delay in condemnations of white supremacists as necessary for him to gather ""the facts"" of the situation, the nature of the protests were quite evident by the evening before, when demonstrators chanting white supremacist slogans held a torchlight parade through Charlottesville. In any regard, Mr Trump has shown little reluctance in jumping to conclusions about violent incidents when it appears Islamic extremism is at play. Upon further questioning, it became clear that the president views the Charlottesville unrest as far from a one-sided affair. Mixed in among the white supremacists, he said, were some good, peaceful people protesting the removal of a statue (of a man who led an army against the US government). And there were plenty of violent individuals among the counter-protesters as well. When the president on Saturday said there were ""many sides"" to blame, he meant it. If Donald Trump's initial handling of the fallout from Charlottesville started a political fire, on Tuesday the president poured on a bucket of kerosene and danced around the flames. Speakingat the White House on Monday, the US president had said that the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists were ""repugnant"" to everything Americans held dear. But at a bad-tempered press conference at Trump Tower on Tuesday, he reverted to blaming ""many sides"" for Saturday's violence. ""You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now,"" he said. ""What about the alt-left that came charging... at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? (...) There are two sides to a story.""

He also praised Ms Heyer's mother, Susan Bro, who had thanked him after his earlier statement for his ""words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred"".

Thousands drive with 12 or more points,"Usually 12 points means a ban, but magistrates can choose not to impose it in exceptional cases. More than 10,000 motorists are allowed on the roads despite having 12 or more penalty points on their licence. Analysis by BBC News shows motorists in the north of England had the most licences with a dozen or more points. Road safety charities said allowing people with lots of points to stay on the road made a mockery of the system. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency said the figure included people who had served a ban and had successfully reapplied for their licence. Drivers are usually banned if they get 12 penalty points within three years, but magistrates can choose not to enforce it in ""exceptional cases"". The data, covering Great Britain as of the end of June 2017, also showed: The category with the greatest rate of offending was men aged between 25 and 34. Men were more likely to have clocked up penalty points than women. About 33 out of every 100,000 male drivers have 12 or more points, compared with under 8 per 100,000 female drivers. The most points on a valid licence belong to a 44-year-old woman in Oxfordshire. The licence has 51 penalty points. Almost 100 motorists were still allowed to drive despite having at least 24 points on their licences, twice the number that results in a ban if accrued within three years. Jason Wakeford, the director of campaigns for Brake, the road safety charity, said: ""Allowing dangerous drivers to stay on the road makes a total mockery of the points system. ""These are irresponsible individuals who have shown disregard for the law and the lives of other road users, time after time. People who clock up over 12 points should face an automatic ban - there needs to be a clear message that dangerous driving will not be tolerated."" For more stories from the BBC England data unit visit our Pinterest board,external Matt Hannon died racing his friend Ann Hannon's son Matt was 22 when he died.  He had been racing his best friend Steve Hayhurst, who was 23 at the time and admitted causing death by dangerous driving. Matt's family pleaded with the judge to spare him a prison sentence. Mrs Hannon, of Blackburn, said driving bans needed to be longer in order to make people think about the consequences of bad driving. ""Six months is not enough,"" she said. ""People use their cars for getting to work and going out. They can get by for six months. A year would make more of a difference. ""Speeding is still a big problem, but there's more focus on mobile phones as well. You see people on their phones at the wheel."" Mrs Hannon, of Blackburn, has worked with theWasted Lives campaign,externalin Lancashire to educate young drivers about risks on the road. The data includes drivers who have served a driving ban and successfully re-applied for their licence. It does not include people who were currently banned as of the end of June. The area with the highest proportion of drivers with a dozen or more points was Blackburn with Darwen.  Sixty-seven drivers there had a dozen or more points in June 2017, which is equivalent to almost 60 out of of every 100,000 motorists. Bans are six months for 12 or more penalty points accrued within three years. Most points remain valid for three years from conviction, but stay on licences for four years, which is why so many drivers have a high number of points but are allowed to be on the roads. The number of points put on a licence varies depending on the offence. Exceeding the speed limit can lead to three to six points as can using a mobile phone at the wheel. Someone who drives above the legal alcohol limit would get 10 points. Up to 11 points can be put on a licence for drug driving and these stay on licences for up to 11 years. Source: Gov.uk,external The Ministry of Justice said decisions on sentencing were a matter for the courts, taking into account the ""full facts"" of the case. A spokeswoman said: ""Drivers who kill ruin lives and must face the full force of the law. While we can never compensate for the loss of a loved one, we are clear that the punishment must fit the crime. ""Last year, the government issued a consultation that will see the maximum sentence in this area increase from 14 years to life. We are now considering the consultation responses. Any announcement will be made in due course."" Tim Williamson, a criminal and regulatory lawyer, said magistrates considered each case ""very carefully"". He said: ""There must be an opportunity for courts to scrutinise each case on its merits and consider how this automatic punishment would actually affect people and their families - and this opportunity does exist within the legal framework. ""If the magistrates accept that on a balance of probabilities having heard evidence on oath from a motorist that they, or other people, would suffer 'exceptional hardship' then they have discretion to disqualify for fewer than six months or not to disqualify the motorist at all. ""So any motorist with 12 or more penalty points will have been to court and will have been required to explain in detail the implications of a driving ban - providing documentary evidence where possible.""

'Frankenstein dinosaur' mystery solved,"About the size of a large dog: Chilesaurus was unearthed in South America Scientists have solved the puzzle of the so-called ""Frankenstein dinosaur"", which seems to consist of body parts from unrelated species. A new study suggests that it is in fact the missing link between plant-eating dinosaurs, such asStegosaurus, and carnivorous dinosaurs, likeT. rex. The finding provides fresh insight on the evolution of the group of dinos known as the ornithischians. The study is published in theRoyal Society journal Biology Letters,external. This video can not be played Cambridge University's Matt Baron tells Today that the new dinosaur fills a family tree gap Matthew Baron, a PhD student at Cambridge University, told BBC News that his assessment indicated that the Frankenstein dinosaur was one of the very first ornithischians, a group that included familiar beasts such as the hornedTriceratops, andStegosauruswhich sported an array of bony plates along its back. ""We had absolutely no idea how the ornithischian body plan started to develop because they look so different to all the other dinosaurs. They have so many unusual features,"" the Cambridge scientist said. ""In the 130 years since the ornithischian group was first recognised, we have never had any concept of how the first ones could have looked until now."" Chilesaurus lived at the end of the Jurassic Period, approximately 145 million years ago The Frankenstein dinosaur, more properly calledChilesaurus, puzzled experts when it was first discovered two years ago. It had the legs of an animal like a Brontosaurus, the hips of a Stegosaurus, and the arms and body of an animal likeTyrannosaurus rex. Scientists simply did not know where it fitted in the dino family tree. In the currently accepted family tree, the ornithischian group was always thought to be completely unrelated to all of the other dinosaurs. Palaeontologists regarded these creatures as an odd-ball group.But a reassessment by Mr Baron published in Marchin the journalNature,externalindicated that ornithischians were more closely related to the meat-eaters, such asT.rex, than previously thought. And it is in re-configuring the dinosaur family tree that Mr Baron transforms the Frankenstein dinosaur from an enigma into a missing link. ""Now that we think ornithischians and meat-eating dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus are related,Chilesaurusslots exactly in between the two groups. It is a perfect half-and-half mix. So, suddenly in the new tree it makes a whole lot of sense."" The alternative version of the dinosaur family tree, now called the ""Baron tree"", is more than just a rearrangement, however. It sheds new light on how different groups of dinosaurs split from one another and evolved along different paths, adds co-author Prof Paul Barrett from London's Natural History Museum. ""Chilesaurusis there at the beginning of one of these big splits and hopefully by understanding more about its biology it will tell us what the driving factors might have been."" The horned Triceratops is a classic example of an ornithischian Prof Barrett and Mr Baron both believe that their re-configured tree could well replace the current dinosaur family tree which has stood the test of time for more than 130 years. The Baron tree is controversial and has its critics. But if it provides further instances where it can smooth the relationships between different dinosaur groups then its supporters will grow. Mr Baron thinks the rescuing ofChilesaurusfrom its Frankenstein status could be just the first of a series reappraisals. ""We've landed a good punch against the counter argument here. This is a very good step towards my main objective which is to try to really nail down the ornithischian lineage because I think we've been completely misunderstanding and ignoring this very important group for far too long. ""Eventually, we'll arrive at a consensus. I think this is a step toward the right model."" Prof Sarah Gabbott, from Leicester University, was not involved in the study. She described the new analysis as ""incredibly important"" ""This is one of those rare fossil discoveries that provides much more evidence to unravel dinosaur relationships than your average skeleton,"" she said. ""This is becauseChilesauruspreserves an unusual suite of characteristics that are a mix between between the ornithischians and theropods. In particular, its melange of features helps to reveal the sequence of events during the critical early stages of ornithischian evolution.""

UK unemployment stays at 42-year low,"Unemployment in the UK fell by 57,000 in the three months to June,official figures show,external, bringing the jobless rate down to 4.4% - its lowest since 1975. The squeeze on real incomes continues to grow, though at a slower pace. Average weekly earnings increased by 2.1% compared with a year earlier - slightly higher than last month's 2% increase. But withinflation standing at 2.6%, real earnings still fell by 0.5%, the ONS figures showed. At 75.1%, the proportion of people in work is the highest it has been since 1971 - partly due to the introduction of a later state pension age for women. There were 32.07 million people in work in the three months to June - 338,000 more than for the same period last year. ""The employment picture remains strong, with a new record high employment rate and another fall in the unemployment rate. Despite the strong jobs picture, however, real earnings continue to decline,"" said Office for National Statistics senior labour market statistician Matt Hughes. Analysis Andy Verity, economics correspondent Pay rises improved, up by 2.1% (excluding bonuses) compared with a consensus prediction of 2%. Maybe the economic theory was right after all - and pay is now ticking up because labour markets are tight. It remains, however, a long way short of what would be required to trigger the sort of wage-price spiral about which central bankers have been hyper-vigilant since the 1970s. That employees are prepared to accept wages that shrink by a tiny bit less than they did the last time these figures came out does not exactly bespeak a dramatic new assertion of workers' bargaining power. Read more from Andy here Jobs were created in the construction, accommodation and food services sectors and transport and storage industries. Pay rises improved, up by 2.1% (excluding bonuses) compared with a consensus prediction of 2%. The increase prompted some economists to suggest that wages may finally be responding to an economy which is closing in on full employment. It remains, however, a long way short of what would be required to trigger the sort of wage-price spiral about which central bankers have been hyper-vigilant since the 1970s. That employees are prepared to accept wages that shrink by a tiny bit less than they did the last time these figures came out does not exactly bespeak a dramatic new assertion of workers' bargaining power. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics said the figures gave some signs that the tighter labour market was leading to a recovery in wage growth. ""Inflation is likely to fall back next year as the impact of the drop in the pound dwindles. What's more, the tightness of the labour market should deliver further rises in nominal wage growth over the coming quarters,"" she said. The poundroseagainst both the dollar and the euro following the positive news on jobs, recovering some of the ground lost on Tuesday, before losing most of those gains. However, productivity - or output per worker - continued to decline, the ONS said, issuing preliminary figures for the second quarter. Productivity was 0.1% lower than in the first quarter and ""remains at around the same level as its pre-downturn peak"". The number of non-UK nationals employed in the UK workforcecontinued to increase,external, rising 109,000 to 3.56 million compared to a year earlier.

Trump fans speculation on Steve Bannon's future,"""We'll see"" - with two words President Donald Trump has shovelled grist into Washington DC's rumour mill, which is filled with chatter that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is a marked man. The so-called Trump whisperer has proved himself one of the administration's great survivors - so far. Steve Bannon, the chief White House strategist, is Death warmed up. By that I mean the characterisation of him by the US comedy circuit - literally as ""Death"" - is in stark contrast to the persona he projects when you meet him privately. He's full of surprises, and he has an infectious laugh. I've spoken with him on a number of occasions over the past few months. We've chatted about Nigel Farage, who led the Brexit campaign in the UK, and a variety of other topics: he doesn't drink, as I learned. He likes English tea (""a cuppa,"" he says). Still, he has a wicked reputation - and has frequently been cast as a malevolent force in the West Wing by those outside of the administration and by insiders, too. The anti-Bannon contingent includes Rupert Murdoch, the Fox News founder who's repeatedly lobbied the president,according to the New York Times,external, for the strategist to be sacked. At a news conference in New York on Tuesday, President Trump was asked whether he had confidence in Mr Bannon. And his tepid answer can't have been very reassuring to the White House chief strategist. ""I like him,"" said the president. ""He's a good man, he's not a racist, I can tell you that. ""He's a good person. He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard. ""But we'll see what happens with Mr Bannon."" Other White House officials are watching as closely as everyone else. One of the president's aides has previously told me in a despairing tone that Mr Bannon supported the ""deconstruction of the administrative state"". The aide looked at me as if to say: how do you work with someone like that? Mr Bannon pushed hard for the dismantling of the system and the trashing of the elites. He argued that this unconventional approach was the best way to improve economic conditions and employment prospects for ordinary working people in the US, the voters who helped propel Mr Trump into the White House. Mr Bannon sees the world in stark terms. He has been a strong proponent of the America First agenda, along with stricter border and immigration policies. The power structure at the White House has been constantly changing, but Mr Bannon was a key player in the administration from the beginning and has influenced the president on these policies in a significant manner. White House TVs drown out shouting Decoding the Trump 'war room' photograph Who is Donald Trump's chief strategist? Mr Bannon has apparently been at odds with so-called moderates in the administration, a group that includes the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser, and Gary Cohn, the director of the national economic council, both of whom want to take a more measured approach to changing the government. In contrast, Mr Bannon has pushed for upheaval. He kept a whiteboard in his West Wing office, coveredin scribbled-out goals,externalsuch as ""Suspend immigration from terror prone regions"". He was known for the way that he trashed the press,telling reporters they had been ""humiliated"",externalby the Democratic defeat in the autumn, and he encouraged the president to demonise the media. He's also been accused of encouraging or at least tolerating racist, nationalist views among those who make up the president's base of support. Mr Bannon's ideological leanings are nothing new. He supported radical political reform while he was the head of Breitbart News,a website he described as,externala ""platform for the alt-right"", a movement that included the Ku Klux Klan and other white nationalist groups. He pushed for the same agenda while he was working on Mr Trump's presidential campaign. Mr Bannon has millions of admirers, people who see the world in the way he does and also want to wreak havoc on the Washington establishment. One of the most important ones is Rebekah Mercer. The daughter of a New York investor, Robert Mercer, she has known Mr Bannon for years and helped to fund his enterprises. Robert Mercer, as the New Yorker's Jane Mayerhas documented,external, is an enigmatic libertarian and a key force behind Mr Trump's victory. Mr Bannon revelled in the populist uprising of Mr Trump and continued to stir things up after he won. At a rally for the president in Melbourne, Florida, in February, Mr Bannon looked on the crowd with a smile. He is polite (he's from the South) and charismatic, and White House aides have invariably tended to gravitate towards him. Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff, used to bound up to Mr Bannon in a crowd, as if he were afraid he might miss something. A bear of a man, Mr Bannon looked rumpled when he travelled with the president, and he'd often smooth down his hair with his hand, trying to make himself more presentable. Still his hair always looked messy. Once we were supposed to meet in the West Wing at night. It was after 10pm on a Friday, and I waited outside the building. The place was quiet, and the lights from the building cast strange shadows on the ground.  As it turned out, he worked late into the night (""still grinding,"" he texted me) and then, House-of-Cards style, disappeared into the darkness. It's not clear whether Mr Bannon will ever be sacked. It's also not certain what the impact of his departure would be on the administration. He could marshal the dark forces of the internet and his Breitbart audience, swinging a wrecking ball at the Trump presidency. Some analysts believe the president will keep Mr Bannon at the White House because he's afraid that he'd do too much damage if he were thrown out. But there are other possibilities: if he left the White House on good terms, Mr Bannon could go back to Breitbart and push for policy changes in the administration from a strong position in the conservative media. Or he could simply disappear into the night, as I've seen him do in the past.

Trump again blames both sides for violence,"This video can not be played ""What about the 'alt-left',"" Trump asked US President Donald Trump has again blamed both sides for the violent unrest in Charlottesville, Virginia, which left one protester dead and others injured. In a statement on Monday, he had condemned white supremacists. But in New York on Tuesday he also blamed left-wing supporters for charging at the ""alt-right"". His latest comments drew swift criticism, including from many in his Republican party. Many echoed Senator John McCain'sview,external: ""There is no moral equivalency between racists & Americans standing up to defy hate & bigotry"". Charlottesville victim was 'a strong woman' Antifa: Left-wing militants on the rise BBC reporter at the scene in Charlottesville The right-wing march had been organised to protest against the proposed removal of a statue of General Robert E Lee, who commanded the pro-slavery Confederate forces during the American Civil War. The event drew white supremacy groups. Violence broke out after they were confronted by anti-racism groups. A car ploughed into one group of anti-racism protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others.

Michael StoddardBBC South Defence Minister Harriett Baldwin has responded to criticism that HMS Queen Elizabeth currently has no fighter jets on board. F-35B Lightning fighter jets are due to make their first trial flights from the carrier's deck next year with 120 aircrew currently training in the US. ""We do have the jets - we have pilots in the states learning to fly the F35 jets. It's an incredible part of global Britain.  We are a trading nation and it gives us the ability to have a carrier at sea at all times to project power around the world, do humanitarian relief and take part in Nato operations."" Harriett Baldwin, Defence Minister Rear Adimral Dr Chris Parry, who spent 35 years in the service, said the new carrier returns the navy to its ""proper roots"". He added: ""The navy is nothing without a carrier - they are a national symbol and become celebrities in their own right and we've been a long time without one. ""It also shows that British industry can still hack it to provide a ship like this. ""One of the biggest compliments was that when the Americans came on board during recent sea trials they were really impressed."" Eleanor Kelly has many fond memories of HMS Queen Elizabeth as her husband worked on the ship. She has come down to welcome the carrier home with her children Iyda and Jack this morning and said it's a very special day for the family. Eleanor said: ""We're a very proud naval family so this is a big day for us and we're very excited to be here. The crowds are amazing and the kids are loving it, it's great."" Speaking on board HMS Queen Elizabeth as it prepared to sail in to Portsmouth, Captain Jerry
Kyd said he is feeling a ""huge amount of pride"" ahead of the vessel berthing
in her home port. ""It sends
the right signals to our allies and indeed potentially to our enemies that we
mean business. The armed forces are fundamentally an insurance policy for the country and
you can't just, at the flick of a switch, decide that you need these
capabilities. ""You have to buy them, work them up, train them, integrate them with the rest
of defence so they're ready to be called upon when required. ""You can't just buy
it off the shelf. Yes, it costs money, but it is all about having the right investment and
having the right equipment for the hundreds, if not thousands of young men and
women that go to war on behalf of the nation."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rail fares and Big Ben bong!,"The 3.6% rise in rail fares was met with ""fury"", according to the Daily Express. The Times says Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is being urged,externalto change the way fares are calculated. It says ""the wrong kind of inflation"" is a legitimate commuter complaint, as they are getting ""fleeced"" by the use of the RPI rather than CPI measure of inflation. Under the headline ""Freeze fares"", theDaily Mirror says the Lib Dems are asking,externalif fuel duty can be frozen, why not train tickets? TheSun,externalsays it is time Mr Grayling put himself on the side of the consumer rather than the rail companies. MPs are set to review the plan to silence Big Ben during a restoration project, because of health and safety concerns,according to the Daily Mail,external. The paper says MPs who signed off on the scheme did not know the bell would be out of action for four years. The Unite trade union has told theDaily Telegraph that it has no objection to the bell being rung,externalwhen workers are off site. The Spectator's Damian Thompson,writing in the Sun,external, suggests Westminster bureaucrats should be locked in Big Ben's tower until they have devised a new plan. The i newspaper,externalcolumnist Ben Chu describes the government's proposals for a post-Brexit customs union with the EU - that is simultaneously not a customs union - as a Schrodinger's Cat scenario that can be politely summed up as ""magical unrealism"". TheFinancial Times,externalsays it is a relief that the government accepts the need for a transitional arrangement. But there is where the good news ends, it says, as ministers still do not seem to have a clear idea of what comes next - bar some wishful thinking. There is support for Brexit Secretary David Davisin the Sun,external. It says he is clearly adopting the right approach as more sensible EU figures realise it is in everyone's interest to reach a customs deal that works. The lead in theTelegraph reports that the number of babies left brain-damaged by NHS blunders,externalhas increased by almost a quarter in one year. Safety experts have told the paper that a ""cult-like fixation"" on so-called normal births - those without medical intervention - has led to catastrophic errors. Health minister Philip Dunne tells the Mail,externalthat tackling such tragic failures had been made a priority - but the NHS is one of the safest places in the world to give birth. The pink knitted ""pussy hat"" that became a symbolic protest against Donald Trump during the women's march in Washington DC in January has been named as one of the best designs of the year by the Design Museum. The Guardian reports that the 60-strong list reflects a tumultuous 12 months of political unrest and ""creative popular resistance"". Other items include the Me & EU project - a collection of postcards by UK designers to be sent across Europe. Rude words have been appearing on giant screens across Hull, theTelegraph,externalreports, because a computer system used to power an art project is unable to understand the Yorkshire accent. The Hull Speaks installation allows people to translate their thoughts into messages projected at sites including the Humber estuary's tidal barrier. The artist behind it, Michael Pinsky, says that in time the technology will learn the Hull accent.

Aircraft carrier due in home port,"This video can not be played The moment HMS Queen Elizabeth entered Portsmouth Harbour The UK's new Â£3bn aircraft carrier has docked in its home port. HMS Queen Elizabeth entered Portsmouth Harbour for the first time at about 07:10 BST following extensive preparations at the naval base. The 65,000-tonne ship has been undergoing sea trials since setting sail from Rosyth dockyard in Fife, where it was built, in June. The 900ft (280m) long carrier cannot currently deploy planes but flying trials are due to begin next year. Prime Minister Theresa May met Capt Jerry Kyd while on board the carrier Addressing crew members and contractors on the flight deck, Prime Minister Theresa May said the carrier was a ""true testament to British ship building and design"". ""Britain truly has the best sailors, marines and officers in the world. And I believe you deserve the very best equipment and that it what we have with HMS Queen Elizabeth,"" she said. ""This ship is the symbol of the United Kingdom as a great global maritime nation. Clearly she is a stunning piece of 21st Century engineering."" Live: New aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth arrives in home port Crowds gathered on Southsea seafront for HMS Queen Elizabeth's arrival Spectators who gathered on the shoreline to watch the ship's arrival saw flypasts of Royal Navy helicopters, the first featuring a Sea King, two MK2 Merlins and two MK3 Merlins which were then joined by two Hawk jets. A flotilla of craft followed the behemoth aircraft carrier as she sailed into the Solent before heading into Portsmouth, where, at its narrowest point, there was less than 66ft (20m) clearance on each side. An 820ft (250m) exclusion zone was enforced by armed police in small boats and a no-fly zone was put in place to prevent the flying of drones around the harbour. The ship's available company stood at the edge of the vessel, with officers and family members also lining the jetty to welcome the ship. Louise Bond, 30, from Fareham, whose husband, Petty Officer Greg Bond, 33, is serving on board, said: ""It's my first homecoming, it's brilliant, I was up at 2.30am, first in line. ""It's amazing, I wouldn't miss it for the world."" Road closures,externalwere put in place in Old Portsmouth, Southsea seafront and parts of the city centre. Isle of Wight, Gosport and cross-channel ferry services also altered timetables. Preparations for the arrival of the future flagship of the fleet, and its 700 crew, saw more than 20,000 items ranging froma human skull to sea mines dredged upfrom Portsmouth Harbour. The Ministry of Defence said specialist dredging vessels had removed 3.2 million cubic metres of sediment - the equivalent to 1,280 Olympic swimming pools - during the dredging operation carried out to deepen the harbour mouth to enable the Queen Elizabeth to reach Portsmouth naval base. Speaking on board before the journey in to Portsmouth, Capt Jerry Kyd said he felt a ""huge amount of pride"" ahead of the vessel berthing in its home port. ""It sends the right signals to our allies and indeed potentially to our enemies that we mean business. ""The armed forces are fundamentally an insurance policy for the country and you can't just, at the flick of a switch, decide that you need these capabilities."" The ship has been undergoing sea trials off the Scottish coast and sailed with the USS George HW Bush and her carrier strike group, during Exercise Saxon Warrior earlier this month. F-35B Lightning fighter jets are due to make their first trial flights from the carrier's deck next year with 120 aircrew currently training in the US. HMS Queen Elizabeth sailed into Portsmouth following extensive preparations at the naval base. HMS Queen Elizabeth is still far from being a fully functioning aircraft carrier. But she now looks and feels less of a giant construction project and more like a warship. For the last seven weeks she's been undergoing sea trials. They've tested everything from the propulsion system to the sewage processing plant. The ship's five galleys have been churning out more than 3,000 meals a day for the 700 crew and additional contractors on board. According to the captain, Jerry Kyd, the tests have gone ""really well"" for what he admits is a ""prototype"". But even he suggests that they'll need more manpower when she's fully operational. The slightly larger US Nimitz class carriers have a crew of more than 4,000. HMS Queen Elizabeth's first deployment is still a long way off. Though helicopters have been landing on her massive deck - the size of three football pitches - it will be another year before the new F35s will begin flight trials. And HMS Queen Elizabeth won't be fully operational until 2023. HMS Queen Elizabeth: Everything you need to know.

Polanski faces third sex attack accuser,"US courts have tried, unsuccessfully, to extradite Roman Polanski Another woman has come forward to say she was sexually molested in the 1970s by the film director Roman Polanski. The woman, named only as Robin, told a news conference that the alleged attack happened in 1973 when she was 16. She is the third woman to accuse Polanski of child abuse. He fled the US in 1978 after admitting statutory rape of a 13-year-old. His victim, Samantha Geimer,asked a Los Angeles court in Juneto end the case against him. She said she had forgiven the filmmaker for the assault and wanted closure for herself and her family. Robin, who appeared with her lawyer Gloria Allred in Los Angeles on Tuesday, cannot sue Polanski in a criminal court because the statute of limitation has passed. However, she could testify against him in the case involving Ms Geimer. The slow-burning Polanski saga She told journalists that she was ""infuriated"" that the case against Polanski, now 83, might be dropped and she believed he should still be held accountable for his assault on Samantha Geimer. ""The day after it happened, I did tell one friend that Mr Polanski had done that to me,"" she said. ""The reason, with this exception, that I kept it to myself is that I didn't want my father to do something that might cause him to go to prison for the rest of his life."" Polanski's lawyers have not yet commented on the latest accusations. He admitted unlawful sex with a minor in 1977 and served 42 days in prison, but later fled the US over concern that a plea bargain deal would be scrapped. The Oscar-winning director, who is a citizen of Poland and of France, has been a fugitive since. In 2010 British actress Charlotte Lewis accused Polanski of sexually assaulting her in Paris in 1983, when she was 16 years old. She was also represented by lawyer Gloria Allred.
