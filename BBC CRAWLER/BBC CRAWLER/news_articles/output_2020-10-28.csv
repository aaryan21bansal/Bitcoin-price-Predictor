LiveLiveTrump hits campaign trail blaming media and tech2 minutes ago,"US President Donald Trump is holding rallies in Arizona â a battleground state where polls suggest Biden has the edge The president attacked the press and tech companies during a Senate hearing on how Facebook, Google and Twitter moderate content All three tech giants have been criticised by both sides during a fraught presidential election campaign Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Joe Biden cast his vote in Delaware, while his VP pick Kamala Harris is campaigning in Arizona Early voting in the US election has now topped 70 million, more than half of the total turnout in 2016 Many of those casting their ballots early are seeking to reduce their exposure to coronavirus In between the news and views from the campaign trail, our theme today is climate change and the election Edited by Helier Cheung We're wrapping up today's live coverage of the election campaign. Our teams in the UK and the US will be back again on Thursday. In the meantime, here's a reminder of Wednesday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by our writers Georgina Rannard, Sophie Williams, Victoria Bisset and Max Matza, and the editors were Rebecca Seales, Paulin Kola and Helier Cheung. Trump encouraged attendees, who stood shoulder-to-shoulder, to dance along to the YMCA With less than a week to go until election day, take a look at what the campaign trail across the US looks like amid a pandemic. Trump spoke earlier today in an Arizona town on the border with Nevada at an airport where many people did not wear masks or space out to prevent infection. Trump reportedly wished to hold the rally in Nevada, but was banned from doing so due to Covid-19 measures put in place by the state's Democratic governor. At the event, he criticised his challenger Biden's stamina saying he did not think he ""would be a good fighter"". He continued: ""One gentle little touch to the face and he's down. He's down and he wouldn't get up very quickly either, would he?""  Biden's address from Delaware was not open to the public, but was streamed online Biden's campaign said he chose to stay in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, so as not to risk catching or spreading coronavirus. He spoke from a largely empty hall for a virtual address about his plans to combat Covid-19, and then cast his vote at a local polling station. He criticised Trump's rally in Nebraska yesterday, where thousands of the president's supporters were stuck outside in the cold as midnight fell after the number of attendees overwhelmed shuttle buses set up by the Trump campaign. ""He gets his photo-op and then he gets out,"" said Biden. Pence spoke in Wisconsin, a state Trump won in 2016 Meanwhile, Mike Pence spoke in central Wisconsin and has another rally in Michigan later tonight. Despite his top aide testing positive for the virus, he has refused to quarantine, saying that he is an essential worker. Pence tested negative for Covid-19 today, his office says. Like Trump, Kamala Harris has been in Arizona today Kamala Harris was in Tucson, Arizona, where she spoke at a drive-in rally that had a few attendees listening outside of their cars. She has another drive in voter mobilisation event in Phoenix today. A former Republican senator from Arizona has appeared in an advert backing Joe Biden, as President Donald Trump doubles down in his campaign in the state. ""I've been a conservative Republican my entire life. I've never before voted for a Democrat for president. But this year, principle and conscience require me to do just that - I'm voting for Joe Biden,"" Flake, who was senator for Arizona from 2013 to 2019, said in the advert. ""And please, don't let anyone tell you that by casting your vote for Joe Biden you are somehow not being conservative. This year, the most conservative thing you can do is to put country over party."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Both President Trump and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris are in Flake's home state of Arizona right now. Trump may have won the Arizona  - a key battleground state - in 2016, but current polling gives Biden a very slim majority of 2%. Flake is not alone - he's one of several former Republican members of congress joined a campaign to back Biden in August. Trump's campaign hit back at Flake at the time, with a spokesman calling him a ""swamp creature"". A spokesman for the Republican party said Flake had ""abandoned any set of principles he once professed to have in order to embrace Joe Biden, a far-left Democrat"". Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth tells the BBC that ""it is looking pretty good all over the country"" for Democrats, particularly in light of record early voting numbers. However, she adds that ""all Democrats are pretty nervous because of 2016"" - when, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump, despite being widely expected to win. You can watch more of the interview, including Duckworth being questioned on whether Democrats would try to pack the Supreme Court, below. This video can not be played Tammy Duckworth: 'Nothing is off the table' with Supreme Court packing And if you want to know more about Duckworth's background,we profiled the Iraq war veteran and senator earlier this year, when she was considered a possible contender for Biden's running mate. With six days until the election, Democratic candidate Joe Biden is currently leading in the polls, with 51% to President Donald Trump's 43%. But while national polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, things are closer in a number of key states which could ultimately decide the outcome of the election. Find out more in our guide to the pollshere. With the president facing scrutiny over his handling of the pandemic, new audio shows his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner justifying moves to reopen the country more than six months ago. In an interview with US journalist Bob Woodward recorded on 18 April, Kushner can be heard saying: ""Trump's now back in charge. It's not the doctors. They've kind of - we have, like, a negotiated settlement."" ""There was the panic phase, the pain phase and then the comeback phase. I do believe that last night symbolised kind of the beginning of the comeback phase,"" he said in the recording, which was obtained bythe BBC's US partner, CBS News,external. Kushner spoke to Woodward after the White House released guidelines for reopening the country.The interview was first reported by CNN,externalearlier today. On the day the interview was recorded, the US death toll passed 37,000. That number has since risen to more than 227,000. Another of Woodward's interviews from the early stages of the pandemic, this time with Donald Trump and first reported last month,indicated that the president knew more about the severity of coronavirusthan he had admitted publicly. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken after Trump was hospitalised with Covid-19 in early October showed that his approval ratings over his response to the pandemic had hit a record low. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Janice Irene Gunn, 63, from Los Angeles asks:Will Joe Biden actually be able to make any strides toward eliminating climate change, given that the Senate leans toward Republican, and the House has a slim Democratic majority? Thereâs actually a real chance he could. Letâs take a look at the situation on Capitol Hill going into the election. As things stand, Republicans hold a three-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate. In the House of Representatives, which has 435 seats, Democrats hold 232 to Republicansâ 197. And analysts say itâs unlikely Democrats will lose their majority there - even among the more âvulnerableâ seats, many still favour Democrats. Meanwhile, in the Senate, there are a number of possible states that could flip from Republican red to Democratic blue, including Arizona, Colorado - and maybe even Texas. If Democrats win three seats in the upper chamber and the White House, theyâll still get the Senate majority, as the vice-president would become the tie-breaker. According to a 19 October forecast from FiveThirtyEight, Democrats have a 72% chance of winning the presidency, Senate and House this election. Action on climate change is high on the Democratic agenda, so control of the executive and legislative branches would make it likely for bills to be pushed through.

For anyone wondering what the electoral college is, when we'll find out who won and what else the election will decide, we've explained everything you need to knowhere. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC In recent years, the US and China have gone head-to-head over trade, technology and accusations of espionage. Today, the US Department of Justice charged eight people for allegedly conspiring as spies for China. China has become a key foreign policy issue in this US presidential election, with both Trump and Biden vowing to be tough on the country. âDecouplingâ is now a buzzword in US-China relations. It means reducing interdependence between the two countries, in order to mitigate risks for US national security. But disentangling the worldâs two largest economies is very complicated and potentially devastating for not only China and America, but also the rest of the world. Regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins the White House, the US-China rivalry is here to stay. Washington faces the challenge of figuring out how to work with China, while trying to protect its national security and tech competitiveness. China economic analyst Scott Kennedy told me that Washington needs to find a strategy to reach a âstable equilibriumâ with Beijing, even if the bilateral relationship becomes largely competitive. This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world The electoral college is a mystifying idea to many outside the US - and to some Americans too. Want to know how it works, and why it means you can become US president without winning the most votes? Sit back and watch this video... This video can not be played The Electoral College: Which voters really decide the US election? Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington His name is now public: Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, wrote an unsigned op-ed in 2018 that said the president was âpetty and ineffectiveâ, among other things. Now Taylor is writing under his own name, calling on people to demand a change in leadership. Taylorâs public stance is unlikely to change the minds of the presidentâs diehard supporters. But his statement may have an impact on those who are still working for the president and are considering leaving their jobs. In the meantime, he has made a splash in the media. Journalists have long wondered who Anonymous was, and his unveiling is making headlines with less than a week before the election. White House officials say he was a low-level official and that he was not only anonymous but unimportant. It is true that he may not have been high on an organisational chart. Yet he had an insiderâs knowledge of the presidentâs activities, style, policies and temperament and seemed well-placed to write the kind of expose that he did. So far Taylorâs former boss, the president, has not said anything about him or his latest work. But as the president himself would say, stay tuned.   Larry MadowoBBC News, Philadelphia Some businesses in Philadelphia are boarding up, expecting a third night of protests after the city announced a curfew. Police clashed with protesters for the last two nights after the tragic shooting of a black man, Walter Wallace, Jr. His family said the 27-year-old had mental health problems and they had called an ambulance but the police got there first. Police say they opened fire when he refused to drop a knife he was holding. A city-wide curfew has been announced from Wednesday 9pm to 6am on Thursday and businesses have been urged to close. Police say they have arrested 172 people on felony or misdemeanour grounds. Fifty-three officers have also been injured in the protests. Several big-box stores and other businesses were looted and at least nine ATMs were blown up over the last two days.The Pennsylvania National Guard has been deployed to the city. In Nevada, President Trump called what was happening in the city ""terrible"" and offered to send federal help. Joe Biden also condemned the violence and looting but said the protests were ""legitimate"". It reflects a difference in the two campaigns: President Trump has centred his campaign on a ""law and order"" message and criticised Democratic-run cities for allowing looters and rioters to take over their streets. Joe Biden meanwhile is walking a tightrope between acknowledging the grievances of Black Lives Matter protesters, while condemning rioting and not committing to defund the police. Seasoned US politics geeks, Jon Sopel, Emily Maitlis and Anthony Zurcher bring you the latest news and analysis from the campaign trail. On this episode of the podcast, the gang consider Donald Trump and Joe Bidenâs final pitches to the American voters, with just six days to go until voting begins! They also catch up with Heather, a voter from Ohio, who reveals which way sheâs going to cast her ballot after months of agonising.

Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida We've been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now it's our turn to respond. Joseph Main, 27, from Auckland, New Zealand, asks:Everyone is aware of President Trump's disdain for the Paris Climate Agreement. However, what could the outcome be, after this election, for more local environmental issues? The answer to this, like many things in the US, goes back to the states. Trump has certainly managed to rollback dozens of environmental protections that have local impacts, like opening up more federal lands for drilling, approving the construction of pipelines, and ending protections for migratory birds and other threatened species. But a lot of these have also been held up in the courts due to challenges by states or other groups. Twenty-five governors have joined a US climate alliance to reduce emissions, promote clean energy, improve public health and report progress on the global stage. Ten states have committed to 100% clean electricity and pollution-reduction policies, according to the Center for American Progress.A coalition,externalof thousands of cities, states and other institutions have also pledged to uphold Americaâs part of the Paris accord. If Biden wins the election, heâs promised to move the US towards a clean energy future and recommit to the Paris agreement. We may see a more national environmental approach in a Democrat-held Congress and White House, but regional leadership and grassroots efforts in the states will still be the key forces for local change. Read more about this issue: In a virtual speech from Delaware, Joe Biden has pledged not to campaign âon the false promises of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switchâ. âEven if I win, itâs going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic,â he said from his hometown of Wilmington. âI do promise this: We will start on day one doing the right things.â He also called Trump's pandemic response an ""insult"" to the victims. The live broadcast speech came after he received a briefing from health experts. The US is currently seeing an average of 71,000 new Covid-19 cases per day. Hospital admissions are rapidly climbing and so is the death toll. While Trump is holding a series of rallies in battleground states across the country, Biden has held far fewer in-person events, citing the coronavirus pandemic. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Peter Berkowitz, the US state departmentâs director of policy planning, met British officials in London earlier this month. Upon his return, he acknowledged he was infected with coronavirus. A state department official said that he had followed safety guidelines, butothers, according to the Washington Post, said he was cavalier about wearing a mask,external. Now UK officials say they will be more selective about approving visits of US officials. The incident underscores the perils of international relations: President Trump has generally been dismissive of masks - he took his mask off after being treated at hospital - and his aides have scorned wearing them during some public events. The president has said the US is ârounding a cornerâ in its efforts to fight the virus despite a spike in infections, and this attitude towards masks reinforces this political message. Some UK officials appear now to be concerned about their meetings with US officials, however, and they are trying to maintain some distance. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Alan R, 74, from Plymouth, UK, asks:Can you contrast each candidate's policies on climate change? With this, Trump's record is clear: since taking office, he's made dozens of changes and rollbacks to environmental protections, let alone his go-to call that climate change is a ""hoax"". Trump's bullet-pointed second-term agenda ignored the wider issue altogether in favour of promising the cleanest water and air.Our reporter Helier Cheung took a detailed look at Trump's record here, but (spoiler alert) these are the big policies to know: With four more years, it'll likely be more of the same. But if voters put Biden in the Oval Office, we're looking at rollbacks of the rollbacks. Biden has promised to recommit to the Paris accord, reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and turn the US into a 100% clean energy economy. He's even gone further than the official Democratic National Committee platform by saying he'll end subsidies to fossil fuel companies. This green vision will cost a cool couple trillion over four years. Do you have a question about the US presidential election that you would like our team to answer? If so,submit your question here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For a candidate who says he doesnât believe presidential preference polls, Donald Trump certainly talks about them a lot. In his first rally of the day, in Bullhead City, Arizona, the president started by mentioning a just-released survey of showing him trailing in Wisconsin, a key mid-west swing state, by 17 points. It was a âfake pollâ, he said, adding that his data on a state that helped deliver the White House to him in 2016 showed that he was up by one point. Surveys indicating heâs only up one point in traditionally conservative Texas? âI donât think so,â he said to cheers in this desert town on the border of Nevada. âIn 2016, I heard this all the time.â Over the course of four rallies in four states in the past 24 hours, the president has claimed heâs ahead and surging in Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona â battleground states, all. âWeâre going to have a great, great red wave,â he said in Arizona, predicting that his supporters â many of whom he believes are not being accurately reflected in the public polls â will cast ballots on election day, once again carrying him to victory despite predictions he may be on the verge of defeat. Kamala Harris spoke at a socially distanced rally in Tucson At a socially distanced drive-in rally in Tucson, Arizona, Kamala Harris claims Republicans are employing dirty tricks to try to suppress Democratic votes. ""Why is the president messing with the post office,"" she asked, referring to recent changes at the postal service that have slowed mail. Critics charge it was a Trump administration attempt to sabotage mail-in voting. ""Because they know we have power,"" she says, answering her question. ""Let's not ever let anyone take our power from us. Ours is the power to use our voices. And at election time that means our vote, and let's not let anyone take it from us."" As she wraps up her event, car horns blared in approval. Earlier in her speech, she brushed off Republicans attempting to label her a ""radical socialist"" and condemned Trump's tone as president. ""We know that real strength is not based on who you beat down, it is based on who you lift up,"" she said. Earlier today, Harris met with Latina businesswomen in Tucson. Chris Badillo is a progressive first-time voter who is extremely concerned by the lack of action on climate change. Angered by President Trumpâs actions on immigration and the environment, he supports Joe Biden. How does the issue of climate change impact your vote? President Trump believes that man-made climate change is a hoax. He has cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency and has utilised his administration to deregulate industries, putting the profits of fossil fuel CEOs above our countryâs future. Living in Miami, I know that my community will be the first to feel the effects of climate change. Joe Biden has committed to signing executive orders that will help move us to net-zero emissions and make an unprecedented federal investment in combating climate change, which Donald Trump actively opposes. Climate change is an existential threat to the future of my generation, and Joe Biden's policies take some of the necessary steps to mitigate its effects. Tell us about your plan to vote. I voted by mail in Miami, Florida, and the online system from my local election department confirmed that my vote has already been counted. These are membersof our US election voter panel.

US tries to block first African head of WTO,"Ms Okonjo-Iweala, 66, was Nigeria's first female finance and foreign minister The appointment of Nigeria's ex-finance minister to lead the World Trade Organization (WTO) has been thrown into doubt after the US opposed the move. On Wednesday, a WTO nominations committee recommended the group's 164 members appoint Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. She would be the first woman and first African to lead the WTO. But the US, critical of the WTO's handling of global trade, wants another woman, South Korea's Yoo Myung-hee, saying she could reform the body. Ms Okonjo-Iweala said she was ""immensely humbled"" to be nominated. But the four-month selection process to find the next WTO director-general hit a road block when Washington said it would continue to back South Korea's trade minister. In a statement critical of the WTO, the Office of the US Trade Representative, which advises President Donald Trump on trade policy, said the organisation ""must be led by someone with real, hands-on experience in the field"". Ms Yoo had ""distinguished herself"" as a trade expert and ""has all the skills necessary to be an effective leader of the organisation"", the statement said. It added: ""This is a very difficult time for the WTO and international trade. There have been no multilateral tariff negotiations in 25 years, the dispute settlement system has gotten out of control, and too few members fulfill basic transparency obligations. The WTO is badly in need of major reform."" The statement did not mention Ms Okonjo-Iweala. Earlier on Wednesday, after a WTO delegates meeting to discuss the appointment, spokesman Keith Rockwell said just one member country did not support Ms Okonjo-Iweala. ""All of the delegations that expressed their views today expressed very strong support for the process... for the outcome. Except for one,"" he said. Mr Trump has described the WTO as ""horrible"" and biased towards China, and some appointments to key roles in the organisation have already been blocked. WTO to name first female boss as shortlist narrows EU gets $4bn bargaining chip in US trade row Liam Fox out of WTO leader race as field narrows The WTO has called a meeting for 9 November - after the US presidential election - to discuss the issue. US opposition does not mean the Nigerian cannot be appointed, but Washington could nevertheless wield considerable influence over the final decision. Mr Rockwell told reporters there was likely to be ""frenzied activity"" to secure a consensus for Ms Okonjo-Iweala's appointment. She has the support of the European Union. The leadership void was created after outgoing WTO chief Roberto Azevedo stepped down a year early in August. The WTO is currently being steered by four deputies. Ms Okonjo-Iweala, 66, served as her country's first female finance and foreign minister and has a 25-year career behind her as a development economist at the World Bank.. She also serves on Twitter's board of directors, as chair of the GAVI vaccine alliance and as a special envoy for the World Health Organisation's Covid-19 fight. If Ms Okonjo-Iweala is eventually appointed she will have a full in-tray. The WTO is already grappling with stalled trade talks and tensions between the US and China. Earlier this month she said that her broad experience in championing reform made her the right person to help put the WTO back on track.

Stock markets sink amid alarm at Covid surge,"Financial markets have tumbled around the world for a second day this week amid concerns that a rise in coronavirus cases will hurt still tentative economic recoveries. Major US indexes sank 3.4% or more, while European bourses also saw steep falls. The UK's FTSE 100 ended almost 2.6% lower, and Germany's Dax dropped 4.2%. The declines were widespread, as investors sold-off shares in favour of less risky assets like the US dollar. In the US, travel and energy firms, which are sensitive to concerns about the pandemic, suffered some of the steepest losses. Tech companies were also hit. Shares in Google, Facebook and Twitter all slid more than 5%, as their bosses were grilled by senators in Washington about how the firms should moderate speech on their platforms. The negative sentiment spilled over into Asian markets on Thursday with Australia's ASX 200 down 1.6% while in Hong Kong the Hang Seng index slipped 1.2%. However, these falls were modest compared to US and European bourses. In the UK, mining companies on the FTSE 100 took a hit, while on France's CAC 40 index, which dropped 3.4%, carmaker Renault was the biggest loser with an 8% drop. The declines mark a second day of steep falls this week, which has seen many countries report record numbers of new coronavirus cases, leading to strains in health systems and fresh lockdown restrictions in France and Germany. Coronavirus: Macron declares second national lockdown in France The Dow closed 3.4% lower, shedding more than 900 points to end at a level last seen in late July. The wider S&P 500 and Nasdaq retreated to September levels, falling 3.5% and 3.7% respectively. By contrast, financial markets in Asia, where the virus is seen as being under better control, have fared better. On Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng indexes closed down about 0.3%. In the US, investors are also on edge ahead of a close US presidential election. A defeat of current President Donald Trump could lead to tougher regulation for some sectors, including technology and oil and gas. Analysts say fears that the results could remain uncertain for some time are also weighing on sentiment.

'I'll be hosting Christmas over Zoom',"Gail says it's sad not being able to see family members, but people will make more effort When aleading medical expert urged peopleto prepare for a ""digital Christmas"" last week, the response was mixed. But amid the frustration and ""mistletoe and Zoom"" jokes, some people were already rearranging their plans. ""I imagine the iPad and FaceTime will be on pretty much the whole day on Christmas Day,"" says Gail Buckie, from Edinburgh. Gail's family live about 150 miles away on the Isle of Mull and she says ""there's no way we'll be able to see them over Christmas"" - especially with her mother considered vulnerable. But she says she's already putting ""a lot more effort"" into this year's festivities - and has even booked Santa to visit her children at her doorstep because they won't be able to go to a grotto like usual. Christmas guidance 'should be same across UK' Victoria Derbyshire sorry for Christmas comments ""We've already started to stock up on extra Christmas lights,"" she tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I think I've probably, in the past, been a bit more 'less is more' type thing, but with the children spending so much time inside, we're going to decorate their bedroom. ""It will be just a wee small thing for us,"" she says. ""But we'll make it extra special trying to keep connected."" It's still too early to say what Christmas will be like for everyone. But current restrictions in Scotland ban people from visiting other households indoors, while in England, millions of people are living under tier two or three restrictions, which also ban visiting others at home. In Wales, there is currently a national lockdown requiring people to stay indoors, while in Northern Ireland indoor visits to other people's homes are also not allowed. What are the new rules across the UK? What are the rules in your area? That means Gail isn't alone in planning a digital Christmas Day. Mhairi Hamilton, from Larkhall, in South Lanarkshire, says she is ""ahead of the curve"" and has already cancelled her big family Christmas to avoid months of uncertainty. ""So I called it about six weeks ago and put a message round the family saying that I was not going to host in the house but I would host a Zoom Christmas,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""I would preserve what we could of the family traditions and we would take it from there. And the response I got from the extended family was nothing but positive. You know, things like, 'you mean we can do this in our jammies? You mean we don't have to drive?'. I'm going, yes, yes, yes."" Mhairi is currently in the process of making gift bags for her relatives, which will be filled with drinks and nibbles, and the whole family will open their Secret Santa presents on a video call. ""I'm ahead of the game and I'm loving it,"" she says. ""I'm having a great time preparing. There are undoubtedly many, many positives to be taken from it."" Becky Goddard-Hill, a parenting blogger from Nottingham, is equally positive. ""I think we can still have that family gathering but just in a different way,"" she says. She's planning a carol concert with members of her family over video call, and a cook-a-long with her mother-in-law to bake a Christmas cake. ""I'll get my kids to open their advent calendar with their grandparents online each morning just so they're still very, very much a part of our Christmas and there's still a lot of fun and togetherness at the heart of it,"" she says. ""It will probably be absolute chaos but I think that's part of the fun, isn't it? It's that being together, throwing your enthusiasm behind it."" She also suggests watching a film together at the same time as relatives living elsewhere, or sending handmade cards and long handwritten letters. But for some, the prospect of a virtual Christmas is nothing but unappealing - especially if they will be on their own. ""This Christmas my husband, a serving soldier, will be at work on Christmas Day, and my brother, who I would normally spend Christmas Day with, died in August,"" says Helen Kemp, 56, who lives in the Yorkshire Dales. ""I don't have children and other than my cousin, who has invited me for Christmas Day to her house, I don't have any close relatives nearby anymore."" Helen says she will spend Christmas morning at work - at a charity that gives discounted holidays to vulnerable people, including the homeless. ""But after that, I really didn't want to have to spend the rest of the day, until my husband comes home at half six at night, on my own."" Her area is currently in tier one - medium alert - where household mixing is still allowed in groups of up to six. But ""who knows what we will be by Christmas"", she adds. ""It has been a tough year for all of us and we need to have some normality back into our lives. ""Spending Christmas Day with family, rather than alone, is a way of normalising our lives again. ""I don't think anyone wants to be alone on Christmas Day, let alone after the year we have all had."" Earlier this week,No 10 said it wasPrime Minister Boris Johnson's ""ambition"" for people to celebrate Christmas with their families. But many scientists and politicians have taken a different view. Scotland's national clinical directorJason Leitch said it was""honestly too early to say"" what would happen at Christmas - but it was ""not going to be normal"". ""People should get their digital Christmas ready,"" he said. Prof John Edmunds, who sits on Sage,said the ideathat people could ""carry on as we are"" and then have a normal Christmas with friends and family was ""wishful thinking in the extreme"". Andanother Sage scientist saidlast week that Christmas was unlikely to be the ""usual celebration"" of ""families coming together"".

US tries to block first African head of WTOThe World Trade Organization's nominations team says member countries should back Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.Business,"Ms Okonjo-Iweala, 66, was Nigeria's first female finance and foreign minister The appointment of Nigeria's ex-finance minister to lead the World Trade Organization (WTO) has been thrown into doubt after the US opposed the move. On Wednesday, a WTO nominations committee recommended the group's 164 members appoint Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. She would be the first woman and first African to lead the WTO. But the US, critical of the WTO's handling of global trade, wants another woman, South Korea's Yoo Myung-hee, saying she could reform the body. Ms Okonjo-Iweala said she was ""immensely humbled"" to be nominated. But the four-month selection process to find the next WTO director-general hit a road block when Washington said it would continue to back South Korea's trade minister. In a statement critical of the WTO, the Office of the US Trade Representative, which advises President Donald Trump on trade policy, said the organisation ""must be led by someone with real, hands-on experience in the field"". Ms Yoo had ""distinguished herself"" as a trade expert and ""has all the skills necessary to be an effective leader of the organisation"", the statement said. It added: ""This is a very difficult time for the WTO and international trade. There have been no multilateral tariff negotiations in 25 years, the dispute settlement system has gotten out of control, and too few members fulfill basic transparency obligations. The WTO is badly in need of major reform."" The statement did not mention Ms Okonjo-Iweala. Earlier on Wednesday, after a WTO delegates meeting to discuss the appointment, spokesman Keith Rockwell said just one member country did not support Ms Okonjo-Iweala. ""All of the delegations that expressed their views today expressed very strong support for the process... for the outcome. Except for one,"" he said. Mr Trump has described the WTO as ""horrible"" and biased towards China, and some appointments to key roles in the organisation have already been blocked. WTO to name first female boss as shortlist narrows EU gets $4bn bargaining chip in US trade row Liam Fox out of WTO leader race as field narrows The WTO has called a meeting for 9 November - after the US presidential election - to discuss the issue. US opposition does not mean the Nigerian cannot be appointed, but Washington could nevertheless wield considerable influence over the final decision. Mr Rockwell told reporters there was likely to be ""frenzied activity"" to secure a consensus for Ms Okonjo-Iweala's appointment. She has the support of the European Union. The leadership void was created after outgoing WTO chief Roberto Azevedo stepped down a year early in August. The WTO is currently being steered by four deputies. Ms Okonjo-Iweala, 66, served as her country's first female finance and foreign minister and has a 25-year career behind her as a development economist at the World Bank.. She also serves on Twitter's board of directors, as chair of the GAVI vaccine alliance and as a special envoy for the World Health Organisation's Covid-19 fight. If Ms Okonjo-Iweala is eventually appointed she will have a full in-tray. The WTO is already grappling with stalled trade talks and tensions between the US and China. Earlier this month she said that her broad experience in championing reform made her the right person to help put the WTO back on track. ""I am a reform candidate and I think the WTO needs the reform credentials and skills now.

LiveLiveTrump resumes campaign blitz blaming media and techLess than a minute ago,"US President Donald Trump is holding rallies in Arizona â a battleground state where polls suggest Biden has the edge The president attacked the press and tech companies during a Senate hearing on how Facebook, Google and Twitter moderate content All three tech giants have been criticised by both sides during a fraught presidential election campaign Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Joe Biden cast his vote in Delaware, while his VP pick Kamala Harris is campaigning in Arizona Early voting in the US election has now topped 70 million, more than half of the total turnout in 2016 Many of those casting their ballots early are seeking to reduce their exposure to coronavirus In between the news and views from the campaign trail, our theme today is climate change and the election Edited by Helier Cheung We're wrapping up today's live coverage of the election campaign. Our teams in the UK and the US will be back again on Thursday. In the meantime, here's a reminder of Wednesday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by our writers Georgina Rannard, Sophie Williams, Victoria Bisset and Max Matza, and the editors were Rebecca Seales, Paulin Kola and Helier Cheung. Trump encouraged attendees, who stood shoulder-to-shoulder, to dance along to the YMCA With less than a week to go until election day, take a look at what the campaign trail across the US looks like amid a pandemic. Trump spoke earlier today in an Arizona town on the border with Nevada at an airport where many people did not wear masks or space out to prevent infection. Trump reportedly wished to hold the rally in Nevada, but was banned from doing so due to Covid-19 measures put in place by the state's Democratic governor. At the event, he criticised his challenger Biden's stamina saying he did not think he ""would be a good fighter"". He continued: ""One gentle little touch to the face and he's down. He's down and he wouldn't get up very quickly either, would he?""  Biden's address from Delaware was not open to the public, but was streamed online Biden's campaign said he chose to stay in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, so as not to risk catching or spreading coronavirus. He spoke from a largely empty hall for a virtual address about his plans to combat Covid-19, and then cast his vote at a local polling station. He criticised Trump's rally in Nebraska yesterday, where thousands of the president's supporters were stuck outside in the cold as midnight fell after the number of attendees overwhelmed shuttle buses set up by the Trump campaign. ""He gets his photo-op and then he gets out,"" said Biden. Pence spoke in Wisconsin, a state Trump won in 2016 Meanwhile, Mike Pence spoke in central Wisconsin and has another rally in Michigan later tonight. Despite his top aide testing positive for the virus, he has refused to quarantine, saying that he is an essential worker. Pence tested negative for Covid-19 today, his office says. Like Trump, Kamala Harris has been in Arizona today Kamala Harris was in Tucson, Arizona, where she spoke at a drive-in rally that had a few attendees listening outside of their cars. She has another drive in voter mobilisation event in Phoenix today. A former Republican senator from Arizona has appeared in an advert backing Joe Biden, as President Donald Trump doubles down in his campaign in the state. ""I've been a conservative Republican my entire life. I've never before voted for a Democrat for president. But this year, principle and conscience require me to do just that - I'm voting for Joe Biden,"" Flake, who was senator for Arizona from 2013 to 2019, said in the advert. ""And please, don't let anyone tell you that by casting your vote for Joe Biden you are somehow not being conservative. This year, the most conservative thing you can do is to put country over party."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Both President Trump and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris are in Flake's home state of Arizona right now. Trump may have won the Arizona  - a key battleground state - in 2016, but current polling gives Biden a very slim majority of 2%. Flake is not alone - he's one of several former Republican members of congress joined a campaign to back Biden in August. Trump's campaign hit back at Flake at the time, with a spokesman calling him a ""swamp creature"". A spokesman for the Republican party said Flake had ""abandoned any set of principles he once professed to have in order to embrace Joe Biden, a far-left Democrat"". Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth tells the BBC that ""it is looking pretty good all over the country"" for Democrats, particularly in light of record early voting numbers. However, she adds that ""all Democrats are pretty nervous because of 2016"" - when, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump, despite being widely expected to win. You can watch more of the interview, including Duckworth being questioned on whether Democrats would try to pack the Supreme Court, below. This video can not be played Tammy Duckworth: 'Nothing is off the table' with Supreme Court packing And if you want to know more about Duckworth's background,we profiled the Iraq war veteran and senator earlier this year, when she was considered a possible contender for Biden's running mate. With six days until the election, Democratic candidate Joe Biden is currently leading in the polls, with 51% to President Donald Trump's 43%. But while national polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, things are closer in a number of key states which could ultimately decide the outcome of the election. Find out more in our guide to the pollshere. With the president facing scrutiny over his handling of the pandemic, new audio shows his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner justifying moves to reopen the country more than six months ago. In an interview with US journalist Bob Woodward recorded on 18 April, Kushner can be heard saying: ""Trump's now back in charge. It's not the doctors. They've kind of - we have, like, a negotiated settlement."" ""There was the panic phase, the pain phase and then the comeback phase. I do believe that last night symbolised kind of the beginning of the comeback phase,"" he said in the recording, which was obtained bythe BBC's US partner, CBS News,external. Kushner spoke to Woodward after the White House released guidelines for reopening the country.The interview was first reported by CNN,externalearlier today. On the day the interview was recorded, the US death toll passed 37,000. That number has since risen to more than 227,000. Another of Woodward's interviews from the early stages of the pandemic, this time with Donald Trump and first reported last month,indicated that the president knew more about the severity of coronavirusthan he had admitted publicly. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken after Trump was hospitalised with Covid-19 in early October showed that his approval ratings over his response to the pandemic had hit a record low. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Janice Irene Gunn, 63, from Los Angeles asks:Will Joe Biden actually be able to make any strides toward eliminating climate change, given that the Senate leans toward Republican, and the House has a slim Democratic majority? Thereâs actually a real chance he could. Letâs take a look at the situation on Capitol Hill going into the election. As things stand, Republicans hold a three-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate. In the House of Representatives, which has 435 seats, Democrats hold 232 to Republicansâ 197. And analysts say itâs unlikely Democrats will lose their majority there - even among the more âvulnerableâ seats, many still favour Democrats. Meanwhile, in the Senate, there are a number of possible states that could flip from Republican red to Democratic blue, including Arizona, Colorado - and maybe even Texas. If Democrats win three seats in the upper chamber and the White House, theyâll still get the Senate majority, as the vice-president would become the tie-breaker. According to a 19 October forecast from FiveThirtyEight, Democrats have a 72% chance of winning the presidency, Senate and House this election. Action on climate change is high on the Democratic agenda, so control of the executive and legislative branches would make it likely for bills to be pushed through.

For anyone wondering what the electoral college is, when we'll find out who won and what else the election will decide, we've explained everything you need to knowhere. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC In recent years, the US and China have gone head-to-head over trade, technology and accusations of espionage. Today, the US Department of Justice charged eight people for allegedly conspiring as spies for China. China has become a key foreign policy issue in this US presidential election, with both Trump and Biden vowing to be tough on the country. âDecouplingâ is now a buzzword in US-China relations. It means reducing interdependence between the two countries, in order to mitigate risks for US national security. But disentangling the worldâs two largest economies is very complicated and potentially devastating for not only China and America, but also the rest of the world. Regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins the White House, the US-China rivalry is here to stay. Washington faces the challenge of figuring out how to work with China, while trying to protect its national security and tech competitiveness. China economic analyst Scott Kennedy told me that Washington needs to find a strategy to reach a âstable equilibriumâ with Beijing, even if the bilateral relationship becomes largely competitive. This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world The electoral college is a mystifying idea to many outside the US - and to some Americans too. Want to know how it works, and why it means you can become US president without winning the most votes? Sit back and watch this video... This video can not be played The Electoral College: Which voters really decide the US election? Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington His name is now public: Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, wrote an unsigned op-ed in 2018 that said the president was âpetty and ineffectiveâ, among other things. Now Taylor is writing under his own name, calling on people to demand a change in leadership. Taylorâs public stance is unlikely to change the minds of the presidentâs diehard supporters. But his statement may have an impact on those who are still working for the president and are considering leaving their jobs. In the meantime, he has made a splash in the media. Journalists have long wondered who Anonymous was, and his unveiling is making headlines with less than a week before the election. White House officials say he was a low-level official and that he was not only anonymous but unimportant. It is true that he may not have been high on an organisational chart. Yet he had an insiderâs knowledge of the presidentâs activities, style, policies and temperament and seemed well-placed to write the kind of expose that he did. So far Taylorâs former boss, the president, has not said anything about him or his latest work. But as the president himself would say, stay tuned.   Larry MadowoBBC News, Philadelphia Some businesses in Philadelphia are boarding up, expecting a third night of protests after the city announced a curfew. Police clashed with protesters for the last two nights after the tragic shooting of a black man, Walter Wallace, Jr. His family said the 27-year-old had mental health problems and they had called an ambulance but the police got there first. Police say they opened fire when he refused to drop a knife he was holding. A city-wide curfew has been announced from Wednesday 9pm to 6am on Thursday and businesses have been urged to close. Police say they have arrested 172 people on felony or misdemeanour grounds. Fifty-three officers have also been injured in the protests. Several big-box stores and other businesses were looted and at least nine ATMs were blown up over the last two days.The Pennsylvania National Guard has been deployed to the city. In Nevada, President Trump called what was happening in the city ""terrible"" and offered to send federal help. Joe Biden also condemned the violence and looting but said the protests were ""legitimate"". It reflects a difference in the two campaigns: President Trump has centred his campaign on a ""law and order"" message and criticised Democratic-run cities for allowing looters and rioters to take over their streets. Joe Biden meanwhile is walking a tightrope between acknowledging the grievances of Black Lives Matter protesters, while condemning rioting and not committing to defund the police. Seasoned US politics geeks, Jon Sopel, Emily Maitlis and Anthony Zurcher bring you the latest news and analysis from the campaign trail. On this episode of the podcast, the gang consider Donald Trump and Joe Bidenâs final pitches to the American voters, with just six days to go until voting begins! They also catch up with Heather, a voter from Ohio, who reveals which way sheâs going to cast her ballot after months of agonising.

Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida We've been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now it's our turn to respond. Joseph Main, 27, from Auckland, New Zealand, asks:Everyone is aware of President Trump's disdain for the Paris Climate Agreement. However, what could the outcome be, after this election, for more local environmental issues? The answer to this, like many things in the US, goes back to the states. Trump has certainly managed to rollback dozens of environmental protections that have local impacts, like opening up more federal lands for drilling, approving the construction of pipelines, and ending protections for migratory birds and other threatened species. But a lot of these have also been held up in the courts due to challenges by states or other groups. Twenty-five governors have joined a US climate alliance to reduce emissions, promote clean energy, improve public health and report progress on the global stage. Ten states have committed to 100% clean electricity and pollution-reduction policies, according to the Center for American Progress.A coalition,externalof thousands of cities, states and other institutions have also pledged to uphold Americaâs part of the Paris accord. If Biden wins the election, heâs promised to move the US towards a clean energy future and recommit to the Paris agreement. We may see a more national environmental approach in a Democrat-held Congress and White House, but regional leadership and grassroots efforts in the states will still be the key forces for local change. Read more about this issue: In a virtual speech from Delaware, Joe Biden has pledged not to campaign âon the false promises of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switchâ. âEven if I win, itâs going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic,â he said from his hometown of Wilmington. âI do promise this: We will start on day one doing the right things.â He also called Trump's pandemic response an ""insult"" to the victims. The live broadcast speech came after he received a briefing from health experts. The US is currently seeing an average of 71,000 new Covid-19 cases per day. Hospital admissions are rapidly climbing and so is the death toll. While Trump is holding a series of rallies in battleground states across the country, Biden has held far fewer in-person events, citing the coronavirus pandemic. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Peter Berkowitz, the US state departmentâs director of policy planning, met British officials in London earlier this month. Upon his return, he acknowledged he was infected with coronavirus. A state department official said that he had followed safety guidelines, butothers, according to the Washington Post, said he was cavalier about wearing a mask,external. Now UK officials say they will be more selective about approving visits of US officials. The incident underscores the perils of international relations: President Trump has generally been dismissive of masks - he took his mask off after being treated at hospital - and his aides have scorned wearing them during some public events. The president has said the US is ârounding a cornerâ in its efforts to fight the virus despite a spike in infections, and this attitude towards masks reinforces this political message. Some UK officials appear now to be concerned about their meetings with US officials, however, and they are trying to maintain some distance. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Alan R, 74, from Plymouth, UK, asks:Can you contrast each candidate's policies on climate change? With this, Trump's record is clear: since taking office, he's made dozens of changes and rollbacks to environmental protections, let alone his go-to call that climate change is a ""hoax"". Trump's bullet-pointed second-term agenda ignored the wider issue altogether in favour of promising the cleanest water and air.Our reporter Helier Cheung took a detailed look at Trump's record here, but (spoiler alert) these are the big policies to know: With four more years, it'll likely be more of the same. But if voters put Biden in the Oval Office, we're looking at rollbacks of the rollbacks. Biden has promised to recommit to the Paris accord, reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and turn the US into a 100% clean energy economy. He's even gone further than the official Democratic National Committee platform by saying he'll end subsidies to fossil fuel companies. This green vision will cost a cool couple trillion over four years. Do you have a question about the US presidential election that you would like our team to answer? If so,submit your question here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For a candidate who says he doesnât believe presidential preference polls, Donald Trump certainly talks about them a lot. In his first rally of the day, in Bullhead City, Arizona, the president started by mentioning a just-released survey of showing him trailing in Wisconsin, a key mid-west swing state, by 17 points. It was a âfake pollâ, he said, adding that his data on a state that helped deliver the White House to him in 2016 showed that he was up by one point. Surveys indicating heâs only up one point in traditionally conservative Texas? âI donât think so,â he said to cheers in this desert town on the border of Nevada. âIn 2016, I heard this all the time.â Over the course of four rallies in four states in the past 24 hours, the president has claimed heâs ahead and surging in Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona â battleground states, all. âWeâre going to have a great, great red wave,â he said in Arizona, predicting that his supporters â many of whom he believes are not being accurately reflected in the public polls â will cast ballots on election day, once again carrying him to victory despite predictions he may be on the verge of defeat. Kamala Harris spoke at a socially distanced rally in Tucson At a socially distanced drive-in rally in Tucson, Arizona, Kamala Harris claims Republicans are employing dirty tricks to try to suppress Democratic votes. ""Why is the president messing with the post office,"" she asked, referring to recent changes at the postal service that have slowed mail. Critics charge it was a Trump administration attempt to sabotage mail-in voting. ""Because they know we have power,"" she says, answering her question. ""Let's not ever let anyone take our power from us. Ours is the power to use our voices. And at election time that means our vote, and let's not let anyone take it from us."" As she wraps up her event, car horns blared in approval. Earlier in her speech, she brushed off Republicans attempting to label her a ""radical socialist"" and condemned Trump's tone as president. ""We know that real strength is not based on who you beat down, it is based on who you lift up,"" she said. Earlier today, Harris met with Latina businesswomen in Tucson. Chris Badillo is a progressive first-time voter who is extremely concerned by the lack of action on climate change. Angered by President Trumpâs actions on immigration and the environment, he supports Joe Biden. How does the issue of climate change impact your vote? President Trump believes that man-made climate change is a hoax. He has cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency and has utilised his administration to deregulate industries, putting the profits of fossil fuel CEOs above our countryâs future. Living in Miami, I know that my community will be the first to feel the effects of climate change. Joe Biden has committed to signing executive orders that will help move us to net-zero emissions and make an unprecedented federal investment in combating climate change, which Donald Trump actively opposes. Climate change is an existential threat to the future of my generation, and Joe Biden's policies take some of the necessary steps to mitigate its effects. Tell us about your plan to vote. I voted by mail in Miami, Florida, and the online system from my local election department confirmed that my vote has already been counted. These are membersof our US election voter panel.

Rashford school meals petition tops 1m signatures,"More than a million people have signed Marcus Rashford's petition calling for children from poor families in England to get free meals in school holidays. The Manchester United and England forward wants the government to provide free lunches amid fears for incomes as coronavirus restrictions increase. His Parliamentary petition says that ""no child should be going hungry"". The government says it has already introduced more effective measures to support families. Rashford 'proud' of school holiday meals response Councils promise free meals after Rashford campaign Restaurants rally for Rashford's free meal crusade Is there really no money for free school meals? It has ruled out extending free meals across England beyond term time - as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have done - saying it has given councils Â£63m for families facing financial difficulties due to pandemic restrictions, as well as increasing welfare support by Â£9.3bn. Last week, MPs rejected Labour's motion to extend the provision of free school meals, with five Conservative MPs rebelling. Some businesses are giving out free food to underprivileged children during half-term Since then, some Conservative and Labour councilshave agreedto supply meal vouchers for pupils during half-term. Some have said they will fund this using cash from the Â£63m government hardship fund, others from within existing budgets. Pubs, restaurants and cafes have also been amongthose to support the initiative. If Parliamentary petitions get more than 100,000 signatures, the subject is considered for a House of Commons debate. Rashford's petition calls for the government to implement three recommendations made by a government-commissioned review on foodpublished in July last year: Expand free school meals to an additional 1.5m children, by including all households receiving universal credit or equivalent Make an extra 1.1m children eligible for holiday activity and food programmes More generous meal vouchers for pregnant women and parents of young children Meanwhile, a separate petition on campaigning website 38 Degrees calling for MPs to lose their ability to claim for food on expenses has nearly reached a million signatures. MPscan claim,externalup to Â£25 for food and non-alcoholic drink for each night spent outside London or their constituency as part of their work. The petition also calls for MPs to be charged ""market rates"" for food they consume at parliamentary catering outlets, which arerun at a loss,external. It was announced on Wednesday that Mr Rashford will receive the City of Manchester Award in honour of his campaigning. The 22-year-old has already been made an MBE for his work on child poverty. The UK government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays this year and, after a campaign by Mr Rashford, repeated this during the summer break. But, with England's schools having reopened fully in September, cabinet minister Brandon Lewis told the BBC at the weekend that it was now up to councils to use the welfare system so that money is ""targeted where it's needed most"".

Our teams in the UK and the US will be back again on Thursday. In the meantime, here's a reminder of Wednesday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by our writers Georgina Rannard, Sophie Williams, Victoria Bisset and Max Matza, and the editors were Rebecca Seales, Paulin Kola and Helier Cheung. Trump encouraged attendees, who stood shoulder-to-shoulder, to dance along to the YMCA With less than a week to go until election day, take a look at what the campaign trail across the US looks like amid a pandemic. Trump spoke earlier today in an Arizona town on the border with Nevada at an airport where many people did not wear masks or space out to prevent infection. Trump reportedly wished to hold the rally in Nevada, but was banned from doing so due to Covid-19 measures put in place by the state's Democratic governor. At the event, he criticised his challenger Biden's stamina saying he did not think he ""would be a good fighter"". He continued: ""One gentle little touch to the face and he's down. He's down and he wouldn't get up very quickly either, would he?""  Biden's address from Delaware was not open to the public, but was streamed online Biden's campaign said he chose to stay in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, so as not to risk catching or spreading coronavirus. He spoke from a largely empty hall for a virtual address about his plans to combat Covid-19, and then cast his vote at a local polling station. He criticised Trump's rally in Nebraska yesterday, where thousands of the president's supporters were stuck outside in the cold as midnight fell after the number of attendees overwhelmed shuttle buses set up by the Trump campaign. ""He gets his photo-op and then he gets out,"" said Biden. Pence spoke in Wisconsin, a state Trump won in 2016 Meanwhile, Mike Pence spoke in central Wisconsin and has another rally in Michigan later tonight. Despite his top aide testing positive for the virus, he has refused to quarantine, saying that he is an essential worker. Pence tested negative for Covid-19 today, his office says. Like Trump, Kamala Harris has been in Arizona today Kamala Harris was in Tucson, Arizona, where she spoke at a drive-in rally that had a few attendees listening outside of their cars. She has another drive in voter mobilisation event in Phoenix today. A former Republican senator from Arizona has appeared in an advert backing Joe Biden, as President Donald Trump doubles down in his campaign in the state. ""I've been a conservative Republican my entire life. I've never before voted for a Democrat for president. But this year, principle and conscience require me to do just that - I'm voting for Joe Biden,"" Flake, who was senator for Arizona from 2013 to 2019, said in the advert. ""And please, don't let anyone tell you that by casting your vote for Joe Biden you are somehow not being conservative. This year, the most conservative thing you can do is to put country over party."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Both President Trump and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris are in Flake's home state of Arizona right now. Trump may have won the Arizona  - a key battleground state - in 2016, but current polling gives Biden a very slim majority of 2%. Flake is not alone - he's one of several former Republican members of congress joined a campaign to back Biden in August. Trump's campaign hit back at Flake at the time, with a spokesman calling him a ""swamp creature"". A spokesman for the Republican party said Flake had ""abandoned any set of principles he once professed to have in order to embrace Joe Biden, a far-left Democrat"". Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth tells the BBC that ""it is looking pretty good all over the country"" for Democrats, particularly in light of record early voting numbers. However, she adds that ""all Democrats are pretty nervous because of 2016"" - when, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump, despite being widely expected to win. You can watch more of the interview, including Duckworth being questioned on whether Democrats would try to pack the Supreme Court, below. This video can not be played Tammy Duckworth: 'Nothing is off the table' with Supreme Court packing And if you want to know more about Duckworth's background,we profiled the Iraq war veteran and senator earlier this year, when she was considered a possible contender for Biden's running mate. With six days until the election, Democratic candidate Joe Biden is currently leading in the polls, with 51% to President Donald Trump's 43%. But while national polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, things are closer in a number of key states which could ultimately decide the outcome of the election. Find out more in our guide to the pollshere. With the president facing scrutiny over his handling of the pandemic, new audio shows his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner justifying moves to reopen the country more than six months ago. In an interview with US journalist Bob Woodward recorded on 18 April, Kushner can be heard saying: ""Trump's now back in charge. It's not the doctors. They've kind of - we have, like, a negotiated settlement."" ""There was the panic phase, the pain phase and then the comeback phase. I do believe that last night symbolised kind of the beginning of the comeback phase,"" he said in the recording, which was obtained bythe BBC's US partner, CBS News,external. Kushner spoke to Woodward after the White House released guidelines for reopening the country.The interview was first reported by CNN,externalearlier today. On the day the interview was recorded, the US death toll passed 37,000. That number has since risen to more than 227,000. Another of Woodward's interviews from the early stages of the pandemic, this time with Donald Trump and first reported last month,indicated that the president knew more about the severity of coronavirusthan he had admitted publicly. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken after Trump was hospitalised with Covid-19 in early October showed that his approval ratings over his response to the pandemic had hit a record low. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Janice Irene Gunn, 63, from Los Angeles asks:Will Joe Biden actually be able to make any strides toward eliminating climate change, given that the Senate leans toward Republican, and the House has a slim Democratic majority? Thereâs actually a real chance he could. Letâs take a look at the situation on Capitol Hill going into the election. As things stand, Republicans hold a three-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate. In the House of Representatives, which has 435 seats, Democrats hold 232 to Republicansâ 197. And analysts say itâs unlikely Democrats will lose their majority there - even among the more âvulnerableâ seats, many still favour Democrats. Meanwhile, in the Senate, there are a number of possible states that could flip from Republican red to Democratic blue, including Arizona, Colorado - and maybe even Texas. If Democrats win three seats in the upper chamber and the White House, theyâll still get the Senate majority, as the vice-president would become the tie-breaker. According to a 19 October forecast from FiveThirtyEight, Democrats have a 72% chance of winning the presidency, Senate and House this election. Action on climate change is high on the Democratic agenda, so control of the executive and legislative branches would make it likely for bills to be pushed through. Do you have a question about the US presidential election that you would like our team to answer? If so,submit your question here. For anyone wondering what the electoral college is, when we'll find out who won and what else the election will decide, we've explained everything you need to knowhere. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC In recent years, the US and China have gone head-to-head over trade, technology and accusations of espionage. Today, the US Department of Justice charged eight people for allegedly conspiring as spies for China. China has become a key foreign policy issue in this US presidential election, with both Trump and Biden vowing to be tough on the country. âDecouplingâ is now a buzzword in US-China relations. It means reducing interdependence between the two countries, in order to mitigate risks for US national security. But disentangling the worldâs two largest economies is very complicated and potentially devastating for not only China and America, but also the rest of the world. Regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins the White House, the US-China rivalry is here to stay. Washington faces the challenge of figuring out how to work with China, while trying to protect its national security and tech competitiveness. China economic analyst Scott Kennedy told me that Washington needs to find a strategy to reach a âstable equilibriumâ with Beijing, even if the bilateral relationship becomes largely competitive. This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world The electoral college is a mystifying idea to many outside the US - and to some Americans too. Want to know how it works, and why it means you can become US president without winning the most votes? Sit back and watch this video... This video can not be played The Electoral College: Which voters really decide the US election? Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington His name is now public: Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, wrote an unsigned op-ed in 2018 that said the president was âpetty and ineffectiveâ, among other things. Now Taylor is writing under his own name, calling on people to demand a change in leadership. Taylorâs public stance is unlikely to change the minds of the presidentâs diehard supporters. But his statement may have an impact on those who are still working for the president and are considering leaving their jobs. In the meantime, he has made a splash in the media. Journalists have long wondered who Anonymous was, and his unveiling is making headlines with less than a week before the election. White House officials say he was a low-level official and that he was not only anonymous but unimportant. It is true that he may not have been high on an organisational chart. Yet he had an insiderâs knowledge of the presidentâs activities, style, policies and temperament and seemed well-placed to write the kind of expose that he did. So far Taylorâs former boss, the president, has not said anything about him or his latest work. But as the president himself would say, stay tuned.   Larry MadowoBBC News, Philadelphia Some businesses in Philadelphia are boarding up, expecting a third night of protests after the city announced a curfew. Police clashed with protesters for the last two nights after the tragic shooting of a black man, Walter Wallace, Jr. His family said the 27-year-old had mental health problems and they had called an ambulance but the police got there first. Police say they opened fire when he refused to drop a knife he was holding. A city-wide curfew has been announced from Wednesday 9pm to 6am on Thursday and businesses have been urged to close. Police say they have arrested 172 people on felony or misdemeanour grounds. Fifty-three officers have also been injured in the protests. Several big-box stores and other businesses were looted and at least nine ATMs were blown up over the last two days.The Pennsylvania National Guard has been deployed to the city. In Nevada, President Trump called what was happening in the city ""terrible"" and offered to send federal help. Joe Biden also condemned the violence and looting but said the protests were ""legitimate"". It reflects a difference in the two campaigns: President Trump has centred his campaign on a ""law and order"" message and criticised Democratic-run cities for allowing looters and rioters to take over their streets. Joe Biden meanwhile is walking a tightrope between acknowledging the grievances of Black Lives Matter protesters, while condemning rioting and not committing to defund the police. Seasoned US politics geeks, Jon Sopel, Emily Maitlis and Anthony Zurcher bring you the latest news and analysis from the campaign trail. On this episode of the podcast, the gang consider Donald Trump and Joe Bidenâs final pitches to the American voters, with just six days to go until voting begins! They also catch up with Heather, a voter from Ohio, who reveals which way sheâs going to cast her ballot after months of agonising.

Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida We've been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now it's our turn to respond. Joseph Main, 27, from Auckland, New Zealand, asks:Everyone is aware of President Trump's disdain for the Paris Climate Agreement. However, what could the outcome be, after this election, for more local environmental issues? The answer to this, like many things in the US, goes back to the states. Trump has certainly managed to rollback dozens of environmental protections that have local impacts, like opening up more federal lands for drilling, approving the construction of pipelines, and ending protections for migratory birds and other threatened species. But a lot of these have also been held up in the courts due to challenges by states or other groups. Twenty-five governors have joined a US climate alliance to reduce emissions, promote clean energy, improve public health and report progress on the global stage. Ten states have committed to 100% clean electricity and pollution-reduction policies, according to the Center for American Progress.A coalition,externalof thousands of cities, states and other institutions have also pledged to uphold Americaâs part of the Paris accord. If Biden wins the election, heâs promised to move the US towards a clean energy future and recommit to the Paris agreement. We may see a more national environmental approach in a Democrat-held Congress and White House, but regional leadership and grassroots efforts in the states will still be the key forces for local change. Read more about this issue: In a virtual speech from Delaware, Joe Biden has pledged not to campaign âon the false promises of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switchâ. âEven if I win, itâs going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic,â he said from his hometown of Wilmington. âI do promise this: We will start on day one doing the right things.â He also called Trump's pandemic response an ""insult"" to the victims. The live broadcast speech came after he received a briefing from health experts. The US is currently seeing an average of 71,000 new Covid-19 cases per day. Hospital admissions are rapidly climbing and so is the death toll. While Trump is holding a series of rallies in battleground states across the country, Biden has held far fewer in-person events, citing the coronavirus pandemic. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Peter Berkowitz, the US state departmentâs director of policy planning, met British officials in London earlier this month. Upon his return, he acknowledged he was infected with coronavirus. A state department official said that he had followed safety guidelines, butothers, according to the Washington Post, said he was cavalier about wearing a mask,external. Now UK officials say they will be more selective about approving visits of US officials. The incident underscores the perils of international relations: President Trump has generally been dismissive of masks - he took his mask off after being treated at hospital - and his aides have scorned wearing them during some public events. The president has said the US is ârounding a cornerâ in its efforts to fight the virus despite a spike in infections, and this attitude towards masks reinforces this political message. Some UK officials appear now to be concerned about their meetings with US officials, however, and they are trying to maintain some distance. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Alan R, 74, from Plymouth, UK, asks:Can you contrast each candidate's policies on climate change? With this, Trump's record is clear: since taking office, he's made dozens of changes and rollbacks to environmental protections, let alone his go-to call that climate change is a ""hoax"". Trump's bullet-pointed second-term agenda ignored the wider issue altogether in favour of promising the cleanest water and air.Our reporter Helier Cheung took a detailed look at Trump's record here, but (spoiler alert) these are the big policies to know: With four more years, it'll likely be more of the same. But if voters put Biden in the Oval Office, we're looking at rollbacks of the rollbacks. Biden has promised to recommit to the Paris accord, reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and turn the US into a 100% clean energy economy. He's even gone further than the official Democratic National Committee platform by saying he'll end subsidies to fossil fuel companies. This green vision will cost a cool couple trillion over four years. Do you have a question about the US presidential election that you would like our team to answer? If so,submit your question here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For a candidate who says he doesnât believe presidential preference polls, Donald Trump certainly talks about them a lot. In his first rally of the day, in Bullhead City, Arizona, the president started by mentioning a just-released survey of showing him trailing in Wisconsin, a key mid-west swing state, by 17 points. It was a âfake pollâ, he said, adding that his data on a state that helped deliver the White House to him in 2016 showed that he was up by one point. Surveys indicating heâs only up one point in traditionally conservative Texas? âI donât think so,â he said to cheers in this desert town on the border of Nevada. âIn 2016, I heard this all the time.â Over the course of four rallies in four states in the past 24 hours, the president has claimed heâs ahead and surging in Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona â battleground states, all. âWeâre going to have a great, great red wave,â he said in Arizona, predicting that his supporters â many of whom he believes are not being accurately reflected in the public polls â will cast ballots on election day, once again carrying him to victory despite predictions he may be on the verge of defeat. Kamala Harris spoke at a socially distanced rally in Tucson At a socially distanced drive-in rally in Tucson, Arizona, Kamala Harris claims Republicans are employing dirty tricks to try to suppress Democratic votes. ""Why is the president messing with the post office,"" she asked, referring to recent changes at the postal service that have slowed mail. Critics charge it was a Trump administration attempt to sabotage mail-in voting. ""Because they know we have power,"" she says, answering her question. ""Let's not ever let anyone take our power from us. Ours is the power to use our voices. And at election time that means our vote, and let's not let anyone take it from us."" As she wraps up her event, car horns blared in approval. Earlier in her speech, she brushed off Republicans attempting to label her a ""radical socialist"" and condemned Trump's tone as president. ""We know that real strength is not based on who you beat down, it is based on who you lift up,"" she said. Earlier today, Harris met with Latina businesswomen in Tucson. Chris Badillo is a progressive first-time voter who is extremely concerned by the lack of action on climate change. Angered by President Trumpâs actions on immigration and the environment, he supports Joe Biden. How does the issue of climate change impact your vote? President Trump believes that man-made climate change is a hoax. He has cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency and has utilised his administration to deregulate industries, putting the profits of fossil fuel CEOs above our countryâs future. Living in Miami, I know that my community will be the first to feel the effects of climate change. Joe Biden has committed to signing executive orders that will help move us to net-zero emissions and make an unprecedented federal investment in combating climate change, which Donald Trump actively opposes. Climate change is an existential threat to the future of my generation, and Joe Biden's policies take some of the necessary steps to mitigate its effects. Tell us about your plan to vote. I voted by mail in Miami, Florida, and the online system from my local election department confirmed that my vote has already been counted. These are membersof our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from them throughout the week. Join the conversation:  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

In Nevada, President Trump called what was happening in the city ""terrible"" and offered to send federal help. Joe Biden also condemned the violence and looting but said the protests were ""legitimate"". It reflects a difference in the two campaigns: President Trump has centred his campaign on a ""law and order"" message and criticised Democratic-run cities for allowing looters and rioters to take over their streets. Joe Biden meanwhile is walking a tightrope between acknowledging the grievances of Black Lives Matter protesters, while condemning rioting and not committing to defund the police. Seasoned US politics geeks, Jon Sopel, Emily Maitlis and Anthony Zurcher bring you the latest news and analysis from the campaign trail. On this episode of the podcast, the gang consider Donald Trump and Joe Bidenâs final pitches to the American voters, with just six days to go until voting begins! They also catch up with Heather, a voter from Ohio, who reveals which way sheâs going to cast her ballot after months of agonising.

Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida We've been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now it's our turn to respond. Joseph Main, 27, from Auckland, New Zealand, asks:Everyone is aware of President Trump's disdain for the Paris Climate Agreement. However, what could the outcome be, after this election, for more local environmental issues? The answer to this, like many things in the US, goes back to the states. Trump has certainly managed to rollback dozens of environmental protections that have local impacts, like opening up more federal lands for drilling, approving the construction of pipelines, and ending protections for migratory birds and other threatened species. But a lot of these have also been held up in the courts due to challenges by states or other groups. Twenty-five governors have joined a US climate alliance to reduce emissions, promote clean energy, improve public health and report progress on the global stage. Ten states have committed to 100% clean electricity and pollution-reduction policies, according to the Center for American Progress.A coalition,externalof thousands of cities, states and other institutions have also pledged to uphold Americaâs part of the Paris accord. If Biden wins the election, heâs promised to move the US towards a clean energy future and recommit to the Paris agreement. We may see a more national environmental approach in a Democrat-held Congress and White House, but regional leadership and grassroots efforts in the states will still be the key forces for local change. Read more about this issue: In a virtual speech from Delaware, Joe Biden has pledged not to campaign âon the false promises of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switchâ. âEven if I win, itâs going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic,â he said from his hometown of Wilmington. âI do promise this: We will start on day one doing the right things.â He also called Trump's pandemic response an ""insult"" to the victims. The live broadcast speech came after he received a briefing from health experts. The US is currently seeing an average of 71,000 new Covid-19 cases per day. Hospital admissions are rapidly climbing and so is the death toll. While Trump is holding a series of rallies in battleground states across the country, Biden has held far fewer in-person events, citing the coronavirus pandemic. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Peter Berkowitz, the US state departmentâs director of policy planning, met British officials in London earlier this month. Upon his return, he acknowledged he was infected with coronavirus. A state department official said that he had followed safety guidelines, butothers, according to the Washington Post, said he was cavalier about wearing a mask,external. Now UK officials say they will be more selective about approving visits of US officials. The incident underscores the perils of international relations: President Trump has generally been dismissive of masks - he took his mask off after being treated at hospital - and his aides have scorned wearing them during some public events. The president has said the US is ârounding a cornerâ in its efforts to fight the virus despite a spike in infections, and this attitude towards masks reinforces this political message. Some UK officials appear now to be concerned about their meetings with US officials, however, and they are trying to maintain some distance. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Alan R, 74, from Plymouth, UK, asks:Can you contrast each candidate's policies on climate change? With this, Trump's record is clear: since taking office, he's made dozens of changes and rollbacks to environmental protections, let alone his go-to call that climate change is a ""hoax"". Trump's bullet-pointed second-term agenda ignored the wider issue altogether in favour of promising the cleanest water and air.Our reporter Helier Cheung took a detailed look at Trump's record here, but (spoiler alert) these are the big policies to know: With four more years, it'll likely be more of the same. But if voters put Biden in the Oval Office, we're looking at rollbacks of the rollbacks. Biden has promised to recommit to the Paris accord, reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and turn the US into a 100% clean energy economy. He's even gone further than the official Democratic National Committee platform by saying he'll end subsidies to fossil fuel companies. This green vision will cost a cool couple trillion over four years. Do you have a question about the US presidential election that you would like our team to answer? If so,submit your question here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For a candidate who says he doesnât believe presidential preference polls, Donald Trump certainly talks about them a lot. In his first rally of the day, in Bullhead City, Arizona, the president started by mentioning a just-released survey of showing him trailing in Wisconsin, a key mid-west swing state, by 17 points. It was a âfake pollâ, he said, adding that his data on a state that helped deliver the White House to him in 2016 showed that he was up by one point. Surveys indicating heâs only up one point in traditionally conservative Texas? âI donât think so,â he said to cheers in this desert town on the border of Nevada. âIn 2016, I heard this all the time.â Over the course of four rallies in four states in the past 24 hours, the president has claimed heâs ahead and surging in Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona â battleground states, all. âWeâre going to have a great, great red wave,â he said in Arizona, predicting that his supporters â many of whom he believes are not being accurately reflected in the public polls â will cast ballots on election day, once again carrying him to victory despite predictions he may be on the verge of defeat. Kamala Harris spoke at a socially distanced rally in Tucson At a socially distanced drive-in rally in Tucson, Arizona, Kamala Harris claims Republicans are employing dirty tricks to try to suppress Democratic votes. ""Why is the president messing with the post office,"" she asked, referring to recent changes at the postal service that have slowed mail. Critics charge it was a Trump administration attempt to sabotage mail-in voting. ""Because they know we have power,"" she says, answering her question. ""Let's not ever let anyone take our power from us. Ours is the power to use our voices. And at election time that means our vote, and let's not let anyone take it from us."" As she wraps up her event, car horns blared in approval. Earlier in her speech, she brushed off Republicans attempting to label her a ""radical socialist"" and condemned Trump's tone as president. ""We know that real strength is not based on who you beat down, it is based on who you lift up,"" she said. Earlier today, Harris met with Latina businesswomen in Tucson. Chris Badillo is a progressive first-time voter who is extremely concerned by the lack of action on climate change. Angered by President Trumpâs actions on immigration and the environment, he supports Joe Biden. How does the issue of climate change impact your vote? President Trump believes that man-made climate change is a hoax. He has cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency and has utilised his administration to deregulate industries, putting the profits of fossil fuel CEOs above our countryâs future. Living in Miami, I know that my community will be the first to feel the effects of climate change. Joe Biden has committed to signing executive orders that will help move us to net-zero emissions and make an unprecedented federal investment in combating climate change, which Donald Trump actively opposes. Climate change is an existential threat to the future of my generation, and Joe Biden's policies take some of the necessary steps to mitigate its effects. Tell us about your plan to vote. I voted by mail in Miami, Florida, and the online system from my local election department confirmed that my vote has already been counted. These are membersof our US election voter panel.

"LiveLiveTrump resumes campaign blitz blaming media and techBoth the president and Kamala Harris campaign in Arizona, while Biden casts his vote in Delaware.US Election 2020","US President Donald Trump is holding rallies in Arizona â a battleground state where polls suggest Biden has the edge The president attacked the press and tech companies during a Senate hearing on how Facebook, Google and Twitter moderate content All three tech giants have been criticised by both sides during a fraught presidential election campaign Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Joe Biden cast his vote in Delaware, while his VP pick Kamala Harris is campaigning in Arizona Early voting in the US election has now topped 70 million, more than half of the total turnout in 2016 Many of those casting their ballots early are seeking to reduce their exposure to coronavirus In between the news and views from the campaign trail, our theme today is climate change and the election Edited by Helier Cheung We're wrapping up today's live coverage of the election campaign. Our teams in the UK and the US will be back again on Thursday. In the meantime, here's a reminder of Wednesday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by our writers Georgina Rannard, Sophie Williams, Victoria Bisset and Max Matza, and the editors were Rebecca Seales, Paulin Kola and Helier Cheung. Trump encouraged attendees, who stood shoulder-to-shoulder, to dance along to the YMCA With less than a week to go until election day, take a look at what the campaign trail across the US looks like amid a pandemic. Trump spoke earlier today in an Arizona town on the border with Nevada at an airport where many people did not wear masks or space out to prevent infection. Trump reportedly wished to hold the rally in Nevada, but was banned from doing so due to Covid-19 measures put in place by the state's Democratic governor. At the event, he criticised his challenger Biden's stamina saying he did not think he ""would be a good fighter"". He continued: ""One gentle little touch to the face and he's down. He's down and he wouldn't get up very quickly either, would he?""  Biden's address from Delaware was not open to the public, but was streamed online Biden's campaign said he chose to stay in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, so as not to risk catching or spreading coronavirus. He spoke from a largely empty hall for a virtual address about his plans to combat Covid-19, and then cast his vote at a local polling station. He criticised Trump's rally in Nebraska yesterday, where thousands of the president's supporters were stuck outside in the cold as midnight fell after the number of attendees overwhelmed shuttle buses set up by the Trump campaign. ""He gets his photo-op and then he gets out,"" said Biden. Pence spoke in Wisconsin, a state Trump won in 2016 Meanwhile, Mike Pence spoke in central Wisconsin and has another rally in Michigan later tonight. Despite his top aide testing positive for the virus, he has refused to quarantine, saying that he is an essential worker. Pence tested negative for Covid-19 today, his office says. Like Trump, Kamala Harris has been in Arizona today Kamala Harris was in Tucson, Arizona, where she spoke at a drive-in rally that had a few attendees listening outside of their cars. She has another drive in voter mobilisation event in Phoenix today. A former Republican senator from Arizona has appeared in an advert backing Joe Biden, as President Donald Trump doubles down in his campaign in the state. ""I've been a conservative Republican my entire life. I've never before voted for a Democrat for president. But this year, principle and conscience require me to do just that - I'm voting for Joe Biden,"" Flake, who was senator for Arizona from 2013 to 2019, said in the advert. ""And please, don't let anyone tell you that by casting your vote for Joe Biden you are somehow not being conservative. This year, the most conservative thing you can do is to put country over party."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Both President Trump and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris are in Flake's home state of Arizona right now. Trump may have won the Arizona  - a key battleground state - in 2016, but current polling gives Biden a very slim majority of 2%. Flake is not alone - he's one of several former Republican members of congress joined a campaign to back Biden in August. Trump's campaign hit back at Flake at the time, with a spokesman calling him a ""swamp creature"". A spokesman for the Republican party said Flake had ""abandoned any set of principles he once professed to have in order to embrace Joe Biden, a far-left Democrat"". Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth tells the BBC that ""it is looking pretty good all over the country"" for Democrats, particularly in light of record early voting numbers. However, she adds that ""all Democrats are pretty nervous because of 2016"" - when, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump, despite being widely expected to win. You can watch more of the interview, including Duckworth being questioned on whether Democrats would try to pack the Supreme Court, below. This video can not be played Tammy Duckworth: 'Nothing is off the table' with Supreme Court packing And if you want to know more about Duckworth's background,we profiled the Iraq war veteran and senator earlier this year, when she was considered a possible contender for Biden's running mate. With six days until the election, Democratic candidate Joe Biden is currently leading in the polls, with 51% to President Donald Trump's 43%. But while national polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, things are closer in a number of key states which could ultimately decide the outcome of the election. Find out more in our guide to the pollshere. With the president facing scrutiny over his handling of the pandemic, new audio shows his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner justifying moves to reopen the country more than six months ago. In an interview with US journalist Bob Woodward recorded on 18 April, Kushner can be heard saying: ""Trump's now back in charge. It's not the doctors. They've kind of - we have, like, a negotiated settlement."" ""There was the panic phase, the pain phase and then the comeback phase. I do believe that last night symbolised kind of the beginning of the comeback phase,"" he said in the recording, which was obtained bythe BBC's US partner, CBS News,external. Kushner spoke to Woodward after the White House released guidelines for reopening the country.The interview was first reported by CNN,externalearlier today. On the day the interview was recorded, the US death toll passed 37,000. That number has since risen to more than 227,000. Another of Woodward's interviews from the early stages of the pandemic, this time with Donald Trump and first reported last month,indicated that the president knew more about the severity of coronavirusthan he had admitted publicly. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken after Trump was hospitalised with Covid-19 in early October showed that his approval ratings over his response to the pandemic had hit a record low. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Janice Irene Gunn, 63, from Los Angeles asks:Will Joe Biden actually be able to make any strides toward eliminating climate change, given that the Senate leans toward Republican, and the House has a slim Democratic majority? Thereâs actually a real chance he could. Letâs take a look at the situation on Capitol Hill going into the election. As things stand, Republicans hold a three-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate. In the House of Representatives, which has 435 seats, Democrats hold 232 to Republicansâ 197. And analysts say itâs unlikely Democrats will lose their majority there - even among the more âvulnerableâ seats, many still favour Democrats. Meanwhile, in the Senate, there are a number of possible states that could flip from Republican red to Democratic blue, including Arizona, Colorado - and maybe even Texas. If Democrats win three seats in the upper chamber and the White House, theyâll still get the Senate majority, as the vice-president would become the tie-breaker. According to a 19 October forecast from FiveThirtyEight, Democrats have a 72% chance of winning the presidency, Senate and House this election. Action on climate change is high on the Democratic agenda, so control of the executive and legislative branches would make it likely for bills to be pushed through.

For anyone wondering what the electoral college is, when we'll find out who won and what else the election will decide, we've explained everything you need to knowhere. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC In recent years, the US and China have gone head-to-head over trade, technology and accusations of espionage. Today, the US Department of Justice charged eight people for allegedly conspiring as spies for China. China has become a key foreign policy issue in this US presidential election, with both Trump and Biden vowing to be tough on the country. âDecouplingâ is now a buzzword in US-China relations. It means reducing interdependence between the two countries, in order to mitigate risks for US national security. But disentangling the worldâs two largest economies is very complicated and potentially devastating for not only China and America, but also the rest of the world. Regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins the White House, the US-China rivalry is here to stay. Washington faces the challenge of figuring out how to work with China, while trying to protect its national security and tech competitiveness. China economic analyst Scott Kennedy told me that Washington needs to find a strategy to reach a âstable equilibriumâ with Beijing, even if the bilateral relationship becomes largely competitive. This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world The electoral college is a mystifying idea to many outside the US - and to some Americans too. Want to know how it works, and why it means you can become US president without winning the most votes? Sit back and watch this video... This video can not be played The Electoral College: Which voters really decide the US election? Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington His name is now public: Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, wrote an unsigned op-ed in 2018 that said the president was âpetty and ineffectiveâ, among other things. Now Taylor is writing under his own name, calling on people to demand a change in leadership. Taylorâs public stance is unlikely to change the minds of the presidentâs diehard supporters. But his statement may have an impact on those who are still working for the president and are considering leaving their jobs. In the meantime, he has made a splash in the media. Journalists have long wondered who Anonymous was, and his unveiling is making headlines with less than a week before the election. White House officials say he was a low-level official and that he was not only anonymous but unimportant. It is true that he may not have been high on an organisational chart. Yet he had an insiderâs knowledge of the presidentâs activities, style, policies and temperament and seemed well-placed to write the kind of expose that he did. So far Taylorâs former boss, the president, has not said anything about him or his latest work. But as the president himself would say, stay tuned.   Larry MadowoBBC News, Philadelphia Some businesses in Philadelphia are boarding up, expecting a third night of protests after the city announced a curfew. Police clashed with protesters for the last two nights after the tragic shooting of a black man, Walter Wallace, Jr. His family said the 27-year-old had mental health problems and they had called an ambulance but the police got there first. Police say they opened fire when he refused to drop a knife he was holding. A city-wide curfew has been announced from Wednesday 9pm to 6am on Thursday and businesses have been urged to close. Police say they have arrested 172 people on felony or misdemeanour grounds. Fifty-three officers have also been injured in the protests. Several big-box stores and other businesses were looted and at least nine ATMs were blown up over the last two days.The Pennsylvania National Guard has been deployed to the city.

"Shops, pubs and gyms to reopen at end of firebreak","Non-essential retail was forced to close in Wales last Friday Non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants, cafes, gyms and leisure centres will reopen after Wales' firebreak lockdown ends, the first minister has promised. The venues will be able to reopen on ""essentially the same terms"", Mark Drakeford said. But there were issues to be resolved on what rules there should be on household gatherings and travel, added. Welsh Tory Senedd leader Paul Davies said ministers should tell people now what their strategy is. Mr Drakeford told WalesOnline: ""Many of the things that people have not been able to do in these two weeks, we plan to restore."" Earlier, Welsh Government Counsel General Jeremy Miles said ministers were working on a new set of national rules for after 9 November. People in Wales are being asked to stay at home until 9 November From 23 October, non-essential retail, hospitality and gyms have had to shut their doors for the firebreak. People have been asked to stay at home unless absolutely necessary, with travel restricted. The Welsh Government said it was necessary to avoid the NHS being overwhelmed with coronavirus cases. A further 37 deaths with Covid reported in Wales Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Mr Drakeford said he anticipated ""shops that are closed at the moment will be able to reopen"" and that restaurants, bars, cafes gyms and leisure centres will be able to reopen ""essentially on the same terms as they traded before the lockdown began"". But he said ""two of the issues that are the trickiest to resolve"" are rules around household gatherings and travel. ""On both of those there is a lot of discussion still to be had. I'm keen that we resolve it by the end of this week or the beginning of next to give people as much notice we can of what will happen when the firebreak is over."" The first minister said the system of local lockdowns had been ""complicated"". ""I think the feeling is we would be better with a simpler, national set of rules,"" he said, although he said it did not mean there would not need to be local action. Meanwhile, he admitted the Welsh Government could have worked more closely with supermarkets on his decision to bar them from selling non-essential goods. The announcement promptedcriticism last week. Mark Drakeford said he was taken by surprise by the strength of reaction to the announcement last week though admitted the Welsh Government could have worked more closely with supermarkets. He said: ""We would have perhaps avoided some of the mistaken communication that led to places thinking that things couldn't have been sold when they could."" He said the government could have worked harder to explain to people that it was ""not the fortnight"" to be going out browsing in shops and added: ""The more people we meet, the more coronavirus likes it."" On Monday, Tesco apologised after saying it could not sell sanitary towels and tamponsfrom a store in Cardiff. Pubs will reopen at the end of the lockdown period At a press conference earlier, Mr Miles said Mr Drakeford would announce ""in the coming days"" any restrictions on travel or visiting families that would remain in place after 9 November ""We can expect to hear from the first minister, I think in the coming days, with a clearer picture of what is ahead following those discussions and following those decisions."" The Welsh Government is due to hold a further press briefing on Friday. Before the firebreak began, 17 areas across Wales were already under local lockdown.

Supermarket staff 'having to referee' Covid rules,"Some supermarket aisles have been closed off and clothes rails covered in cellophane Supermarket staff are being put at risk by having to ""referee"" what can be bought during Wales' coronavirus lockdown, the Welsh Retail Consortium has said. Supermarkets are only able to sell essential items until 9 November. On Tuesday, the Welsh Governmentissued a listof what can be sold and said customers could ask for non-essential items in exceptional circumstances. It follows a backlash over supermarkets closing parts of their stores. Apetition,externalon the issue exceeded 67,000 signatures, making it the largest ever submitted to the Senedd. Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, said staff were being ""placed in a very difficult position"". She told BBC Radio WalesBreakfast with Claire Summers: ""They have the discretion to determine whether or not someone can or can't have what might be deemed a non-essential item and quite frankly it's not acceptable for our retail colleagues to have to determine that need. ""It feels to us that our staff have to referee this entire system."" Ms Jones added: ""We know this policy will put them at risk."" She said the association would implement the rules but was ""deeply disappointed"". Conservative member of the Senedd (MS) Russell George said he was concerned for both shop workers and customers. He said: ""It's the wrong approach the government has taken now, particularly expecting shop workers to effectively police policy, that's not a fair system. ""It's not fair on shop workers and I think it is unfair on customers to be expected to provide private information. ""I think it is a violation of people's privacy."" He said the Welsh Government should ""allow all retail shops to open and allow supermarkets to open up their aisles and for customers to decide what is right themselves and what's essential for themselves"". Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford first announced the measures when responding to Mr George, who said it was ""unfair"" to force independent clothing and hardware retailers to close while similar goods were on sale in major supermarkets. Plaid Cymru MS Rhun ap Iorwerth said he was worried abuse would be ""thrown at shop workers"". ""I don't think shop workers should be in this situation,"" he said. But he added: ""I think Russell George is wrong to say all retail should be open because that doesn't suggest a stay at home lockdown."" Ministers have said the non-essential goods restrictions will stay until lockdown ends on 9 November Ministers have said the principle of restricting non-essential goods will stay until lockdown ends on 9 November. Announcing the list of essential items on Tuesday, the Welsh Government said it could not ""move away from the central principle that retailers must restrict the sale of non-essential goods for the duration of the firebreak"". ""We continue to work closely with the sector and would stress that these restrictions are in place to stop the spread of coronavirus and save lives,"" a spokesman said. ""We are asking the public to continue to support the effort by restricting unnecessary journeys and shopping .""

France set for second national lockdown - Macron,"This video can not be played 'We will all get there together': President Macron places France into lockdown for November French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a second national lockdown until at least the end of November. Mr Macron said that under the new measures, starting on Friday, people would only be allowed to leave home for essential work or medical reasons. Non-essential businesses, such as restaurants and bars, will close, but schools and factories will remain open. Covid daily deaths in France are at the highest level since April. On Tuesday, 33,000 new cases were confirmed. Mr Macron said the country risked being ""overwhelmed by a second wave that no doubt will be harder than the first"". Meanwhile, Germany will impose an emergency lockdown that is less severe but includes the closure of restaurants, gyms and theatres. Covid deaths in Europe rise sharply Tracking the pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Infections are rising sharply across Europe, including the UK which on Wednesday announced 310 new deaths and 24,701 new officially-recorded cases. In England, a new study estimatesalmost 100,000 people are actually catching the virus every day, with researchers warning that ""something has to change"". Night curfews are in force in several countries, including for 46 million people in France. News of the new restrictions being introduced in Europe's biggest economies led tosharp falls in the financial marketson Wednesday. The UK's FTSE 100 ended almost 2.6% lower, and Germany's Dax dropped 4.2%. Major US indexes also sank 3.4% or more. ""We are deep in the second wave,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. ""I think that this year's Christmas will be a different Christmas."" In a televised address on Wednesday, Mr Macron said that France must now ""brutally apply the brakes"" to avoid being ""submerged by the acceleration of the epidemic"". ""The virus is circulating at a speed that not even the most pessimistic forecasts had anticipated,"" he said, adding that half of all intensive care beds at French hospitals were being occupied by Covid patients. The president said that under the new rules, people would need to fill in a form to justify leaving their homes, as was required in the initial lockdown in March. Social gatherings are banned. ""Like in the spring, you will be able to leave your house only to work, for a medical appointment, to provide assistance to a relative, to shop for essential goods or to go for a walk near your house,"" Mr Macron said. But he made clear that public services and factories would remain open, adding that the economy ""must not stop or collapse"". Mr Macron added that visits to care homes - which were banned during the two-month lockdown declared in March - would be permitted under the latest measures. The curbs will apply until 1 December and will be reassessed every two weeks. The president said he retained ""hope that families will be able to be reunited for Christmas"". The French government has been taken by surprise by the virulence of this second Covid wave. Some 50,000 new cases a day are being reported and that's probably a big underestimate. The proportion of critical beds occupied by Covid patients is now 70% in Paris. The new restrictions announced by President Macron on Wednesday are similar to measures introduced in March, but with some key differences. For business, it's going to be another massive blow - especially for sectors like entertainment and events. The president promised help for French firms, but did not provide details. After the economy picked up in the third quarter, it now looks inevitable that it'll contract again between now and the end of the year, and for the whole of 2020 the government's predicting a 10% fall in GDP. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country had to ""act now"" and called for a ""major national effort"" to fight the spread of coronavirus. While Germany has a lower infection rate than many other parts of Europe, the speed with which the virus has been spreading in recent weeks has alarmed Berlin. ""Our health system can still cope with this challenge today, but at this speed of infection it will reach the limits of its capacity within weeks,"" Mrs Merkel said. This video can not be played Europe's streets empty A partial lockdown will now begin in Germany on 2 November, under terms agreed by Mrs Merkel and the 16 state premiers: Schools and kindergartens will remain open Social contacts will be limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people and tourism will be halted Bars will close and restaurants will be limited to takeaways Tattoo and massage parlours will shut Smaller companies badly hit by the lockdown will be reimbursed with up to 75% of their November 2019 takings Mrs Merkel and the state premiers are expected to reconvene by video conference on 11 November to reassess the situation The chancellor said the measures were necessary to avoid a national emergency. The German government is keen to enable families and friends to meet at Christmas, but daily infections have soared to a new high of 14,964, with 85 more deaths reported in the latest 24-hour period.

What happens to migrants who reach the UK?,"The government says ""stopping the boats"" crossing the English Channel is a key political priority. As part of this, it is pushing ahead with its plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, despite a Supreme Court judgment that the policy is unlawful. Since the Supreme Court ruling,the government has signed a new treaty with Rwanda to strengthen its asylum process, and proposed new UK laws declaring that Rwanda is a safe country. As well as the Rwanda plan, theIllegal Migration Actincludes a number of new provisions: the home secretary has a duty to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally either to Rwanda, or another ""safe"" third country migrants will not be granted bail or able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detention under-18s, those medically unfit to fly or at risk of serious harm in the country to which they are being removed, will be able to delay departure the number of refugees the UK settles through ""safe and legal routes"" is capped. The government also signed a new agreement with France, under which the UK will pay Â£500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre. Commercial documents published by the Home Office suggest thatthe government plans to spend at least Â£700m to manage small boat arrivals until 2030. How many people cross the Channel in small boats? Is migration to the UK slowing and other claims Why record numbers are suddenly being given asylum At the end of September 2023 there weremore than 56,000 asylum seekers living in hotels,externalacross the UK. The government hopes to save money by using other types of accommodation instead. There are currently about 300 asylum seekers housed on a barge called the Bibby Stockholm in Dorset, which has capacity for 500. In aletter to the Home Affairs Committee of MPs,external, the Home Office confirmed the contract to provide accommodation on the Bibby Stockholm is worth Â£22.5m. In August 2023, all of the 39 asylum seekers then on board were removed afterLegionella bacteria was found in the water system. On 12 December 2023,one of the migrants living on the barge died.The man is believed to have taken his own life. What is it like on the UK's first migrant barge? Why is Bibby Stockholm barge so controversial? No asylum seekers have yet been housed at RAF Scampton The government has alsosaid that three ex-military sites in Essex, Lincolnshire and East Sussexwill house several thousand migrants: Wethersfield in Essex is due to hold up to 1,700 people Scampton in Lincolnshire is due to hold up to 2,000 Bexhill in East Sussex is due to hold up to 1,200 Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire is also due to hold an unspecified number of people. The BBC understands about 600 asylum seekers are being housed at Wethersfield. In July 2023, some residentstested positive for tuberculosis(TB). The first asylum seekers were expected to arrive at Scampton in mid-August, but this was delayed until further notice. The Home Office says it is still ""exploring proposals"" to use the Bexhill site. In December 2023,the High Court ruled that asylum seekers could be housed at Wethersfield and Scampton, following legal action by the relevant local councils. They have applied for permission to take the case to the Court of Appeal. The Home Office commercial documents also show the government is looking for a partner to run two migrant reception centres in Kent until at least 2030 - and potentially to 2034. The Home Office insists there are a number of""safe and legal"",externalroutes to the UK. However, some are restricted to people from specific countries such as Afghanistan andUkraine,external, while other routes only accept limited numbers.Figures shown,externalare for the year to September 2023: Refugee Family Reunion- for partners and children under 18 of those already granted protection in the UK (6,114 grants) UK Resettlement Scheme- prioritises those from regions in conflict (525 grants) Community Sponsorship Scheme- for local community groups to provide accommodation and support for refugees (162 grants) Mandate Resettlement Scheme- to resettle refugees who have a close family member in the UK who can offer a home (13 grants) In April 2023, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick was asked in Parliament which safe and legal routes were available to a young person wanting to flee the conflict in Sudan. He said individuals should contact the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR. But it insisted""there is no mechanism through which refugees can approach UNHCR with the intention of seeking asylum in the UK"". Critics of the government's asylum proposals, such as the Refugee Council, say they risk breaking international law. The main principle of the1951 Refugee Convention,externalstates that refugees should not be returned to countries where they faced threats to life or freedom. Home Secretary James Cleverly said the new treaty with Rwanda addresses the UK Supreme Court's concerns The government insists its plan to send migrants to Rwanda for their asylum cases to be processedcomplies with international law. But the Supreme Court ruled in November 2023that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawfulbecause of the risk they could be moved on to countries where they could face harm, known as ""refoulement"". In response, the governmentsigned a new treaty with Rwandawhich it says will prevent refoulement. It has also publishednew legislation declaring Rwanda a safe country. No easy way forward for PM after win as Rwanda bill splits party Clarification 2 December: This article has been amended to make clear that the government's ""safe and legal"" routes are only available to certain groups of people who have already been recognised as refugees, or family members of refugees already in the UK.

'I'll be hosting my Christmas over Zoom',"Gail says it's sad not being able to see family members, but people will make more effort When aleading medical expert urged peopleto prepare for a ""digital Christmas"" last week, the response was mixed. But amid the frustration and ""mistletoe and Zoom"" jokes, some people were already rearranging their plans. ""I imagine the iPad and FaceTime will be on pretty much the whole day on Christmas Day,"" says Gail Buckie, from Edinburgh. Gail's family live about 150 miles away on the Isle of Mull and she says ""there's no way we'll be able to see them over Christmas"" - especially with her mother considered vulnerable. But she says she's already putting ""a lot more effort"" into this year's festivities - and has even booked Santa to visit her children at her doorstep because they won't be able to go to a grotto like usual. Christmas guidance 'should be same across UK' Victoria Derbyshire sorry for Christmas comments ""We've already started to stock up on extra Christmas lights,"" she tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I think I've probably, in the past, been a bit more 'less is more' type thing, but with the children spending so much time inside, we're going to decorate their bedroom. ""It will be just a wee small thing for us,"" she says. ""But we'll make it extra special trying to keep connected."" It's still too early to say what Christmas will be like for everyone. But current restrictions in Scotland ban people from visiting other households indoors, while in England, millions of people are living under tier two or three restrictions, which also ban visiting others at home. In Wales, there is currently a national lockdown requiring people to stay indoors, while in Northern Ireland indoor visits to other people's homes are also not allowed. What are the new rules across the UK? What are the rules in your area? That means Gail isn't alone in planning a digital Christmas Day. Mhairi Hamilton, from Larkhall, in South Lanarkshire, says she is ""ahead of the curve"" and has already cancelled her big family Christmas to avoid months of uncertainty. ""So I called it about six weeks ago and put a message round the family saying that I was not going to host in the house but I would host a Zoom Christmas,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""I would preserve what we could of the family traditions and we would take it from there. And the response I got from the extended family was nothing but positive. You know, things like, 'you mean we can do this in our jammies? You mean we don't have to drive?'. I'm going, yes, yes, yes."" Mhairi is currently in the process of making gift bags for her relatives, which will be filled with drinks and nibbles, and the whole family will open their Secret Santa presents on a video call. ""I'm ahead of the game and I'm loving it,"" she says. ""I'm having a great time preparing. There are undoubtedly many, many positives to be taken from it."" Becky Goddard-Hill, a parenting blogger from Nottingham, is equally positive. ""I think we can still have that family gathering but just in a different way,"" she says. She's planning a carol concert with members of her family over video call, and a cook-a-long with her mother-in-law to bake a Christmas cake. ""I'll get my kids to open their advent calendar with their grandparents online each morning just so they're still very, very much a part of our Christmas and there's still a lot of fun and togetherness at the heart of it,"" she says. ""It will probably be absolute chaos but I think that's part of the fun, isn't it? It's that being together, throwing your enthusiasm behind it."" She also suggests watching a film together at the same time as relatives living elsewhere, or sending handmade cards and long handwritten letters. But for some, the prospect of a virtual Christmas is nothing but unappealing - especially if they will be on their own. ""This Christmas my husband, a serving soldier, will be at work on Christmas Day, and my brother, who I would normally spend Christmas Day with, died in August,"" says Helen Kemp, 56, who lives in the Yorkshire Dales. ""I don't have children and other than my cousin, who has invited me for Christmas Day to her house, I don't have any close relatives nearby anymore."" Helen says she will spend Christmas morning at work - at a charity that gives discounted holidays to vulnerable people, including the homeless. ""But after that, I really didn't want to have to spend the rest of the day, until my husband comes home at half six at night, on my own."" Her area is currently in tier one - medium alert - where household mixing is still allowed in groups of up to six. But ""who knows what we will be by Christmas"", she adds. ""It has been a tough year for all of us and we need to have some normality back into our lives. ""Spending Christmas Day with family, rather than alone, is a way of normalising our lives again. ""I don't think anyone wants to be alone on Christmas Day, let alone after the year we have all had."" Earlier this week,No 10 said it wasPrime Minister Boris Johnson's ""ambition"" for people to celebrate Christmas with their families. But many scientists and politicians have taken a different view. Scotland's national clinical directorJason Leitch said it was""honestly too early to say"" what would happen at Christmas - but it was ""not going to be normal"". ""People should get their digital Christmas ready,"" he said. Prof John Edmunds, who sits on Sage,said the ideathat people could ""carry on as we are"" and then have a normal Christmas with friends and family was ""wishful thinking in the extreme"". Andanother Sage scientist saidlast week that Christmas was unlikely to be the ""usual celebration"" of ""families coming together"".

Nottinghamshire to have 9pm alcohol rule,"Nottinghamshire's auction houses, car boot sales, betting shops, saunas and tattoo parlours must close, the government has announced. The measures were revealed as it was confirmed the whole county would move into tier three at 00:01 on Friday. Alcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 GMT in shops, but can be sold until 22:00 if bought ""in hospitality venues where accompanying a substantial meal"". Hotels can remain open, as can gyms and leisure centres. Nottingham, Rushcliffe, Gedling and Broxtowehad been expected to move into the top tier of Covid restrictions on Thursday. While the tier three status has been delayed for 24 hours, it will now include the entire county. Other tier three rules include: Fitness and dance studios, sports courts and swimming pools can also remain open, although it is ""strongly advised"" group indoor classes do not take place Public buildings such as community centres, libraries and town halls are allowed to remain open to run activities such as childcare and support groups, but not for private hire, birthday parties and other social events ""Indoor entertainment and tourism venues"" have to close, but cinemas, concert halls, ice rinks and theatres are not affected by the new rules. Local lockdown rules: What Covid tier is my area in? Covid: How the new rules will work Housing Minister Christopher Pincher praised the local authorities ""for entering into productive discussions and coming to an agreement as quickly as possible"". ""We are very conscious that these new restrictions will have a huge impact on those living and working in the county, but this action is vital and is based on public health advice,"" he said. However, Nottingham South Labour MP Lilian Greenwood has criticised the government for taking ""a week and a half"" to come to an agreement over the city and county. ""It's created huge anxiety and uncertainty, by doing that I think they're undermining trust,"" she said. Micropubs like A Room with a Brew that cannot offer a ""substantial meal"" alongside pints for regulars will have to close A Room with a Brew, a micropub in Derby Road, Nottingham, lies between the city centre and the Lenton area popular with students. With no option to provide the crucial ""substantial meal"" to keep the beer flowing, licence-holder Jill Nettleton said the last week has been ""confusing"". ""Because we were expecting to close down last week we've let stocks run down, and now we've found out we can open tomorrow, which is a bit annoying"" she said. ""Why have they shut bars when nearly everything else is open?"" Jill Nettleton said not knowing if or when pubs would have to close meant buying less stock The rules on pubs in particular were a source of contention amid convivial conversation. ""I think the over-riding thing is people are genuinely confused as to why having a food option is a distinction,"" said one bemused regular. However, as often happens down the pub, a potential solution was suggested. ""Potentially you could nominate your local and just go to one place, or a small number,"" said Katy Voisey. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome also said she was not happy with the way information had been shared with local officials. ""The communication has been shoddy,"" she said. ""It's been so disrespectful. They've just treated the people of Nottingham with a total lack of respect."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nottingham had thehighest figures in the UKearlier this month, but its seven-day rate of infection has dropped again, according to the latest data. The city had the 23rd highest rate of infection per 100,000 people in England, at 451.5, in the week to 25 October - down from 611 the previous week. Mansfield's seven-day infection rate is currently at 349.5 cases per 100,000 people. Mansfield's Conservative MP Ben Bradley, who previously opposed his constituency moving into tier three, said ""big rises in cases in the north of the county"" meant it was hard to argue with the tightening of restrictions. ""The more and more those figures are similar - and we've seen Mansfield is pretty much the same as Broxtowe in terms of numbers - it's becoming increasingly difficult to make that case and treat it differently,"" he said.

Married PC who killed lover jailed,"Claire Parry died in hospital after being strangled, the court heard A police officer who strangled a mother of two after she exposed their affair to his wife has been jailed. Timothy Brehmer killed nurse Claire Parry, 41, after they met in a pub car park in Dorset on 9 May. The two had been involved in a secret relationship for more than 10 years, a trial at Salisbury Crown Court heard. Brehmer, 41, who admitted manslaughter andwas acquitted of murder by a jury on Tuesday, has been jailed for 10 and a half years. The trial heard Mrs Parry, who was married to another Dorset Police officer, met the defendant outside the Horns Inn in West Parley to confront him about another of his extra-marital affairs. Mrs Parry took hold of his phone before sending a text to his wife, saying: ""I am cheating on you."" Brehmer, of Hordle, Hampshire, said he had strangled Mrs Parry by accident during a ""kerfuffle"" in his car and that his arm ""must have slipped in all the melee"". Mrs Parry, from Bournemouth, died in hospital the following day from a brain injury caused by compression of the neck. Timothy Brehmer admitted killing Claire Parry but told the court it was an accident Mr Justice Jacobs told Brehmer he was sentencing him ""on the basis you lost your self-control following the sending of the text message to your wife where the affair was revealed, rather than on the basis that you had no intention to kill or cause really serious harm"". ""I am sure that you did deliberately take Claire Parry by the neck applying significant force with your forearm or the crook of your elbow for a period of time while she struggled against you, thereby causing...severe neck injuries,"" the judge added. ""The evidence from the pathologist was that those injuries which she described as 'severe' on a scale of mild, moderate or severe resulted from the application of significant force to the neck for a period of a minimum 10 to 30 seconds and possibly longer. ""She said it was difficult to envisage a situation where a struggle in the car imparted the necessary degree of force or could explain the extent and severity of the neck injuries."" This video can not be played Police body-worn video showed Brehmer ""crying hysterically"" after killing his lover Brehmer told the trial he had left the car without realising Mrs Parry was ""poorly"". However, the judge said as a trained police officer ""it must have been obvious"" that Mrs Parry was not breathing. ""Yet you did nothing to try to help Claire Parry,"" Mr Justice Jacobs added. ""You did not ask her how she was. That was because you knew how she was. ""You could not possibly have thought, as you said in your police interview, that she was simply taking a breath. ""You must have known that her body had gone limp after your assault on her. ""Before you walked to the car park entrance you must have seen how she was - hanging half out of the car."" Mrs Parry's husband, Andrew, said he was ""incredibly disappointed"" with the verdict and branded Brehmer a ""well-practised liar"". ""He has shown himself - as the trial exposed - to be consistently dishonest, deceitful and devious,"" he added. ""Claire was a caring nurse practitioner who helped many people in a career of over 20 years. She was a loving family member and a doting mother who leaves behind two young children. ""Her energy and enthusiasm for life were infectious and our lives are poorer without her in them."" Mr Parry previously told the court Brehmer was the ""worst kind of thief"" anddescribed the pain of telling their children that their mother was dead. ""It was like a physical weight crushing down on my chest,"" he said. Dorset Police said Brehmer had been sacked at a misconduct meeting held on 16 September. He was also placed on the national police barred list. Chief Constable James Vaughan said for a serving officer ""to take the life of another in this way is incomprehensible"".

Thanks for joining us. This live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Lauren Turner, Mary O'Connor and Sarah Collerton. We'll see you again tomorrow for more coverage of the pandemic. We'll be pausing our live coverage in a few minutes, but if you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the main stories we've covered this Wednesday: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent For the second day in a row more than 300 new Covid deaths
have been reported. Wednesdayâs figure of 310 comes after 367 were reported on
Tuesday. A week before there were 191. The figures are in line with
the current trajectory, as they're doubling every two weeks. This is a much more gradual rise than we saw in the spring
when the figures were doubling every four days at one point. It suggests the UKâs current approach is still slowing the
spread of the virus, but will it be enough? We are only at the end of October and there are already
nearly 10,000 patients in hospital â that is halfway to the peak seen in
spring. With winter ahead of us and cases continuing to rise, there
is a growing sense within government that something must be done to reverse the
trend. The UK's central government has rejected the local branding of Covid restrictions in Bristol as ""tier one plus"" measures. The city - currently in tier one - is bringing in Covid marshals, conducting more analytic work, and boosting local contact tracing, to try to curb a recent rise in infections. Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said: ""These actions are being called tier one plus. Any further actions will be based on what we're seeing locally and through discussion with our local partners across the city and central government."" But a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""There are three local Covid alert levels which are enshrined in law and we are not considering the introduction of a 'plus' system."" She added that local leaders can bring in some additional measures, however. Meanwhile, a senior council official has warned North Yorkshire's tier one status is""hanging by a thread""and that a decision on tougher restrictions could come within days. Danai HowardBBC News Belgium could reach its maximum capacity for Covid-19
patients in intensive care by next Friday if the current rate of infections
continues, officials have warned. There are currently 911 coronavirus patients in intensive care in Belgium,external, with the number having been doubling every eight days. On average, 547 people have been admitted to hospital every day over the last week, which is already 85% higher than the week before. âAt this rate, we will reach 2,000 patients [the maximum capacity] by 6 November,â
said Steven van Gucht, the spokesman for Belgiumâs coronavirus taskforce. It's been widely reported by local media thatfurther restrictions,externalwill come into force on Friday in Belgiumâs northern Flanders
region, but van Gucht has urged people not to wait until then to limit
social interactions. âWhat we are doing now will have a huge impact on the
expected November peak. It takes at least 10 days before each new
measure has an effect on hospitals,"" he said. Belgian authorities have been accused of being slow to
introduce the new measures. On Tuesday, Flemish Minister-President Jan Jambon
defended the decision to introduce the rules on Friday evening,telling
Flemish radio,external: âLet it be clear:
nobody is banned from applying the measures right away. It just takes a little
time between political decision-making and implementing those things.â Belgium is currently the second hardest-hit country in all
of Europe, after the Czech Republic. Over the last two weeks, 1,424 new cases
have been recorded per 100,000 inhabitants,according to the
ECDC,external. While Halloween will be a little different this year, one family has not let coronavirus spoil the occasion. The Hargreaves family, who live in Llandaff, near Cardiff, have created a spooky display of Halloween decorations to bring a smile to children's faces during Wales' lockdown and to raise money for charity. Rosie, 10, outside her family home in Llandaff Danny, who works in TV special effects, with one of his decorations Danny and Carmela Hargreaves, both 41, and children Harry, 14, and Rosie, 10, spent the weekend installing more than 100 decorations - including gravestones, dragons, ghosts and giant spiders. The family want people follow the rules of thefirebreak lockdown currently in force across Wales, and only come to visit while out for exercise. The Hargreaves family outside their haunted house display Their display is in aid of the charity Dreams & Wishes, which supports seriously ill children across the UK. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A driver's documents being checked in Moscow For a second day running, Russia has reported its highest daily count of Covid-19 deaths with a total of 346. It comes amid reports that the health ministry has banned doctors at state-run hospitals from making unauthorised comments on the pandemic. From now on, doctors and officials must agree comments with the ministry in advance to improve âthe efficiencyâ of public information on Covid-19. Russian media reports suggest that hospitals across the country are struggling to cope with the worsening pandemic. Five days is the average amount of time patients in the Urals city of Chelyabinsk are having to wait for an ambulance, the popularKomsomolskaya Pravda,externaltabloid says. Local authorities point to a shortage of drivers and medics, saying that they hope to cut this to three days. In Siberiaâs Omsk, two ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients showed up outside the local health ministry having been turned away from the cityâs hospitals due to overcrowding, local news siteGorod 55,externalreports. A hospital in another Siberian city, Kuybyshev, is dealing with the problem of overcrowding by putting beds in its corridors, the localTayga.info,externalwebsite reports. It published photos showing elderly patients curled up in makeshift beds in the hospitalâs stairwells. Meanwhile, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said it is âprematureâ to lift current Covid-19 restrictions as he today announced he was extending certain measures - including the wearing of masks and a requirement that 30% of staff work from home - until 29 November. Secondary school pupils will continue to study online until 8 November, he said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced next month's spending review will take place on 25 November. The government scrapped its planned multi-year spending review, choosing a one-year review instead, due to the focus on the response to the pandemic. Some local leaders criticised the move, sayinglocal authorities need ""long-term financial certainty""as they deal with the effects of Covid-19. Sunak,who confirmed the 25 November date in a tweet,external, will use his review to set departmental resources and capital budgets for 2021-22, and the devolved administrations' block grants for the same period. Downing Street has suggested Sunak could use the review to announce extra support to feed families during the holidays. Funding for the NHS and schools remains multi-year, along with priority infrastructure projects. Around of two-thirds of coronavirus fines have been issued to people under the age of 35 and the vast majority of fines went to men, new figures show. Police in England and Wales handed out 20,223 fines for breaching coronavirus restrictions between 27 March and 19 October, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council data. Of those fines:  In England, 64 fines were issued for large gatherings such as illegal raves and parties, carrying a Â£10,000 penalty. Two were handed out in Wales. Provisional figures for England's recently introduced three-tier system show 268 fines have been issued, with 65 handed out for a breach of regulations in tier one, 79 in tier two, and 124 in tier three. Another 310 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, thelatest government figures show,external. It brings the total number of coronavirus deaths to 45,675, using that measure. There have also been a further 24,701 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK as of 09:00 on Wednesday, taking the total number of UK cases to 942,275. On Tuesday, the UK recorded its highly daily death figure since May, after 367 people were reported to have died with the virus. A broad but limited lockdown in Germany is going to take place from 2 November, reports say. An earlier draft plan, which we reported on, had the start date as two days later. Under the proposals, as yet unconfirmed:  Chancellor Angela Merkel and the state premiers will reconvene on 11 November to reassess the situation, under those proposed measures. An apparent loophole in government rules for Englandhas caused confusionover whether social clubs are subject to tier three Covid restrictions on serving alcohol. Inareas placed in tier three, pubs and bars must close unless they are serving substantial meals, and alcohol can only be served as part of a meal. But some social clubs are continuing to serve alcohol to members without a substantial meal after their local councils told them it was permitted. There are thousands of members clubs across England, including conservative clubs, working men's clubs and sports clubs. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde have all advised their local social clubs that the discrepancy exists because they hold club premises certificates and not premises licences. The Association of Conservative Clubs, which represents more than 800 clubs, said ""the legislation could be amended in the future to close this 'loop hole'"". The Department for Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment. Elizabeth Lusty runs online choirs and is hosting a Halloween-themed session with fancy dress Halloween is normally a time for creepy costumes, party games and trick or treating. But with a rise in UK coronavirus cases and different rules about what you can and can't do, many of us will be wondering how we can still have a safe 31 October.

Drug companies GSK and Sanofi are tosupply 200 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidateto a global inoculation scheme. The vaccine, going through the first stages of testing, will be supplied to the Covax scheme, which is backed by the World Health Organization. Covax, which aims to deliver two billion vaccine doses around the world by the end of 2021, has already signed agreements this year with AstraZeneca and Novavax. It aims to discourage national governments from hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and to focus on vaccinating high-risk people first in every country. More than 180 nations, including China, have joined the plan, but some, including the US, have opted to stick with their own supply deals. GSK and Sanofi hope to have the first results of its trial by December. If it is successful, they will move on to further trials by the end of the year. Healthcare workers have been on the frontline of the pandemic for the last nine months, fighting to treat and save as many people infected with Covid-19 as possible. With the second wave already here in the UK, the battle isn't over yet - as the BBC's Marie-Louise Connolly found out when she spent a day observing staff at Northern Ireland's Altnagelvin Hospital. Many nurses there are working gruelling five-day stretches of 12-hour shifts to ensure colleagues and wards are not left understaffed. They are supposed to work one week of four - the next week three. They say that rarely happens. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there was talk of staff burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder and coping with depression. But despite the tremendous pressure staff are under, the BBC found a strong sense of calm and order, with patients shown huge dignity and kindness. You can read morehere. Boeing is tocut another 7,000 jobsas its losses mount in the pandemic. The US plane maker, which had already announced deep cuts, said its staff would number just 130,000 by the end of next year - 20% down on the 160,000 it employed before the crisis. The continuing pandemic and safety concerns about its 737 Max jet have contributed to a slump in orders. The pandemic has caused a huge drop in air travel, pushing major airlines to the brink of bankruptcy and forcing them to cut staff and drop plans for new aircraft. As a result, Boeing has slashed production and also cut jobs. It posted a loss of $466m (Â£354m) for the three months to 30 September, its fourth straight quarterly decline. Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check Indiaâs capital city is
witnessing a fresh spike in coronavirus cases, although overall numbers have been
declining in the country since a peak in September. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 4,853
cases, the most detected so far in a single day since the pandemic hit India in
March. This spike in cases comes after a
change in testing strategy, with the Delhi authorities moving to the gold
standard PCR tests from less accurate (but faster) rapid antigen tests. The city has re-tested about 85%
of those who had tested negative in rapid antigen tests in October, but still
had symptoms, compared with 10-15% in September. Delhi is conducting nearly
60,000 tests a day - a number thatâs been more or less constant for some
months. The proportion of positive tests
is going up steadily, which suggests the city needs a further ramping up of
reliable testing. Read more on India's testing strategies here. Wales has recorded its highest number of daily coronavirus deaths in more than six months, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford tweeted: ""I am deeply saddened the number of coronavirus deaths in Wales reported over the past 24 hours is 37 - the highest number in more than 6 months."" There have also been a further 1,414 cases of Covid-19 recorded in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 46,459. Public Health Wales said after the latest 37 deaths, the total number had risen to 1,827. On Tuesday, the UK as a whole recorded its highest daily death toll since May, after another 367 people died within 28 days of a positive test. Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check Pupis returned to classrooms in Kenya earlier this month The World Health Organization (WHO) says Kenya has witnessed a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases in the last month. It says the country reported
4,594 new cases in the past week - up
51% on the previous week. That's the second-highest number of new weekly cases in the WHO's Africa region, excluding Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia. Restrictions in Kenya were eased in late September, allowed bars and restaurants to reopen, and overnight curfew hours to be reduced. Teaching in some school
classes resumed in mid-October. Across the whole of Africa there have been 1.7 million recorded Covid cases, and more than 41,000 deaths. Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe Correspondent The European Commission is calling on member states of the EU to co-ordinate their coronavirus policies as infections continue to rise. Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen is proposing leaders of member states co-operate on quarantine rules and travel policies. Von Der Leyen says the commission wants member states to agree a European Passenger Locator Form which would allow continent-wide contact tracing. Sheâs also called for common policies on quarantine, self-isolation and travel rules and information sharing about hospital capacity. The biggest test for EU solidarity will come when a vaccine becomes available and member states have to decide how to share it between their own populations and those of their neighbours. In her call for solidarity, Von Der Leyen said: ""No-one is safe until everyone is safe."" Brussels also wants EU governments to co-ordinate their testing strategies and make more use of rapid antigen tests. It comes asGermany and France are set to enter new lockdowns. Germany is expected to have a ""lockdown light"" in November while France is set to announce a four-week lockdown which would be less severe than that in spring. Details of the measures to be introduced in each country are expected later.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Provisional figures for England's recently introduced three-tier system show 268 fines have been issued, with 65 handed out for a breach of regulations in tier one, 79 in tier two, and 124 in tier three. Another 310 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, thelatest government figures show,external. It brings the total number of coronavirus deaths to 45,675, using that measure. There have also been a further 24,701 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK as of 09:00 on Wednesday, taking the total number of UK cases to 942,275. On Tuesday, the UK recorded its highly daily death figure since May, after 367 people were reported to have died with the virus. A broad but limited lockdown in Germany is going to take place from 2 November, reports say. An earlier draft plan, which we reported on, had the start date as two days later. Under the proposals, as yet unconfirmed:  Chancellor Angela Merkel and the state premiers will reconvene on 11 November to reassess the situation, under those proposed measures. An apparent loophole in government rules for Englandhas caused confusionover whether social clubs are subject to tier three Covid restrictions on serving alcohol. Inareas placed in tier three, pubs and bars must close unless they are serving substantial meals, and alcohol can only be served as part of a meal. But some social clubs are continuing to serve alcohol to members without a substantial meal after their local councils told them it was permitted. There are thousands of members clubs across England, including conservative clubs, working men's clubs and sports clubs. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde have all advised their local social clubs that the discrepancy exists because they hold club premises certificates and not premises licences. The Association of Conservative Clubs, which represents more than 800 clubs, said ""the legislation could be amended in the future to close this 'loop hole'"". The Department for Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment.

Drug companies GSK and Sanofi are tosupply 200 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidateto a global inoculation scheme. The vaccine, going through the first stages of testing, will be supplied to the Covax scheme, which is backed by the World Health Organization. Covax, which aims to deliver two billion vaccine doses around the world by the end of 2021, has already signed agreements this year with AstraZeneca and Novavax. It aims to discourage national governments from hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and to focus on vaccinating high-risk people first in every country. More than 180 nations, including China, have joined the plan, but some, including the US, have opted to stick with their own supply deals. GSK and Sanofi hope to have the first results of its trial by December. If it is successful, they will move on to further trials by the end of the year. Healthcare workers have been on the frontline of the pandemic for the last nine months, fighting to treat and save as many people infected with Covid-19 as possible. With the second wave already here in the UK, the battle isn't over yet - as the BBC's Marie-Louise Connolly found out when she spent a day observing staff at Northern Ireland's Altnagelvin Hospital. Many nurses there are working gruelling five-day stretches of 12-hour shifts to ensure colleagues and wards are not left understaffed. They are supposed to work one week of four - the next week three. They say that rarely happens. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there was talk of staff burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder and coping with depression. But despite the tremendous pressure staff are under, the BBC found a strong sense of calm and order, with patients shown huge dignity and kindness. You can read morehere. Boeing is tocut another 7,000 jobsas its losses mount in the pandemic. The US plane maker, which had already announced deep cuts, said its staff would number just 130,000 by the end of next year - 20% down on the 160,000 it employed before the crisis. The continuing pandemic and safety concerns about its 737 Max jet have contributed to a slump in orders. The pandemic has caused a huge drop in air travel, pushing major airlines to the brink of bankruptcy and forcing them to cut staff and drop plans for new aircraft. As a result, Boeing has slashed production and also cut jobs. It posted a loss of $466m (Â£354m) for the three months to 30 September, its fourth straight quarterly decline. Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check Indiaâs capital city is
witnessing a fresh spike in coronavirus cases, although overall numbers have been
declining in the country since a peak in September. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 4,853
cases, the most detected so far in a single day since the pandemic hit India in
March. This spike in cases comes after a
change in testing strategy, with the Delhi authorities moving to the gold
standard PCR tests from less accurate (but faster) rapid antigen tests. The city has re-tested about 85%
of those who had tested negative in rapid antigen tests in October, but still
had symptoms, compared with 10-15% in September. Delhi is conducting nearly
60,000 tests a day - a number thatâs been more or less constant for some
months. The proportion of positive tests
is going up steadily, which suggests the city needs a further ramping up of
reliable testing. Read more on India's testing strategies here. Wales has recorded its highest number of daily coronavirus deaths in more than six months, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford tweeted: ""I am deeply saddened the number of coronavirus deaths in Wales reported over the past 24 hours is 37 - the highest number in more than 6 months."" There have also been a further 1,414 cases of Covid-19 recorded in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 46,459. Public Health Wales said after the latest 37 deaths, the total number had risen to 1,827. On Tuesday, the UK as a whole recorded its highest daily death toll since May, after another 367 people died within 28 days of a positive test. Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check Pupis returned to classrooms in Kenya earlier this month The World Health Organization (WHO) says Kenya has witnessed a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases in the last month. It says the country reported
4,594 new cases in the past week - up
51% on the previous week. That's the second-highest number of new weekly cases in the WHO's Africa region, excluding Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia. Restrictions in Kenya were eased in late September, allowed bars and restaurants to reopen, and overnight curfew hours to be reduced. Teaching in some school
classes resumed in mid-October. Across the whole of Africa there have been 1.7 million recorded Covid cases, and more than 41,000 deaths. Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe Correspondent The European Commission is calling on member states of the EU to co-ordinate their coronavirus policies as infections continue to rise. Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen is proposing leaders of member states co-operate on quarantine rules and travel policies. Von Der Leyen says the commission wants member states to agree a European Passenger Locator Form which would allow continent-wide contact tracing. Sheâs also called for common policies on quarantine, self-isolation and travel rules and information sharing about hospital capacity. The biggest test for EU solidarity will come when a vaccine becomes available and member states have to decide how to share it between their own populations and those of their neighbours. In her call for solidarity, Von Der Leyen said: ""No-one is safe until everyone is safe."" Brussels also wants EU governments to co-ordinate their testing strategies and make more use of rapid antigen tests. It comes asGermany and France are set to enter new lockdowns. Germany is expected to have a ""lockdown light"" in November while France is set to announce a four-week lockdown which would be less severe than that in spring.

New lockdown for Germany as France awaits decision,"This video can not be played 'We will all get there together': President Macron places France into lockdown for November French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a second national lockdown until at least the end of November. Mr Macron said that under the new measures, starting on Friday, people would only be allowed to leave home for essential work or medical reasons. Non-essential businesses, such as restaurants and bars, will close, but schools and factories will remain open. Covid daily deaths in France are at the highest level since April. On Tuesday, 33,000 new cases were confirmed. Mr Macron said the country risked being ""overwhelmed by a second wave that no doubt will be harder than the first"". Meanwhile, Germany will impose an emergency lockdown that is less severe but includes the closure of restaurants, gyms and theatres. Covid deaths in Europe rise sharply Tracking the pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Infections are rising sharply across Europe, including the UK which on Wednesday announced 310 new deaths and 24,701 new officially-recorded cases. In England, a new study estimatesalmost 100,000 people are actually catching the virus every day, with researchers warning that ""something has to change"". Night curfews are in force in several countries, including for 46 million people in France. News of the new restrictions being introduced in Europe's biggest economies led tosharp falls in the financial marketson Wednesday. The UK's FTSE 100 ended almost 2.6% lower, and Germany's Dax dropped 4.2%. Major US indexes also sank 3.4% or more. ""We are deep in the second wave,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. ""I think that this year's Christmas will be a different Christmas."" In a televised address on Wednesday, Mr Macron said that France must now ""brutally apply the brakes"" to avoid being ""submerged by the acceleration of the epidemic"". ""The virus is circulating at a speed that not even the most pessimistic forecasts had anticipated,"" he said, adding that half of all intensive care beds at French hospitals were being occupied by Covid patients. The president said that under the new rules, people would need to fill in a form to justify leaving their homes, as was required in the initial lockdown in March. Social gatherings are banned. ""Like in the spring, you will be able to leave your house only to work, for a medical appointment, to provide assistance to a relative, to shop for essential goods or to go for a walk near your house,"" Mr Macron said. But he made clear that public services and factories would remain open, adding that the economy ""must not stop or collapse"". Mr Macron added that visits to care homes - which were banned during the two-month lockdown declared in March - would be permitted under the latest measures. The curbs will apply until 1 December and will be reassessed every two weeks. The president said he retained ""hope that families will be able to be reunited for Christmas"". The French government has been taken by surprise by the virulence of this second Covid wave. Some 50,000 new cases a day are being reported and that's probably a big underestimate. The proportion of critical beds occupied by Covid patients is now 70% in Paris. The new restrictions announced by President Macron on Wednesday are similar to measures introduced in March, but with some key differences. For business, it's going to be another massive blow - especially for sectors like entertainment and events. The president promised help for French firms, but did not provide details. After the economy picked up in the third quarter, it now looks inevitable that it'll contract again between now and the end of the year, and for the whole of 2020 the government's predicting a 10% fall in GDP. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country had to ""act now"" and called for a ""major national effort"" to fight the spread of coronavirus. While Germany has a lower infection rate than many other parts of Europe, the speed with which the virus has been spreading in recent weeks has alarmed Berlin. ""Our health system can still cope with this challenge today, but at this speed of infection it will reach the limits of its capacity within weeks,"" Mrs Merkel said. This video can not be played Europe's streets empty A partial lockdown will now begin in Germany on 2 November, under terms agreed by Mrs Merkel and the 16 state premiers: Schools and kindergartens will remain open Social contacts will be limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people and tourism will be halted Bars will close and restaurants will be limited to takeaways Tattoo and massage parlours will shut Smaller companies badly hit by the lockdown will be reimbursed with up to 75% of their November 2019 takings Mrs Merkel and the state premiers are expected to reconvene by video conference on 11 November to reassess the situation The chancellor said the measures were necessary to avoid a national emergency. The German government is keen to enable families and friends to meet at Christmas, but daily infections have soared to a new high of 14,964, with 85 more deaths reported in the latest 24-hour period.

Confusion as social clubs serve alcohol in tier 3,"Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde have advised local social clubs they can serve alcohol without food An apparent loophole in government rules has caused confusion over whether social clubs are subject to tier three Covid restrictions on serving alcohol. Pubs and barsin tier threemust close unless they serve substantial meals. But some social clubs are continuing to serve alcohol to members without a substantial meal after their local councils told them it was permitted. The government said social clubs cannot sell alcohol on the premises unless they serve substantial meals. There are thousands of members clubs across England, including Conservative clubs, working men's clubs and sports clubs. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde have all advised social clubs that the discrepancy exists because they hold club premises certificates and not premises licences. The tier three regulations,external, which came into effect earlier this month, appeared not to include private members clubs because they operate under a different law which means, in effect, the members own the drink already. Preston Council posted advice,externalstating membership based social clubs ""do not sell alcohol, instead they supply alcohol to their members"". ""Therefore the requirement to close does not apply to these premises and nor do these premises need to provide a substantial meal to club members or their guests when they are drinking"". The British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive Emma McClarkin said the organisation was ""aware of this inconsistency and are raising it with government to get clarity"". ""Given the circumstances they find themselves in, it is vital, more than ever, that pubs have a level-playing field with clear guidance,"" she added. Mill Hill Working Men's Club in Blackburnposted on Facebook,externalthat it is planning to reopen on Friday, prompting some to celebrate and others to condemn the move. Blackburn with Darwen has the highest rate of new cases of Covid-19 in England, with 1,176 new cases recorded in the seven days to October 23 - the equivalent of 785.6 cases per 100,000 people. What are the social distancing rules? Halloween: Can we go trick or treating or not? What Covid tier is your area in? 'I'll be hosting my Christmas over Zoom' One person commented on the post, saying: ""Surely can't be able to open without selling substantial meals.

Club owners responded to one of the comments, saying: ""Please read the statement! We contacted the Council!"" Blackburn with Darwen Council said it is ""awaiting urgent clarification"" from government ""and will provide an update as soon as possible"". Wallasey Conservative Club treasurer Charlie White, 75, said he was ""happy to re-open"" and ""didn't agree with being locked down in the first place"". He said the Wirral club has all the Covid measures in place and is safe but that he thinks the loophole is ""likely to be closed soon"". The Association of Conservative Clubs (ACC) noted the confusion,externalon its website but said it does not consider this interpretation of the rules to be ""the government's intention"". The ACC, which represents more than 800 clubs, said ""the legislation could be amended in the future to close this 'loop hole'"". It is unclear whether social clubs choosing to remain closed will receive the enhanced tier three financial support packages. The ACC said it ""will be heavily pushing"" for such clubs to get the enhanced support ""even if the actual legislation has become muddled"" about whether it had to close. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We are asking everybody to play their part to reduce potential periods of exposure in an indoor environment. ""For areas in very high local alert levels, any pub, bar or other business, including social or members clubs, cannot sell alcohol for consumption on the premises unless it is served alongside a substantial meal.""

Nottinghamshire to move into tier 3 from Friday,"Nottinghamshire's auction houses, car boot sales, betting shops, saunas and tattoo parlours must close, the government has announced. The measures were revealed as it was confirmed the whole county would move into tier three at 00:01 on Friday. Alcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 GMT in shops, but can be sold until 22:00 if bought ""in hospitality venues where accompanying a substantial meal"". Hotels can remain open, as can gyms and leisure centres. Nottingham, Rushcliffe, Gedling and Broxtowehad been expected to move into the top tier of Covid restrictions on Thursday. While the tier three status has been delayed for 24 hours, it will now include the entire county. Other tier three rules include: Fitness and dance studios, sports courts and swimming pools can also remain open, although it is ""strongly advised"" group indoor classes do not take place Public buildings such as community centres, libraries and town halls are allowed to remain open to run activities such as childcare and support groups, but not for private hire, birthday parties and other social events ""Indoor entertainment and tourism venues"" have to close, but cinemas, concert halls, ice rinks and theatres are not affected by the new rules. Local lockdown rules: What Covid tier is my area in? Covid: How the new rules will work Housing Minister Christopher Pincher praised the local authorities ""for entering into productive discussions and coming to an agreement as quickly as possible"". ""We are very conscious that these new restrictions will have a huge impact on those living and working in the county, but this action is vital and is based on public health advice,"" he said. However, Nottingham South Labour MP Lilian Greenwood has criticised the government for taking ""a week and a half"" to come to an agreement over the city and county. ""It's created huge anxiety and uncertainty, by doing that I think they're undermining trust,"" she said. Micropubs like A Room with a Brew that cannot offer a ""substantial meal"" alongside pints for regulars will have to close A Room with a Brew, a micropub in Derby Road, Nottingham, lies between the city centre and the Lenton area popular with students. With no option to provide the crucial ""substantial meal"" to keep the beer flowing, licence-holder Jill Nettleton said the last week has been ""confusing"". ""Because we were expecting to close down last week we've let stocks run down, and now we've found out we can open tomorrow, which is a bit annoying"" she said. ""Why have they shut bars when nearly everything else is open?"" Jill Nettleton said not knowing if or when pubs would have to close meant buying less stock The rules on pubs in particular were a source of contention amid convivial conversation. ""I think the over-riding thing is people are genuinely confused as to why having a food option is a distinction,"" said one bemused regular. However, as often happens down the pub, a potential solution was suggested. ""Potentially you could nominate your local and just go to one place, or a small number,"" said Katy Voisey. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome also said she was not happy with the way information had been shared with local officials. ""The communication has been shoddy,"" she said. ""It's been so disrespectful. They've just treated the people of Nottingham with a total lack of respect."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nottingham had thehighest figures in the UKearlier this month, but its seven-day rate of infection has dropped again, according to the latest data. The city had the 23rd highest rate of infection per 100,000 people in England, at 451.5, in the week to 25 October - down from 611 the previous week. Mansfield's seven-day infection rate is currently at 349.5 cases per 100,000 people. Mansfield's Conservative MP Ben Bradley, who previously opposed his constituency moving into tier three, said ""big rises in cases in the north of the county"" meant it was hard to argue with the tightening of restrictions. ""The more and more those figures are similar - and we've seen Mansfield is pretty much the same as Broxtowe in terms of numbers - it's becoming increasingly difficult to make that case and treat it differently,"" he said.

Germany and France to decide on new lockdowns,"This video can not be played 'We will all get there together': President Macron places France into lockdown for November French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a second national lockdown until at least the end of November. Mr Macron said that under the new measures, starting on Friday, people would only be allowed to leave home for essential work or medical reasons. Non-essential businesses, such as restaurants and bars, will close, but schools and factories will remain open. Covid daily deaths in France are at the highest level since April. On Tuesday, 33,000 new cases were confirmed. Mr Macron said the country risked being ""overwhelmed by a second wave that no doubt will be harder than the first"". Meanwhile, Germany will impose an emergency lockdown that is less severe but includes the closure of restaurants, gyms and theatres. Covid deaths in Europe rise sharply Tracking the pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Infections are rising sharply across Europe, including the UK which on Wednesday announced 310 new deaths and 24,701 new officially-recorded cases. In England, a new study estimatesalmost 100,000 people are actually catching the virus every day, with researchers warning that ""something has to change"". Night curfews are in force in several countries, including for 46 million people in France. News of the new restrictions being introduced in Europe's biggest economies led tosharp falls in the financial marketson Wednesday. The UK's FTSE 100 ended almost 2.6% lower, and Germany's Dax dropped 4.2%. Major US indexes also sank 3.4% or more. ""We are deep in the second wave,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. ""I think that this year's Christmas will be a different Christmas."" In a televised address on Wednesday, Mr Macron said that France must now ""brutally apply the brakes"" to avoid being ""submerged by the acceleration of the epidemic"".

But he made clear that public services and factories would remain open, adding that the economy ""must not stop or collapse"". Mr Macron added that visits to care homes - which were banned during the two-month lockdown declared in March - would be permitted under the latest measures. The curbs will apply until 1 December and will be reassessed every two weeks. The president said he retained ""hope that families will be able to be reunited for Christmas"". The French government has been taken by surprise by the virulence of this second Covid wave. Some 50,000 new cases a day are being reported and that's probably a big underestimate. The proportion of critical beds occupied by Covid patients is now 70% in Paris. The new restrictions announced by President Macron on Wednesday are similar to measures introduced in March, but with some key differences. For business, it's going to be another massive blow - especially for sectors like entertainment and events. The president promised help for French firms, but did not provide details.

"Coral reef taller than Empire State Building foundStanding 500m (1,640ft) tall, the ""blade-like"" reef was found off Australia's far north.","Scientists used a robot to capture video of the ""massive"" reef found off Australia's northern coast An enormous coral reef has been found at the northern tip of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the first such discovery in 120 years, scientists say. At 500m (1,640ft) high, the reef is taller than New York's Empire State Building and the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Scientists on a 12-month mission found the structure, detached from the Great Barrier Reef off Cape York, last week. They were conducting 3D mapping of the sea floor in the area. A team aboard a research vessel owned by the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI), a non-profit group based in California, used an underwater robot to explore the reef. Known as SuBastian, the robot live-streamed video of the discovery on Sunday and posted it to YouTube. ""To find a new half-a-kilometre tall reef in the offshore Cape York area of the well-recognised Great Barrier Reef shows how mysterious the world is just beyond our coastline,"" said SOI executive director Dr Jyotika Virmani. The reef is higher than iconic skyscrapers such as New York City's Empire State Building ""This powerful combination of mapping data and underwater imagery will be used to understand this new reef and its role within the incredible Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area."" The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef, is home to more than 1,500 species of fish, 411 species of hard corals and dozens of other species. A robot called SuBastian filmed the reef underwater Stretching over 2,300km (1,400 miles), the reef was designated a World Heritage site in 1981 for its ""enormous scientific and intrinsic importance"". But in recent years, it has been vastly damaged by warmer seas which have killed off coral, dispersed other marine life and sped up growth of algae and other contaminants. A study published earlier this monthfound the Great Barrier Reef had lost more than half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change. Great Barrier Reef suffers third mass bleaching Australia downgrades reef outlook to 'very poor' This video can not be played Drones and scientific facilities could help the reef The reef is the first of its kind to be found in the region since the late 1800s, scientists said. There are known to be seven other tall reefs in the region, including the one at Raine Island - the world's most important green sea turtle nesting area. While the reef is bedded to the ocean floor off North Queensland, it is detached, meaning it is not part of the main body of the Great Barrier Reef. Scientists found the reef while conducting 3D mapping Described as ""blade-like"", the reef is 1.5km wide (one mile), then rises 500m to its shallowest depth of only 40m below the sea surface. ""This unexpected discovery affirms that we continue to find unknown structures and new species in our ocean,"" said SOI co-founder Wendy Schmidt. ""The state of our knowledge about what's in the ocean has long been so limited. Thanks to new technologies that work as our eyes, ears and hands in the deep ocean, we have the capacity to explore like never before. ""New ocean-scapes are opening to us, revealing the ecosystems and diverse life forms that share the planet with us."" Researchers are expected to continue surveying the northern Great Barrier Reef until 17 November. The reef is the latest discovery to be made by researchers aboard the Falkor, a Schmidt Ocean Institute ship on a year-long exploration of oceans around Australia. The institute said it had discovered up to 30 new species, including ""the longest recorded sea creature"", a 45m-long siphonophore found in April in a canyon off Western Australia's coast. The new reef was found off Cape York in Australia's far north Relatives of jellyfish and coral, siphonophores are deep-sea organisms. Many are bioluminescent, glowing green or blue to lure prey. More discoveries were made in August, including undescribed species of black coral and sponges and ""Australia's first observation of rare scorpionfish"", the institute said.

Thanks for joining us. This live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Lauren Turner, Mary O'Connor and Sarah Collerton. We'll see you again tomorrow for more coverage of the pandemic. We'll be pausing our live coverage in a few minutes, but if you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the main stories we've covered this Wednesday: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent For the second day in a row more than 300 new Covid deaths
have been reported. Wednesdayâs figure of 310 comes after 367 were reported on
Tuesday. A week before there were 191. The figures are in line with
the current trajectory, as they're doubling every two weeks. This is a much more gradual rise than we saw in the spring
when the figures were doubling every four days at one point. It suggests the UKâs current approach is still slowing the
spread of the virus, but will it be enough? We are only at the end of October and there are already
nearly 10,000 patients in hospital â that is halfway to the peak seen in
spring. With winter ahead of us and cases continuing to rise, there
is a growing sense within government that something must be done to reverse the
trend. The UK's central government has rejected the local branding of Covid restrictions in Bristol as ""tier one plus"" measures. The city - currently in tier one - is bringing in Covid marshals, conducting more analytic work, and boosting local contact tracing, to try to curb a recent rise in infections. Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said: ""These actions are being called tier one plus. Any further actions will be based on what we're seeing locally and through discussion with our local partners across the city and central government."" But a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""There are three local Covid alert levels which are enshrined in law and we are not considering the introduction of a 'plus' system."" She added that local leaders can bring in some additional measures, however. Meanwhile, a senior council official has warned North Yorkshire's tier one status is""hanging by a thread""and that a decision on tougher restrictions could come within days. Danai HowardBBC News Belgium could reach its maximum capacity for Covid-19
patients in intensive care by next Friday if the current rate of infections
continues, officials have warned. There are currently 911 coronavirus patients in intensive care in Belgium,external, with the number having been doubling every eight days. On average, 547 people have been admitted to hospital every day over the last week, which is already 85% higher than the week before. âAt this rate, we will reach 2,000 patients [the maximum capacity] by 6 November,â
said Steven van Gucht, the spokesman for Belgiumâs coronavirus taskforce. It's been widely reported by local media thatfurther restrictions,externalwill come into force on Friday in Belgiumâs northern Flanders
region, but van Gucht has urged people not to wait until then to limit
social interactions. âWhat we are doing now will have a huge impact on the
expected November peak. It takes at least 10 days before each new
measure has an effect on hospitals,"" he said. Belgian authorities have been accused of being slow to
introduce the new measures. On Tuesday, Flemish Minister-President Jan Jambon
defended the decision to introduce the rules on Friday evening,telling
Flemish radio,external: âLet it be clear:
nobody is banned from applying the measures right away. It just takes a little
time between political decision-making and implementing those things.â Belgium is currently the second hardest-hit country in all
of Europe, after the Czech Republic. Over the last two weeks, 1,424 new cases
have been recorded per 100,000 inhabitants,according to the
ECDC,external. While Halloween will be a little different this year, one family has not let coronavirus spoil the occasion. The Hargreaves family, who live in Llandaff, near Cardiff, have created a spooky display of Halloween decorations to bring a smile to children's faces during Wales' lockdown and to raise money for charity. Rosie, 10, outside her family home in Llandaff Danny, who works in TV special effects, with one of his decorations Danny and Carmela Hargreaves, both 41, and children Harry, 14, and Rosie, 10, spent the weekend installing more than 100 decorations - including gravestones, dragons, ghosts and giant spiders. The family want people follow the rules of thefirebreak lockdown currently in force across Wales, and only come to visit while out for exercise. The Hargreaves family outside their haunted house display Their display is in aid of the charity Dreams & Wishes, which supports seriously ill children across the UK. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A driver's documents being checked in Moscow For a second day running, Russia has reported its highest daily count of Covid-19 deaths with a total of 346. It comes amid reports that the health ministry has banned doctors at state-run hospitals from making unauthorised comments on the pandemic. From now on, doctors and officials must agree comments with the ministry in advance to improve âthe efficiencyâ of public information on Covid-19. Russian media reports suggest that hospitals across the country are struggling to cope with the worsening pandemic. Five days is the average amount of time patients in the Urals city of Chelyabinsk are having to wait for an ambulance, the popularKomsomolskaya Pravda,externaltabloid says. Local authorities point to a shortage of drivers and medics, saying that they hope to cut this to three days. In Siberiaâs Omsk, two ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients showed up outside the local health ministry having been turned away from the cityâs hospitals due to overcrowding, local news siteGorod 55,externalreports. A hospital in another Siberian city, Kuybyshev, is dealing with the problem of overcrowding by putting beds in its corridors, the localTayga.info,externalwebsite reports. It published photos showing elderly patients curled up in makeshift beds in the hospitalâs stairwells. Meanwhile, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said it is âprematureâ to lift current Covid-19 restrictions as he today announced he was extending certain measures - including the wearing of masks and a requirement that 30% of staff work from home - until 29 November. Secondary school pupils will continue to study online until 8 November, he said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced next month's spending review will take place on 25 November. The government scrapped its planned multi-year spending review, choosing a one-year review instead, due to the focus on the response to the pandemic. Some local leaders criticised the move, sayinglocal authorities need ""long-term financial certainty""as they deal with the effects of Covid-19. Sunak,who confirmed the 25 November date in a tweet,external, will use his review to set departmental resources and capital budgets for 2021-22, and the devolved administrations' block grants for the same period. Downing Street has suggested Sunak could use the review to announce extra support to feed families during the holidays. Funding for the NHS and schools remains multi-year, along with priority infrastructure projects. Around of two-thirds of coronavirus fines have been issued to people under the age of 35 and the vast majority of fines went to men, new figures show. Police in England and Wales handed out 20,223 fines for breaching coronavirus restrictions between 27 March and 19 October, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council data. Of those fines:  In England, 64 fines were issued for large gatherings such as illegal raves and parties, carrying a Â£10,000 penalty. Two were handed out in Wales. Provisional figures for England's recently introduced three-tier system show 268 fines have been issued, with 65 handed out for a breach of regulations in tier one, 79 in tier two, and 124 in tier three. Another 310 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, thelatest government figures show,external. It brings the total number of coronavirus deaths to 45,675, using that measure. There have also been a further 24,701 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK as of 09:00 on Wednesday, taking the total number of UK cases to 942,275. On Tuesday, the UK recorded its highly daily death figure since May, after 367 people were reported to have died with the virus. A broad but limited lockdown in Germany is going to take place from 2 November, reports say. An earlier draft plan, which we reported on, had the start date as two days later. Under the proposals, as yet unconfirmed:  Chancellor Angela Merkel and the state premiers will reconvene on 11 November to reassess the situation, under those proposed measures. An apparent loophole in government rules for Englandhas caused confusionover whether social clubs are subject to tier three Covid restrictions on serving alcohol. Inareas placed in tier three, pubs and bars must close unless they are serving substantial meals, and alcohol can only be served as part of a meal. But some social clubs are continuing to serve alcohol to members without a substantial meal after their local councils told them it was permitted. There are thousands of members clubs across England, including conservative clubs, working men's clubs and sports clubs. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde have all advised their local social clubs that the discrepancy exists because they hold club premises certificates and not premises licences. The Association of Conservative Clubs, which represents more than 800 clubs, said ""the legislation could be amended in the future to close this 'loop hole'"". The Department for Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment. Elizabeth Lusty runs online choirs and is hosting a Halloween-themed session with fancy dress Halloween is normally a time for creepy costumes, party games and trick or treating.

Drug companies GSK and Sanofi are tosupply 200 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidateto a global inoculation scheme. The vaccine, going through the first stages of testing, will be supplied to the Covax scheme, which is backed by the World Health Organization. Covax, which aims to deliver two billion vaccine doses around the world by the end of 2021, has already signed agreements this year with AstraZeneca and Novavax. It aims to discourage national governments from hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and to focus on vaccinating high-risk people first in every country. More than 180 nations, including China, have joined the plan, but some, including the US, have opted to stick with their own supply deals. GSK and Sanofi hope to have the first results of its trial by December. If it is successful, they will move on to further trials by the end of the year. Healthcare workers have been on the frontline of the pandemic for the last nine months, fighting to treat and save as many people infected with Covid-19 as possible. With the second wave already here in the UK, the battle isn't over yet - as the BBC's Marie-Louise Connolly found out when she spent a day observing staff at Northern Ireland's Altnagelvin Hospital. Many nurses there are working gruelling five-day stretches of 12-hour shifts to ensure colleagues and wards are not left understaffed. They are supposed to work one week of four - the next week three. They say that rarely happens. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there was talk of staff burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder and coping with depression. But despite the tremendous pressure staff are under, the BBC found a strong sense of calm and order, with patients shown huge dignity and kindness. You can read morehere. Boeing is tocut another 7,000 jobsas its losses mount in the pandemic. The US plane maker, which had already announced deep cuts, said its staff would number just 130,000 by the end of next year - 20% down on the 160,000 it employed before the crisis. The continuing pandemic and safety concerns about its 737 Max jet have contributed to a slump in orders. The pandemic has caused a huge drop in air travel, pushing major airlines to the brink of bankruptcy and forcing them to cut staff and drop plans for new aircraft. As a result, Boeing has slashed production and also cut jobs. It posted a loss of $466m (Â£354m) for the three months to 30 September, its fourth straight quarterly decline. Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check Indiaâs capital city is
witnessing a fresh spike in coronavirus cases, although overall numbers have been
declining in the country since a peak in September. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 4,853
cases, the most detected so far in a single day since the pandemic hit India in
March. This spike in cases comes after a
change in testing strategy, with the Delhi authorities moving to the gold
standard PCR tests from less accurate (but faster) rapid antigen tests. The city has re-tested about 85%
of those who had tested negative in rapid antigen tests in October, but still
had symptoms, compared with 10-15% in September. Delhi is conducting nearly
60,000 tests a day - a number thatâs been more or less constant for some
months. The proportion of positive tests
is going up steadily, which suggests the city needs a further ramping up of
reliable testing. Read more on India's testing strategies here. Wales has recorded its highest number of daily coronavirus deaths in more than six months, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford tweeted: ""I am deeply saddened the number of coronavirus deaths in Wales reported over the past 24 hours is 37 - the highest number in more than 6 months."" There have also been a further 1,414 cases of Covid-19 recorded in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 46,459. Public Health Wales said after the latest 37 deaths, the total number had risen to 1,827. On Tuesday, the UK as a whole recorded its highest daily death toll since May, after another 367 people died within 28 days of a positive test. Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check Pupis returned to classrooms in Kenya earlier this month The World Health Organization (WHO) says Kenya has witnessed a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases in the last month. It says the country reported
4,594 new cases in the past week - up
51% on the previous week. That's the second-highest number of new weekly cases in the WHO's Africa region, excluding Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia. Restrictions in Kenya were eased in late September, allowed bars and restaurants to reopen, and overnight curfew hours to be reduced. Teaching in some school
classes resumed in mid-October. Across the whole of Africa there have been 1.7 million recorded Covid cases, and more than 41,000 deaths. Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe Correspondent The European Commission is calling on member states of the EU to co-ordinate their coronavirus policies as infections continue to rise. Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen is proposing leaders of member states co-operate on quarantine rules and travel policies. Von Der Leyen says the commission wants member states to agree a European Passenger Locator Form which would allow continent-wide contact tracing. Sheâs also called for common policies on quarantine, self-isolation and travel rules and information sharing about hospital capacity. The biggest test for EU solidarity will come when a vaccine becomes available and member states have to decide how to share it between their own populations and those of their neighbours. In her call for solidarity, Von Der Leyen said: ""No-one is safe until everyone is safe."" Brussels also wants EU governments to co-ordinate their testing strategies and make more use of rapid antigen tests. It comes asGermany and France are set to enter new lockdowns. Germany is expected to have a ""lockdown light"" in November while France is set to announce a four-week lockdown which would be less severe than that in spring. Details of the measures to be introduced in each country are expected later.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Comic Relief will stop sending stars to Africa,"Stacey Dooley was criticised for a fundraising film she made in Uganda last year Comic Relief will stop sending celebrities to Africa after criticism that stars like Stacey Dooley were going to Africa as ""white saviours"". The charity will also stop using images of starving people or critically ill children to portray the continent, it has announced. Instead, its fundraising appeals will be made by local film-makers with a ""more authentic perspective"". Sir Lenny Henry, who co-founded Comic Relief, called it ""a huge move"". ""I think it's about time,"" he said. ""And it's not to say that the films that have been made in the past weren't extraordinary and didn't have a huge effect. ""But it's time for young black and brown film-makers to take charge and say, 'I want to tell you my story'. He added: ""There are other ways to elicit sympathy - and maybe we'd been pushing on the same button for too long."" Comic Relief to curb celebrity appeals Dooley hits back at Comic Relief criticism Did Ed Sheeran commit 'poverty tourism'? As part of the new approach, Comic Relief will preview three videos by film-makers from across the African continent on Wednesday. The films will explore issues including mental health, climate change and forced marriages. The move comes after a backlash against the charity's tactic of sending British stars to poor African villages and filming their reactions. Sir Lenny Henry called the changes a ""much-needed step forward"" Last year, Labour MP David Lammy criticised an appeal in which documentary maker Stacey Dooley travelled to Uganda to visit a neonatal clinic that Comic Relief had supported. He said pictures of the Strictly Come Dancing winner holding a young Ugandan boy were perpetuating ""tired and unhelpful stereotypes"". ""The world does not need any more white saviours,"" he added, saying the picture evoked ""a colonial image of a white, beautiful heroine holding a black child, with no agency, no parents in sight"". In 2017, a video Ed Sheeran filmed in Liberia for Comic Relief was handed a ""Rusty Radiator"" award, given to the ""most offensive and stereotypical fundraising video of the year"". Speaking to MPs last year, Comic Relief co-founder Richard Curtis said the charity was moving away from celebrity-led fundraising films. He said it would be ""very careful to give voices to people"" who live in Africa. This video can not be played The women behind #nowhitesaviours On Wednesday, Comic Relief said it was finalising new ""story-telling guidelines"", which would include a stronger focus on ""grassroots"" workers in appeal films. The charity also said it will work with media organisations across Africa to raise ""awareness of wider narratives across the continent"" and promised to make ""every aspect"" of its production ""more diverse and inclusive"". ""I'm proud that Comic Relief is making these changes and I am looking forward to seeing the films next year,"" said Sir Lenny. ""Investing in local talent across Africa to tell stories from their communities is great and a much-needed step forward, but as always there is more that can be done.

Halloween: Can we go trick or treating?,"From trick or treating to apple bobbing, the traditions of 31 October aren't things you would immediately consider to be ""Covid-safe"". So does that mean Halloween is cancelled? The answer kind of depends on where you live. In Scotland, trick or treating - or guising - has beenstrongly discouraged by the government, with Deputy First Minister John Swinney telling parents going door-to-door ""brings an additional and avoidable risk of spreading the virus"". ""Our clear advice for families is to avoid it,"" he said. And withpeople banned from meeting other households indoors, Halloween parties are also definitely off the cards. In Wales, Halloween falls during a 17-day firebreak lockdown, meaning meeting people from other households, either indoors or outdoors, is not allowed. ""We are asking people to stay home during the firebreak period to slow the spread of coronavirus and help save lives,"" a government spokesman said. Children told 'stay at home' this Halloween What are the rules on meeting up? Will Christmas celebrations be the same this year? Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency (PHA) has said it is important peoplecontinue to follow the restrictions, which prevent meeting indoors with other households and restrict the number of people who can meet outside to 15. Dr Gerry Waldron, head of health protection at PHA, said apple bobbing was a definite no-no, and asked people not to trick or treat. So what about in England? Well, it depends on what tier your local area is in. Downing Street has suggested trick or treating can take place as long as the local restrictions are followed. The prime minister's official spokesman this week said: ""The rules are those which apply to household mixing in general and what that means in practice is if you are in a very high alert level (Tier 3) then you cannot mix with other households indoors or in private outdoor spaces. ""If you're in a high Covid alert level (Tier 2) then the rule of six applies in private gardens and outdoor spaces but households must not mix indoors. ""And in terms of the medium alert level (Tier 1), you can meet indoors and outdoors in groups of no more than six people."" He added people would have to use their common sense. The Cabinet Office said people should check which restrictions applied to them, but said it was not planning to give specific guidance on Halloween. What are the restrictions where I live? In the US, where Halloween is big business,some cities have already said traditional trick or treating is not recommended,external. And the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasoutlined guidance on how risky Halloween activities are,external, ranging from lower-risk activities to higher risk ones. The safer activities, it said, included having a movie night with your family, carving pumpkins with your own household or going on a socially-distanced scavenger hunt to find Halloween-theme items outside. Higher risk activities include traditional trick or treating, where sweets are handed to children, and fancy dress parities indoors. Shared bowls of unwrapped sweets aren't recommended for trick or treaters So what are the risks of trick or treating? ""If you're doing something that increases your contacts with other people then you are automatically increasing their risk and your risk,"" says Dr Chris Smith, a virologist at the University of Cambridge. Covid-19 can be spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus, as well as through droplets breathed in. ""There's the issue of how you give a treat,"" he said. ""If everyone's scrabbling round in a bucket full of sweets and they touch all of them then there's a risk of transmission."" To reduce this risk, he recommends giving out individually wrapped sweets so children aren't touching something they then put straight in their mouths. Safer still, you could leave sweets outside the door for people to help themselves. But while large gatherings are probably off the cards this year, virtual events are still a possibility. Elizabeth Lusty runs online choirs for children and adults and is hosting a Halloween-themed session with fancy dress and singalongs to tunes like Monster Mash and Time Warp. Usually she would host a Halloween party for her children, Scarlett, aged three, and seven-year-old Frank, but this year the family, from west London, won't be able to. Elizabeth would normally host a Halloween party for her children Instead, she's still planning to decorate the house and hopes to try to organise a safe trail with some of her neighbours who are doing the same. In Bristol, a map of the ""spookiest houses"" has been created by a mother of five who says she is ""obsessed by Halloween"". Natasha Wood set up the Facebook group Halloween displays in Bristol when she realised trick or treating would be different this year due to coronavirus, Organise a Halloween treasure hunt within your own household Host a virtual party with themed games and music Watch a scary movie with the family Decorate your own house and organise a spooky trail, avoiding face-to-face contact Try reverse trick or treating by dropping off pre-packed sweets on neighbours' doorsteps Since then more than 170 decorated Halloween houses have been added to a digital map covering most of the city. Among the displays is an 18ft (5.49m) pirate ship complete with skeleton crew. ""I didn't expect it to but it has literally snowballed and gone crazy in the last two weeks,"" Ms Wood said. A Halloween pirate ship comes complete with a skeleton crew in Bristol A similar scheme has been organised in the Marple area of Stockport, with an online map of decorated houses created for families to follow. People are being encouraged to remain two metres apart and not to knock on doors or leave out treats - so children will only be able to admire pumpkin displays from a distance. And of course, if you're dressing up, why not make your mask part of your costume. ""Because it's Halloween I'd say people are quite likely to be wearing a mask anyway,"" Dr Chris Smith adds. ""So if they can make a face covering work it's way into their costume then even better."" BBC IPLAYER EXCLUSIVE:Would you like a sneak peek at the new series of His Dark Materials?

LiveLiveUS early voting passes half the turnout in 20161 minute ago,"US President Donald Trump is holding rallies in Arizona â a battleground state where polls suggest Biden has the edge The president attacked the press and tech companies during a Senate hearing on how Facebook, Google and Twitter moderate content All three tech giants have been criticised by both sides during a fraught presidential election campaign Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Joe Biden cast his vote in Delaware, while his VP pick Kamala Harris is campaigning in Arizona Early voting in the US election has now topped 70 million, more than half of the total turnout in 2016 Many of those casting their ballots early are seeking to reduce their exposure to coronavirus In between the news and views from the campaign trail, our theme today is climate change and the election Edited by Helier Cheung We're wrapping up today's live coverage of the election campaign. Our teams in the UK and the US will be back again on Thursday. In the meantime, here's a reminder of Wednesday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by our writers Georgina Rannard, Sophie Williams, Victoria Bisset and Max Matza, and the editors were Rebecca Seales, Paulin Kola and Helier Cheung. Trump encouraged attendees, who stood shoulder-to-shoulder, to dance along to the YMCA With less than a week to go until election day, take a look at what the campaign trail across the US looks like amid a pandemic. Trump spoke earlier today in an Arizona town on the border with Nevada at an airport where many people did not wear masks or space out to prevent infection. Trump reportedly wished to hold the rally in Nevada, but was banned from doing so due to Covid-19 measures put in place by the state's Democratic governor. At the event, he criticised his challenger Biden's stamina saying he did not think he ""would be a good fighter"". He continued: ""One gentle little touch to the face and he's down. He's down and he wouldn't get up very quickly either, would he?""  Biden's address from Delaware was not open to the public, but was streamed online Biden's campaign said he chose to stay in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, so as not to risk catching or spreading coronavirus. He spoke from a largely empty hall for a virtual address about his plans to combat Covid-19, and then cast his vote at a local polling station. He criticised Trump's rally in Nebraska yesterday, where thousands of the president's supporters were stuck outside in the cold as midnight fell after the number of attendees overwhelmed shuttle buses set up by the Trump campaign. ""He gets his photo-op and then he gets out,"" said Biden. Pence spoke in Wisconsin, a state Trump won in 2016 Meanwhile, Mike Pence spoke in central Wisconsin and has another rally in Michigan later tonight. Despite his top aide testing positive for the virus, he has refused to quarantine, saying that he is an essential worker. Pence tested negative for Covid-19 today, his office says. Like Trump, Kamala Harris has been in Arizona today Kamala Harris was in Tucson, Arizona, where she spoke at a drive-in rally that had a few attendees listening outside of their cars. She has another drive in voter mobilisation event in Phoenix today. A former Republican senator from Arizona has appeared in an advert backing Joe Biden, as President Donald Trump doubles down in his campaign in the state. ""I've been a conservative Republican my entire life. I've never before voted for a Democrat for president. But this year, principle and conscience require me to do just that - I'm voting for Joe Biden,"" Flake, who was senator for Arizona from 2013 to 2019, said in the advert. ""And please, don't let anyone tell you that by casting your vote for Joe Biden you are somehow not being conservative. This year, the most conservative thing you can do is to put country over party."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Both President Trump and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris are in Flake's home state of Arizona right now. Trump may have won the Arizona  - a key battleground state - in 2016, but current polling gives Biden a very slim majority of 2%. Flake is not alone - he's one of several former Republican members of congress joined a campaign to back Biden in August. Trump's campaign hit back at Flake at the time, with a spokesman calling him a ""swamp creature"". A spokesman for the Republican party said Flake had ""abandoned any set of principles he once professed to have in order to embrace Joe Biden, a far-left Democrat"". Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth tells the BBC that ""it is looking pretty good all over the country"" for Democrats, particularly in light of record early voting numbers. However, she adds that ""all Democrats are pretty nervous because of 2016"" - when, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump, despite being widely expected to win. You can watch more of the interview, including Duckworth being questioned on whether Democrats would try to pack the Supreme Court, below. This video can not be played Tammy Duckworth: 'Nothing is off the table' with Supreme Court packing And if you want to know more about Duckworth's background,we profiled the Iraq war veteran and senator earlier this year, when she was considered a possible contender for Biden's running mate. With six days until the election, Democratic candidate Joe Biden is currently leading in the polls, with 51% to President Donald Trump's 43%. But while national polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, things are closer in a number of key states which could ultimately decide the outcome of the election. Find out more in our guide to the pollshere. With the president facing scrutiny over his handling of the pandemic, new audio shows his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner justifying moves to reopen the country more than six months ago. In an interview with US journalist Bob Woodward recorded on 18 April, Kushner can be heard saying: ""Trump's now back in charge. It's not the doctors. They've kind of - we have, like, a negotiated settlement."" ""There was the panic phase, the pain phase and then the comeback phase. I do believe that last night symbolised kind of the beginning of the comeback phase,"" he said in the recording, which was obtained bythe BBC's US partner, CBS News,external. Kushner spoke to Woodward after the White House released guidelines for reopening the country.The interview was first reported by CNN,externalearlier today. On the day the interview was recorded, the US death toll passed 37,000. That number has since risen to more than 227,000. Another of Woodward's interviews from the early stages of the pandemic, this time with Donald Trump and first reported last month,indicated that the president knew more about the severity of coronavirusthan he had admitted publicly. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken after Trump was hospitalised with Covid-19 in early October showed that his approval ratings over his response to the pandemic had hit a record low. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Janice Irene Gunn, 63, from Los Angeles asks:Will Joe Biden actually be able to make any strides toward eliminating climate change, given that the Senate leans toward Republican, and the House has a slim Democratic majority? Thereâs actually a real chance he could. Letâs take a look at the situation on Capitol Hill going into the election. As things stand, Republicans hold a three-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate. In the House of Representatives, which has 435 seats, Democrats hold 232 to Republicansâ 197. And analysts say itâs unlikely Democrats will lose their majority there - even among the more âvulnerableâ seats, many still favour Democrats. Meanwhile, in the Senate, there are a number of possible states that could flip from Republican red to Democratic blue, including Arizona, Colorado - and maybe even Texas. If Democrats win three seats in the upper chamber and the White House, theyâll still get the Senate majority, as the vice-president would become the tie-breaker. According to a 19 October forecast from FiveThirtyEight, Democrats have a 72% chance of winning the presidency, Senate and House this election. Action on climate change is high on the Democratic agenda, so control of the executive and legislative branches would make it likely for bills to be pushed through.

For anyone wondering what the electoral college is, when we'll find out who won and what else the election will decide, we've explained everything you need to knowhere. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC In recent years, the US and China have gone head-to-head over trade, technology and accusations of espionage. Today, the US Department of Justice charged eight people for allegedly conspiring as spies for China. China has become a key foreign policy issue in this US presidential election, with both Trump and Biden vowing to be tough on the country. âDecouplingâ is now a buzzword in US-China relations. It means reducing interdependence between the two countries, in order to mitigate risks for US national security. But disentangling the worldâs two largest economies is very complicated and potentially devastating for not only China and America, but also the rest of the world. Regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins the White House, the US-China rivalry is here to stay. Washington faces the challenge of figuring out how to work with China, while trying to protect its national security and tech competitiveness. China economic analyst Scott Kennedy told me that Washington needs to find a strategy to reach a âstable equilibriumâ with Beijing, even if the bilateral relationship becomes largely competitive. This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world The electoral college is a mystifying idea to many outside the US - and to some Americans too. Want to know how it works, and why it means you can become US president without winning the most votes? Sit back and watch this video... This video can not be played The Electoral College: Which voters really decide the US election? Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington His name is now public: Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, wrote an unsigned op-ed in 2018 that said the president was âpetty and ineffectiveâ, among other things. Now Taylor is writing under his own name, calling on people to demand a change in leadership. Taylorâs public stance is unlikely to change the minds of the presidentâs diehard supporters. But his statement may have an impact on those who are still working for the president and are considering leaving their jobs. In the meantime, he has made a splash in the media. Journalists have long wondered who Anonymous was, and his unveiling is making headlines with less than a week before the election. White House officials say he was a low-level official and that he was not only anonymous but unimportant. It is true that he may not have been high on an organisational chart. Yet he had an insiderâs knowledge of the presidentâs activities, style, policies and temperament and seemed well-placed to write the kind of expose that he did. So far Taylorâs former boss, the president, has not said anything about him or his latest work. But as the president himself would say, stay tuned.   Larry MadowoBBC News, Philadelphia Some businesses in Philadelphia are boarding up, expecting a third night of protests after the city announced a curfew. Police clashed with protesters for the last two nights after the tragic shooting of a black man, Walter Wallace, Jr. His family said the 27-year-old had mental health problems and they had called an ambulance but the police got there first. Police say they opened fire when he refused to drop a knife he was holding. A city-wide curfew has been announced from Wednesday 9pm to 6am on Thursday and businesses have been urged to close. Police say they have arrested 172 people on felony or misdemeanour grounds. Fifty-three officers have also been injured in the protests. Several big-box stores and other businesses were looted and at least nine ATMs were blown up over the last two days.The Pennsylvania National Guard has been deployed to the city. In Nevada, President Trump called what was happening in the city ""terrible"" and offered to send federal help. Joe Biden also condemned the violence and looting but said the protests were ""legitimate"". It reflects a difference in the two campaigns: President Trump has centred his campaign on a ""law and order"" message and criticised Democratic-run cities for allowing looters and rioters to take over their streets. Joe Biden meanwhile is walking a tightrope between acknowledging the grievances of Black Lives Matter protesters, while condemning rioting and not committing to defund the police. Seasoned US politics geeks, Jon Sopel, Emily Maitlis and Anthony Zurcher bring you the latest news and analysis from the campaign trail. On this episode of the podcast, the gang consider Donald Trump and Joe Bidenâs final pitches to the American voters, with just six days to go until voting begins! They also catch up with Heather, a voter from Ohio, who reveals which way sheâs going to cast her ballot after months of agonising.

Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida We've been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now it's our turn to respond. Joseph Main, 27, from Auckland, New Zealand, asks:Everyone is aware of President Trump's disdain for the Paris Climate Agreement. However, what could the outcome be, after this election, for more local environmental issues? The answer to this, like many things in the US, goes back to the states. Trump has certainly managed to rollback dozens of environmental protections that have local impacts, like opening up more federal lands for drilling, approving the construction of pipelines, and ending protections for migratory birds and other threatened species. But a lot of these have also been held up in the courts due to challenges by states or other groups. Twenty-five governors have joined a US climate alliance to reduce emissions, promote clean energy, improve public health and report progress on the global stage. Ten states have committed to 100% clean electricity and pollution-reduction policies, according to the Center for American Progress.A coalition,externalof thousands of cities, states and other institutions have also pledged to uphold Americaâs part of the Paris accord. If Biden wins the election, heâs promised to move the US towards a clean energy future and recommit to the Paris agreement. We may see a more national environmental approach in a Democrat-held Congress and White House, but regional leadership and grassroots efforts in the states will still be the key forces for local change. Read more about this issue: In a virtual speech from Delaware, Joe Biden has pledged not to campaign âon the false promises of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switchâ. âEven if I win, itâs going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic,â he said from his hometown of Wilmington. âI do promise this: We will start on day one doing the right things.â He also called Trump's pandemic response an ""insult"" to the victims. The live broadcast speech came after he received a briefing from health experts. The US is currently seeing an average of 71,000 new Covid-19 cases per day. Hospital admissions are rapidly climbing and so is the death toll. While Trump is holding a series of rallies in battleground states across the country, Biden has held far fewer in-person events, citing the coronavirus pandemic. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Peter Berkowitz, the US state departmentâs director of policy planning, met British officials in London earlier this month. Upon his return, he acknowledged he was infected with coronavirus. A state department official said that he had followed safety guidelines, butothers, according to the Washington Post, said he was cavalier about wearing a mask,external. Now UK officials say they will be more selective about approving visits of US officials. The incident underscores the perils of international relations: President Trump has generally been dismissive of masks - he took his mask off after being treated at hospital - and his aides have scorned wearing them during some public events. The president has said the US is ârounding a cornerâ in its efforts to fight the virus despite a spike in infections, and this attitude towards masks reinforces this political message. Some UK officials appear now to be concerned about their meetings with US officials, however, and they are trying to maintain some distance. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Alan R, 74, from Plymouth, UK, asks:Can you contrast each candidate's policies on climate change? With this, Trump's record is clear: since taking office, he's made dozens of changes and rollbacks to environmental protections, let alone his go-to call that climate change is a ""hoax"". Trump's bullet-pointed second-term agenda ignored the wider issue altogether in favour of promising the cleanest water and air.Our reporter Helier Cheung took a detailed look at Trump's record here, but (spoiler alert) these are the big policies to know: With four more years, it'll likely be more of the same. But if voters put Biden in the Oval Office, we're looking at rollbacks of the rollbacks. Biden has promised to recommit to the Paris accord, reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and turn the US into a 100% clean energy economy. He's even gone further than the official Democratic National Committee platform by saying he'll end subsidies to fossil fuel companies. This green vision will cost a cool couple trillion over four years. Do you have a question about the US presidential election that you would like our team to answer? If so,submit your question here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For a candidate who says he doesnât believe presidential preference polls, Donald Trump certainly talks about them a lot. In his first rally of the day, in Bullhead City, Arizona, the president started by mentioning a just-released survey of showing him trailing in Wisconsin, a key mid-west swing state, by 17 points. It was a âfake pollâ, he said, adding that his data on a state that helped deliver the White House to him in 2016 showed that he was up by one point. Surveys indicating heâs only up one point in traditionally conservative Texas? âI donât think so,â he said to cheers in this desert town on the border of Nevada. âIn 2016, I heard this all the time.â Over the course of four rallies in four states in the past 24 hours, the president has claimed heâs ahead and surging in Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona â battleground states, all. âWeâre going to have a great, great red wave,â he said in Arizona, predicting that his supporters â many of whom he believes are not being accurately reflected in the public polls â will cast ballots on election day, once again carrying him to victory despite predictions he may be on the verge of defeat. Kamala Harris spoke at a socially distanced rally in Tucson At a socially distanced drive-in rally in Tucson, Arizona, Kamala Harris claims Republicans are employing dirty tricks to try to suppress Democratic votes. ""Why is the president messing with the post office,"" she asked, referring to recent changes at the postal service that have slowed mail. Critics charge it was a Trump administration attempt to sabotage mail-in voting. ""Because they know we have power,"" she says, answering her question. ""Let's not ever let anyone take our power from us. Ours is the power to use our voices. And at election time that means our vote, and let's not let anyone take it from us."" As she wraps up her event, car horns blared in approval. Earlier in her speech, she brushed off Republicans attempting to label her a ""radical socialist"" and condemned Trump's tone as president. ""We know that real strength is not based on who you beat down, it is based on who you lift up,"" she said. Earlier today, Harris met with Latina businesswomen in Tucson. Chris Badillo is a progressive first-time voter who is extremely concerned by the lack of action on climate change. Angered by President Trumpâs actions on immigration and the environment, he supports Joe Biden. How does the issue of climate change impact your vote? President Trump believes that man-made climate change is a hoax. He has cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency and has utilised his administration to deregulate industries, putting the profits of fossil fuel CEOs above our countryâs future. Living in Miami, I know that my community will be the first to feel the effects of climate change. Joe Biden has committed to signing executive orders that will help move us to net-zero emissions and make an unprecedented federal investment in combating climate change, which Donald Trump actively opposes. Climate change is an existential threat to the future of my generation, and Joe Biden's policies take some of the necessary steps to mitigate its effects. Tell us about your plan to vote. I voted by mail in Miami, Florida, and the online system from my local election department confirmed that my vote has already been counted. These are membersof our US election voter panel.

Our teams in the UK and the US will be back again on Thursday. In the meantime, here's a reminder of Wednesday's key developments:  Today's live page was brought to you by our writers Georgina Rannard, Sophie Williams, Victoria Bisset and Max Matza, and the editors were Rebecca Seales, Paulin Kola and Helier Cheung. Trump encouraged attendees, who stood shoulder-to-shoulder, to dance along to the YMCA With less than a week to go until election day, take a look at what the campaign trail across the US looks like amid a pandemic. Trump spoke earlier today in an Arizona town on the border with Nevada at an airport where many people did not wear masks or space out to prevent infection. Trump reportedly wished to hold the rally in Nevada, but was banned from doing so due to Covid-19 measures put in place by the state's Democratic governor. At the event, he criticised his challenger Biden's stamina saying he did not think he ""would be a good fighter"". He continued: ""One gentle little touch to the face and he's down. He's down and he wouldn't get up very quickly either, would he?""  Biden's address from Delaware was not open to the public, but was streamed online Biden's campaign said he chose to stay in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, so as not to risk catching or spreading coronavirus. He spoke from a largely empty hall for a virtual address about his plans to combat Covid-19, and then cast his vote at a local polling station. He criticised Trump's rally in Nebraska yesterday, where thousands of the president's supporters were stuck outside in the cold as midnight fell after the number of attendees overwhelmed shuttle buses set up by the Trump campaign. ""He gets his photo-op and then he gets out,"" said Biden. Pence spoke in Wisconsin, a state Trump won in 2016 Meanwhile, Mike Pence spoke in central Wisconsin and has another rally in Michigan later tonight. Despite his top aide testing positive for the virus, he has refused to quarantine, saying that he is an essential worker. Pence tested negative for Covid-19 today, his office says. Like Trump, Kamala Harris has been in Arizona today Kamala Harris was in Tucson, Arizona, where she spoke at a drive-in rally that had a few attendees listening outside of their cars. She has another drive in voter mobilisation event in Phoenix today. A former Republican senator from Arizona has appeared in an advert backing Joe Biden, as President Donald Trump doubles down in his campaign in the state. ""I've been a conservative Republican my entire life. I've never before voted for a Democrat for president. But this year, principle and conscience require me to do just that - I'm voting for Joe Biden,"" Flake, who was senator for Arizona from 2013 to 2019, said in the advert. ""And please, don't let anyone tell you that by casting your vote for Joe Biden you are somehow not being conservative. This year, the most conservative thing you can do is to put country over party."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Both President Trump and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris are in Flake's home state of Arizona right now. Trump may have won the Arizona  - a key battleground state - in 2016, but current polling gives Biden a very slim majority of 2%. Flake is not alone - he's one of several former Republican members of congress joined a campaign to back Biden in August. Trump's campaign hit back at Flake at the time, with a spokesman calling him a ""swamp creature"". A spokesman for the Republican party said Flake had ""abandoned any set of principles he once professed to have in order to embrace Joe Biden, a far-left Democrat"". Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth tells the BBC that ""it is looking pretty good all over the country"" for Democrats, particularly in light of record early voting numbers. However, she adds that ""all Democrats are pretty nervous because of 2016"" - when, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump, despite being widely expected to win. You can watch more of the interview, including Duckworth being questioned on whether Democrats would try to pack the Supreme Court, below. This video can not be played Tammy Duckworth: 'Nothing is off the table' with Supreme Court packing And if you want to know more about Duckworth's background,we profiled the Iraq war veteran and senator earlier this year, when she was considered a possible contender for Biden's running mate. With six days until the election, Democratic candidate Joe Biden is currently leading in the polls, with 51% to President Donald Trump's 43%. But while national polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, things are closer in a number of key states which could ultimately decide the outcome of the election. Find out more in our guide to the pollshere. With the president facing scrutiny over his handling of the pandemic, new audio shows his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner justifying moves to reopen the country more than six months ago. In an interview with US journalist Bob Woodward recorded on 18 April, Kushner can be heard saying: ""Trump's now back in charge. It's not the doctors. They've kind of - we have, like, a negotiated settlement."" ""There was the panic phase, the pain phase and then the comeback phase. I do believe that last night symbolised kind of the beginning of the comeback phase,"" he said in the recording, which was obtained bythe BBC's US partner, CBS News,external. Kushner spoke to Woodward after the White House released guidelines for reopening the country.The interview was first reported by CNN,externalearlier today. On the day the interview was recorded, the US death toll passed 37,000. That number has since risen to more than 227,000. Another of Woodward's interviews from the early stages of the pandemic, this time with Donald Trump and first reported last month,indicated that the president knew more about the severity of coronavirusthan he had admitted publicly. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken after Trump was hospitalised with Covid-19 in early October showed that his approval ratings over his response to the pandemic had hit a record low. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Janice Irene Gunn, 63, from Los Angeles asks:Will Joe Biden actually be able to make any strides toward eliminating climate change, given that the Senate leans toward Republican, and the House has a slim Democratic majority? Thereâs actually a real chance he could. Letâs take a look at the situation on Capitol Hill going into the election. As things stand, Republicans hold a three-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate. In the House of Representatives, which has 435 seats, Democrats hold 232 to Republicansâ 197. And analysts say itâs unlikely Democrats will lose their majority there - even among the more âvulnerableâ seats, many still favour Democrats. Meanwhile, in the Senate, there are a number of possible states that could flip from Republican red to Democratic blue, including Arizona, Colorado - and maybe even Texas. If Democrats win three seats in the upper chamber and the White House, theyâll still get the Senate majority, as the vice-president would become the tie-breaker. According to a 19 October forecast from FiveThirtyEight, Democrats have a 72% chance of winning the presidency, Senate and House this election. Action on climate change is high on the Democratic agenda, so control of the executive and legislative branches would make it likely for bills to be pushed through.

For anyone wondering what the electoral college is, when we'll find out who won and what else the election will decide, we've explained everything you need to knowhere. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC In recent years, the US and China have gone head-to-head over trade, technology and accusations of espionage. Today, the US Department of Justice charged eight people for allegedly conspiring as spies for China. China has become a key foreign policy issue in this US presidential election, with both Trump and Biden vowing to be tough on the country. âDecouplingâ is now a buzzword in US-China relations. It means reducing interdependence between the two countries, in order to mitigate risks for US national security. But disentangling the worldâs two largest economies is very complicated and potentially devastating for not only China and America, but also the rest of the world. Regardless of whether Trump or Biden wins the White House, the US-China rivalry is here to stay. Washington faces the challenge of figuring out how to work with China, while trying to protect its national security and tech competitiveness. China economic analyst Scott Kennedy told me that Washington needs to find a strategy to reach a âstable equilibriumâ with Beijing, even if the bilateral relationship becomes largely competitive. This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world The electoral college is a mystifying idea to many outside the US - and to some Americans too. Want to know how it works, and why it means you can become US president without winning the most votes? Sit back and watch this video... This video can not be played The Electoral College: Which voters really decide the US election? Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington His name is now public: Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, wrote an unsigned op-ed in 2018 that said the president was âpetty and ineffectiveâ, among other things. Now Taylor is writing under his own name, calling on people to demand a change in leadership. Taylorâs public stance is unlikely to change the minds of the presidentâs diehard supporters. But his statement may have an impact on those who are still working for the president and are considering leaving their jobs. In the meantime, he has made a splash in the media. Journalists have long wondered who Anonymous was, and his unveiling is making headlines with less than a week before the election. White House officials say he was a low-level official and that he was not only anonymous but unimportant. It is true that he may not have been high on an organisational chart. Yet he had an insiderâs knowledge of the presidentâs activities, style, policies and temperament and seemed well-placed to write the kind of expose that he did. So far Taylorâs former boss, the president, has not said anything about him or his latest work. But as the president himself would say, stay tuned.   Larry MadowoBBC News, Philadelphia Some businesses in Philadelphia are boarding up, expecting a third night of protests after the city announced a curfew. Police clashed with protesters for the last two nights after the tragic shooting of a black man, Walter Wallace, Jr. His family said the 27-year-old had mental health problems and they had called an ambulance but the police got there first. Police say they opened fire when he refused to drop a knife he was holding. A city-wide curfew has been announced from Wednesday 9pm to 6am on Thursday and businesses have been urged to close. Police say they have arrested 172 people on felony or misdemeanour grounds. Fifty-three officers have also been injured in the protests. Several big-box stores and other businesses were looted and at least nine ATMs were blown up over the last two days.The Pennsylvania National Guard has been deployed to the city. In Nevada, President Trump called what was happening in the city ""terrible"" and offered to send federal help. Joe Biden also condemned the violence and looting but said the protests were ""legitimate"". It reflects a difference in the two campaigns: President Trump has centred his campaign on a ""law and order"" message and criticised Democratic-run cities for allowing looters and rioters to take over their streets. Joe Biden meanwhile is walking a tightrope between acknowledging the grievances of Black Lives Matter protesters, while condemning rioting and not committing to defund the police. Seasoned US politics geeks, Jon Sopel, Emily Maitlis and Anthony Zurcher bring you the latest news and analysis from the campaign trail. On this episode of the podcast, the gang consider Donald Trump and Joe Bidenâs final pitches to the American voters, with just six days to go until voting begins! They also catch up with Heather, a voter from Ohio, who reveals which way sheâs going to cast her ballot after months of agonising.

Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida We've been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now it's our turn to respond. Joseph Main, 27, from Auckland, New Zealand, asks:Everyone is aware of President Trump's disdain for the Paris Climate Agreement. However, what could the outcome be, after this election, for more local environmental issues? The answer to this, like many things in the US, goes back to the states. Trump has certainly managed to rollback dozens of environmental protections that have local impacts, like opening up more federal lands for drilling, approving the construction of pipelines, and ending protections for migratory birds and other threatened species. But a lot of these have also been held up in the courts due to challenges by states or other groups. Twenty-five governors have joined a US climate alliance to reduce emissions, promote clean energy, improve public health and report progress on the global stage. Ten states have committed to 100% clean electricity and pollution-reduction policies, according to the Center for American Progress.A coalition,externalof thousands of cities, states and other institutions have also pledged to uphold Americaâs part of the Paris accord. If Biden wins the election, heâs promised to move the US towards a clean energy future and recommit to the Paris agreement. We may see a more national environmental approach in a Democrat-held Congress and White House, but regional leadership and grassroots efforts in the states will still be the key forces for local change. Read more about this issue: In a virtual speech from Delaware, Joe Biden has pledged not to campaign âon the false promises of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switchâ. âEven if I win, itâs going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic,â he said from his hometown of Wilmington. âI do promise this: We will start on day one doing the right things.â He also called Trump's pandemic response an ""insult"" to the victims. The live broadcast speech came after he received a briefing from health experts. The US is currently seeing an average of 71,000 new Covid-19 cases per day. Hospital admissions are rapidly climbing and so is the death toll. While Trump is holding a series of rallies in battleground states across the country, Biden has held far fewer in-person events, citing the coronavirus pandemic. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Peter Berkowitz, the US state departmentâs director of policy planning, met British officials in London earlier this month. Upon his return, he acknowledged he was infected with coronavirus. A state department official said that he had followed safety guidelines, butothers, according to the Washington Post, said he was cavalier about wearing a mask,external. Now UK officials say they will be more selective about approving visits of US officials. The incident underscores the perils of international relations: President Trump has generally been dismissive of masks - he took his mask off after being treated at hospital - and his aides have scorned wearing them during some public events. The president has said the US is ârounding a cornerâ in its efforts to fight the virus despite a spike in infections, and this attitude towards masks reinforces this political message. Some UK officials appear now to be concerned about their meetings with US officials, however, and they are trying to maintain some distance. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Alan R, 74, from Plymouth, UK, asks:Can you contrast each candidate's policies on climate change? With this, Trump's record is clear: since taking office, he's made dozens of changes and rollbacks to environmental protections, let alone his go-to call that climate change is a ""hoax"". Trump's bullet-pointed second-term agenda ignored the wider issue altogether in favour of promising the cleanest water and air.Our reporter Helier Cheung took a detailed look at Trump's record here, but (spoiler alert) these are the big policies to know: With four more years, it'll likely be more of the same. But if voters put Biden in the Oval Office, we're looking at rollbacks of the rollbacks. Biden has promised to recommit to the Paris accord, reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and turn the US into a 100% clean energy economy. He's even gone further than the official Democratic National Committee platform by saying he'll end subsidies to fossil fuel companies. This green vision will cost a cool couple trillion over four years. Do you have a question about the US presidential election that you would like our team to answer? If so,submit your question here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For a candidate who says he doesnât believe presidential preference polls, Donald Trump certainly talks about them a lot.

Thanks for joining us. This live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Lauren Turner, Mary O'Connor and Sarah Collerton. We'll see you again tomorrow for more coverage of the pandemic. We'll be pausing our live coverage in a few minutes, but if you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the main stories we've covered this Wednesday: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent For the second day in a row more than 300 new Covid deaths
have been reported. Wednesdayâs figure of 310 comes after 367 were reported on
Tuesday. A week before there were 191. The figures are in line with
the current trajectory, as they're doubling every two weeks. This is a much more gradual rise than we saw in the spring
when the figures were doubling every four days at one point. It suggests the UKâs current approach is still slowing the
spread of the virus, but will it be enough? We are only at the end of October and there are already
nearly 10,000 patients in hospital â that is halfway to the peak seen in
spring. With winter ahead of us and cases continuing to rise, there
is a growing sense within government that something must be done to reverse the
trend. The UK's central government has rejected the local branding of Covid restrictions in Bristol as ""tier one plus"" measures. The city - currently in tier one - is bringing in Covid marshals, conducting more analytic work, and boosting local contact tracing, to try to curb a recent rise in infections. Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said: ""These actions are being called tier one plus. Any further actions will be based on what we're seeing locally and through discussion with our local partners across the city and central government."" But a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""There are three local Covid alert levels which are enshrined in law and we are not considering the introduction of a 'plus' system."" She added that local leaders can bring in some additional measures, however. Meanwhile, a senior council official has warned North Yorkshire's tier one status is""hanging by a thread""and that a decision on tougher restrictions could come within days. Danai HowardBBC News Belgium could reach its maximum capacity for Covid-19
patients in intensive care by next Friday if the current rate of infections
continues, officials have warned. There are currently 911 coronavirus patients in intensive care in Belgium,external, with the number having been doubling every eight days. On average, 547 people have been admitted to hospital every day over the last week, which is already 85% higher than the week before. âAt this rate, we will reach 2,000 patients [the maximum capacity] by 6 November,â
said Steven van Gucht, the spokesman for Belgiumâs coronavirus taskforce. It's been widely reported by local media thatfurther restrictions,externalwill come into force on Friday in Belgiumâs northern Flanders
region, but van Gucht has urged people not to wait until then to limit
social interactions. âWhat we are doing now will have a huge impact on the
expected November peak. It takes at least 10 days before each new
measure has an effect on hospitals,"" he said. Belgian authorities have been accused of being slow to
introduce the new measures. On Tuesday, Flemish Minister-President Jan Jambon
defended the decision to introduce the rules on Friday evening,telling
Flemish radio,external: âLet it be clear:
nobody is banned from applying the measures right away. It just takes a little
time between political decision-making and implementing those things.â Belgium is currently the second hardest-hit country in all
of Europe, after the Czech Republic. Over the last two weeks, 1,424 new cases
have been recorded per 100,000 inhabitants,according to the
ECDC,external. While Halloween will be a little different this year, one family has not let coronavirus spoil the occasion. The Hargreaves family, who live in Llandaff, near Cardiff, have created a spooky display of Halloween decorations to bring a smile to children's faces during Wales' lockdown and to raise money for charity. Rosie, 10, outside her family home in Llandaff Danny, who works in TV special effects, with one of his decorations Danny and Carmela Hargreaves, both 41, and children Harry, 14, and Rosie, 10, spent the weekend installing more than 100 decorations - including gravestones, dragons, ghosts and giant spiders. The family want people follow the rules of thefirebreak lockdown currently in force across Wales, and only come to visit while out for exercise. The Hargreaves family outside their haunted house display Their display is in aid of the charity Dreams & Wishes, which supports seriously ill children across the UK. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A driver's documents being checked in Moscow For a second day running, Russia has reported its highest daily count of Covid-19 deaths with a total of 346. It comes amid reports that the health ministry has banned doctors at state-run hospitals from making unauthorised comments on the pandemic. From now on, doctors and officials must agree comments with the ministry in advance to improve âthe efficiencyâ of public information on Covid-19. Russian media reports suggest that hospitals across the country are struggling to cope with the worsening pandemic. Five days is the average amount of time patients in the Urals city of Chelyabinsk are having to wait for an ambulance, the popularKomsomolskaya Pravda,externaltabloid says. Local authorities point to a shortage of drivers and medics, saying that they hope to cut this to three days. In Siberiaâs Omsk, two ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients showed up outside the local health ministry having been turned away from the cityâs hospitals due to overcrowding, local news siteGorod 55,externalreports. A hospital in another Siberian city, Kuybyshev, is dealing with the problem of overcrowding by putting beds in its corridors, the localTayga.info,externalwebsite reports. It published photos showing elderly patients curled up in makeshift beds in the hospitalâs stairwells. Meanwhile, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said it is âprematureâ to lift current Covid-19 restrictions as he today announced he was extending certain measures - including the wearing of masks and a requirement that 30% of staff work from home - until 29 November. Secondary school pupils will continue to study online until 8 November, he said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced next month's spending review will take place on 25 November. The government scrapped its planned multi-year spending review, choosing a one-year review instead, due to the focus on the response to the pandemic. Some local leaders criticised the move, sayinglocal authorities need ""long-term financial certainty""as they deal with the effects of Covid-19. Sunak,who confirmed the 25 November date in a tweet,external, will use his review to set departmental resources and capital budgets for 2021-22, and the devolved administrations' block grants for the same period. Downing Street has suggested Sunak could use the review to announce extra support to feed families during the holidays. Funding for the NHS and schools remains multi-year, along with priority infrastructure projects. Around of two-thirds of coronavirus fines have been issued to people under the age of 35 and the vast majority of fines went to men, new figures show. Police in England and Wales handed out 20,223 fines for breaching coronavirus restrictions between 27 March and 19 October, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council data. Of those fines:  In England, 64 fines were issued for large gatherings such as illegal raves and parties, carrying a Â£10,000 penalty. Two were handed out in Wales. Provisional figures for England's recently introduced three-tier system show 268 fines have been issued, with 65 handed out for a breach of regulations in tier one, 79 in tier two, and 124 in tier three. Another 310 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, thelatest government figures show,external. It brings the total number of coronavirus deaths to 45,675, using that measure. There have also been a further 24,701 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK as of 09:00 on Wednesday, taking the total number of UK cases to 942,275.

Drug companies GSK and Sanofi are tosupply 200 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidateto a global inoculation scheme. The vaccine, going through the first stages of testing, will be supplied to the Covax scheme, which is backed by the World Health Organization. Covax, which aims to deliver two billion vaccine doses around the world by the end of 2021, has already signed agreements this year with AstraZeneca and Novavax. It aims to discourage national governments from hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and to focus on vaccinating high-risk people first in every country. More than 180 nations, including China, have joined the plan, but some, including the US, have opted to stick with their own supply deals. GSK and Sanofi hope to have the first results of its trial by December. If it is successful, they will move on to further trials by the end of the year. Healthcare workers have been on the frontline of the pandemic for the last nine months, fighting to treat and save as many people infected with Covid-19 as possible.

Boeing is tocut another 7,000 jobsas its losses mount in the pandemic. The US plane maker, which had already announced deep cuts, said its staff would number just 130,000 by the end of next year - 20% down on the 160,000 it employed before the crisis. The continuing pandemic and safety concerns about its 737 Max jet have contributed to a slump in orders. The pandemic has caused a huge drop in air travel, pushing major airlines to the brink of bankruptcy and forcing them to cut staff and drop plans for new aircraft. As a result, Boeing has slashed production and also cut jobs. It posted a loss of $466m (Â£354m) for the three months to 30 September, its fourth straight quarterly decline. Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check Indiaâs capital city is
witnessing a fresh spike in coronavirus cases, although overall numbers have been
declining in the country since a peak in September. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 4,853
cases, the most detected so far in a single day since the pandemic hit India in
March. This spike in cases comes after a
change in testing strategy, with the Delhi authorities moving to the gold
standard PCR tests from less accurate (but faster) rapid antigen tests. The city has re-tested about 85%
of those who had tested negative in rapid antigen tests in October, but still
had symptoms, compared with 10-15% in September. Delhi is conducting nearly
60,000 tests a day - a number thatâs been more or less constant for some
months. The proportion of positive tests
is going up steadily, which suggests the city needs a further ramping up of
reliable testing. Read more on India's testing strategies here. Wales has recorded its highest number of daily coronavirus deaths in more than six months, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford tweeted: ""I am deeply saddened the number of coronavirus deaths in Wales reported over the past 24 hours is 37 - the highest number in more than 6 months."" There have also been a further 1,414 cases of Covid-19 recorded in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 46,459. Public Health Wales said after the latest 37 deaths, the total number had risen to 1,827. On Tuesday, the UK as a whole recorded its highest daily death toll since May, after another 367 people died within 28 days of a positive test. Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check Pupis returned to classrooms in Kenya earlier this month The World Health Organization (WHO) says Kenya has witnessed a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases in the last month. It says the country reported
4,594 new cases in the past week - up
51% on the previous week. That's the second-highest number of new weekly cases in the WHO's Africa region, excluding Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia. Restrictions in Kenya were eased in late September, allowed bars and restaurants to reopen, and overnight curfew hours to be reduced. Teaching in some school
classes resumed in mid-October. Across the whole of Africa there have been 1.7 million recorded Covid cases, and more than 41,000 deaths. Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe Correspondent The European Commission is calling on member states of the EU to co-ordinate their coronavirus policies as infections continue to rise. Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen is proposing leaders of member states co-operate on quarantine rules and travel policies. Von Der Leyen says the commission wants member states to agree a European Passenger Locator Form which would allow continent-wide contact tracing. Sheâs also called for common policies on quarantine, self-isolation and travel rules and information sharing about hospital capacity. The biggest test for EU solidarity will come when a vaccine becomes available and member states have to decide how to share it between their own populations and those of their neighbours. In her call for solidarity, Von Der Leyen said: ""No-one is safe until everyone is safe."" Brussels also wants EU governments to co-ordinate their testing strategies and make more use of rapid antigen tests. It comes asGermany and France are set to enter new lockdowns. Germany is expected to have a ""lockdown light"" in November while France is set to announce a four-week lockdown which would be less severe than that in spring. Details of the measures to be introduced in each country are expected later.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Thanks for joining us. This live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Lauren Turner, Mary O'Connor and Sarah Collerton. We'll see you again tomorrow for more coverage of the pandemic. We'll be pausing our live coverage in a few minutes, but if you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the main stories we've covered this Wednesday: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent For the second day in a row more than 300 new Covid deaths
have been reported. Wednesdayâs figure of 310 comes after 367 were reported on
Tuesday. A week before there were 191. The figures are in line with
the current trajectory, as they're doubling every two weeks. This is a much more gradual rise than we saw in the spring
when the figures were doubling every four days at one point. It suggests the UKâs current approach is still slowing the
spread of the virus, but will it be enough? We are only at the end of October and there are already
nearly 10,000 patients in hospital â that is halfway to the peak seen in
spring. With winter ahead of us and cases continuing to rise, there
is a growing sense within government that something must be done to reverse the
trend. The UK's central government has rejected the local branding of Covid restrictions in Bristol as ""tier one plus"" measures. The city - currently in tier one - is bringing in Covid marshals, conducting more analytic work, and boosting local contact tracing, to try to curb a recent rise in infections. Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said: ""These actions are being called tier one plus. Any further actions will be based on what we're seeing locally and through discussion with our local partners across the city and central government."" But a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""There are three local Covid alert levels which are enshrined in law and we are not considering the introduction of a 'plus' system."" She added that local leaders can bring in some additional measures, however. Meanwhile, a senior council official has warned North Yorkshire's tier one status is""hanging by a thread""and that a decision on tougher restrictions could come within days. Danai HowardBBC News Belgium could reach its maximum capacity for Covid-19
patients in intensive care by next Friday if the current rate of infections
continues, officials have warned. There are currently 911 coronavirus patients in intensive care in Belgium,external, with the number having been doubling every eight days. On average, 547 people have been admitted to hospital every day over the last week, which is already 85% higher than the week before. âAt this rate, we will reach 2,000 patients [the maximum capacity] by 6 November,â
said Steven van Gucht, the spokesman for Belgiumâs coronavirus taskforce. It's been widely reported by local media thatfurther restrictions,externalwill come into force on Friday in Belgiumâs northern Flanders
region, but van Gucht has urged people not to wait until then to limit
social interactions. âWhat we are doing now will have a huge impact on the
expected November peak. It takes at least 10 days before each new
measure has an effect on hospitals,"" he said. Belgian authorities have been accused of being slow to
introduce the new measures. On Tuesday, Flemish Minister-President Jan Jambon
defended the decision to introduce the rules on Friday evening,telling
Flemish radio,external: âLet it be clear:
nobody is banned from applying the measures right away. It just takes a little
time between political decision-making and implementing those things.â Belgium is currently the second hardest-hit country in all
of Europe, after the Czech Republic. Over the last two weeks, 1,424 new cases
have been recorded per 100,000 inhabitants,according to the
ECDC,external. While Halloween will be a little different this year, one family has not let coronavirus spoil the occasion. The Hargreaves family, who live in Llandaff, near Cardiff, have created a spooky display of Halloween decorations to bring a smile to children's faces during Wales' lockdown and to raise money for charity. Rosie, 10, outside her family home in Llandaff Danny, who works in TV special effects, with one of his decorations Danny and Carmela Hargreaves, both 41, and children Harry, 14, and Rosie, 10, spent the weekend installing more than 100 decorations - including gravestones, dragons, ghosts and giant spiders. The family want people follow the rules of thefirebreak lockdown currently in force across Wales, and only come to visit while out for exercise. The Hargreaves family outside their haunted house display Their display is in aid of the charity Dreams & Wishes, which supports seriously ill children across the UK. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A driver's documents being checked in Moscow For a second day running, Russia has reported its highest daily count of Covid-19 deaths with a total of 346. It comes amid reports that the health ministry has banned doctors at state-run hospitals from making unauthorised comments on the pandemic. From now on, doctors and officials must agree comments with the ministry in advance to improve âthe efficiencyâ of public information on Covid-19. Russian media reports suggest that hospitals across the country are struggling to cope with the worsening pandemic. Five days is the average amount of time patients in the Urals city of Chelyabinsk are having to wait for an ambulance, the popularKomsomolskaya Pravda,externaltabloid says. Local authorities point to a shortage of drivers and medics, saying that they hope to cut this to three days. In Siberiaâs Omsk, two ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients showed up outside the local health ministry having been turned away from the cityâs hospitals due to overcrowding, local news siteGorod 55,externalreports. A hospital in another Siberian city, Kuybyshev, is dealing with the problem of overcrowding by putting beds in its corridors, the localTayga.info,externalwebsite reports. It published photos showing elderly patients curled up in makeshift beds in the hospitalâs stairwells. Meanwhile, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said it is âprematureâ to lift current Covid-19 restrictions as he today announced he was extending certain measures - including the wearing of masks and a requirement that 30% of staff work from home - until 29 November. Secondary school pupils will continue to study online until 8 November, he said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced next month's spending review will take place on 25 November. The government scrapped its planned multi-year spending review, choosing a one-year review instead, due to the focus on the response to the pandemic. Some local leaders criticised the move, sayinglocal authorities need ""long-term financial certainty""as they deal with the effects of Covid-19. Sunak,who confirmed the 25 November date in a tweet,external, will use his review to set departmental resources and capital budgets for 2021-22, and the devolved administrations' block grants for the same period. Downing Street has suggested Sunak could use the review to announce extra support to feed families during the holidays. Funding for the NHS and schools remains multi-year, along with priority infrastructure projects. Around of two-thirds of coronavirus fines have been issued to people under the age of 35 and the vast majority of fines went to men, new figures show. Police in England and Wales handed out 20,223 fines for breaching coronavirus restrictions between 27 March and 19 October, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council data. Of those fines:  In England, 64 fines were issued for large gatherings such as illegal raves and parties, carrying a Â£10,000 penalty. Two were handed out in Wales. Provisional figures for England's recently introduced three-tier system show 268 fines have been issued, with 65 handed out for a breach of regulations in tier one, 79 in tier two, and 124 in tier three. Another 310 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, thelatest government figures show,external. It brings the total number of coronavirus deaths to 45,675, using that measure. There have also been a further 24,701 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK as of 09:00 on Wednesday, taking the total number of UK cases to 942,275.

"Married PC who killed lover jailedTimothy Brehmer and Claire Parry had a secret relationship for more than 10 years, his trial heard.Dorset","Claire Parry died in hospital after being strangled, the court heard A police officer who strangled a mother of two after she exposed their affair to his wife has been jailed. Timothy Brehmer killed nurse Claire Parry, 41, after they met in a pub car park in Dorset on 9 May. The two had been involved in a secret relationship for more than 10 years, a trial at Salisbury Crown Court heard. Brehmer, 41, who admitted manslaughter andwas acquitted of murder by a jury on Tuesday, has been jailed for 10 and a half years. The trial heard Mrs Parry, who was married to another Dorset Police officer, met the defendant outside the Horns Inn in West Parley to confront him about another of his extra-marital affairs. Mrs Parry took hold of his phone before sending a text to his wife, saying: ""I am cheating on you."" Brehmer, of Hordle, Hampshire, said he had strangled Mrs Parry by accident during a ""kerfuffle"" in his car and that his arm ""must have slipped in all the melee"". Mrs Parry, from Bournemouth, died in hospital the following day from a brain injury caused by compression of the neck. Timothy Brehmer admitted killing Claire Parry but told the court it was an accident Mr Justice Jacobs told Brehmer he was sentencing him ""on the basis you lost your self-control following the sending of the text message to your wife where the affair was revealed, rather than on the basis that you had no intention to kill or cause really serious harm"". ""I am sure that you did deliberately take Claire Parry by the neck applying significant force with your forearm or the crook of your elbow for a period of time while she struggled against you, thereby causing...severe neck injuries,"" the judge added. ""The evidence from the pathologist was that those injuries which she described as 'severe' on a scale of mild, moderate or severe resulted from the application of significant force to the neck for a period of a minimum 10 to 30 seconds and possibly longer. ""She said it was difficult to envisage a situation where a struggle in the car imparted the necessary degree of force or could explain the extent and severity of the neck injuries."" This video can not be played Police body-worn video showed Brehmer ""crying hysterically"" after killing his lover Brehmer told the trial he had left the car without realising Mrs Parry was ""poorly"". However, the judge said as a trained police officer ""it must have been obvious"" that Mrs Parry was not breathing. ""Yet you did nothing to try to help Claire Parry,"" Mr Justice Jacobs added. ""You did not ask her how she was. That was because you knew how she was. ""You could not possibly have thought, as you said in your police interview, that she was simply taking a breath. ""You must have known that her body had gone limp after your assault on her. ""Before you walked to the car park entrance you must have seen how she was - hanging half out of the car."" Mrs Parry's husband, Andrew, said he was ""incredibly disappointed"" with the verdict and branded Brehmer a ""well-practised liar"". ""He has shown himself - as the trial exposed - to be consistently dishonest, deceitful and devious,"" he added. ""Claire was a caring nurse practitioner who helped many people in a career of over 20 years. She was a loving family member and a doting mother who leaves behind two young children. ""Her energy and enthusiasm for life were infectious and our lives are poorer without her in them."" Mr Parry previously told the court Brehmer was the ""worst kind of thief"" anddescribed the pain of telling their children that their mother was dead. ""It was like a physical weight crushing down on my chest,"" he said. Dorset Police said Brehmer had been sacked at a misconduct meeting held on 16 September. He was also placed on the national police barred list. Chief Constable James Vaughan said for a serving officer ""to take the life of another in this way is incomprehensible"".

Coral reef taller than Empire State Building found,"Scientists used a robot to capture video of the ""massive"" reef found off Australia's northern coast An enormous coral reef has been found at the northern tip of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the first such discovery in 120 years, scientists say. At 500m (1,640ft) high, the reef is taller than New York's Empire State Building and the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Scientists on a 12-month mission found the structure, detached from the Great Barrier Reef off Cape York, last week. They were conducting 3D mapping of the sea floor in the area. A team aboard a research vessel owned by the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI), a non-profit group based in California, used an underwater robot to explore the reef. Known as SuBastian, the robot live-streamed video of the discovery on Sunday and posted it to YouTube. ""To find a new half-a-kilometre tall reef in the offshore Cape York area of the well-recognised Great Barrier Reef shows how mysterious the world is just beyond our coastline,"" said SOI executive director Dr Jyotika Virmani. The reef is higher than iconic skyscrapers such as New York City's Empire State Building ""This powerful combination of mapping data and underwater imagery will be used to understand this new reef and its role within the incredible Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area."" The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef, is home to more than 1,500 species of fish, 411 species of hard corals and dozens of other species. A robot called SuBastian filmed the reef underwater Stretching over 2,300km (1,400 miles), the reef was designated a World Heritage site in 1981 for its ""enormous scientific and intrinsic importance"". But in recent years, it has been vastly damaged by warmer seas which have killed off coral, dispersed other marine life and sped up growth of algae and other contaminants. A study published earlier this monthfound the Great Barrier Reef had lost more than half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change. Great Barrier Reef suffers third mass bleaching Australia downgrades reef outlook to 'very poor' This video can not be played Drones and scientific facilities could help the reef The reef is the first of its kind to be found in the region since the late 1800s, scientists said. There are known to be seven other tall reefs in the region, including the one at Raine Island - the world's most important green sea turtle nesting area. While the reef is bedded to the ocean floor off North Queensland, it is detached, meaning it is not part of the main body of the Great Barrier Reef. Scientists found the reef while conducting 3D mapping Described as ""blade-like"", the reef is 1.5km wide (one mile), then rises 500m to its shallowest depth of only 40m below the sea surface. ""This unexpected discovery affirms that we continue to find unknown structures and new species in our ocean,"" said SOI co-founder Wendy Schmidt. ""The state of our knowledge about what's in the ocean has long been so limited. Thanks to new technologies that work as our eyes, ears and hands in the deep ocean, we have the capacity to explore like never before. ""New ocean-scapes are opening to us, revealing the ecosystems and diverse life forms that share the planet with us."" Researchers are expected to continue surveying the northern Great Barrier Reef until 17 November. The reef is the latest discovery to be made by researchers aboard the Falkor, a Schmidt Ocean Institute ship on a year-long exploration of oceans around Australia. The institute said it had discovered up to 30 new species, including ""the longest recorded sea creature"", a 45m-long siphonophore found in April in a canyon off Western Australia's coast. The new reef was found off Cape York in Australia's far north Relatives of jellyfish and coral, siphonophores are deep-sea organisms. Many are bioluminescent, glowing green or blue to lure prey. More discoveries were made in August, including undescribed species of black coral and sponges and ""Australia's first observation of rare scorpionfish"", the institute said.

Shops and gyms to reopen at end of firebreakMinisters are working on new set of national rules to come into effect on 9 November.Wales politics,"Non-essential retail was forced to close in Wales last Friday Non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants, cafes, gyms and leisure centres will reopen after Wales' firebreak lockdown ends, the first minister has promised. The venues will be able to reopen on ""essentially the same terms"", Mark Drakeford said. But there were issues to be resolved on what rules there should be on household gatherings and travel, added. Welsh Tory Senedd leader Paul Davies said ministers should tell people now what their strategy is. Mr Drakeford told WalesOnline: ""Many of the things that people have not been able to do in these two weeks, we plan to restore."" Earlier, Welsh Government Counsel General Jeremy Miles said ministers were working on a new set of national rules for after 9 November. People in Wales are being asked to stay at home until 9 November From 23 October, non-essential retail, hospitality and gyms have had to shut their doors for the firebreak. People have been asked to stay at home unless absolutely necessary, with travel restricted. The Welsh Government said it was necessary to avoid the NHS being overwhelmed with coronavirus cases. A further 37 deaths with Covid reported in Wales Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Mr Drakeford said he anticipated ""shops that are closed at the moment will be able to reopen"" and that restaurants, bars, cafes gyms and leisure centres will be able to reopen ""essentially on the same terms as they traded before the lockdown began"". But he said ""two of the issues that are the trickiest to resolve"" are rules around household gatherings and travel. ""On both of those there is a lot of discussion still to be had. I'm keen that we resolve it by the end of this week or the beginning of next to give people as much notice we can of what will happen when the firebreak is over."" The first minister said the system of local lockdowns had been ""complicated"". ""I think the feeling is we would be better with a simpler, national set of rules,"" he said, although he said it did not mean there would not need to be local action. Meanwhile, he admitted the Welsh Government could have worked more closely with supermarkets on his decision to bar them from selling non-essential goods. The announcement promptedcriticism last week. Mark Drakeford said he was taken by surprise by the strength of reaction to the announcement last week though admitted the Welsh Government could have worked more closely with supermarkets. He said: ""We would have perhaps avoided some of the mistaken communication that led to places thinking that things couldn't have been sold when they could."" He said the government could have worked harder to explain to people that it was ""not the fortnight"" to be going out browsing in shops and added: ""The more people we meet, the more coronavirus likes it."" On Monday, Tesco apologised after saying it could not sell sanitary towels and tamponsfrom a store in Cardiff. Pubs will reopen at the end of the lockdown period At a press conference earlier, Mr Miles said Mr Drakeford would announce ""in the coming days"" any restrictions on travel or visiting families that would remain in place after 9 November ""We can expect to hear from the first minister, I think in the coming days, with a clearer picture of what is ahead following those discussions and following those decisions."" The Welsh Government is due to hold a further press briefing on Friday. Before the firebreak began, 17 areas across Wales were already under local lockdown. Paul Davies of the Welsh Conservatives said ministers should have been discussing what the new rules would be ""before now"". ""We don't know what the plan is,"" he said. ""People want to know what the next steps are and businesses need to know so they can plan ahead."" Caroline Jones, a Member of the Senedd with the Independent Alliance for Reform, said: ""We do not believe Covid-19 is spread mostly in gyms, shops, hairdressers or the majority of pubs and clubs. ""The majority of businesses have ensured their premises are adapted to meet all requirements but if we continue to impose lockdowns these measures will, in the medium to long-term cause untold harm to people's health, wealth and well-being.""

"Supermarket staff 'having to referee' Covid rulesStaff should not have to decide which customers can buy non-essential items, says an association.WalesComments","Some supermarket aisles have been closed off and clothes rails covered in cellophane Supermarket staff are being put at risk by having to ""referee"" what can be bought during Wales' coronavirus lockdown, the Welsh Retail Consortium has said. Supermarkets are only able to sell essential items until 9 November. On Tuesday, the Welsh Governmentissued a listof what can be sold and said customers could ask for non-essential items in exceptional circumstances. It follows a backlash over supermarkets closing parts of their stores. Apetition,externalon the issue exceeded 67,000 signatures, making it the largest ever submitted to the Senedd. Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, said staff were being ""placed in a very difficult position"". She told BBC Radio WalesBreakfast with Claire Summers: ""They have the discretion to determine whether or not someone can or can't have what might be deemed a non-essential item and quite frankly it's not acceptable for our retail colleagues to have to determine that need. ""It feels to us that our staff have to referee this entire system."" Ms Jones added: ""We know this policy will put them at risk."" She said the association would implement the rules but was ""deeply disappointed"". Conservative member of the Senedd (MS) Russell George said he was concerned for both shop workers and customers. He said: ""It's the wrong approach the government has taken now, particularly expecting shop workers to effectively police policy, that's not a fair system. ""It's not fair on shop workers and I think it is unfair on customers to be expected to provide private information. ""I think it is a violation of people's privacy."" He said the Welsh Government should ""allow all retail shops to open and allow supermarkets to open up their aisles and for customers to decide what is right themselves and what's essential for themselves"". Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford first announced the measures when responding to Mr George, who said it was ""unfair"" to force independent clothing and hardware retailers to close while similar goods were on sale in major supermarkets. Plaid Cymru MS Rhun ap Iorwerth said he was worried abuse would be ""thrown at shop workers"". ""I don't think shop workers should be in this situation,"" he said. But he added: ""I think Russell George is wrong to say all retail should be open because that doesn't suggest a stay at home lockdown."" Ministers have said the non-essential goods restrictions will stay until lockdown ends on 9 November Ministers have said the principle of restricting non-essential goods will stay until lockdown ends on 9 November. Announcing the list of essential items on Tuesday, the Welsh Government said it could not ""move away from the central principle that retailers must restrict the sale of non-essential goods for the duration of the firebreak"". ""We continue to work closely with the sector and would stress that these restrictions are in place to stop the spread of coronavirus and save lives,"" a spokesman said. ""We are asking the public to continue to support the effort by restricting unnecessary journeys and shopping .""

Rashford given city award for free school meals fight,"Marcus Rashford recently helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester Footballer Marcus Rashford is to be given the City of Manchester Award to thank him for his campaign to get free meals for children during the school holidays. The award recognises ""outstanding and exceptional contribution to the city"". Manchester United striker Rashford's petition to end child food poverty has more than 990,000 signatures. Lord Mayor of Manchester Tommy Judge said it was ""remarkable"" to see him ""give a voice to the powerless"". The 22-year-old hasalready been awarded an MBEfor his work to tackle child poverty. Rashford 'proud' of school holiday meals response Restaurants rally for Rashford's free meal crusade Is there really no money for free school meals? The UK government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays earlier this year and, after a high-profile campaign by Rashford, did the same for the summer holiday. Marcus Rashford was made an MBE earlier this year Butit has refused to do so again, saying it had already given money to councils in England to support families. It led to businesses across the country, including fish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants and cafes, offering free food to eligible children over half-term. Wythenshawe councillor Judge, who will officially award Rashford the accolade at a full meeting of Manchester City Council later, said it was a ""truly memorable"" moment, ""from one Wythenshawe lad to another"". He said: ""We could never have known that Marcus was going to become the world-famous footballer that he is celebrated for today, but perhaps his recent campaign to feed needy young people will become his true legacy. ""The way he and his wonderful family has stood up for what they believe in, the way they have given a voice to the powerless has been remarkable to see."" Rashford will be invited to formally receive the award at a future council meeting when social distancing rules allow it.

Paris trumps Heathrow as Europe's busiest airport,"Heathrow says it has been overtaken as Europe's busiest airport for the first time by Paris Charles de Gaulle because of a slump in demand for air travel. Some 19 million passengers used Heathrow in the first nine months of the year, versus 19.3 million who used the airport in the French capital. Heathrow said Amsterdam Schiphol and Frankfurt were ""close behind"". It said all three rivals had adopted testing regimes as a way of people reducing or avoiding quarantine. By contrast, Britain had been ""too slow to embrace passenger testing"" and was ""falling behind"". Heathrow reported an 84% fall in passenger numbers for the three months to September as losses for the year to date widened to Â£1.5bn. ""Already in France and Germany, even Canada and Ireland have moved to testing and this is the way to make sure we can protect jobs in the UK as well as protecting people from coronavirus,"" Mr Holland Kaye told the BBC. ""The government really need to get on and make this happen before the beginning of December if we are going to save people's jobs."" Transport Secretary Grant Shappshas said he wants to have post-arrivals testing up and running in the UK by 1 December. This would reduce the amount of time arrivals from high risk destinations had to spend in quarantine from 14 days - seen as a big deterrent to travel - to a week. But Mr Holland Kaye said the industry still needed a ""commitment"" it would happen. He added that the only way to really revive air travel was to bring in widespread pre-departure testing that met internationally agreed standards. In the first nine months of 2020, Heathrow had 19m passengers - down 69% from 61m in the same period last year Paris CDG had 19.3m passengers in the same period, a drop of 67% from the 58 million it had last year. Before the pandemic, Heathrow would always boast that it was the biggest airport in Europe. So it's striking that when announcing its unsurprisingly dreadful financial results, the airport has gone out of its way to underline the fact that it no longer holds that title. Of course, all of the world's airports are seeing record low passenger numbers right now and not even a crystal ball will tell you what the picture will be next year and beyond. But by announcing that Paris Charles de Gaulle has robbed it of Europe's top spot, Heathrow is subtly taking aim at the UK government. UK aviation bosses are fed up that ministers have still not approved a testing regime for passengers arriving into the country as a way for people to avoid a two-week quarantine. The warning from Heathrow is clear: if the UK doesn't act quickly to help its aviation sector recover, then passenger traffic will head elsewhere and even more jobs will be lost at home. The airport has already begun offering pre-departure testing, but only for passengers travelling to destinations that require it. He urged the UK government to speed up talks with the US over creating a ""pilot air bridge"" for such a scheme. ""That is the best way to make sure we are no longer importing Covid and also that people can travel with confidence."" Heathrow, which is already cutting 500 jobs, said it forecast passenger numbers of 22.6 million next year - less than a quarter of 2019 levels. But while it is losing about Â£5m a day, it said its finances were solid and it had reserves to tide it over until 2023. The air travel industry has been hit hard by coronavirus, with airlines such as British Airways and Easyjet slashing thousands of jobs. The International Air Transport Association, which represents 290 airlines, estimates that air traffic will not return to pre-pandemic levels until at least 2024.

Call to improve 'disjointed' Covid business help,"The past few months have been ""immensely challenging"" says Rachel Bedgood Small company owners want to see the Welsh and UK governments ""work together"" to offer support during the Covid-19 crisis, according to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). One business owner told BBC Wales the help available was ""disjointed"". The FSB also warned job losses from small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) - around 60% of private employment - could have a large impact overall. The UK government said it had provided billions of pounds of support to Wales. A Welsh Government spokesperson said it agreed with the FSB's comments. Redundancy warning in lockdown appeal to Treasury Welsh businesses offered Â£140m Covid help 'Job hunting in the crisis has been soul destroying' The UK government's furlough scheme ends on 31 October, and the newJob Support Schemestarts on 1 November, just over half way through the Welsh firebreak lockdown. Until the end of October the UK government is paying 60% of wages and the employer - including businesses closed down during the lockdown - has to pay 20%. Only previously furloughed employees can be furloughed again. The Welsh Government asked the Treasury to bring forward the Job Support Scheme - which will cover 67% of wages for employees of closed businesses - so it applied to the whole firebreak period. It said it had offered to pay the difference so Welsh businesses would not have to apply to two schemes, but this was declined by the UK government. The FSB expressed concerns about the impact on companies caused by thatgap. Its policy chair Ben Francis said the situation was creating an administrative burden on SMEs, who employ an estimated 750,000 people in Wales. ""While perhaps [small businesses] aren't necessarily as headline grabbing as when you say a large scale or a chain employer decides to cut jobs, they still are just as important."" Business groups are concerned about the amount of administration businesses face to access support He said the first minister's announcement of the firebreak lockdown was an ""extremely worrying time for business owners in Wales, particularly given the months that preceded the announcement"". The Welsh Government has announced Â£5m to help workers who fall through the gap in the Treasury's wage support schemes. Mountain Ash-based CBS employs 20 people, processing checks on job candidates, particularly in areas where safeguarding is paramount. Chief executive Rachel Bedgood explained the business was reliant on a buoyant recruitment market, adding the past few months have been ""immensely challenging"" and ""the demand for our services relatively quickly dropped off a cliff"". ""The furlough scheme was initially fantastic. The new [Job Support Scheme that] has just come in now is a little bit too late for us."" She said making redundancies was ""difficult"", having replaced seven posts with five new higher-skilled jobs, but remained positive about her 15-year-old business. Ms Bedgood echoed the FSB's calls for consistent policies from the Welsh and UK governments during the pandemic. ""It's difficult because it's so disjointed. So whereas we have the Chancellor now coming forward with these new offers... if we're not united in the decision processes that we make, whether it be lockdown, furlough or finance help, then it's just not going to work effectively or certainly going to benefit everyone."" The UK government said it had given the Welsh Government ""an additional Â£4.4bn to cope with the pressures of the pandemic"" and ""protected more than half a million jobs in Wales through our income support schemes"".

Paris trumps Heathrow as Europe's busiest airportParis Charles de Gaulle is now busier as passenger numbers at Heathrow dive 84% because of Covid.Business,"Heathrow says it has been overtaken as Europe's busiest airport for the first time by Paris Charles de Gaulle because of a slump in demand for air travel. Some 19 million passengers used Heathrow in the first nine months of the year, versus 19.3 million who used the airport in the French capital. Heathrow said Amsterdam Schiphol and Frankfurt were ""close behind"". It said all three rivals had adopted testing regimes as a way of people reducing or avoiding quarantine. By contrast, Britain had been ""too slow to embrace passenger testing"" and was ""falling behind"". Heathrow reported an 84% fall in passenger numbers for the three months to September as losses for the year to date widened to Â£1.5bn. ""Already in France and Germany, even Canada and Ireland have moved to testing and this is the way to make sure we can protect jobs in the UK as well as protecting people from coronavirus,"" Mr Holland Kaye told the BBC. ""The government really need to get on and make this happen before the beginning of December if we are going to save people's jobs."" Transport Secretary Grant Shappshas said he wants to have post-arrivals testing up and running in the UK by 1 December. This would reduce the amount of time arrivals from high risk destinations had to spend in quarantine from 14 days - seen as a big deterrent to travel - to a week. But Mr Holland Kaye said the industry still needed a ""commitment"" it would happen. He added that the only way to really revive air travel was to bring in widespread pre-departure testing that met internationally agreed standards. In the first nine months of 2020, Heathrow had 19m passengers - down 69% from 61m in the same period last year Paris CDG had 19.3m passengers in the same period, a drop of 67% from the 58 million it had last year. Before the pandemic, Heathrow would always boast that it was the biggest airport in Europe. So it's striking that when announcing its unsurprisingly dreadful financial results, the airport has gone out of its way to underline the fact that it no longer holds that title. Of course, all of the world's airports are seeing record low passenger numbers right now and not even a crystal ball will tell you what the picture will be next year and beyond. But by announcing that Paris Charles de Gaulle has robbed it of Europe's top spot, Heathrow is subtly taking aim at the UK government. UK aviation bosses are fed up that ministers have still not approved a testing regime for passengers arriving into the country as a way for people to avoid a two-week quarantine. The warning from Heathrow is clear: if the UK doesn't act quickly to help its aviation sector recover, then passenger traffic will head elsewhere and even more jobs will be lost at home. The airport has already begun offering pre-departure testing, but only for passengers travelling to destinations that require it. He urged the UK government to speed up talks with the US over creating a ""pilot air bridge"" for such a scheme. ""That is the best way to make sure we are no longer importing Covid and also that people can travel with confidence."" Heathrow, which is already cutting 500 jobs, said it forecast passenger numbers of 22.6 million next year - less than a quarter of 2019 levels. But while it is losing about Â£5m a day, it said its finances were solid and it had reserves to tide it over until 2023. The air travel industry has been hit hard by coronavirus, with airlines such as British Airways and Easyjet slashing thousands of jobs. The International Air Transport Association, which represents 290 airlines, estimates that air traffic will not return to pre-pandemic levels until at least 2024.

Delays in Nottingham tier 3 details 'unacceptable',"Nottinghamshire's auction houses, car boot sales, betting shops, saunas and tattoo parlours must close, the government has announced. The measures were revealed as it was confirmed the whole county would move into tier three at 00:01 on Friday. Alcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 GMT in shops, but can be sold until 22:00 if bought ""in hospitality venues where accompanying a substantial meal"". Hotels can remain open, as can gyms and leisure centres. Nottingham, Rushcliffe, Gedling and Broxtowehad been expected to move into the top tier of Covid restrictions on Thursday. While the tier three status has been delayed for 24 hours, it will now include the entire county. Other tier three rules include: Fitness and dance studios, sports courts and swimming pools can also remain open, although it is ""strongly advised"" group indoor classes do not take place Public buildings such as community centres, libraries and town halls are allowed to remain open to run activities such as childcare and support groups, but not for private hire, birthday parties and other social events ""Indoor entertainment and tourism venues"" have to close, but cinemas, concert halls, ice rinks and theatres are not affected by the new rules. Local lockdown rules: What Covid tier is my area in? Covid: How the new rules will work Housing Minister Christopher Pincher praised the local authorities ""for entering into productive discussions and coming to an agreement as quickly as possible"". ""We are very conscious that these new restrictions will have a huge impact on those living and working in the county, but this action is vital and is based on public health advice,"" he said. However, Nottingham South Labour MP Lilian Greenwood has criticised the government for taking ""a week and a half"" to come to an agreement over the city and county. ""It's created huge anxiety and uncertainty, by doing that I think they're undermining trust,"" she said. Micropubs like A Room with a Brew that cannot offer a ""substantial meal"" alongside pints for regulars will have to close A Room with a Brew, a micropub in Derby Road, Nottingham, lies between the city centre and the Lenton area popular with students. With no option to provide the crucial ""substantial meal"" to keep the beer flowing, licence-holder Jill Nettleton said the last week has been ""confusing"". ""Because we were expecting to close down last week we've let stocks run down, and now we've found out we can open tomorrow, which is a bit annoying"" she said. ""Why have they shut bars when nearly everything else is open?"" Jill Nettleton said not knowing if or when pubs would have to close meant buying less stock The rules on pubs in particular were a source of contention amid convivial conversation. ""I think the over-riding thing is people are genuinely confused as to why having a food option is a distinction,"" said one bemused regular. However, as often happens down the pub, a potential solution was suggested. ""Potentially you could nominate your local and just go to one place, or a small number,"" said Katy Voisey. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome also said she was not happy with the way information had been shared with local officials. ""The communication has been shoddy,"" she said. ""It's been so disrespectful. They've just treated the people of Nottingham with a total lack of respect."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nottingham had thehighest figures in the UKearlier this month, but its seven-day rate of infection has dropped again, according to the latest data. The city had the 23rd highest rate of infection per 100,000 people in England, at 451.5, in the week to 25 October - down from 611 the previous week. Mansfield's seven-day infection rate is currently at 349.5 cases per 100,000 people. Mansfield's Conservative MP Ben Bradley, who previously opposed his constituency moving into tier three, said ""big rises in cases in the north of the county"" meant it was hard to argue with the tightening of restrictions. ""The more and more those figures are similar - and we've seen Mansfield is pretty much the same as Broxtowe in terms of numbers - it's becoming increasingly difficult to make that case and treat it differently,"" he said. What Covid tier is your area in and what are the rules? Nottingham's tier 3 restrictions 'heartbreaking' 'Too early to say' what Christmas rules will be Hospital bosses in Nottingham have cancelled some cancer operations due to ""pressure on intensive care units"". Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust medical director Keith Girling said the trust had taken the ""extremely difficult decision"" to postpone four cancer operations this week. More than eight million people in England will be living in the tier three ""very high"" alert level by the end of the week. Nottinghamshire will join the Liverpool City Region, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, South Yorkshire and Warrington in the highest tier. Pubs in tier three that do not serve substantial meals have to close, and there are further restrictions on households mixing. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

Post-furlough job loss 'hits young and minorities',"Young and ethnic minority workers were more likely to be made unemployed post-furlough, according to a new report. A survey of about 6,000 adults by the Resolution Foundation found 19% of 18-24 year olds who were furloughed during lockdown were unemployed in September. For black, Asian and minority ethnic workers the figure was 22%, compared to 9% for the general population. The Treasury said its wage support schemes had helped to protect millions of jobs. Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, the Resolution Foundation president, former government minister Lord Willetts, said the group's research findings were grim. ""Compared with previous recessions, the real slowdown is in the number of new jobs that people are moving into,"" he said. ""Once you become unemployed, finding new employment looks like it's even worse than it was after the financial crash."" He said young people were concentrated in sectors which had been worst affected by the pandemic such as hospitality and retail, while those who had lost their jobs had been faced with very few vacancies when looking for a new role. The government's Job Retention Scheme initially covered up to 80% of an individual's wages if they were placed on furlough and unable to work. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak began winding down the scheme from September and it will be replaced with the less generousJob Support Schemenext month. Seven ways the young have been hit by Covid 'This pandemic has left me with nothing job wise' Which sectors are hiring at the moment? The think tank's report found that while more than half of those who had been furloughed had returned to work, a third were still on full or partial furlough last month. Only 43% of those who had lost their jobs since March had found new work by September. For young people the figure fell to 33% and for those in hard-hit sectors like hospitality and leisure it was 36%. Kathleen Henehan, a researcher at the think tank, said: ""The first eight months of the Covid crisis have been marked by an almighty economic shock and unprecedented support that has cushioned the impact in terms of people's livelihoods. ""But the true nature of Britain's jobs crisis is starting to reveal itself."" ""Worryingly, fewer than half of those who have lost their jobs during the pandemic have been able to find work since,"" she added. ""This suggests that even if the public health crisis recedes in a few months' time, Britain's jobs crisis will be with us for far longer."" The Treasury defended its response, highlighting initiatives such as the""kickstart scheme"", which subsidises work placements for young people. A spokeswoman said: ""We're doing everything we can to ensure our coronavirus support reaches those who need it the most, across all backgrounds. ""Our wage support schemes, loans and other measures have helped protect millions of jobs across the country through this crisis.""

Thanks for joining us. This live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Lauren Turner, Mary O'Connor and Sarah Collerton. We'll see you again tomorrow for more coverage of the pandemic. We'll be pausing our live coverage in a few minutes, but if you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the main stories we've covered this Wednesday: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent For the second day in a row more than 300 new Covid deaths
have been reported. Wednesdayâs figure of 310 comes after 367 were reported on
Tuesday. A week before there were 191. The figures are in line with
the current trajectory, as they're doubling every two weeks. This is a much more gradual rise than we saw in the spring
when the figures were doubling every four days at one point. It suggests the UKâs current approach is still slowing the
spread of the virus, but will it be enough? We are only at the end of October and there are already
nearly 10,000 patients in hospital â that is halfway to the peak seen in
spring. With winter ahead of us and cases continuing to rise, there
is a growing sense within government that something must be done to reverse the
trend. The UK's central government has rejected the local branding of Covid restrictions in Bristol as ""tier one plus"" measures. The city - currently in tier one - is bringing in Covid marshals, conducting more analytic work, and boosting local contact tracing, to try to curb a recent rise in infections. Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said: ""These actions are being called tier one plus. Any further actions will be based on what we're seeing locally and through discussion with our local partners across the city and central government."" But a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""There are three local Covid alert levels which are enshrined in law and we are not considering the introduction of a 'plus' system."" She added that local leaders can bring in some additional measures, however. Meanwhile, a senior council official has warned North Yorkshire's tier one status is""hanging by a thread""and that a decision on tougher restrictions could come within days. Danai HowardBBC News Belgium could reach its maximum capacity for Covid-19
patients in intensive care by next Friday if the current rate of infections
continues, officials have warned. There are currently 911 coronavirus patients in intensive care in Belgium,external, with the number having been doubling every eight days. On average, 547 people have been admitted to hospital every day over the last week, which is already 85% higher than the week before. âAt this rate, we will reach 2,000 patients [the maximum capacity] by 6 November,â
said Steven van Gucht, the spokesman for Belgiumâs coronavirus taskforce. It's been widely reported by local media thatfurther restrictions,externalwill come into force on Friday in Belgiumâs northern Flanders
region, but van Gucht has urged people not to wait until then to limit
social interactions. âWhat we are doing now will have a huge impact on the
expected November peak. It takes at least 10 days before each new
measure has an effect on hospitals,"" he said. Belgian authorities have been accused of being slow to
introduce the new measures. On Tuesday, Flemish Minister-President Jan Jambon
defended the decision to introduce the rules on Friday evening,telling
Flemish radio,external: âLet it be clear:
nobody is banned from applying the measures right away. It just takes a little
time between political decision-making and implementing those things.â Belgium is currently the second hardest-hit country in all
of Europe, after the Czech Republic. Over the last two weeks, 1,424 new cases
have been recorded per 100,000 inhabitants,according to the
ECDC,external. While Halloween will be a little different this year, one family has not let coronavirus spoil the occasion. The Hargreaves family, who live in Llandaff, near Cardiff, have created a spooky display of Halloween decorations to bring a smile to children's faces during Wales' lockdown and to raise money for charity. Rosie, 10, outside her family home in Llandaff Danny, who works in TV special effects, with one of his decorations Danny and Carmela Hargreaves, both 41, and children Harry, 14, and Rosie, 10, spent the weekend installing more than 100 decorations - including gravestones, dragons, ghosts and giant spiders. The family want people follow the rules of thefirebreak lockdown currently in force across Wales, and only come to visit while out for exercise. The Hargreaves family outside their haunted house display Their display is in aid of the charity Dreams & Wishes, which supports seriously ill children across the UK. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A driver's documents being checked in Moscow For a second day running, Russia has reported its highest daily count of Covid-19 deaths with a total of 346. It comes amid reports that the health ministry has banned doctors at state-run hospitals from making unauthorised comments on the pandemic. From now on, doctors and officials must agree comments with the ministry in advance to improve âthe efficiencyâ of public information on Covid-19. Russian media reports suggest that hospitals across the country are struggling to cope with the worsening pandemic. Five days is the average amount of time patients in the Urals city of Chelyabinsk are having to wait for an ambulance, the popularKomsomolskaya Pravda,externaltabloid says. Local authorities point to a shortage of drivers and medics, saying that they hope to cut this to three days. In Siberiaâs Omsk, two ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients showed up outside the local health ministry having been turned away from the cityâs hospitals due to overcrowding, local news siteGorod 55,externalreports. A hospital in another Siberian city, Kuybyshev, is dealing with the problem of overcrowding by putting beds in its corridors, the localTayga.info,externalwebsite reports. It published photos showing elderly patients curled up in makeshift beds in the hospitalâs stairwells. Meanwhile, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said it is âprematureâ to lift current Covid-19 restrictions as he today announced he was extending certain measures - including the wearing of masks and a requirement that 30% of staff work from home - until 29 November. Secondary school pupils will continue to study online until 8 November, he said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced next month's spending review will take place on 25 November. The government scrapped its planned multi-year spending review, choosing a one-year review instead, due to the focus on the response to the pandemic. Some local leaders criticised the move, sayinglocal authorities need ""long-term financial certainty""as they deal with the effects of Covid-19. Sunak,who confirmed the 25 November date in a tweet,external, will use his review to set departmental resources and capital budgets for 2021-22, and the devolved administrations' block grants for the same period. Downing Street has suggested Sunak could use the review to announce extra support to feed families during the holidays. Funding for the NHS and schools remains multi-year, along with priority infrastructure projects. Around of two-thirds of coronavirus fines have been issued to people under the age of 35 and the vast majority of fines went to men, new figures show. Police in England and Wales handed out 20,223 fines for breaching coronavirus restrictions between 27 March and 19 October, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council data. Of those fines:  In England, 64 fines were issued for large gatherings such as illegal raves and parties, carrying a Â£10,000 penalty. Two were handed out in Wales. Provisional figures for England's recently introduced three-tier system show 268 fines have been issued, with 65 handed out for a breach of regulations in tier one, 79 in tier two, and 124 in tier three. Another 310 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, thelatest government figures show,external. It brings the total number of coronavirus deaths to 45,675, using that measure. There have also been a further 24,701 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK as of 09:00 on Wednesday, taking the total number of UK cases to 942,275. On Tuesday, the UK recorded its highly daily death figure since May, after 367 people were reported to have died with the virus. A broad but limited lockdown in Germany is going to take place from 2 November, reports say. An earlier draft plan, which we reported on, had the start date as two days later. Under the proposals, as yet unconfirmed:  Chancellor Angela Merkel and the state premiers will reconvene on 11 November to reassess the situation, under those proposed measures. An apparent loophole in government rules for Englandhas caused confusionover whether social clubs are subject to tier three Covid restrictions on serving alcohol. Inareas placed in tier three, pubs and bars must close unless they are serving substantial meals, and alcohol can only be served as part of a meal. But some social clubs are continuing to serve alcohol to members without a substantial meal after their local councils told them it was permitted. There are thousands of members clubs across England, including conservative clubs, working men's clubs and sports clubs. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde have all advised their local social clubs that the discrepancy exists because they hold club premises certificates and not premises licences. The Association of Conservative Clubs, which represents more than 800 clubs, said ""the legislation could be amended in the future to close this 'loop hole'"". The Department for Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment. Elizabeth Lusty runs online choirs and is hosting a Halloween-themed session with fancy dress Halloween is normally a time for creepy costumes, party games and trick or treating.

Drug companies GSK and Sanofi are tosupply 200 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidateto a global inoculation scheme. The vaccine, going through the first stages of testing, will be supplied to the Covax scheme, which is backed by the World Health Organization. Covax, which aims to deliver two billion vaccine doses around the world by the end of 2021, has already signed agreements this year with AstraZeneca and Novavax. It aims to discourage national governments from hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and to focus on vaccinating high-risk people first in every country. More than 180 nations, including China, have joined the plan, but some, including the US, have opted to stick with their own supply deals. GSK and Sanofi hope to have the first results of its trial by December. If it is successful, they will move on to further trials by the end of the year. Healthcare workers have been on the frontline of the pandemic for the last nine months, fighting to treat and save as many people infected with Covid-19 as possible. With the second wave already here in the UK, the battle isn't over yet - as the BBC's Marie-Louise Connolly found out when she spent a day observing staff at Northern Ireland's Altnagelvin Hospital. Many nurses there are working gruelling five-day stretches of 12-hour shifts to ensure colleagues and wards are not left understaffed. They are supposed to work one week of four - the next week three. They say that rarely happens.

Boeing is tocut another 7,000 jobsas its losses mount in the pandemic. The US plane maker, which had already announced deep cuts, said its staff would number just 130,000 by the end of next year - 20% down on the 160,000 it employed before the crisis. The continuing pandemic and safety concerns about its 737 Max jet have contributed to a slump in orders. The pandemic has caused a huge drop in air travel, pushing major airlines to the brink of bankruptcy and forcing them to cut staff and drop plans for new aircraft. As a result, Boeing has slashed production and also cut jobs. It posted a loss of $466m (Â£354m) for the three months to 30 September, its fourth straight quarterly decline. Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check Indiaâs capital city is
witnessing a fresh spike in coronavirus cases, although overall numbers have been
declining in the country since a peak in September. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 4,853
cases, the most detected so far in a single day since the pandemic hit India in
March. This spike in cases comes after a
change in testing strategy, with the Delhi authorities moving to the gold
standard PCR tests from less accurate (but faster) rapid antigen tests. The city has re-tested about 85%
of those who had tested negative in rapid antigen tests in October, but still
had symptoms, compared with 10-15% in September. Delhi is conducting nearly
60,000 tests a day - a number thatâs been more or less constant for some
months. The proportion of positive tests
is going up steadily, which suggests the city needs a further ramping up of
reliable testing. Read more on India's testing strategies here. Wales has recorded its highest number of daily coronavirus deaths in more than six months, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford tweeted: ""I am deeply saddened the number of coronavirus deaths in Wales reported over the past 24 hours is 37 - the highest number in more than 6 months."" There have also been a further 1,414 cases of Covid-19 recorded in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 46,459. Public Health Wales said after the latest 37 deaths, the total number had risen to 1,827. On Tuesday, the UK as a whole recorded its highest daily death toll since May, after another 367 people died within 28 days of a positive test. Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check Pupis returned to classrooms in Kenya earlier this month The World Health Organization (WHO) says Kenya has witnessed a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases in the last month. It says the country reported
4,594 new cases in the past week - up
51% on the previous week. That's the second-highest number of new weekly cases in the WHO's Africa region, excluding Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia. Restrictions in Kenya were eased in late September, allowed bars and restaurants to reopen, and overnight curfew hours to be reduced. Teaching in some school
classes resumed in mid-October. Across the whole of Africa there have been 1.7 million recorded Covid cases, and more than 41,000 deaths. Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe Correspondent The European Commission is calling on member states of the EU to co-ordinate their coronavirus policies as infections continue to rise. Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen is proposing leaders of member states co-operate on quarantine rules and travel policies. Von Der Leyen says the commission wants member states to agree a European Passenger Locator Form which would allow continent-wide contact tracing. Sheâs also called for common policies on quarantine, self-isolation and travel rules and information sharing about hospital capacity. The biggest test for EU solidarity will come when a vaccine becomes available and member states have to decide how to share it between their own populations and those of their neighbours. In her call for solidarity, Von Der Leyen said: ""No-one is safe until everyone is safe."" Brussels also wants EU governments to co-ordinate their testing strategies and make more use of rapid antigen tests. It comes asGermany and France are set to enter new lockdowns. Germany is expected to have a ""lockdown light"" in November while France is set to announce a four-week lockdown which would be less severe than that in spring.

Thanks for joining us. This live page was brought to you by Alice Evans, Lauren Turner, Mary O'Connor and Sarah Collerton. We'll see you again tomorrow for more coverage of the pandemic. We'll be pausing our live coverage in a few minutes, but if you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the main stories we've covered this Wednesday: Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent For the second day in a row more than 300 new Covid deaths
have been reported. Wednesdayâs figure of 310 comes after 367 were reported on
Tuesday. A week before there were 191. The figures are in line with
the current trajectory, as they're doubling every two weeks. This is a much more gradual rise than we saw in the spring
when the figures were doubling every four days at one point. It suggests the UKâs current approach is still slowing the
spread of the virus, but will it be enough? We are only at the end of October and there are already
nearly 10,000 patients in hospital â that is halfway to the peak seen in
spring. With winter ahead of us and cases continuing to rise, there
is a growing sense within government that something must be done to reverse the
trend. The UK's central government has rejected the local branding of Covid restrictions in Bristol as ""tier one plus"" measures. The city - currently in tier one - is bringing in Covid marshals, conducting more analytic work, and boosting local contact tracing, to try to curb a recent rise in infections. Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said: ""These actions are being called tier one plus. Any further actions will be based on what we're seeing locally and through discussion with our local partners across the city and central government."" But a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""There are three local Covid alert levels which are enshrined in law and we are not considering the introduction of a 'plus' system."" She added that local leaders can bring in some additional measures, however. Meanwhile, a senior council official has warned North Yorkshire's tier one status is""hanging by a thread""and that a decision on tougher restrictions could come within days. Danai HowardBBC News Belgium could reach its maximum capacity for Covid-19
patients in intensive care by next Friday if the current rate of infections
continues, officials have warned. There are currently 911 coronavirus patients in intensive care in Belgium,external, with the number having been doubling every eight days. On average, 547 people have been admitted to hospital every day over the last week, which is already 85% higher than the week before. âAt this rate, we will reach 2,000 patients [the maximum capacity] by 6 November,â
said Steven van Gucht, the spokesman for Belgiumâs coronavirus taskforce. It's been widely reported by local media thatfurther restrictions,externalwill come into force on Friday in Belgiumâs northern Flanders
region, but van Gucht has urged people not to wait until then to limit
social interactions. âWhat we are doing now will have a huge impact on the
expected November peak. It takes at least 10 days before each new
measure has an effect on hospitals,"" he said. Belgian authorities have been accused of being slow to
introduce the new measures. On Tuesday, Flemish Minister-President Jan Jambon
defended the decision to introduce the rules on Friday evening,telling
Flemish radio,external: âLet it be clear:
nobody is banned from applying the measures right away. It just takes a little
time between political decision-making and implementing those things.â Belgium is currently the second hardest-hit country in all
of Europe, after the Czech Republic. Over the last two weeks, 1,424 new cases
have been recorded per 100,000 inhabitants,according to the
ECDC,external. While Halloween will be a little different this year, one family has not let coronavirus spoil the occasion. The Hargreaves family, who live in Llandaff, near Cardiff, have created a spooky display of Halloween decorations to bring a smile to children's faces during Wales' lockdown and to raise money for charity. Rosie, 10, outside her family home in Llandaff Danny, who works in TV special effects, with one of his decorations Danny and Carmela Hargreaves, both 41, and children Harry, 14, and Rosie, 10, spent the weekend installing more than 100 decorations - including gravestones, dragons, ghosts and giant spiders. The family want people follow the rules of thefirebreak lockdown currently in force across Wales, and only come to visit while out for exercise. The Hargreaves family outside their haunted house display Their display is in aid of the charity Dreams & Wishes, which supports seriously ill children across the UK. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A driver's documents being checked in Moscow For a second day running, Russia has reported its highest daily count of Covid-19 deaths with a total of 346. It comes amid reports that the health ministry has banned doctors at state-run hospitals from making unauthorised comments on the pandemic. From now on, doctors and officials must agree comments with the ministry in advance to improve âthe efficiencyâ of public information on Covid-19. Russian media reports suggest that hospitals across the country are struggling to cope with the worsening pandemic. Five days is the average amount of time patients in the Urals city of Chelyabinsk are having to wait for an ambulance, the popularKomsomolskaya Pravda,externaltabloid says. Local authorities point to a shortage of drivers and medics, saying that they hope to cut this to three days. In Siberiaâs Omsk, two ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients showed up outside the local health ministry having been turned away from the cityâs hospitals due to overcrowding, local news siteGorod 55,externalreports. A hospital in another Siberian city, Kuybyshev, is dealing with the problem of overcrowding by putting beds in its corridors, the localTayga.info,externalwebsite reports. It published photos showing elderly patients curled up in makeshift beds in the hospitalâs stairwells. Meanwhile, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said it is âprematureâ to lift current Covid-19 restrictions as he today announced he was extending certain measures - including the wearing of masks and a requirement that 30% of staff work from home - until 29 November. Secondary school pupils will continue to study online until 8 November, he said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced next month's spending review will take place on 25 November. The government scrapped its planned multi-year spending review, choosing a one-year review instead, due to the focus on the response to the pandemic. Some local leaders criticised the move, sayinglocal authorities need ""long-term financial certainty""as they deal with the effects of Covid-19. Sunak,who confirmed the 25 November date in a tweet,external, will use his review to set departmental resources and capital budgets for 2021-22, and the devolved administrations' block grants for the same period. Downing Street has suggested Sunak could use the review to announce extra support to feed families during the holidays. Funding for the NHS and schools remains multi-year, along with priority infrastructure projects. Around of two-thirds of coronavirus fines have been issued to people under the age of 35 and the vast majority of fines went to men, new figures show. Police in England and Wales handed out 20,223 fines for breaching coronavirus restrictions between 27 March and 19 October, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council data. Of those fines:  In England, 64 fines were issued for large gatherings such as illegal raves and parties, carrying a Â£10,000 penalty. Two were handed out in Wales. Provisional figures for England's recently introduced three-tier system show 268 fines have been issued, with 65 handed out for a breach of regulations in tier one, 79 in tier two, and 124 in tier three. Another 310 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, thelatest government figures show,external. It brings the total number of coronavirus deaths to 45,675, using that measure. There have also been a further 24,701 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK as of 09:00 on Wednesday, taking the total number of UK cases to 942,275. On Tuesday, the UK recorded its highly daily death figure since May, after 367 people were reported to have died with the virus. A broad but limited lockdown in Germany is going to take place from 2 November, reports say. An earlier draft plan, which we reported on, had the start date as two days later. Under the proposals, as yet unconfirmed:  Chancellor Angela Merkel and the state premiers will reconvene on 11 November to reassess the situation, under those proposed measures. An apparent loophole in government rules for Englandhas caused confusionover whether social clubs are subject to tier three Covid restrictions on serving alcohol. Inareas placed in tier three, pubs and bars must close unless they are serving substantial meals, and alcohol can only be served as part of a meal. But some social clubs are continuing to serve alcohol to members without a substantial meal after their local councils told them it was permitted. There are thousands of members clubs across England, including conservative clubs, working men's clubs and sports clubs. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde have all advised their local social clubs that the discrepancy exists because they hold club premises certificates and not premises licences. The Association of Conservative Clubs, which represents more than 800 clubs, said ""the legislation could be amended in the future to close this 'loop hole'"". The Department for Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment.

Drug companies GSK and Sanofi are tosupply 200 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidateto a global inoculation scheme. The vaccine, going through the first stages of testing, will be supplied to the Covax scheme, which is backed by the World Health Organization. Covax, which aims to deliver two billion vaccine doses around the world by the end of 2021, has already signed agreements this year with AstraZeneca and Novavax. It aims to discourage national governments from hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and to focus on vaccinating high-risk people first in every country. More than 180 nations, including China, have joined the plan, but some, including the US, have opted to stick with their own supply deals. GSK and Sanofi hope to have the first results of its trial by December. If it is successful, they will move on to further trials by the end of the year. Healthcare workers have been on the frontline of the pandemic for the last nine months, fighting to treat and save as many people infected with Covid-19 as possible. With the second wave already here in the UK, the battle isn't over yet - as the BBC's Marie-Louise Connolly found out when she spent a day observing staff at Northern Ireland's Altnagelvin Hospital. Many nurses there are working gruelling five-day stretches of 12-hour shifts to ensure colleagues and wards are not left understaffed. They are supposed to work one week of four - the next week three. They say that rarely happens. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there was talk of staff burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder and coping with depression. But despite the tremendous pressure staff are under, the BBC found a strong sense of calm and order, with patients shown huge dignity and kindness. You can read morehere.

Police in Scotland break up hundreds of parties,"Police officers in Scotland are breaking up hundreds of house parties every week despite the ongoing ban on home visits because of Covid-19. There have been more than 3,000 call-outs since the force was granted new powers in late August, data obtained by the BBC shows. More than 420 fines have been issued and 83 arrests have been made. A spike in home gatherings in Tayside and Lanarkshire, where tough rules are being considered, can also be seen. Police Scotland weregranted powers by the government,externalon 28 August to break up large house parties that contravened new restrictions on social gatherings. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made it clear the move was necessary to ensure socialising continued in a safe and responsible manner. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Police to have powers to shut down parties Data, which was obtained by BBC Scotland through a freedom of information request, reveals police officers were called out to 3,052 illegal gatherings between 28 August and 14 October. A third of these reports occurred afternationwide restrictions were implementedon 23 September. Two of the largest spikes since these measures took affect have occurred in Dundee and Lanarkshire -areas now being touted for harsher restrictions. Police Scotland's response to the coronavirus pandemic is known as Operation Talla. A weekly log is produced as part of that operation. Some of the incidents it highlights include: Officers from the north east division reported 270 students holding an ""ongoing party"" in halls of residence In Motherwell about 20 people were found attending a ""religious gathering"" Police attended a student house party in St Andrews where eight students required ""reasonable force"" to eject them from a property In Edinburgh officers who attended a ""large out of control party andâ¦ were met with a hostile crowd, and several were arrested for police assault"" Airbnb properties are being increasingly used as ""popâup"" party venues where there is ""a clear level of planning ahead of these efforts to host illegal events"" Deputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: ""Despite overwhelming levels of co-operation and support from communities across Scotland, a small minority of people continue to host or participate in house parties and gatherings. ""These are not confined to certain age groups and people should not be in any doubt that house gatherings allow coronavirus to spread. ""Where we encounter wilful, repeated, persistent or flagrant breaches we will, as the public would expect and support, act decisively to enforce the law"". He added that assaults on officers during this challenging time were ""disgraceful and will not be tolerated"". The house party data also showed that only 41% of the parties police were called to resulted in fixed penalty notices or arrests. Paul Waterson, spokesman for the Scottish Licensed Trade Association (STLA), said it would be ""unlikely"" such leniency would be applied to a pub or restaurant for breaching guidelines. He added: ""People [attending house parties] should feel the full force of the law. If say bars flouted the laws then we'd be shut down."" Mr Waterson believed police officers were using discretion when attending potentially volatile house parties, and only issuing fines or making arrests if absolutely necessary. The STLA is one of severalhospitality industry bodies to have launched a legal challengeagainst the Scottish government's coronavirus restrictions. Mr Waterson said the continuing rate of illegal gatherings is ""further proof these measures that have targeted our trade haven't worked"". More than 250 call-outs were made by police in the five days following the introduction of the closure of pubs and restaurants in the central belt on 9 October. Mr Waterson said: ""So we've taken people out of a controlled environment. ""[And the data] shows that people will just start to do their own thing."" The Scottish government said it ""remains concerned at the prevalence of household gatherings"". A spokesman added: ""We know restrictions are tough and we don't want them in place a moment longer than needed, but everyone needs to continue to play their part in curtailing the spread of the virus."" Police documents obtained by BBC Scotland also show concern that the number of parties happening could be far greater than the 3,052 recorded between 28 August and 14 October. One of the Operation Talla reports said the force's ""methodology is designed to quantify the number of times officers have had to enter a private dwelling to investigate suspected breach of legislation or guidance"". The report added: ""If officers have not been assigned, or attend several hours later due to other demands and do not enter the premises, but, for example,close the incident concerned with 'house in darkness, no noise', this will not be included as a house party as there is no evidence there has been one."" What level might your area be heading into? Similarly while student parties only accounted for 188 (or 6%) of the police call outs, another of the internal police documents indicates the number could be higher. The report said: ""It should be noted that only instances where students are explicitly mentioned in the return or incident are included [in its data]."" But Matt Crilly, NUS Scotland president, said that ""the overwhelming majority of students take Covidâ19 very seriously"", and have made ""tremendous sacrifices already"" with exams cancelled and their learning disrupted.

Five days is the average amount of time patients in the Urals city of Chelyabinsk are having to wait for an ambulance, the popularKomsomolskaya Pravda,externaltabloid says. Local authorities point to a shortage of drivers and medics, saying that they hope to cut this to three days. In Siberiaâs Omsk, two ambulances carrying Covid-19 patients showed up outside the local health ministry having been turned away from the cityâs hospitals due to overcrowding, local news siteGorod 55,externalreports. A hospital in another Siberian city, Kuybyshev, is dealing with the problem of overcrowding by putting beds in its corridors, the localTayga.info,externalwebsite reports. It published photos showing elderly patients curled up in makeshift beds in the hospitalâs stairwells. Meanwhile, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said it is âprematureâ to lift current Covid-19 restrictions as he today announced he was extending certain measures - including the wearing of masks and a requirement that 30% of staff work from home - until 29 November. Secondary school pupils will continue to study online until 8 November, he said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced next month's spending review will take place on 25 November. The government scrapped its planned multi-year spending review, choosing a one-year review instead, due to the focus on the response to the pandemic. Some local leaders criticised the move, sayinglocal authorities need ""long-term financial certainty""as they deal with the effects of Covid-19. Sunak,who confirmed the 25 November date in a tweet,external, will use his review to set departmental resources and capital budgets for 2021-22, and the devolved administrations' block grants for the same period. Downing Street has suggested Sunak could use the review to announce extra support to feed families during the holidays. Funding for the NHS and schools remains multi-year, along with priority infrastructure projects. Around of two-thirds of coronavirus fines have been issued to people under the age of 35 and the vast majority of fines went to men, new figures show. Police in England and Wales handed out 20,223 fines for breaching coronavirus restrictions between 27 March and 19 October, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council data. Of those fines:  In England, 64 fines were issued for large gatherings such as illegal raves and parties, carrying a Â£10,000 penalty. Two were handed out in Wales. Provisional figures for England's recently introduced three-tier system show 268 fines have been issued, with 65 handed out for a breach of regulations in tier one, 79 in tier two, and 124 in tier three. Another 310 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, thelatest government figures show,external. It brings the total number of coronavirus deaths to 45,675, using that measure. There have also been a further 24,701 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK as of 09:00 on Wednesday, taking the total number of UK cases to 942,275. On Tuesday, the UK recorded its highly daily death figure since May, after 367 people were reported to have died with the virus. A broad but limited lockdown in Germany is going to take place from 2 November, reports say. An earlier draft plan, which we reported on, had the start date as two days later. Under the proposals, as yet unconfirmed:  Chancellor Angela Merkel and the state premiers will reconvene on 11 November to reassess the situation, under those proposed measures. An apparent loophole in government rules for Englandhas caused confusionover whether social clubs are subject to tier three Covid restrictions on serving alcohol. Inareas placed in tier three, pubs and bars must close unless they are serving substantial meals, and alcohol can only be served as part of a meal. But some social clubs are continuing to serve alcohol to members without a substantial meal after their local councils told them it was permitted. There are thousands of members clubs across England, including conservative clubs, working men's clubs and sports clubs. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde have all advised their local social clubs that the discrepancy exists because they hold club premises certificates and not premises licences. The Association of Conservative Clubs, which represents more than 800 clubs, said ""the legislation could be amended in the future to close this 'loop hole'"". The Department for Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment.

Drug companies GSK and Sanofi are tosupply 200 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidateto a global inoculation scheme. The vaccine, going through the first stages of testing, will be supplied to the Covax scheme, which is backed by the World Health Organization. Covax, which aims to deliver two billion vaccine doses around the world by the end of 2021, has already signed agreements this year with AstraZeneca and Novavax. It aims to discourage national governments from hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and to focus on vaccinating high-risk people first in every country. More than 180 nations, including China, have joined the plan, but some, including the US, have opted to stick with their own supply deals. GSK and Sanofi hope to have the first results of its trial by December. If it is successful, they will move on to further trials by the end of the year. Healthcare workers have been on the frontline of the pandemic for the last nine months, fighting to treat and save as many people infected with Covid-19 as possible. With the second wave already here in the UK, the battle isn't over yet - as the BBC's Marie-Louise Connolly found out when she spent a day observing staff at Northern Ireland's Altnagelvin Hospital. Many nurses there are working gruelling five-day stretches of 12-hour shifts to ensure colleagues and wards are not left understaffed. They are supposed to work one week of four - the next week three. They say that rarely happens. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there was talk of staff burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder and coping with depression. But despite the tremendous pressure staff are under, the BBC found a strong sense of calm and order, with patients shown huge dignity and kindness. You can read morehere. Boeing is tocut another 7,000 jobsas its losses mount in the pandemic. The US plane maker, which had already announced deep cuts, said its staff would number just 130,000 by the end of next year - 20% down on the 160,000 it employed before the crisis. The continuing pandemic and safety concerns about its 737 Max jet have contributed to a slump in orders. The pandemic has caused a huge drop in air travel, pushing major airlines to the brink of bankruptcy and forcing them to cut staff and drop plans for new aircraft. As a result, Boeing has slashed production and also cut jobs. It posted a loss of $466m (Â£354m) for the three months to 30 September, its fourth straight quarterly decline. Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check Indiaâs capital city is
witnessing a fresh spike in coronavirus cases, although overall numbers have been
declining in the country since a peak in September. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 4,853
cases, the most detected so far in a single day since the pandemic hit India in
March. This spike in cases comes after a
change in testing strategy, with the Delhi authorities moving to the gold
standard PCR tests from less accurate (but faster) rapid antigen tests. The city has re-tested about 85%
of those who had tested negative in rapid antigen tests in October, but still
had symptoms, compared with 10-15% in September. Delhi is conducting nearly
60,000 tests a day - a number thatâs been more or less constant for some
months. The proportion of positive tests
is going up steadily, which suggests the city needs a further ramping up of
reliable testing. Read more on India's testing strategies here. Wales has recorded its highest number of daily coronavirus deaths in more than six months, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford tweeted: ""I am deeply saddened the number of coronavirus deaths in Wales reported over the past 24 hours is 37 - the highest number in more than 6 months."" There have also been a further 1,414 cases of Covid-19 recorded in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 46,459. Public Health Wales said after the latest 37 deaths, the total number had risen to 1,827. On Tuesday, the UK as a whole recorded its highest daily death toll since May, after another 367 people died within 28 days of a positive test. Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check Pupis returned to classrooms in Kenya earlier this month The World Health Organization (WHO) says Kenya has witnessed a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases in the last month. It says the country reported
4,594 new cases in the past week - up
51% on the previous week. That's the second-highest number of new weekly cases in the WHO's Africa region, excluding Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia. Restrictions in Kenya were eased in late September, allowed bars and restaurants to reopen, and overnight curfew hours to be reduced. Teaching in some school
classes resumed in mid-October. Across the whole of Africa there have been 1.7 million recorded Covid cases, and more than 41,000 deaths. Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe Correspondent The European Commission is calling on member states of the EU to co-ordinate their coronavirus policies as infections continue to rise. Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen is proposing leaders of member states co-operate on quarantine rules and travel policies. Von Der Leyen says the commission wants member states to agree a European Passenger Locator Form which would allow continent-wide contact tracing. Sheâs also called for common policies on quarantine, self-isolation and travel rules and information sharing about hospital capacity. The biggest test for EU solidarity will come when a vaccine becomes available and member states have to decide how to share it between their own populations and those of their neighbours. In her call for solidarity, Von Der Leyen said: ""No-one is safe until everyone is safe."" Brussels also wants EU governments to co-ordinate their testing strategies and make more use of rapid antigen tests. It comes asGermany and France are set to enter new lockdowns. Germany is expected to have a ""lockdown light"" in November while France is set to announce a four-week lockdown which would be less severe than that in spring. Details of the measures to be introduced in each country are expected later.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Biden hits new battleground, Trump blitzes Midwest","This video can not be played Trump: ""We're getting your husbands back to work"" Democratic White House challenger Joe Biden blasted President Donald Trump as a conman during a campaign foray into traditionally Republican territory. In Georgia, Mr Biden said that Mr Trump's handling of coronavirus amounted to a ""capitulation"". Mr Trump kept blitzing the swing states that he won in 2016, warning in Michigan that its ""economic survival"" was on the line if Mr Biden won. According to opinion polls, Mr Trump lags behind with a week to go. But the race is tighter in critical battleground states such as Arizona, Florida and North Carolina. More than 69 million people have already voted early by post or in person in a record-breaking surge driven mainly by the coronavirus pandemic. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? A really simple guide to the US election The other US election that's hugely important This video can not be played Can we believe the polls this time? On Tuesday, Mr Trump held rallies in Nebraska and two states he snatched from Democrats in 2016: Michigan and Wisconsin. In Lansing, Michigan's capital, he warned: ""This election is a matter of economic survival for Michigan."" And he told suburban women, a demographic that many opinion polls suggest he is struggling to win over: ""Your husbands, they want to get back to work, right? We're getting your husbands back to work."" Before leaving the White House, the president renewed his criticism of postal ballots - more than 46 million of which have been cast so far. The huge volume of mail-in votes, which could take days or weeks to tally, means a winner is not certain to be known on election night next week. ""It would be very, very proper and very nice if a winner were declared on November 3, instead of counting ballots for two weeks, which is totally inappropriate,"" Mr Trump told reporters before heading to the Midwest. Why we might have to wait for the US election results Mr Trump - who only this month was admitted to hospital with coronavirus - is planning a head-spinning 11 rallies in the final two days of the election campaign before voting day next Tuesday. Meanwhile, First Lady Melania Trump joined the campaign fray solo for the first time on Tuesday, assailing Mr Biden as a ""socialist"". This video can not be played Melania Trump: ""Media created picture of my husband I don't recognise"" In the critical election state of Pennsylvania, Mrs Trump cast doubt on Mr Biden's claims that he could do a better job as president. ""Well, the American people can look at Joe Biden's 36 years in Congress and eight years in the vice-presidency and determine whether they think he'll finally be able to get something done for the American people."" If Donald Trump loses the White House next week, it won't be for a lack of effort on the campaign trail down the stretch. On Tuesday, he kicked off a three-day, multi-state swing across the country with a stop in Lansing, Michigan. Despite a temperature hovering just above freezing as light rain mixed with ice pelted the airfield, a crowd of several thousand waited for hours to see the president. ""I'm working my ass off,"" Mr Trump told the cheering throngs of people, who at one point responded with chants of ""We love you"". The president went on to speak for more than an hour, mixing in his normal stump-speech attacks on his opponent, Joe Biden, with some more focused riffs on immigration and trade in the car-industry-dominated state. He once again attacked the state's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, for aggressive attempts to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, to which the crowd responded with the now-familiar ""lock her up"" chant. Michigan was perhaps the biggest surprise of the 2016 election, as Mr Trump narrowly carried it over Hillary Clinton despite opinion polls before the election showing him behind by sometimes large margins. The polls aren't encouraging for the president this time around either, although after the rally the campaign gave printouts to the press suggesting that Republicans have a slight advantage in returned ballots in the state so far. Another Michigan surprise would go a long way toward unlocking a path for the president to re-election. In a trip to Warm Springs, Georgia, on Tuesday, Mr Biden vowed to be ""a president who doesn't divide us, but unites us"" and someone who could ""heal this nation"". Georgia has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1992, but opinion polls suggest the Democrat is statistically tied with Mr Trump in the southern state. This video can not be played Biden speaks in Warm Springs, Georgia Even as he presented himself as a president for all Americans regardless of party, Mr Biden targeted his rival. ""Time and again throughout our history, we have seen the charlatans, the conmen, the phony populists - who have sought to play to our fears, appeal to our worst appetites, and pick at the oldest scabs we have for their own political gain. ""They appear when the nation has been hit the hardest and we're at our most vulnerable. Never to solve anything. Always to benefit themselves."" This video can not be played BBC Reality Check breaks down the bill for the world's most expensive election Mr Biden kept hammering away at his opponent's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 225,000 Americans. He said Mr Trump had ""shrugged. He's swaggered. And he's surrendered."" In a sign of the Biden campaign's confidence that it can expand the electoral map, he will travel later this week to Iowa, a state that Mr Trump won by 10 points four years ago. Mr Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, will head to Arizona and Texas, where no Democrat has been elected to statewide office since 1994. No doubt mindful that 2016 Democratic White House nominee Hillary Clinton also tried to make in-roads in Republican states, only to lose critical Democratic strongholds, Mr Biden is also scheduled to visit Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida in the coming days. This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins Former President Barack Obama was back on the trail in Florida on Tuesday on behalf of his former vice-president. At a drive-in rally in Orlando, Mr Obama warned Democratic voters not to be ""complacent"" or ""lazy"", allowing Mr Trump to pull off another come-from-behind victory as he did in 2016.

âShops refusing cash left me unable to buy basicsâ,"Stores refusing to accept cash have left consumers unable to buy basics such as groceries and medicine, according to Which? The consumer group warned the cash system is being threatened as shops have declined payments using banknotes and coins during the coronavirus crisis. Thousands of people have been prevented from paying with cash in recent months. This risks excluding vulnerable people, the campaign group said. Some shops have refused payments with banknotes and coins during the coronavirus crisis due to social distancing concerns, but this has threatened the viability of the cash system, it warned. Thomas Scobie of Stirling, who lives on universal credit, said: ""When shops started to accept only card payment it meant I couldn't buy the essentials I needed to feed myself."" He has a chronic health condition and a mental health disorder, so found the process of finding places to shop that would accept his cash ""a real struggle and depressing"". ""The reason I don't use a card is because I worry about the people that are able to clone cards and scam people and being on a fixed income, I simply couldn't survive if I lost any of that money,"" he said. Which? is asking businesses to show greater understanding and flexibility to customers who may only be able to pay in cash. ""The rapid move towards a cashless society risks excluding the most vulnerable from being able to pay for vital products and services,"" said Richard Piggin, head of external affairs and campaigns at Which?. ""We're alarmed at the reports of people leaving food and medicine behind because they can't pay with cash and it underlines how important it is to have a co-ordinated approach to protecting the fragile cash system."" Natalie Ceeney, chairwoman of the Access to Cash Review, said: ""Businesses who don't accept cash are saying to the most vulnerable in society: 'You're not welcome here'. ""Right now, as so many people are going through hardship and isolation, it's critical that no one gets excluded."" Coronavirus 'will hasten the decline of cash' Will we be getting our cash from shops, not ATMs? The government has plans to make rules to protect cash and, as part of this, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) could oversee that. Which? said it supports the proposal regarding the FCA and wants to see the regulator track levels of cash acceptance. ""The government has already proposed giving the FCA responsibility for cash,"" said My Piggin. ""It's vital that acceptance is also treated as a priority as part of this, as commitments to safeguarding cash access will be severely undermined if people are left with nowhere to spend it."" The Access to Cash Review revealed eight million people were at risk in the UK from the demise of cash. Nearly 2,500 people responded to Which?'s call for people to report their payment problems last month. Two fifths of those who reported being unable to pay with cash said that they did not have access to another payment method. Some people were able to go to another shop to buy what they wanted but almost a third were unable to buy items or services at all. Which? said two out of five people were left empty handed when they had problems paying for groceries, while nearly a fifth had problems trying to buy medicine. Andy Fisher in Beverley said: ""I was told by one shop assistant that cash was 'a thing of the past' when I tried to buy some stationery, which made me feel uncomfortable and patronised. ""I feel that coronavirus is being used as an excuse to get rid of cash but lots of people locally still need it, such as the elderly or vulnerable."" John Howells, chief executive of cash machine network Link, said: ""We can't afford to sleepwalk into a cashless society where people are left behind."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ""Many older people rely on cash and it's really disappointing that even after venturing out to do their shopping, which for some feels like a significant risk at the moment, they may then be unable to buy their essential items.""

Pandemic deposes Heathrow as top European airport,"Heathrow says it has been overtaken as Europe's busiest airport for the first time by Paris Charles de Gaulle because of a slump in demand for air travel. Some 19 million passengers used Heathrow in the first nine months of the year, versus 19.3 million who used the airport in the French capital. Heathrow said Amsterdam Schiphol and Frankfurt were ""close behind"". It said all three rivals had adopted testing regimes as a way of people reducing or avoiding quarantine. By contrast, Britain had been ""too slow to embrace passenger testing"" and was ""falling behind"". Heathrow reported an 84% fall in passenger numbers for the three months to September as losses for the year to date widened to Â£1.5bn. ""Already in France and Germany, even Canada and Ireland have moved to testing and this is the way to make sure we can protect jobs in the UK as well as protecting people from coronavirus,"" Mr Holland Kaye told the BBC. ""The government really need to get on and make this happen before the beginning of December if we are going to save people's jobs."" Transport Secretary Grant Shappshas said he wants to have post-arrivals testing up and running in the UK by 1 December. This would reduce the amount of time arrivals from high risk destinations had to spend in quarantine from 14 days - seen as a big deterrent to travel - to a week. But Mr Holland Kaye said the industry still needed a ""commitment"" it would happen. He added that the only way to really revive air travel was to bring in widespread pre-departure testing that met internationally agreed standards. In the first nine months of 2020, Heathrow had 19m passengers - down 69% from 61m in the same period last year Paris CDG had 19.3m passengers in the same period, a drop of 67% from the 58 million it had last year. Before the pandemic, Heathrow would always boast that it was the biggest airport in Europe. So it's striking that when announcing its unsurprisingly dreadful financial results, the airport has gone out of its way to underline the fact that it no longer holds that title. Of course, all of the world's airports are seeing record low passenger numbers right now and not even a crystal ball will tell you what the picture will be next year and beyond. But by announcing that Paris Charles de Gaulle has robbed it of Europe's top spot, Heathrow is subtly taking aim at the UK government. UK aviation bosses are fed up that ministers have still not approved a testing regime for passengers arriving into the country as a way for people to avoid a two-week quarantine. The warning from Heathrow is clear: if the UK doesn't act quickly to help its aviation sector recover, then passenger traffic will head elsewhere and even more jobs will be lost at home. The airport has already begun offering pre-departure testing, but only for passengers travelling to destinations that require it. He urged the UK government to speed up talks with the US over creating a ""pilot air bridge"" for such a scheme. ""That is the best way to make sure we are no longer importing Covid and also that people can travel with confidence."" Heathrow, which is already cutting 500 jobs, said it forecast passenger numbers of 22.6 million next year - less than a quarter of 2019 levels. But while it is losing about Â£5m a day, it said its finances were solid and it had reserves to tide it over until 2023. The air travel industry has been hit hard by coronavirus, with airlines such as British Airways and Easyjet slashing thousands of jobs. The International Air Transport Association, which represents 290 airlines, estimates that air traffic will not return to pre-pandemic levels until at least 2024.

Philadelphia rocked by unrest after police shooting,"This video can not be played Walter Wallace Jr's father has called for an end to the violence and looting Hundreds of protesters marched through the US city of Philadelphia for a second night, demanding racial justice after police fatally shot a black man. The family of Walter Wallace Jr says he was suffering a mental health crisis when officers opened fire on him. Police say they shot him because he would not drop a knife he was holding. The National Guard as well as police reinforcements have been deployed. Authorities say 30 officers were hurt during Monday night clashes. The city's police have also accused protesters of looting and ransacking businesses during the unrest. Mr Wallace, 27, had bipolar disorder, and his wife told officers this before they shot him, a lawyer representing his family said. Philadelphia also saw large protests earlier this year over police brutality and racism followingthe death of George Floyd in Minnesota. The marches began peacefully on Tuesday but became more confrontational as the evening drew on. Officers in riot gear arrived in squad cars, on bicycles and on buses, and used their bikes to shove protesters back from barricade lines. Shops around the city closed early and set up barricades. Police and the city's office of emergency management said widespread looting was reported in several areas. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, protesters tried to erect makeshift barricades using bins. Police used pepper spray and batons after saying they were attacked by demonstrators. Don't shoot, I'm disabled Three facts that help explain anger in the US A city pledged to abolish its police. Then what? On Monday, more than 300 people took to the streets to protest, and 91 were arrested. One officer was in hospital with a broken leg and other injuries after being struck by a pickup truck. This video can not be played There were car fires as protests erupted on the streets of Philadelphia Speaking at a campaign rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday, President Donald Trump attempted to tie the protesters to his democratic rival, former Vice-President Joe Biden, without providing evidence of a link. ""Last night [Monday] Philadelphia was torn up by Biden-supporting radicals,"" he said. ""Thirty police officers, Philadelphia police officers, they were injured, some badly. Biden stands with the rioters, and I stand with the heroes of law enforcement."" In a joint statement, Mr Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, said: ""We cannot accept that in this country a mental health crisis ends in death. ""It makes the shock and grief and violence of yesterday's shooting that much more painful, especially for a community that has already endured so much trauma,"" they added, while condemning Monday's looting, calling it a crime. Philadelphia is the largest city in Pennsylvania, a state critical to next week's presidential election. Mayor Jim Kenney, a Democrat, said the video of the shooting presented ""difficult questions that must be answered"", and that he was looking forward to a ""speedy and transparent resolution"" to the case. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said she had visited the scene and felt the ""anger of the community"". ""We anticipate the chance of additional incidents of civil unrest,"" she said, vowing to take ""additional steps to ensure order"". Police reinforcements along with the National Guard have been deployed Police said two officers responded to a report of a man with a weapon in the neighbourhood of Cobbs Creek in West Philadelphia at about 16:00 (20:00 GMT) on Monday. Police spokeswoman Tanya Little told AP news agency that a man, later identified as Mr Wallace, was holding a knife when the officers approached, and instead of following orders to drop the weapon he ""advanced towards them"". Both officers fired ""several times"", hitting Mr Wallace in the shoulder and chest, she said. One of the officers drove him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to Ms Little. Footage shared on social media shows two officers pointing their guns at Mr Wallace as he walks towards them. The officers back away from him and shout at him to put the knife down. Shots are then fired and Mr Wallace is seen lying on the street. Mr Wallace's fathertold the Philadelphia Inquirer that his son had mental health issues and was on medication,external. ""Why didn't they use a Taser?"" he asked. At Tuesday's news conference, officials said the officers both fired seven shots each. The officers, who have not been named, were wearing body cameras and did not carry tasers. Meanwhile, Mr Wallace's family lawyer said they had called for an ambulance - not police - to help deal with Walter Wallace's mental issues. Instead, two police officers arrived, lawyer Shaka Johnson was quoted as saying by the Inquirer. Mr Wallace's pregnant wife told them her husband had bipolar disorder and was in crisis. Mr Wallace was an aspiring rapper, and often recorded songs on issues including gun and police violence and racial injustice, according to relatives and neighbours, who described him as a ""quiet, family man"". The Inquirer reported he was a father of eight,externalwho had been in and out of court throughout his adult life.

"Call to improve 'disjointed' Covid business helpSmall companies want to see the Welsh and UK governments ""work together"", a business group says.Wales","The past few months have been ""immensely challenging"" says Rachel Bedgood Small company owners want to see the Welsh and UK governments ""work together"" to offer support during the Covid-19 crisis, according to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). One business owner told BBC Wales the help available was ""disjointed"". The FSB also warned job losses from small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) - around 60% of private employment - could have a large impact overall. The UK government said it had provided billions of pounds of support to Wales. A Welsh Government spokesperson said it agreed with the FSB's comments. Redundancy warning in lockdown appeal to Treasury Welsh businesses offered Â£140m Covid help 'Job hunting in the crisis has been soul destroying' The UK government's furlough scheme ends on 31 October, and the newJob Support Schemestarts on 1 November, just over half way through the Welsh firebreak lockdown. Until the end of October the UK government is paying 60% of wages and the employer - including businesses closed down during the lockdown - has to pay 20%. Only previously furloughed employees can be furloughed again. The Welsh Government asked the Treasury to bring forward the Job Support Scheme - which will cover 67% of wages for employees of closed businesses - so it applied to the whole firebreak period. It said it had offered to pay the difference so Welsh businesses would not have to apply to two schemes, but this was declined by the UK government. The FSB expressed concerns about the impact on companies caused by thatgap. Its policy chair Ben Francis said the situation was creating an administrative burden on SMEs, who employ an estimated 750,000 people in Wales. ""While perhaps [small businesses] aren't necessarily as headline grabbing as when you say a large scale or a chain employer decides to cut jobs, they still are just as important."" Business groups are concerned about the amount of administration businesses face to access support He said the first minister's announcement of the firebreak lockdown was an ""extremely worrying time for business owners in Wales, particularly given the months that preceded the announcement"". The Welsh Government has announced Â£5m to help workers who fall through the gap in the Treasury's wage support schemes. Mountain Ash-based CBS employs 20 people, processing checks on job candidates, particularly in areas where safeguarding is paramount. Chief executive Rachel Bedgood explained the business was reliant on a buoyant recruitment market, adding the past few months have been ""immensely challenging"" and ""the demand for our services relatively quickly dropped off a cliff"". ""The furlough scheme was initially fantastic. The new [Job Support Scheme that] has just come in now is a little bit too late for us."" She said making redundancies was ""difficult"", having replaced seven posts with five new higher-skilled jobs, but remained positive about her 15-year-old business. Ms Bedgood echoed the FSB's calls for consistent policies from the Welsh and UK governments during the pandemic. ""It's difficult because it's so disjointed. So whereas we have the Chancellor now coming forward with these new offers... if we're not united in the decision processes that we make, whether it be lockdown, furlough or finance help, then it's just not going to work effectively or certainly going to benefit everyone."" The UK government said it had given the Welsh Government ""an additional Â£4.4bn to cope with the pressures of the pandemic"" and ""protected more than half a million jobs in Wales through our income support schemes"".

Watching one US president take on another,"The Trump faithful in Florida are young and old Florida. The mere mention of the state when talking about politics brings smiles to Republican faces and sends shivers down Democratic spines. Florida is where liberal dreams are broken. It's the place where, in what was otherwise a Democratic wave election of 2018, the party narrowly lost the governorship and an incumbent Senate seat. It's where, in 2000, 537 votes delivered the White House to Republican George W Bush, instead of Al Gore. For Democrats, Florida is like an unreliable friend - never around when needed. The last four times the party won the presidency, they could have lost Florida and still prevailed. But in two of the last three Democratic defeats, winning Florida would have meant taking the White House. That one exception was 2016, when despite losing the nationwide popular vote, Donald Trump eked out a plurality in enough states to win a comfortable electoral college victory. The results from Florida, however, were the first flashing sign that Democrat Hillary Clinton was in trouble on election night. Fast forward four years, and Florida is once again an electoral battleground that could decide the presidency. Polls, as they always seem to do here, show the state is close. And if the overall race is tight, Florida - with its 29 electoral votes - could once again be decisive. A really simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Since winning the presidency, Trump has lavished attention on Florida - a reflection of how important the state is to his electoral strategy. He regularly visits his Mar-a-Lago and the Doral properties there and relinquished his official New York residence in favour of the state's warmer, and politically friendlier, climes. Trump referred to Florida as his ""home state"" before a cheering crowd of thousands of supporters at an airport rally in the northwest city of Pensacola on Friday - and the following day, he travelled to Palm Beach to cast his ballot in person. Pensacola was Trump's fourth rally in the ""sunshine state"" since being hospitalised for Covid-19 at the end of September and the first in the state's panhandle, a Republican stronghold with its high number of conservative-leaning current and retired military personnel and politics that hews closer to neighbouring Alabama and Mississippi. ""The panhandle is what makes Florida a swing state,"" says Dana Arduini, a Pensacola resident who ran a stand selling Trump-related merchandise outside the rally. She says the area balances out the more Democratic areas in the southern portion of the state. According to Arduini, flags are usually the big sellers for her, although on this particular sunny afternoon, hats were in demand. There's been talk in the past about so-called ""shy"" Trump voters who aren't registered in the polls showing Biden ahead, but at least in Florida the president's supporters are vocal and visible. ""I think people in Florida like Trump because he doesn't blow sunshine up your butt,"" says Kristen Rasmussen, who attended her first presidential rally wearing a bright red Trump-Pence T-shirt. ""I'm a pre-school teacher, so I don't like it when he bullies people, but if you're going into politics you've got to be ready for that. You've got to have a tough skin."" Could Biden's Latino problem lose him the election? What older voters make of Trump Covid story Congressman Matt Gaetz, who represents Pensacola in the House of Representatives, laid out the stakes in a warm-up speech for the president. ""We've elected presidents before, and we know how to do it,"" he said. ""We love our military, and our veterans, and our law enforcement and our flag and our anthem, and we love the fact that Donald J Trump is the president of the United States."" The level of devotion to the president, particularly in Florida, is readily apparent at his campaign rallies. His supporters gather outside Mar-a-Lago, waving signs and cheering whenever Trump visits the estate. Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the campaign organised regular social events - in bars, restaurants and even bowling alleys. The southern Florida city of West Palm Beach, which despite being president's new official residence is reliable Democratic, is also home to what's touted as the largest independently organised Trump fan club. This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins The Club 45, as it's called, has hosted monthly gatherings with hundreds, sometimes thousands, attending complete with merchants, guest speakers and Trump-themed regalia. On Tuesday, it is planning a Trump victory party in a hotel ballroom with a buffet and ice-cream bar. ""We've had candidates who couldn't connect with the Florida voter,"" said Joe Budd, co-founder of the club. ""The president connects on a different level than anybody in the past. I like to call him the blue-collar billionaire. He's a real people-person. He was a working man."" On Saturday, 90km (56 miles) south of Palm Beach and 850km (528 miles) from Trump's Pensacola airport gathering the day before, Barack Obama - the Democrat who carried Florida twice in his presidential bids - was hitting the campaign trail for his former vice president. ""If you bring Florida home, this thing's over,"" he said, using bullhorn to address a group of campaign volunteers in Miami. A few hours later, over the din of honking horns at a drive-in car rally at a local university, he struck an incredulous tone when talking about the man who replaced him in the White House. Obama stumped for Biden at a drive-in rally ""This pandemic would have been tough for any president, because we have not seen something like this in 100 years,"" he said. ""But the idea that somehow this White House has done anything but completely screw this thing up is nonsense."" Amore Rodrigues, a 27-year-old volunteer with the group Cubanos for Biden, said she listened to Obama speak with tears in her eyes. ""I realised how much I missed having a president that is competent, that shares love, that exudes peace, stand up there and speak to us,"" she said. She says she vividly remembers the pain of Clinton's 2016 loss and continues to be nervous about the Florida race even with polls showing a slight Biden lead. One of her big concerns is that Republicans, including Trump, have been trying to paint Biden as a socialist, which has negative connotations among the regions many Cuban and South American transplants, who equate the term with Fidel Castro and Nicolas Maduro dictatorships. How ghost of 'socialism' splits US Venezuelan vote If Trump and the Republicans can build on traditional Cuban support in south Florida - while continuing to turn out their faithful in the northern part of the state - it could go a long way toward ensuring Trump wins again. ""Our people's trauma is being manipulated as a fear tactic to get people to vote for the right,"" she says. It was a concern Obama himself tried to address in his speech, saying that Republican attempts to paint Biden as a Latin American-style communist were ridiculous. ""He was a senator from Delaware. He was my vice-president. I think people would know if he were a secret socialist by now."" Hispanics were just part of the electoral coalition Obama assembled in his Florida victories, along with young and black voters. Four years ago, that coalition failed the Democrats. But this time, says Raymond Adderly, a 16-year-old Biden volunteer, will be different. ""It was embarrassing that Hillary Clinton lost. We thought Florida would do better,"" he says. ""But we're seeing some of the highest youth turnout in history now. We're seeing more and more African-Americans take to the streets every day not only to protest, but to vote. ""Vote by vote, we'll win this election."" Although election day in the US is still a week away, Floridians have been voting by mail for weeks and at early in-person locations since last Monday. Because the state processes the ballots as they receive them and release information about the party affiliation of those who have voted, that has given campaigns and political analysts an early look at how the race might be shaping up. So far, at least, there have been encouraging signs for the Democrats. As of Monday, the state has already received 86% of the total early vote recorded in 2016. Registered Democrats have cast 596,000 more mail-in ballots than Republicans, while 230,000 more Republicans have voted early at in-person locations - giving Biden what could amount to an early 366,000 vote advantage. Why it can be hard to vote in the US The Trump campaign has touted a poll showing that Republicans might have a big advantage during in-person voting on election day - perhaps enough to erase the Democratic lead - in part because of the president's repeated questioning of the safety and reliability of mail-in voting. The risk, according to pollster and Democratic campaign consultant Evan Roth Smith, is that the size of such a late-breaking ""red wave"" would have to be unprecedented. This video can not be played Biden or Trump? Persuading an undecided voter ""There's no room for error,"" Smith says. ""Trump can't have a couple of bad news cycles that keep people home. He can't have a massive Covid spike that scares voters away. If you're going to pick a position, would you rather be counting on people planning to vote, or do you want a lead that's already banked?"" There is cause for concern for both sides with just over a week left, however. Who will be the next US president? You decide Where Trump and Biden stand on policy Why we might not get a result on election night Did Trump stop more people coming to US? Full coverage of the US election Democratic turnout in Miami, particularly among Hispanics, is lower than expected. For Republicans, the margins in the retirement communities in the centre of the state - which traditionally tilt conservative - are approaching uncomfortable territory. And if anecdotal and polling evidence of elderly Republicans voting for Biden because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic are true, it could be disaster for Trump. ""That's something he wouldn't be able to survive in Florida or, for that matter, in the upper Midwest swing states [Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio] with large elderly populations,"" Smith says. Unless something unexpected happens or the race is decided by a razor-thin margin, it won't take long for Democrats and Republicans to receive Florida's verdict on election night. The early vote tabulations will be announced as soon as the state's in-person polling places close, leaving only the day's results to be accounted for. This video can not be played Can the polls be believed this time? If the Democrats maintain their early lead, it will be a question of whether there are enough Republican votes left to be counted. If the Democrats have underperformed, then it's just matter of waiting for Trump to eventually catch up. While it may be a long night in other states, Florida tradition of breaking hearts and prompting celebrations on election night is likely to continue in 2020.

The other US election that's hugely important,"Ready to run... astronaut Mark Kelly, football coach Tommy Tuberville and trucker hat-wearing Kelly Loeffler ""An astronaut, a pastor and an American football coach walk into the US Senate"" sounds like the beginning of a joke, but that is what could happen when winners of the 2020 general election take their seats in Congress. While attention has been hyper-focused on the battle for the White House between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, an equally important fight is underway for control of Congress on 3 November. The Democrats already have control of the House of Representatives, so they are looking to keep hold of it, while also gaining a majority in the Senate. Republicans hold a thin three-seat advantage in that chamber, and there are 35 senators up for re-election - a good many of whom are vulnerable. A Democratic-controlled House and Senate would have the power to obstruct the plans of a second-term President Trump, or push through the agenda of a first-term President Biden. These five races, which underline the key battle lines in US politics, are some of the seats most at risk of flipping. Charismatic astronaut threatens Trump's Senate agenda This contest could have an immediate effect on the last three months of the current Trump presidency. This is because the contest between DemocratMark Kellyand RepublicanMartha McSallyis a ""special race"" to fill a seat occupied by the late senator John McCain, who died in 2018. Unlike with other races, should Mr Kelly win, the former astronaut could be seated in the US Senate as early as November 30, rather than in January. Kelly and McSally debate in Phoenix With a current 53 seats in the Senate, President Trump has a solid Republican majority but it's not invulnerable - at least three moderates in his party have been willing to break rank with his agenda before. Should Mr Kelly arrive in the Senate next month, Mr Trump's hopes to rush through favoured policies before his first term is up could well vanish. Former air force pilot Ms McSally, 54, was given the seat by appointment from the Republican governor. She already lost a Senate race in Arizona in 2018 and polls suggest it will be an uphill climb for her to avoid a second defeat now. Mr Kelly also has a poignant personal story - his wife, the ex-Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, was shot at a public event with constituents and suffered serious brain injuries. The couple have been among the most visible advocates for gun control since the 2011 incident. Powerful Trump ally at risk Republican bigwigLindsey Graham, a former Trump critic who has turned into one of his most vocal supporters, is facing a strong challenge fromJaime Harrison, a former lobbyist and chairman of the state Democratic Party. Polls put the two men on even footing going into October, though the Republican has since made up some ground. Still, according to analysts, South Carolinians are unhappy with Mr Graham's transformation from an outspoken small-government, hawkish foreign policy-focused conservative, to a full-throated backer of Trumpism. No one expected this race to be so close The race was once considered Mr Graham's for the taking, but the senator has found himself vulnerable after his opponent raised a record $57m (Â£44m) in campaign funds in a single quarter. Mr Graham, 65, managed only half the amount. Should the now-powerful chairman of the judiciary committee lose to Mr Harrison, 44, it would not only be a massive political upset, but also mark the first time the southern state would be represented by two black senators. The slow death of moderate America Voters in Maine look set to punish one of the few moderate Republican senators still in office,Susan Collins, in a race that underscores just how tricky it is to be a centrist in the age of Trump. Ms Collins, 67, used to be one of the most popular senators serving in the chamber, but now trails her Democratic rivalSara Gideon. The difficulty for Ms Collins lies in being a Republican who represents a centre-right constituency in a state where Mr Trump is deeply unpopular. Susan Collins is fighting for her political life against Sara Gideon She was widely criticised for backing the president's controversial 2018 Supreme Court pick, Brett Kavanaugh, despite allegations of sexual misconduct from the 1980s. Since then, she has not been able to shake off accusations of secret fealty to Mr Trump. Several groups that used to back her including Planned Parenthood, Human Rights Campaign and the League of Conservation Voters, are now supporting her rival Ms Gideon, 48. Will demographics finally favour the Democrats? Democrats have not won Georgia since 1992 but more liberal-leaning, young people are moving to the state, and Hillary Clinton did very well in the Atlanta suburbs four years ago. Now two of the state's Senate seats are up for grabs. A regular general election pits incumbent RepublicanDavid Perdue, a former executive of the Dollar General discount chain store, againstJon Ossoff, a young former journalist. Two Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Rev Raphael Warnock Mr Ossoff, 33, lost a special election in 2017 for the House - but now has his sights on a higher, state-wide office and is neck-and-neck with Mr Perdue, 70. The party has a rare second chance to capture a seat in Georgia (normally only one Senate seat is up at a time) owing to a special election. Though a charismatic Democratic candidate leads the race -Raphael Warnock, a pastor at the historically black Ebenezer Baptist Church - it is far from a predictable one. The incumbent senatorKelly Loeffler, who was appointed, is in trouble over her handling of the coronavirus. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the sitting senators Ms Loeffler, 49, is accused of using insider government knowledge about the virus for financial gain, and now faces challenges not only from Democrats, but also from her own party. With the Republican vote split, a run-off election is expected in January, as no candidate has 50% of the vote. Where the future of Trumpism is alive and well This election in Alabama represents a rare bright spot for the Republican party to flip a Democrat-held seat. Doug Jones, the incumbent Democrat, triumphed in a special election in 2017 after the Republican candidate became embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal. The victory was an anomaly and now, the deeply conservative state is likely to vote him out, as they view the Democratic Party with scepticism. Tommy Tuberville is heavily favoured to unseat Senator Doug Jones Mr Jones trails 10 percentage points behind RepublicanTommy Tuberville, a former university American football coach backed by President Trump. The race demonstrates that whatever the outcome of the presidential contest, there are parts of America where Trumpism will continue to resonate. Why can it be so hard to vote in Georgia?

The selectively edited clip shows Biden saying: ""Why am I doing this? Why? What is my real aim?â as if he has suddenly forgotten what has motivated him to run for president. What ""@TrumpWarRoom"" neglected to mention is that Biden was quoting Pope Francis' questions that he says all leaders should ask themselves when they seek office. A Biden spokesman accused the Trump campaign of âattacking Joe Bidenâs faith"". (If elected, Biden would be only the second Catholic president in US history after John F Kennedy). For those who missed the full speech, Biden's quote was followed by these words: ""Pope Francis asked the questions that anyone who seeks to lead this great nation should be able to answer. And my answer is this: I run to unite this nation. And to heal this nation."" Both candidates in the US presidential election have vowed to be tough on China - but disentangling the worldâs two biggest economies is very complicated.

Lynn Beyak, listed her home address as Dryden, New York, rather than Dryden, Ontario, (where she actually resides) when she donated $300 (Â£230) to Trump in May. The former real estate agent also listed her occupation as ""retired"" despite being a sitting senator. It is illegal under US election law for non-Americans to give money to any political campaign. Foreign nationals are, however, allowed to volunteer for campaigns. A spokesperson for Beyak told Vice that the ""donation was made in error and is being returned in its entirety, simply because it was erroneous"". But the news outlet reports that the donation has not yet been returned by the Republican National Committee. President Trump has made no secret of his desire to win over women (especially suburban women) this election. He is 15 points behind Biden in support from female voters, according to the latest Economist/YouGov poll and 23 points back by the New York Times' count. Campaigning in Michigan earlier today, he had a surprising pitch to get their vote. This video can not be played President Trump: 'We're getting your husbands back to work' With just seven days to go until the election, Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump in the national polls. The latest data puts Biden about 10 points ahead of Trump. While national polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, itâs important to remember that the election could come down to results in just a few key states. At the moment, polls in the battleground states also look good for Biden. They suggest he has big leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - three states his Republican rival won by margins of less than 1% to clinch victory in 2016. You can read more about the latest polls here A judge in Michigan has blocked a ban on the open display of guns near polling locations on election day. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson issued a directive earlier this month banning people from openly carrying guns within 100 feet of polling sites. The ban was announced days afterthe FBI said it had thwarted a plot to abduct and overthrow Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer,and amid concerns over voter intimidation and violence. Gun-rights groups argued that Benson, a Democrat, had overstepped her authority and had failed to observe the formal rule-making process required by law to pass the ban. Judge Christopher Murray sided with them on Tuesday. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has vowed to appeal against the ruling.

""We're calling them out and we're calling out the radical left,"" he says. ""Go out and vote. We will not have a socialist nation, or even worse. It could be worse than a socialist nation, and you know what that means,"" he continues. ""Vote early and in person. Don't let them take your vote away. The most important election we've ever had."" Our correspondent is traveling with the president as he campaigns in the Midwest Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter A cold rain mixed with ice fell as Trump spoke in Lansing, Michigan If Donald Trump loses the White House next week, it wonât be for a lack of effort on the campaign trail down the stretch. He has kicked off a three-day, multi-state swing across the country with a stop in Lansing, Michigan. Despite a temperature hovering just above freezing as light rain mixed with ice pelted the airfield, a crowd of several thousand waited for hours to see the president. âIâm working my ass off,â Trump told the cheering throngs of people. The president went on to speak for more than an hour, mixing in his normal stump-speech attacks on Joe Biden with some more focused riffs on immigration and trade in the automotive industry-dominated state. Michigan was perhaps the biggest surprise of the 2016 election, as Trump narrowly carried it over Hillary Clinton despite polls before the election showing him behind, sometimes by large margins. The polls arenât encouraging for the president this time around either, but another Michigan surprise would go a long way toward unlocking a path for the president to re-election. Biden was speaking to a drive-in rally in Atlanta Biden is speaking at his second Georgia event of the day. ""Hello, Atlanta,"" he says, as he comes to the stage to music by local rap group Outkast. ""My name is Joe Biden, and I'm Kamala Harris' running mate,"" he says as cars beep their horn in approval at this drive-in rally. He thanked the audience for ""helping to create the change that you know is possible"" and thanked rapper Common who introduced him. ""Folks, I think we're gonna surprise the living devil out of everybody this year,"" he said. ""I can't tell you how important it is that we flip the United States Senate,"" he continued, calling for the normally Republican southern state to send two Democrats to Washington next year ""to fight for your interest, not for Donald Trump's interests"". Acknowledging that we're now in the final stretch before election day, he tells Atlanta: ""Folks, it's go time."" Roosevelt frequently visited Warm Springs Joe Biden is due to appear in Atlanta, Georgia for his second campaign stop of the day in the state, but earlier, he drew on the memory of former US President Franklin D Roosevelt as he campaigned in Warm Springs. FDR, the Democrat who led the US during the Great Depression and through World War Two, retreated to the town to seek treatment for polio. Biden spoke of the significance of the small town (population 400). ""This place represented a way forward,"" he said. ""A way of restoration, of resilience, of healing"". It ""is a reminder that though broken, each of us can be healedâ¦ That as a people and a country, we can overcome a devastating virus. That we can heal a suffering world. That, yes, we can restore our soul and save our country.â Biden also quoted a speech FDR drafted before his death. âTo live together and work together. Thatâs how I see America. Thatâs how I see the presidency, and thatâs how I see the future,â he said. Georgia has not backed a Democrat in a presidential election since 1992. But polls suggest a close race this year and Biden says he has a ""fighting chance"". Socially distanced supporters in Warm Springs, GA British pop star Harry Styles might not be eligible to vote in the upcoming election but that hasnât stopped him from endorsing Democrat Joe Biden. Taking to Twitter, the former One Direction singer wrote: âIf I could vote in America, Iâd vote with kindness."" The post was accompanied by a video from Bidenâs campaign.

Millions more Americans have voted or are still expected to vote by post because of coronavirus, meaning a delay in counting all the ballots is likely. It was previously common for states to restrict voting by post to certain people - such as the elderly, ill, or those away from home. But the practice is now widely permitted in a majority of states. An estimated 80 million postal ballots,externalwill be cast this time round - more than double the number in 2016. Postal votes also take longer to count once they have arrived and different states have different rules over how and when they count them. Find out more about when we're likely to get a result - and if it could be contested - here. Donald Trump has begun a busy day of campaigning with a rally in the battleground state of Michigan. Most polls show Democrat Joe Biden leading in the state, which Trump took narrowly in 2016. But Trump told thousands of supporters gathered for the rally that he had momentum behind him as the election nears. âSeven days from now weâre going to win the great state of Michigan,â he said. ""A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream,"" he later said. It would be hard to argue with Trump's assessment of supporters' enthusiasm.

"Biden hits new battleground, Trump blitzes MidwestJoe Biden blasts Donald Trump as a conman, while the president promises ""economic survival"".","This video can not be played Trump: ""We're getting your husbands back to work"" Democratic White House challenger Joe Biden blasted President Donald Trump as a conman during a campaign foray into traditionally Republican territory. In Georgia, Mr Biden said that Mr Trump's handling of coronavirus amounted to a ""capitulation"". Mr Trump kept blitzing the swing states that he won in 2016, warning in Michigan that its ""economic survival"" was on the line if Mr Biden won. According to opinion polls, Mr Trump lags behind with a week to go. But the race is tighter in critical battleground states such as Arizona, Florida and North Carolina. More than 69 million people have already voted early by post or in person in a record-breaking surge driven mainly by the coronavirus pandemic. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? A really simple guide to the US election The other US election that's hugely important This video can not be played Can we believe the polls this time? On Tuesday, Mr Trump held rallies in Nebraska and two states he snatched from Democrats in 2016: Michigan and Wisconsin. In Lansing, Michigan's capital, he warned: ""This election is a matter of economic survival for Michigan."" And he told suburban women, a demographic that many opinion polls suggest he is struggling to win over: ""Your husbands, they want to get back to work, right? We're getting your husbands back to work."" Before leaving the White House, the president renewed his criticism of postal ballots - more than 46 million of which have been cast so far. The huge volume of mail-in votes, which could take days or weeks to tally, means a winner is not certain to be known on election night next week. ""It would be very, very proper and very nice if a winner were declared on November 3, instead of counting ballots for two weeks, which is totally inappropriate,"" Mr Trump told reporters before heading to the Midwest. Why we might have to wait for the US election results Mr Trump - who only this month was admitted to hospital with coronavirus - is planning a head-spinning 11 rallies in the final two days of the election campaign before voting day next Tuesday. Meanwhile, First Lady Melania Trump joined the campaign fray solo for the first time on Tuesday, assailing Mr Biden as a ""socialist"". This video can not be played Melania Trump: ""Media created picture of my husband I don't recognise"" In the critical election state of Pennsylvania, Mrs Trump cast doubt on Mr Biden's claims that he could do a better job as president. ""Well, the American people can look at Joe Biden's 36 years in Congress and eight years in the vice-presidency and determine whether they think he'll finally be able to get something done for the American people."" If Donald Trump loses the White House next week, it won't be for a lack of effort on the campaign trail down the stretch. On Tuesday, he kicked off a three-day, multi-state swing across the country with a stop in Lansing, Michigan. Despite a temperature hovering just above freezing as light rain mixed with ice pelted the airfield, a crowd of several thousand waited for hours to see the president. ""I'm working my ass off,"" Mr Trump told the cheering throngs of people, who at one point responded with chants of ""We love you"". The president went on to speak for more than an hour, mixing in his normal stump-speech attacks on his opponent, Joe Biden, with some more focused riffs on immigration and trade in the car-industry-dominated state. He once again attacked the state's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, for aggressive attempts to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, to which the crowd responded with the now-familiar ""lock her up"" chant. Michigan was perhaps the biggest surprise of the 2016 election, as Mr Trump narrowly carried it over Hillary Clinton despite opinion polls before the election showing him behind by sometimes large margins. The polls aren't encouraging for the president this time around either, although after the rally the campaign gave printouts to the press suggesting that Republicans have a slight advantage in returned ballots in the state so far. Another Michigan surprise would go a long way toward unlocking a path for the president to re-election. In a trip to Warm Springs, Georgia, on Tuesday, Mr Biden vowed to be ""a president who doesn't divide us, but unites us"" and someone who could ""heal this nation"". Georgia has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1992, but opinion polls suggest the Democrat is statistically tied with Mr Trump in the southern state. This video can not be played Biden speaks in Warm Springs, Georgia Even as he presented himself as a president for all Americans regardless of party, Mr Biden targeted his rival. ""Time and again throughout our history, we have seen the charlatans, the conmen, the phony populists - who have sought to play to our fears, appeal to our worst appetites, and pick at the oldest scabs we have for their own political gain. ""They appear when the nation has been hit the hardest and we're at our most vulnerable. Never to solve anything. Always to benefit themselves."" This video can not be played BBC Reality Check breaks down the bill for the world's most expensive election Mr Biden kept hammering away at his opponent's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 225,000 Americans. He said Mr Trump had ""shrugged. He's swaggered. And he's surrendered."" In a sign of the Biden campaign's confidence that it can expand the electoral map, he will travel later this week to Iowa, a state that Mr Trump won by 10 points four years ago. Mr Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, will head to Arizona and Texas, where no Democrat has been elected to statewide office since 1994. No doubt mindful that 2016 Democratic White House nominee Hillary Clinton also tried to make in-roads in Republican states, only to lose critical Democratic strongholds, Mr Biden is also scheduled to visit Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida in the coming days.

Michigan was perhaps the biggest surprise of the 2016 election, as Trump narrowly carried it over Hillary Clinton despite polls before the election showing him behind, sometimes by large margins. The polls arenât encouraging for the president this time around either, but another Michigan surprise would go a long way toward unlocking a path for the president to re-election. Biden was speaking to a drive-in rally in Atlanta Biden is speaking at his second Georgia event of the day. ""Hello, Atlanta,"" he says, as he comes to the stage to music by local rap group Outkast. ""My name is Joe Biden, and I'm Kamala Harris' running mate,"" he says as cars beep their horn in approval at this drive-in rally. He thanked the audience for ""helping to create the change that you know is possible"" and thanked rapper Common who introduced him. ""Folks, I think we're gonna surprise the living devil out of everybody this year,"" he said. ""I can't tell you how important it is that we flip the United States Senate,"" he continued, calling for the normally Republican southern state to send two Democrats to Washington next year ""to fight for your interest, not for Donald Trump's interests"". Acknowledging that we're now in the final stretch before election day, he tells Atlanta: ""Folks, it's go time."" Roosevelt frequently visited Warm Springs Joe Biden is due to appear in Atlanta, Georgia for his second campaign stop of the day in the state, but earlier, he drew on the memory of former US President Franklin D Roosevelt as he campaigned in Warm Springs. FDR, the Democrat who led the US during the Great Depression and through World War Two, retreated to the town to seek treatment for polio. Biden spoke of the significance of the small town (population 400). ""This place represented a way forward,"" he said. ""A way of restoration, of resilience, of healing"". It ""is a reminder that though broken, each of us can be healedâ¦ That as a people and a country, we can overcome a devastating virus. That we can heal a suffering world. That, yes, we can restore our soul and save our country.â Biden also quoted a speech FDR drafted before his death. âTo live together and work together. Thatâs how I see America. Thatâs how I see the presidency, and thatâs how I see the future,â he said. Georgia has not backed a Democrat in a presidential election since 1992. But polls suggest a close race this year and Biden says he has a ""fighting chance"". Socially distanced supporters in Warm Springs, GA British pop star Harry Styles might not be eligible to vote in the upcoming election but that hasnât stopped him from endorsing Democrat Joe Biden. Taking to Twitter, the former One Direction singer wrote: âIf I could vote in America, Iâd vote with kindness."" The post was accompanied by a video from Bidenâs campaign.

Millions more Americans have voted or are still expected to vote by post because of coronavirus, meaning a delay in counting all the ballots is likely. It was previously common for states to restrict voting by post to certain people - such as the elderly, ill, or those away from home. But the practice is now widely permitted in a majority of states. An estimated 80 million postal ballots,externalwill be cast this time round - more than double the number in 2016. Postal votes also take longer to count once they have arrived and different states have different rules over how and when they count them. Find out more about when we're likely to get a result - and if it could be contested - here. Donald Trump has begun a busy day of campaigning with a rally in the battleground state of Michigan. Most polls show Democrat Joe Biden leading in the state, which Trump took narrowly in 2016. But Trump told thousands of supporters gathered for the rally that he had momentum behind him as the election nears. âSeven days from now weâre going to win the great state of Michigan,â he said. ""A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream,"" he later said. It would be hard to argue with Trump's assessment of supporters' enthusiasm.

Kushner told Fox News on Monday that Trump ""canât want them to be successful more than they want to be successful"", referring to African Americans. That posture is a problem, America's first black president said. ""Who are these folks? What history books do they read? Who do they talk to?"" Obama asked.
