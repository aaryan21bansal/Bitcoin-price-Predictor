Has this model got what it takes to crack Paris?," It’s a Monday morning at the end of February and the Louvre-Rivoli metro station in Paris looks rather unusual. Every minute you see a tall, slim girl with a heavy bag and a black folder under her arm getting off a train. In a dark, damp basement, just a few minutes’ walk from the station, a casting for Paris Fashion Week is taking place. Dozens of models, shivering in the cold, are queuing in front of the heavy closed door. Despite the freezing weather they are all dressed in tight black jeans and tight-fitting T-shirts – it’s the mandatory dress code for a casting. They have to be perfect. The perfect body, perfect skin, perfect walk They are waiting for a short casting - if successful, it can lead to a show. Seventeen-year-old Anna Vasilieva from the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod is one of them. For her, like the others, fashion week begins with hours spent in casting queues.Casting director Michelle Mode needs 30 girls for her show. Within an hour she sees dozens of girls but seems to be unhappy with the result. “They have to be perfect. The perfect body, perfect skin, perfect walk,” she says. From the casting room comes the word: “Next”. Anna rushes in, but in the blink of an eye is back out again. The casting she’s waited for for so long has only lasted 10 seconds. The teenager quickly swaps her high-heels for winter boots and heads back out. Today Anna has nine more casting calls to make.I tentatively ask Michelle what was wrong with Anna. “You want me to tell you?” she asks. “Her body is not perfect. Her legs are not perfect. I need girls from 178cm (5.8ft), so she is a little bit small.” Anna arrived in Paris with a packet of buckwheat and a determination to get a modelling job. Her dream is to walk the catwalk for her favourite brand, Yves Saint Laurent. She remembers well the day she was discovered by an agency. “A scout from Nizhny Novgorod wrote to me on a Russian social media network called Vkontakte,” she tells me inside a Parisian brasserie over a cup of coffee and a Caesar salad. “She said she liked my pictures and that I could be a model. She invited me and my mum for an interview.” After an audition Anna was soon sent to South Korea on her first modelling assignment. She was just 14. “My parents were worried but the agency’s director and my personal agent there Ravida talked to them,” remembers Anna. “They said it was safe and that the agency bookers take care of their girls. The youngest was just 12.” Teachers think I am travelling on holiday but they can’t imagine what it takes to do 10 castings a day. At night all you can do is just collapse on your bed Anna’s family is what can be described as middle-class. When I meet her, she is in her final year at a local school in Nizhny Novgorod - a city about 250 miles (402km) east of Moscow. She admits that her modelling jobs – which can last for two months – can, at times, put her under pressure. “The teachers are always pressuring me saying that I am missing a lot and I won’t pass my exams,” she says. “Many of them say: ‘Why are you are taking so much time off?’They think I am travelling on holiday but they can’t imagine what it takes to do 10 castings a day. At night all you can do is just collapse on your bed.” For many Russian teenagers, the ideal scenario would be to get a free place at one of the local universities. But the number of government-financed places is limited, so most of the students will have to pay for their education. An academic year costs around $900 (approximately £700). With an average monthly income of $500 (£400), combined with the lack of a student loan scheme, many families have to start saving from the time their children start school. But for ambitious teenagers like Anna, who is already well-travelled, Nizhny can feel small. Inspired by social media and Instagram in particular, young people in Nizhny are increasingly interested in creative jobs and some of them told me that the Soviet teaching style at local universities is too old-fashioned for them. Moscow, just four hours away by train, has far better universities but the competition for places is extremely tough. Anna says she is likely to enrol at the local university but dreams of studying design at Parsons School of Design in New York in the future. Thanks to her modelling career, she believes this dream has more chance of becoming reality. She proudly says she can afford to pay for her shopping and food (and occasionally send her parents flowers while she is abroad). Like hundreds of other models in Paris, Anna is fully dependent on her agency. The agency pays for her flights, her accommodation, and gives her a weekly allowance, or what is called “pocket money”. Most importantly, it finds the jobs. But if the model doesn't live up to expectations, it's the agency that will send her home. All the costs, including printing portfolio pictures and catwalk lessons, are deducted from the models’ net earnings. The agency I visit in Paris feels like a stock exchange. In a bright spacious room, 10 people sit around a long table endlessly making phone calls and loudly shouting at each other. Girls who don’t speak the language look panic-stricken when they catch their name amidst a long stream of French. The office is covered wall-to-wall with photographs of models. Every photo has the label ""IN"" under it – meaning ""in town"". Each model knows that if she isn’t successful at castings ""IN"" will be replaced with “OUT” under her photograph. Sometimes they don’t get castings and they come to me for help. If they’ve spent all their money they come to me. The young girls are really just children. I get really worried about them Anna is here for her weekly measurement check and to receive her pocket money. Every Monday the agency’s manager Tatyana measures the chest, waist and hips of each girl. Being the “right” size is an entry point to the fashion world. “The most important are the hips. They should be between 86cm and 88cm,” explains 19-year-old Ukrainian-born Tatyana. “If the hips are bigger than 90cm, the girl won’t get work.” Despite working with new models all year round Tatyana still gets emotional about the girls. “I am almost the same age as them but I feel like their mum. I need to ensure they are working,” she explains. “Sometimes they don’t get castings and they come to me for help. If they’ve spent all their money they come to me. The young girls are really just children. I get really worried about them.” Every week Anna receives an allowance of $90 (£70). This is meant to pay for transport, food and mobile phone bills for a week. According to Anna’s accounts, a third of her allowance goes on her weekly metro card, leaving her with as little as $5 (£4) for food a day. When I started modelling about 10 years ago, the agency was giving us the same amount. How is it possible to live on this money today? “It’s quite hard,” says Anna. “You should eat in the apartment to save money and buy food on the street so it’s cheaper.” Yet for most of the models, the only way to avoid being hungry in Paris is to bring their own food with them. Anna is no exception. Half of her suitcase was filled with groceries, including buckwheat, tea and instant noodles. Anna takes me to her apartment, which she shares with six other aspiring models. The apartment has a few lights and basic furniture. The “house rules” are attached to the entrance door. There are a few spacious bedrooms, which girls share between two, but there is only one bathroom. Every morning this becomes a little problem, especially when everyone has castings starting at the same time. After a long casting day the girls gather in a small kitchen over a bowl of pasta. After noticing my surprised expression one of them looks guilty and says that they only “eat this type of food once a month”. It’s an industry that says yes or no. And if you cry on your first casting you are not cut out for it They talk about how the day went and wonder about a new model who was supposed to have arrived. “The girls come and go so fast so we sometimes don’t even know who else lives here,” says Australian model Owey, who came to Paris after Milan Fashion Week. “One of the girls is like a ghost in the house.  She comes in and leaves whenever and no-one even knows her.” I wonder what makes Paris so special that so many models fly in. “There is a game-changing opportunity here,” says 26-year-old Bayana from Kazakhstan. “Imagine you come for the Yohji Yamamoto casting, he likes you, books you for the show, then gives you a campaign job and you become more well-known.” However, the girls agree that with so much competition there is not much prospect of that happening. With many of the models being just 16, I wonder how they cope with the constant rejection at castings. “It’s a cut-throat industry,” says Owey. “It’s an industry that says yes or no. And if you cry on your first casting you are not cut out for it.” Every year the founders of the Silent modelling agency, Vincent Peter and Eric Dubois, bring dozens of new faces to the Parisian market in the hope that one of the girls will make it big. With so much competition during fashion week, I ask the agency founders what makes a certain model stand out and get the job. Eric argues that personality is the key to their success. There is no-one more insecure than the designer. They don’t know if the dress is right or wrong until 10,000 women buy it in the shop “This is also about attitude. The way you take a cigarette, the way you smoke, take a glass. You are so sure of yourself that people around you feel it,” says Eric, who’s been in the industry for a few decades. “There is no-one more insecure than the designer,” he continues. “They don’t know if the dress is right or wrong until women buy it in the shop. The designer has to feel the energy in the model, find something that resonates with his collection, so then she has better chances to get the show.” Watching the models passing by the agency, I wonder if this is still the look the industry wants in the age of diversity. “The job of the models is to make clothes look nice,” explains Vincent Peter. “If the girl is tall and slim off course this will make the coat look even more beautiful.” Can plus-size models be as successful on a catwalk? “If you look at the Olympics, you don’t see plus-size models jumping,” he says. “You see athletes who are long and slim. Same in fashion. In order to wear a coat the nicest way possible you have to be tall and slim.” Paris doesn't feel much like a city of love in February. The cold wind goes right through you and your hands hurt from the cold. The weather doesn’t affect Anna’s determination. Following directions on her phone she heads to the next casting. It’s not easy to find an address in the maze of winding streets. Finally Anna knocks on the right door. The casting room is warm and full of life. There is a crowd of make-up artists surrounding a model who is trying to hold it together. They don’t tell you if they like you or if they don’t like you. You can just read it in their faces She has only just been chosen from hundreds of potentials to act as a blank canvas for the make-up artists to test catwalk looks on. There aren’t many girls in this casting. It gives Anna more confidence. She walks towards the designer with a smile.“If he asks me to change my clothes, I will have some time to warm up,"" she says. But the designer simply looks Anna up and down and says: ""Thank you. Bye."" “They don’t tell you if they like you or if they don’t like you,” Anna says. “You can just read it in their faces.” I have a quick chat with another model who has just arrived. Sarah,18, from Holland looks lost. She has done five castings with no success and has 10 more to do. I ask her how she feels about the rejection. “It’s so hard,” she responds. “Because you don’t know what is wrong and what you can improve. It sucks.” “When you come to Paris you are sure that everyone will like you,” says Anna. “But then you come to the first, second, ninth casting and no-one notices you. Your self-esteem drops, you start doubting yourself.” She slowly begins to realise that this season she is unlikely to book any shows. None of Anna’s flatmates is booked for shows either. The kitchen, where the girls used to gather in the evenings, is now empty. The girls sit quietly in their rooms. In a cold, dark corridor I meet 17-year-old Alisa from Russia. With a touch of disappointment on her face she tells me that success during fashion week has nothing to do with the model herself. “The casting-director has to wake up in a good mood, get a delicious cup of coffee and see a girl at the right moment,” she says. “It’s a shame when your efforts are not appreciated, but this is life, this is modelling.” After two weeks in Paris, Anna’s debt to her agency has reached more than 2000 euros (£1,800). With no casting success during fashion week, she was sent to work in a designer brand showroom. “You come, try on clothes, appear in front of the clients, they look at you, sometimes they can touch you,” Anna says of her new job. “You are sort of working between the tables - it's not something I like.” Fifteen people, including models and staff, are put together in a tiny room waiting for the fashion buyers to come. You come, try on clothes, appear in front of the clients, they look at you, sometimes they can touch you Once the clients arrive, Anna’s job is to stay still in an outfit and smile. Turn and move upon request. In one day Anna can have up to a few hundred outfit changes. “The most difficult thing is the hours,” she says. “Working in a showroom takes up to 10 hours a day. Standing for so long is quite tiring. “But when I have a free minute I can read my book,” she adds. A model’s success during fashion week is measured by the number of shows she is booked for. For the agencies it’s the amount of money they can make from these shows. Anna’s manager Roman is not happy with the result. “I did my calculations yesterday. We made approximately 100,000 euros. Could be more,” he says. For models like Anna, the girl arrives, she works, then the agency gets back everything it advanced for her. So the agency is always the winner Will Anna make any money during this trip? Roman doubts it. “For models like Anna, the girl arrives, she works, then the agency gets back everything it advanced for her. So the agency is always a winner,” he says. “Probably she won’t make any money, but she is not alone.” Comp cards are cards with the model’s photo, agency and measurements on “It’s not a question of agency or model, it’s just the market system,” he shrugs. The last time I meet Anna she is late finishing work and I wait for her outside the showroom for a couple of hours. To my surprise, Anna is fully aware that she might leave Paris empty-handed. And even more surprisingly she is OK with it. In a few days Anna will head back to Nizhny for her end-of-year exams. Despite getting no shows this time in Paris, she still plans to try again next year. She does have some work lined up - once her exams are over she is heading East. “I work quite a lot in China. I have a good agency there,” explains Anna, who has worked there four times already. Due to the country's vast production of clothes, the need for models in recent years has rapidly increased. Local designers admire the Eastern European look, so it comes as no surprise that models like Anna can get work much more easily there than in Europe. In China most of the girls work for catalogues, shooting anything between 20 to 200 outfits a day. At times it may feel tedious and repetitive, but, unlike in Paris, it actually pays. “I already have many regular clients there. Sometimes I don’t even need to go for castings,” Anna says. “To me going to China feels almost like home.” Author: Alina Isachenka (BBC Russian Service) Project coordinator and editor: Emma Wells Design: Denis Korolev Illustrations: Natallia Trayan Images: Getty, Anna Vasilieva’s archive, Direct Scouting.

Harry Redknapp wins I'm a Celebrity,"This video can not be played The moment Harry Redknapp found out he had won Almost 11 million viewers tuned in live to see Harry Redknapp crowned King of the Jungle on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, overnight ratings show. The ex-Tottenham and West Ham manager beat fellow finalists Emily Atack and John Barrowman on the ITV reality show. He was a popular winner and the programme itself has been a hit this year, with an average of 10.8 million watching Sunday's final live. Those are the highest ratings the show's final has had for five years. Another 170,000 watched on ITV+1. Last year, an average of 9.2 million watched live to see Georgia ""Toff"" Toffolo crowned. Redknapp became the show's oldest ever winner at 71 and said it was ""so surreal"" to emerge victorious. ""My grandkids will be jumping around the living room now. They'll be so excited,"" he said after being crowned. He said he didn't think he would survive so long in the show, and praised his campmates for being ""amazing"" and pulling him through. While he has a ""very happy home life"", he added that football can be a ""lonely business"" and the show had ""taught me how to laugh again"". But he admitted he had struggled with the meagre rations - and unusual foods - and that he thought the contestants would get well-fed with a ""nice bit of grub"" every night. Host Holly Willoughby said more than 11 million votes were cast in this year's final. ""Harry was the favourite all the way though,"" TV critic Emma Bullimore told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""With all of his little idiosyncrasies and little catchphrases, he was absolutely brilliant entertainment value and a very worthy winner. ""There was no game plan, there was no pretence, he was just himself. He came across as such a genuinely nice man."" Atack said the experience had changed her life Atack came second and said she was ""honoured"" to be in the final two with Redknapp. She said she had met ""so many amazing souls"" on the show, and discovered a new-found love and respect for herself. The Inbetweeners star said: ""It's changed my life in so many ways. I came into this with a bit of a difficult start to the year. ""I didn't really know what I was doing and where I wanted to go and this place has just given me so me so much self-acceptance."" Willoughby made the actress promise to never cover up her freckles again, after Atack said: ""This is my skin, this is my hair - this is what I look like."" Barrowman came in third place, and said I'm a Celebrity had been one of the best experiences of his life. The actor and singer appeared emotional as he told Willoughby and Donnelly: ""I can't tell you how happy I am."" This year's contestants have been put through a series of Bushtucker trials involving snakes, cockroaches and other creatures. They've also had to negotiate assault courses blindfolded, bake cakes while plastered in treacle and climb through ""sickening sewers"" in order to win food and other necessities. The trio had to each carry out a final trial in order to win treats for their last supper together, after 23 days in the jungle. Barrowman had to eat a range of gruesome items like worms, a dead spider, goats' eyes and a bull's penis. Atack had to wear a helmet filled with insects while Redknapp's trial saw him trapped in an underground chamber while rats and bugs ran over him in the pitch black. The former football manager was the bookies' favourite to win this year's series, despite having never watched the show before. After leaving the show and being shown his highlights, he said: ""Great show, innit?"" Many viewers agreed. Lots thought it was one of the best series in the show's 16-year history, and Redknapp was one of the most popular winners. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Murder tariffs 10 years lower in NI,"The average minimum tariff for murder in Northern Ireland in 2017 was 11 years and four months The average minimum term handed out by Northern Ireland courts in murder life sentences was almost 10 years lower than in England and Wales last year. Figures obtained by BBC News NI show that the average minimum tariff for murder in Northern Ireland in 2017 was 11 years and four months. That compared to 21 years and one month in England and Wales. The Northern Ireland figure represented a drop of three years on the figure for 2016. People convicted of murder are given life sentences, however courts stipulate a tariff period which will be the minimum amount of time the prisoner must serve before they are considered for release by parole commissioners. In 2013, the Northern Ireland average was 15 years, although it also dropped to 11-and-a-half years in 2014. The lowest figure in England and Wales in the five-year period between 2013 and 2017 was 20 years and 10 months. The 2017 Northern Ireland murder tariff was also much lower than the average sentence for attempted murder, which was just over 20 years in NI last year. A spokesperson for the Lord Chief Justice's office said tariffs depended on ""specific factual circumstances in each case"" and that the number of murder cases in Northern Ireland was significantly smaller than in England and Wales. ""That explains why there is so much variation in average tariffs year on year in this jurisdiction,"" said the spokesperson. Maghaberry Prison in County Antrim houses long-term sentenced prisoners ""There are many examples of tariffs of 15 years or more being imposed in this jurisdiction where premeditated murders are carried out with weapons by persons of bad character. ""Murder is one of the offences where the director of public prosecutions can refer the sentence to the Court of Appeal if he considers it to be unduly lenient."" Victim Support NI said crime - and particularly murder - not only affects the victim, but their family, friends and wider community. ""Some victims tell us that they do not feel the sentence fully reflects the impact the crime has had on their lives, and this leads to a sense that justice has not been done,"" a spokesperson said. ""Sentencing in NI follows very strict guidelines and is a matter for the judiciary and the courts. We do not comment on individual sentences. ""However, sentencing is currently under review and will soon open to public consultation. The average minimum tariff for murder is much higher in England and Wales ""Victim Support NI has contributed to this review process in order to strongly represent the experience victims have. ""We would encourage all victims and witnesses to respond to the public consultation when it opens, to ensure that their voices are heard."" A spokesperson for the Department of Justice said: ""The setting of tariffs for life sentence prisoners in Northern Ireland is a matter for the independent judiciary."" The average sentence for manslaughter in Northern Ireland was also significantly lower than in England and Wales last year. It was five years and eight months in Northern Ireland compared to eight years and four months in England and Wales. However, the average term given out to rapists in Northern Ireland was higher than in England Wales. The 2017 figure for Northern Ireland was just over 15 years, compared to nine years and 10 months in England and Wales. The Northern Ireland figure rose by more than five years from the previous year, when it stood at nine years and eight months. Other average sentences in Northern Ireland in 2017 were: Kidnapping: Five years and six months Burglary: One year and nine months Robbery: Five years and eight months Assault: Five and a half months Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Japan princess 'insecure' over new role,"Princess Masako, pictured with Prince Naruhito and their pet dog, said: ""I will strive to do my very best"" Japan's Crown Princess Masako says she feels ""insecure"" about becoming empress in April, but will do her best to serve the people of Japan. Masako Owada will become empress when her husband, Crown Prince Naruhito, succeeds his father Emperor Akihito. Emperor Akihito, 84, is abdicating next year because of his age and health. The princess, who has suffered from a stress-related disorder for many years, says she is slowly recovering and will try to perform more royal duties. Princess Masako was educated at Harvard and Oxford, and had a promising career as a diplomat before her marriage in 1993, the BBC's Asia analyst Michael Bristow reports. However, she has struggled to cope with royal life and Japan's notoriously conservative imperial household, our correspondent adds. 'I will protect you my entire life' The princess, the palace and the shrinking royal line Ten things about Japan's emperor The princess made the comments in a statement marking her 55th birthday. ""Giving thought to the days ahead, I sometimes feel insecure about the extent to which I will be able to be of service to people,"" she said. ""But I will strive to do my best so that I can contribute to their happiness."" She said that she was ""filled with deep emotions"" and felt ""nostalgic"" that this was the last year before Emperor Akihito abdicated. Princess Masako's doctors say she suffers from ""adjustment disorder"", a condition caused by stress, that is often linked to depression or anxiety. In Sunday's statement, she said that her health was improving slowly, adding: ""I am happy as I can now perform more official duties than before, little by little."" Her doctors emphasised, in a separate statement, that it was important that the princess be allowed to continue her treatment and not be subjected to too much pressure. The princess ""is still on the recovery track and there are ups and downs to her condition"", they said. The couple married in 1993 Crown Prince Naruhito reportedly met Masako Owada at a tea party for a Spanish princess in 1986. Ms Owada, who is fluent in several languages, had just passed exams that qualified her to work as a top-ranked diplomat. She was reportedly concerned about marrying into the royal family, but agreed to marry Prince Naruhito in 1993. She later told reporters that she had accepted his proposal after he said: ""You might have fears and worries about joining the imperial household. But I will protect you for my entire life."" The couple came under pressure to produce a male heir despite having a daughter, Princess Aiko, in 2001. In 2004, the prince told journalists his wife had ""completely exhausted herself"" trying to adapt to palace life, and accused palace officials of ""moves to negate"" her character and career. The princess stayed largely out of the public eye for the next decade, although she has attended more and more functions in recent years.

No new Doctor Who series until 2020,"The next series of Doctor Who won't start until 2020, it's been confirmed. Series 11 ended on Sunday night, but after the festive special on New Year's Day, Jodie Whittaker won't be seen in the Tardis again next year. Showrunner Chris Chibnall said work on the new series had already begun. He said the team had been ""blown away by the response from audiences"" to the new Doctor. The first episode of the series, the first to feature a female Doctor, drew a record audience. The Doctor has been joined by three new companions for the current series It saw the highest launch viewing figuresfor the sci-fi stalwart in a decade, with 10.9 million people tuning in. The series has been considered a ratings success, with viewing figures above those of the last two series when Peter Capaldi starred in the title role. On Sunday evening, the Doctor was seen answering distress calls from a battle-scarred planet. Talking about the next series Chibnall, head writer of the show, said: ""We're off again! Well we never actually stopped. ""As Jodie Whittaker's Doctor and friends have been winning the hearts of families across the nation this autumn, we've been busy with a whole new set of action-packed adventures for the 13th Doctor."" Whittaker is to return for a New Year's Day special He said they couldn't wait to bring ""more scares, more monsters and more Bradley Walsh, Mandip Gill and Tosin Cole"" - referring to the Doctor's companions. Lizo Mzimba, the BBC's entertainment correspondent, said while there was ""a recognition that fans might want a series every single year, Doctor Who has almost uniquely complex filming requirements and a lengthy post-production period"". He added that the New Year's Day episode could have been planned so that 2019 ""won't be a totally Doctor Who-free year"".

NHS told to ditch 'absurd' fax machines,"The NHS will be banned from buying fax machines from next month - and has been told by the government to phase out the machines entirely by 31 March 2020. In July, the Royal College of Surgeons revealed nearly 9,000 fax machines were in use across the NHS in England. The Department of Health said a change to more modern communication methods was needed to improve patient safety and cyber security. An RCS spokesman said they supported the government's decision. In place of fax machines, the Department of Health said secure email should be used. NHS still reliant on 'archaic' fax machines Oxford University Hospitals Trust scraps fax machines Why is hi-tech Japan using cassette tapes and faxes? Richard Kerr, who is the chair of the RCS's commission on the future of surgery, said the continued use of the outdated technology by the NHS was ""absurd"". He added it was ""crucial"" that the health service invested in ""better ways of communicating the vast amount of patient information that is going to be generated"" in the future. The group's report from earlier this year found the use of fax machines was most common at the Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Trust, which still relied on 603 machines. Three-quarters of the trusts in England replied to the survey - 95 in total. Ten trusts said that they did not own any fax machines, but four in ten reported more than 100 in use. Rebecca McIntyre from Manchester, who works as a cognitive behavioural therapist, said fax machines are ""a continued risk to the confidentiality and safeguarding of patients"". ""You would not believe the palaver we have in the work place trying to communicate important documents to services (referrals etc),"" she said. ""We constantly receive faxes meant for other places in error but this is never reported."" Meanwhile, Taz, from Doncaster, works in a pharmacy and said discharge notes, emergency documents and out-of-hours services ""all are stuck in the dark ages"". ""I hope this is just the start of many changes,"" he said. ""The amount of time wasted and potential errors that exist from not using technology is shocking and often it's the patients that suffer. ""My next hope is that hand written prescriptions are scrapped completely and we use tablets to send them electronically for patients like most GPs have been doing for years."" Malicious fax leaves firms open to attack Why the fax machine isn't quite dead yet However, Tim Owen. from Bolton, who works in blood services, asked: ""So what happens when a computer virus attacks a hospital's IT infrastructure, as happened recently? ""During theWannaCry attack of 2017our 'out-dated, redundant' piece of equipment ensured that blood products, not routinely held in our on-site blood bank, could be ordered without delay and therefore not compromising patient safety."" One GP in the Midlands said they currently rely on a fax machine for requesting x-rays at local hospitals because of an ongoing IT problem which has not been fixed. Meanwhile, outside of the NHS, Nina Mowbray, from Northampton, works for one of the top 10 accountancy firms where she said they still fax documents to HM Revenue and Customs. ""We could email but we need to have this set up first which means we have to get formal approval from a director/partner which we don't do,"" she said. ""It does seem very outdated."" And Joseph Vincent, from Macclesfield, said he still uses his fax machine to communicate with his brother, who lives in a remote part of Scotland. ""The internet is slow there and sometimes we send funny messages to each other using a fax machine. The sound it makes is really satisfying although it is a bit of a running gag between us."" The first ""facsimile"" machinewas invented in 1842by Scotsman Alexander Bain Bain's invention worked by scanning a message written with special ink on a metallic surface. This picked up the electrical impression of the original and a telegraph circuit could be used to transmit it By the beginning of the 20th Century, fax machines were being used commercially by organisations such as newspapers After technological improvements by Japanese companies, fax machines became widespread in the 1970s and 1980s The technology reached its peak around the end of the 20th Century, and was then gradually replaced by more modern methods of communication NHS still reliant on 'archaic' fax machines NHS trust scraps faxing of patient data Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

O2 'to seek millions' over data outage,"Mobile operator O2 is understood to be seeking millions in damages from supplier Ericsson after last week's day-long data network collapse. The total bill could be up to Â£100m,according to The Telegraph.,external O2 smartphone users were unable to use their mobile phone data last Thursday. Ericsson blamed expired software certification for the problem. Both firms have apologised for the issue and O2 has already set out howit plans to compensate customers. Customers with a monthly subscription will be refunded the cost of two days' service by the end of January. Pay As You Go customers will get 10% extra when they top up their phone in the new year or 10% off when they buy data for mobile broadband devices. O2 compensation for customers over outage O2 data network restored after outage 'We're reliant on data and phone networks' O2 said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some customers said they could not make calls or send texts either. The mobile phone operator is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT. It is the company that bills customers, so it holds the responsibility for compensation. O2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Tesco, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users. Services such as bus timetable information were also affected by last week's outage, while many businesses also faced disruption. Telefonica's UK chief executive Mark Evans told the BBC last week it planned a ""full audit"" of the problem. ""What we will now do is a full audit, a thorough audit, across both organisations to ensure whatever steps can be taken will be taken to provide the continuous service that our customers expect and deserve."" Ericsson said last week that ""an initial root cause analysis"" had indicated that the ""main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers"". ""The faulty software that has caused these issues is being decommissioned,"" Marielle Lindgren, chief executive of Ericsson UK & Ireland, said at the time.

From stammering to performing sermons,"This video can not be played Stammer to sermon: A priest's struggle with words ""As a boy, I couldn't say the word chemist. That's when my difficult journey with words began."" Father Patrick Lagan would struggle to say certain words out loud and his stammer got progressively worse as he grew up. ""I told myself I had a problem with my vocal chords,"" the priest, who is usually based at St Eugene's Cathedral in Londonderry, told BBC News NI. ""I just couldn't get certain words out. It leaves you incredibly frustrated."" 'It's so frustrating trying to speak' 'Rap makes my stutter disappear' How do you overcome a stammer? He said he stopped answering the telephone at home. ""That was dangerous. You start to avoid things and that's not good for your confidence. ""People would have stared at me the odd time. I never got seriously bullied though."" Fr Lagan says he needs to do breathing exercises before big events He later joined the McGuire Programme, which offers a method of controlling stuttering, and it changed his life ""completely"". So much so, he was able to finish a reading at his leavers' mass from St Patrick's College in Maghera. ""It was a reading from the prophet Jeremiah,"" he said. ""That was a big turning point for me because I finished the piece. ""I realised for the first time that I could really do this. It was a big confirmation for me. It transformed my life."" The McGuire Programme has courses around the world. It explains to people why they have a stutter, the physiological aspect of it and how to breathe and pause in the right places. Fr Lagan said: ""I learned how to accept who I was and then I started going to the classes to learn how the breathe and take my time with words. ""You need a lot of patience and self determination but slowly but surely you get there. It's important to talk to people, read different books and seek guidance."" ""He's fantastic,"" said Carmel Moore, from Rosemount in Derry. ""He has overcome a lot. I think it's a great message he is sending out to young people."" Peter Houston, from the Waterside, said he was ""really good to talk to"" and the stammer ""did not hold him back at all"". ""He has too many good attributes to let that hold him back in life,"" he said. ""He's a good example to young people and anybody really."" Fr Lagan said he knew he wanted to become a priest at a young age. ""The Catholic Church was always very supportive. Certain clergymen were a great help along the way and told me to take things slowly. ""There are still days where I think I could do better. I go back and practise. Sometimes I rehearse before I do weddings or funerals in the cathedral. ""It's amazing to think I've come this far."" Northern Ireland's five health trusts have told BBC News NI that about 600 adults and children are being treated for a stammer. However, many people also seek independent care through programmes and charities. ""I would advise children who have a stammer not to be afraid,"" said Fr Lagan. ""Those who are going through a difficult time should seek the right help. It's not a hopeless situation. ""Carry on, persevere and don't let anyone get you down."" Former shadow chancellor Ed Balls has spoken candidly about his struggle with a stammer Stammering - sometimes referred to as stuttering - commonly occurs in early childhood when speech and language skills are developing rapidly It can also occur in older children and adults after an injury, illness or trauma It is not possible to say for sure why a particular child starts stammering but it is not caused by anything the parents have done Stammering is more common in boys than girls It is important to get referred to a specialist as soon as possible Famous people who have had a stammer include King George VI, former politician Ed Balls and singer Gareth Gates 'Rap makes my stutter disappear' Video, 00:03:59'Rap makes my stutter disappear' 'It's so frustrating trying to speak' Video, 00:01:33'It's so frustrating trying to speak' 'I use my stutter to give kids hope' Man beats stammer to be speech therapist How do you overcome a stammer?

The world-famous game that's never topped the charts,"Fortnite is more than a game - it's a global phenomenon. Not many titles in recent years have merited their own clothing range or kept England footballers glued to their screens after training. The popularity of the survival game, with its tense Battle Royale format, has grown and grown over time. It now has 200 million registered players worldwide - last January it had 40 million players. But despite being a global hit, Fortnite has never topped the UK charts. That's simply because the game itself is free - players can then spend money on purchases within the game, most of which are downloaded digitally. And the industry is still using physical units sold rather than revenue to measure a game's success. Watchdog: Parental controls on in-game purchases Five things we've learnt about Fortnite Fortnite being blamed for divorce While the launch of a new season of the game has become a regular event, the idea of having lots of updates and downloadable content - meaning the experience of the game is ever-evolving - is not unique to Fortnite. In fact, the days where the game that came in the box is the same one you're playing weeks, months or even years later are long gone. Instead, they are increasingly seen as a service rather than a product. While Fortnite is perhaps the most successful example of it to date, other major releases like Call of Duty and Fifa are following the same script. In the UK in 2017, gamers spent Â£2.67bn on digital, mobile and online products including in-game purchases. In comparison, they spent Â£790m on box software - physical games used in consoles. It is this second category on which the charts are based. Epic Games, the company that owns Fortnite, is tight-lipped about how much it makes from the game. Bloomberg has estimated that the whole company, with all its products, is worth between Â£3.9-6.2bn ($5-8bn). The industry faces challenges when it comes to regulation, too, as the laws and guidelines have to keep up with the fast-evolving world of gaming. The Gambling Commission has raised concerns that in some instances the worlds of online gaming and gambling could become blurred. It has highlighted ""unlicensed third-party websites offering illegal gambling linked to popular video games,"" where players can stake a bet on things like the value of their virtual weapons inventory. Astudy conducted by gambling psychology researchers,externalat the University of Adelaide in Australia found online gaming's system of ""microtransactions"" closes the gap between gaming and gambling, and may pose a risk for vulnerable players. In September, the World Health Organization added a definition of gaming disorder to its latest edition of the International Classification of Diseases. On top of this, some parents have been caught out by their children unwittingly making large purchases on their credit cards. A Fortnite spokesperson pointed out that most consoles do have the option to set a spending limit (which can include zero) as well as age restrictions. And anyone concerned about interactions with other players can switch off the chat function in-game, as well as on the console itself. As well as the regulators, the wider gaming industry itself has had to evolve to keep up with the latest innovations. While it has traditionally been dominated by major titles that are developed by hundreds of people, cost millions to make and at least Â£50 to buy, games like Fortnite have lower up-front costs and are free. By keeping players engaged with in-game purchasing and frequent updates, they can make a company a lot of money. Meanwhile, the latest estimates from theDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport,externalsuggest that jobs across the wider computer games sector more than doubled between 2011 and 2017, from 13,000 to 30,000. In Fortnite's seventh season, which is released on Thursday, players can expect more costume additions, map changes and plenty of snow. These might seem like small adjustments but, by adding more content, tweaking the game map and updating what players can see and experience, developers are trying to give audiences a reason to keep coming back.

'I have impostor syndrome too',"Michelle Obama's remarks aboutimpostor syndrome- a term used to describe feelings of insecurity or self-doubt, despite there being no evidence to support such a belief -  have inspired others to share their experiences. When Sophie Montagne applied to be a part of theIce Maiden expedition in Antarctica,external, she didn't think she would make the cut. She applied whilst working in marketing, and saw a poster about the trip at an army reserve unit where she attends part-time. ""The group of applicants was gradually whittled down from 250 applicants to the final six, in a process that lasted two years. ""During this time I was so crippled by impostor syndrome that I nearly took myself out of the running for the team - I was just somebody that sat at a desk doing marketing. Why did I think I could be part of a record breaking team in the coldest place on earth?! ""It affected how I behaved, my sense of self and, most importantly, my confidence. ""Everyone else seemed to be more of an athlete and was in the army full-time. ""When the team was announced it was vindication that someone has seen me as being valuable. It gave me a spine of confidence. ""As part of the selection I spoke to a psychologist who helped me to identify why I felt like a fraud - I could finally put a name to it. ""I nowspeak about my experiences,externalin Antarctica and about impostor syndrome specifically to companies and schools. I had never done public speaking before. ""I help them try to find ways to encourage young girls into sport and am very open about my imposter syndrome and how I dealt with it."" Psychotherapist Rachel Buchan describes impostor syndrome as ""an internal belief that you are not good enough or don't belong"". She says the feeling is most commonly found in the workplace but can also manifest itself in other areas of life like social situations. It can affect people of all backgrounds, she says, and emerges for a variety of reasons including someone's upbringing, background and specific circumstances at the time. Consultant Noel Ferguson says he has impostor syndrome but instead of trying to overcoming it, he has used it to his advantage. Growing up in ""a working class background in Belfast, during the Troubles,"" and looking after his elderly parents who were ill during a time when he himself became ill with cancer, he underperformed academically and that led him to feel he wasn't good enough. ""I have tried to take my impostor syndrome and use it for a directed purpose,"" says Noel who later did Open University courses in Leadership and Management. ""I was always aware I had it but I didn't know what it was. ""Many see it as a burden but I have used it to my benefit. I am thankful I have impostor syndrome because a way of dealing with it is to always strive to be better. ""There's nothing wrong for men to admit they have it."" Noel started the Institute for One World Leadership and encourages people to be better leaders. ""When I give talks to students I like to share personal experiences. Lots of people have imposter syndrome and think they are the only ones. ""For people with impostor syndrome, you will always be searching for ways to improve your performance, extend your abilities, and be better at what you do."" Kate Atkin is a professional speaker and delivers workshops on impostor syndrome, which she is researching for her PhD. As the only woman on her managerial team in her previous career at Barclays she experienced impostor syndrome herself and shares tips for overcoming it: Talk about it: If you share how you are feeling with others you will soon realise you are not alone. Recognise your successes:Don't put them down to just luck or hard work - without your skills and ability you would not have achieved what you did. But remember nobody is perfect:Accept failure is likely to happen at some point and learn from it rather than seeing it as a reflection of yourself. Stop comparing yourself to others:Try comparing yourself to what you were like last year instead to see how you have progressed. Doreen Anselm-Etienne from Cambridgeshire told the BBC that when she was the only black manager in a team in the NHS she had a ""constant feeling"" of not belonging. ""My role involved working closely with mainly doctors and consultants, the majority of whom were white middle-class males. ""For about five to six years I had the constant feeling that I didn't belong, that I had got the job by default, I wasn't smart enough, I wasn't good enough, my grasp of the English language was inadequate, as I had a Caribbean accent. ""The HR consultant once told me to just keep telling myself every day: 'I'm the manager, I'm the manager'. ""I don't know if I overcame it but having the support of some of my colleagues and my successes helped. ""But it was a constant urge to keep doing better, keep working harder. It wasn't so much about being the best but an attempt to keep up with people I wrongly perceived to be better, smarter, or more intelligent than I am."" ""Feeling like an impostor hasn't really left me - I've just developed a thicker skin, and age has brought with it a level of confidence.""

The athletes starving themselves for success,"Anna Boniface ignored the warning signs of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport Anna Boniface seemed to have the world at her feet when finishing as the 2017 London Marathon's fastest amateur female runner. Her performance earned her an England team place in that autumn's Toronto Marathon. The then 25-year-old finished the London race in two hours, 37 minutes and travelled to Canada six months later. But 10 miles into her international debut, Anna's ankle fractured. ""It was the breakthrough that broke me,"" she tells BBC 5 live Investigates. ""It was horrible, I'd never not finished a race in my life. I thought I could just struggle to the end somehow, but I realised I would not be able to go on, I just had to sit on the kerb and wait."" But worse was to come for the Reading runner. In addition to the stress fracture of her ankle, tests found poor bone density, including osteoporosis in her spine, which made fractures a real risk. These symptoms were all hallmarks of a condition called Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (Red-S). This occurs when sports people restrict their diet in the belief that constant weight loss will keep improving performance, to such an extent that some of the body's functions begin to shut down. Anna Boniface crosses the line at the London Marathon The condition can cause a range of health problems in men and women including a drop in hormone levels, a deterioration in bone density, a drop in metabolic rate and mental health problems. Anna, who works as a physiotherapist, admits she was aware of the condition but was so desperate to keep improving that she ignored the warning signs, which included not having a period for eight years. ""It was a lot to do with my training volume and not eating enough - not being wide enough in my food groups, being restrictive with carbohydrates,"" she says. ""I was training twice a day, I was running 100-plus miles a week at times, and you burn up a lot of energy with that, and from a runner's perspective you get it into your mind that you need to be this race weight. ""You get caught up in this cycle of running really fast, wanting to lose a little more weight, push that race weight a little bit more, running faster, and then just breaking, which is what happened."" The performance chef who keeps athletes on their toes Lewis Hamilton: Could a vegan diet hamper his 'racing edge'? Serena Williams: How did she compete while pregnant? The state of Anna's health was discovered before any more serious damage could be done and, after a year's rest, she has been able to slowly return to running. Red-S can affect male and female athletes and became a recognised condition in 2014 - replacing another condition called female athlete triad, which recognised the effect of too few calories among sportswomen only. There have been few studies into the prevalence of the condition but it is understood to be most common in sports such as athletics, cycling and dancing, where being light could make a significant difference to performance. On Sunday, the #Trainbrave campaign is being launched to raise awareness of the risks of Red-S, particularly among promising amateur sportspeople who may be trying to improve their performance without giving enough thought to their diet. Sam Woodfield took up cycling in 2016 It was the same drive for performance perfection which led cyclist Sam Woodfield, 28, from Northamptonshire, to lose up to one-third of his body weight in a year, after taking up the sport in 2016. Having previously been a bodybuilder and a natural sportsman, losing some weight helped him to rapidly progress to a competitive level in the sport and he began to take it seriously. But his drive for better performance spiralled to the point that he was frequently enduring gruelling training rides without eating. For Sam the equation was simple: ""Lighter meant faster which meant I stood more chance of winning."" For a time it worked but his victories came at a huge cost. By 2017 Sam had so little energy he could barely walk upstairs, he could not sleep and his mental health was suffering. He accepted he needed help and had a series of tests which revealed the true cost of his pursuit of performance. ""I was told I had very low visceral fat around my body which is essential fat you need to keep you alive,"" he says. ""I was also told that, as well as having no testosterone, I had the bone density of an 80-year-old in my spine and my hips. It was a very scary point in my life."" Dr Nicky Keay, a sport and dance endocrinologist, says Red-S occurs when the athlete's body does not have enough energy to sustain it and begins to shut down. She says: ""The body partitions the energy you get from your diet. You need an amount to cover training, then the remaining energy is what you need for day-to-day life. ""If you're not getting enough spare energy you go into survival mode. Oestrogen levels drop in women and testosterone for men which is key for bone health. ""It's like when your phone's battery drops to a low level, it switches off lots of non-essential apps, this is what the body is doing."" Five live Investigates asked British Athletics what it was doing to raise awareness of the risks among athletes. In response, it said it works with a number of partner organisations, including the English Institute of Sport, to ensure awareness and treatment of the conditions that are part of the Red-S. 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 9 December at 11:00 GMT -catch up on BBC Sounds.

Brexit marches ahead of vote,"The UKIP-organised ""Brexit Betrayal"" march started after midday Thousands of people have taken to the streets in London to march in a UKIP-organised rally and a counter-protest march. A UKIP spokesman said ""quite a few thousand"" supporters turned up to their ""Brexit Betrayal"" march alongside controversial activist Tommy Robinson. Marching in opposition were anti-fascist groups and Labour-backed campaigners. A spokeswoman said 15,000 turned up to oppose Mr Robinson's rally. Laura Parker of Labour grassroots group Momentum claimed their counter-demonstration ""vastly"" outnumbered UKIP's ""nearly five to one"". She said: ""Even with the UKIP machine in tow, he [Robinson] only managed to bring a few thousand supporters out on the streets while we mobilised nearly 15,000 to march against his racism and bigotry."" Police have not provided an estimate of crowd sizes. By Richard Galpin Despite fears there could be clashes between the pro and anti-Brexiteers today, the marches which streamed through the streets of central London passed off peacefully. Thousands of people took part on both sides of the divide, making their feelings known ahead of the key vote in parliament due to take place on Tuesday. Those marching under the UKIP banner called for Theresa May's Brexit deal to be dumped. One demonstrator carried an effigy of the prime minister describing her as a traitor, while another held a model scaffold and hangman's noose. Later in a rally close to parliament and Downing Street, the UKIP leader Gerrard Batten said it had been an achievement to get the far-right activist Tommy Robinson involved in the demonstration. Mr Robinson who denies claims he is a racist and fascist, joined the front of the march saying it was ""a beautiful day."" Scotland Yard imposed restrictions,externalon both marches and urged people to protest peacefully. A simple guide to Brexit Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Former leader Nigel Farage quits UKIP Counter-demonstrators marched to Parliament with placards and signs Mr Robinson and his supporters gathered outside the Houses of Parliament where they were addressed by UKIP leader Gerard Batten. The former English Defence League leader was recently appointed as an adviser to Mr Batten, prompting a number of people to resign from the party,including former leader Nigel Farage, Mr Batten told the crowd: ""If Parliament does not take Britain out of the European Union it will be the biggest constitutional crisis since the English Civil War. ""In 1642 the king put himself in opposition to parliament. Parliament won and the king lost his head."" UKIP leader Gerard Batten carried a banner with supporters Weyman Bennett, of Stand Up To Racism and one of the counter-protest organisers, said: ""I believe that the majority of people in this country reject fascism and racism. ""There's deep concern in Britain about the growth of the far right in this country, under the guise of Tommy Robinson and UKIP."" He added: ""We are excited about the amount of women organisers, Muslim groups and trade unions that have come out. UKIP had earlier predicted its ""Brexit Betrayal"" march would be ""the largest pro-Brexit event of the year"", with party leaderGerard Batten telling supporters,externalit was the ""only pro-Brexit rally to be held before the vote next week"". Unite Against Fascism and grassroots group Momentum march against Tommy Robinson Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, had urged people to join the rally against Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. Scotland Yard said it had imposed conditions - which include the marches sticking to planned routes and limits on the time they could take place. Mr Robinson and his supporters met outside the Dorchester hotel on Park Lane before marching along a pre-determined route to Westminster. Police barriers separated them from the counter-protesters, who had gathered outside the BBC's Portland Place headquarters prior to marching to Whitehall.

Deal 'huge step into unknown',"Theresa May's Brexit deal has been dealt a fresh blow after being given a highly critical verdict from MPs. The Commons Committee on Exiting the European Union said it doesn't give enough clarity or certainty about the future, describing it as a ""huge step into the unknown"". The cross-party report comes days before the Commons is due to vote on the proposed deal on Tuesday. Meanwhile Labour said the prime minister's plan is ""dead in the water"". A simple guide to Brexit How would the backstop work? PM's options narrow The committee described the draftpolitical declarationon the future relationship between the EU and the UK as ""neither detailed nor substantive"". Its report said that meant there was still ""significant uncertainty"" about the terms of trade after the transition period elapses at the end of December 2020 - and that ""the extent of our access to EU markets will depend on the degree to which we adhere to its rules"". ""After 20 months of negotiations, we only know the terms of the UK's departure but not the nature of the future relationship with the EU,"" the committee said. ""The prime minister's deal fails to offer sufficient clarity or certainty about the future."" Please upgrade your browser The MPs said the government had failed to set out objectives that are ""realistic, workable and have parliamentary support"". They said this meant negotiations with the EU on the future relationship with the UK would be more complicated and could take ""significantly"" longer. On the issue of the Irish border, the report said there were no ""realistic, long-term proposals"" on how to keep it open while leaving the single market and customs union. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland, in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. It would keep the UK under EU customs rules in order to prevent a hard border. But the report says this would ""result in immediate barriers to UK-EU trade in goods and services"". It also said a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU would not be a viable option as it would ""not ensure the type of friction-free trade with the EU that many UK companies with just-in-time supply chains need."" Hilary Benn said the government had ""refused to face up to hard choices"" Hilary Benn, chair of the committee, said the government had ""refused to face up to the hard choices confronting us"". ""The political declaration falls far short of the 'detailed and substantive' document promised by former secretaries of state and by the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier,"" he said. ""It does not give the British people or our businesses the clarity and the certainty they need about our future trading relationship with the EU in five or 10 years' time."" He said he hoped the report would help other MPs when making their decision ahead of the vote next week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell saidLabour's alternative Brexit plancould prevent a political vacuum engulfing Westminster if Mrs May's deal is defeated. He said his party's proposals could ""give a level of certainty"" for the next stage of the Brexit negotiations. What's in the Brexit political declaration?

Crucial MPs' Brexit vote 'will go ahead',"Theresa May has attended a church service near her Maidenhead constituency The Commons vote on Tuesday will not be delayed, the Brexit Secretary has said, amid growing calls for the PM to go back to Brussels to renegotiate. Stephen Barclay also said Theresa May could stay in post if, as expected, MPs reject her Brexit plan. The PMhas warned Tory rebels,externalit could lead to a general election, and there was a ""very real risk of no Brexit"". Boris Johnson said the PM could stay on if she lost but must renegotiate the deal with Brussels. The withdrawal deal negotiated between the UK and EU has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by Parliament. Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Brexit deal 'huge step into the unknown' Brexit: A really simple guide But the government is widely expected to lose the vote with Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the DUP, the SNP and dozens of Conservative MPs saying they cannot support the deal. European Council President Donald Tusktweeted on Sunday,externalit would be ""an important week for the fate of Brexit"", after a phone call with Theresa May. This video can not be played Stephen Barclay said MPs shouldn't ""let the perfect be the enemy of the good"" Despitenewspaper speculation it could be called off,external, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said: ""The vote is going ahead and that's because it's a good deal and it's the only deal"". He warned against suggesting negotiations could be reopened: ""The French, the Spanish and others will turn round, if we seek to reopen the negotiation, and ask for more."" Alternative ways to break Brexit impasse The backstop explained And he insisted that Theresa May could remain prime minister, even if her deal is heavily defeated by MPs: ""Yes, the prime minister is fighting for us and will continue in post."" Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit strategy, told the BBC he did not want a ""no-deal"" Brexit or another referendum, but it was not right to say there were no other alternatives. He said theNorthern Ireland ""backstop""- effectively an insurance policy to prevent a hard border if no free trade deal is struck in time - put the UK in a ""diabolical negotiating position"". MPs could give Mrs May ""a powerful mandate to change that backstop"" by voting it down on Tuesday, he said. The border issue should instead be covered in negotiations over a future trading relationship with Europe, he said, and the UK should ""incentivise"" the EU by withholding ""at least half"" of the UK's agreed Â£39bn ""divorce"" payment, until a free trade is signed at the end of 2020. This video can not be played Boris Johnson said it was a ""relatively simple job"" to change the withdrawal agreement He dismissed suggestions he had already offered other Tory MPs jobs if they backed a future leadership bid by him as ""nonsense"" and said the public wanted to see a plan ""to get out of this mess"" rather than ""stuff about leadership elections and personalities"" - although he did not rule out challenging Mrs May for the leadership. And the former foreign secretary, a key figure in the 2016 campaign to leave the EU, said: ""Don't underestimate the deep sense of personal responsibility I feel for Brexit and what's happened. ""It breaks my heart to think that after all we fought for... that we should consign ourselves to a future in which the EU effectively rules us in many respects and yet we have no say around the table in Brussels."" By BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley Some Conservatives are urging Theresa May to defer Tuesday's vote, fearing a humiliating defeat which would destabilise the government. They hope more clarity or compromise on the backstop issue can be provided - and some wavering Tories won over. But others point out that no acceptable compromise has been found so far - and question whether one will be found now. They also point out that Brussels has shown little enthusiasm for revisiting the backstop. Indeed there are some who believe only a strong rejection of Theresa May's deal will encourage the EU to rethink. The Brexit Secretary said the vote would go ahead. With some still seeking to persuade the prime minister, it cannot be completely certain the vote will go ahead until Monday. If the deal is rejected, it is unclear what happens next.Mrs May told the Mail on Sunday,externalit would mean ""grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal"". Protesters calling for another referendum to decide the issue were joined by politicians from across the political spectrum at a rally on Sunday, including Tory peer Lord Heseltine, Green MP Caroline Lucas, and Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan. Actor Charles Dance was among those at the rally Conservative former minister Philip Lee told the rally in east London: ""I think a People's Vote is the best hope that we have of reuniting our country after this sorry episode."" Ms Lucas said the message to Mrs May was: ""We don't want your vision of a mean-minded little Britain, with our borders closed and our horizons narrowed."" And Dr Allin-Khan said: ""The promises made in 2016 are so far removed from the reality of the 585-page Withdrawal Agreement that it's time to take the Brexit decision back to the people."" She was careful to say that the vote should only take place if there was not a general election - it is Labour Party policy to call for an election and, only if that does not happen, to keep ""all options"" open, including a referendum. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn told ITV News that he would ""have a discussion"" with Rosena Allin-Khan, who is a shadow minister, about her appearance at the rally: ""She's entitled to her point of view. I would rather she and every other Labour MP spent today and tomorrow and Tuesday concentrating solely on making sure we defeat this deal."" And former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said there was ""a very large chunk of people who would feel utterly betrayed"" if another referendum was called. AUKIP-organised ""Brexit Betrayal"" march also took placein London, amid controversy over leader Gerard Batten's decision to appoint controversial activist Tommy Robinson as an adviser. On Saturday, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd suggested a so-called ""Norway Plus"" option - which would see the UK remaining in the European Economic Area and joining a customs union with the EU - could be another possibility, if the deal was rejected. But Mr Barclay told the BBC: ""I don't think it honours the referendum result"" - saying it would not give the UK control over immigration. Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet over the deal, also said Mrs May should ""immediately"" renegotiate with Brussels, if MPs reject her deal. Asked if she would consider a leadership bid, she told Sky News it was not about ""personalities"" and she would back the PM if she renegotiated the deal. This video can not be played The BBC's Leila Nathoo on how the Commons vote will play out But she did not rule it out, saying she'd give it ""serious consideration"" if she were asked to stand. Justice Minister Rory Stewart told the BBC that the government ""should come back again"" to Parliament if it loses Tuesday's vote, potentially with some ""small adjustment"" to the deal but suggested some MPs were using the backstop ""as an excuse"" to reject it. Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey would not confirm that Labour would immediately put down a motion of no confidence in the prime minister. She said: ""We will have to see what happens on Tuesday... we will have to make an assessment at the time and we will be in discussions with other political parties across the House to assess the best thing to do."" She added that the PM should call a general election, having lost a key proposal, but added ""alternatively she could offer to renegotiate around a deal that would provide consensus in Parliament"".

Novichok victim 'terrified' about health,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons A man who was exposed to the nerve agent Novichok says he is ""terrified he will be dead within a decade"". Charlie Rowley, 45, was exposed to the same poison used to attack ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March. Mr Rowley told theSunday Mirror,externalhe was ""struggling to see and to walk"". Mr Rowley and his partner Dawn Sturgess fell ill in Amesbury on 30 June, months after the Skripal incident. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. Britain has accused Russia of carrying out the poisoning of the Skripals, who were found seriously ill on a bench on 4 March. The pair survived. Charlie Rowley was exposed to the same poison used to attack Sergei Skripal and daughter Yulia Russia has also been blamed for the death of Ms Sturgess and the poisoning of Mr Rowley, who are believed to have come into contact with a bottle of Novichok discarded by the Skripals' attackers. Mr Rowley told the newspaper: ""I may be out of hospital but I don't feel safe. I'm terrified about the future. Doctors simply don't know what the long-term effects could be. ""The worst thing has been the fear over my sight. I'm struggling to see properly and to walk."" Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far 'We lost everything because of Novichok' Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? He said he was ""one of only a handful in the world to have survived Novichok, so it's untrod territory"". ""I feel like a guinea pig. I don't know what's going to happen from one day to the next."" Dawn Sturgess died after finding a bottle containing the Novichok Mr Rowley added he ""dreaded getting a cold"" and was ""worried the Novichok could kill me if I get any sort of virus again"". He told the Sunday Mirror he felt ""suicidal"" and claimed to have had ""no support"". ""The system is flawed. I need counselling. If the authorities offered me help I would take it. I feel let down. ""I don't think I'll be alive in 10 years. It has been horrendous,"" he said. Police have said they do not believe Mr Rowley or Ms Sturgess were deliberately targeted, but were affected due to the ""recklessness"" with which the nerve agent was disposed of.

France protests 'an economic catastrophe',"About 50 vehicles were set on fire during the protests The ""yellow vest"" protests have been ""a catastrophe"" for the French economy, the finance minister says. France has seen four consecutive weekends of demonstrations against fuel tax rises, high living costs and other issues. About 125,000 protesters took to the streets on Saturday, with more than 1,200 taken into custody. President Emmanuel Macron is expected to announce anti-crisis measures in an address to the nation on Monday. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called the situation ""a crisis"" for both society and democracy. ""It's a catastrophe for business, it's a catastrophe for our economy,"" he said during a visit to shops in Paris that had been damaged during the protests. The capital was particularly badly hit, with windows smashed, cars burned, and shops looted, as 10,000 people took part in demonstrations. In pictures: France's latest protests Why the 'yellow vests' won't stop protests French students 'humiliated by police' ""There was much more damage yesterday than a week ago"" because Saturday's protests were more dispersed, deputy mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told local radio. However, he added that there had been fewer injuries compared with last week.

""I say this to Donald Trump and the French president says it too: leave our nation be,"" Mr Le Drian said. President Emmanuel Macron - who many protesters want to stand down - will address the nation at 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Monday. He is expected to meet trade union and business leaders in the morning, according to union sources. Mr Macron has kept a low profile so far during the protests. It is too early to calculate the full economic cost - but it's clear the damage is severe. Le Parisien newspaper reported that in the capital about 50 vehicles had been burnt and dozens of businesses vandalised, with some of them looted. The authorities in the city say that riots have caused millions of pounds of damage. On Friday, the French retail federation told Reuters news agency that retailers had lost about â¬1bn ($1.1bn; Â£900m) since the protests first began on 17 November. Mr Le Maire said last week, before the most recent protests, thatthe restaurant trade had declined by between 20% and 50%,external. And Francois Asselin, head of the confederation of small and medium-sized businesses, told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper (in French) thatoverall the protests could cost his members â¬10bn,external. There are concerns that the protests could lead to a drop in tourism.Paris was visited by a record number of tourists in 2017 - more than 40 million,,externalthe Paris Tourism Office said last month. The movement began as a protest against a rise in duties on diesel, which is widely used by French motorists and has long been less heavily taxed than other types of fuel. Diesel prices have risen by about 23% over the past 12 months - and Mr Macron's decision to impose a tax increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol from 1 January enraged protesters. Mr Macron had blamed world oil prices for three-quarters of the price rise, but said higher taxes on fossil fuels were needed to fund renewable energy investments. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Will the environment be the true victim of France's riots? Who supports the protesters? The rallies became known as the ""yellow vest"" or ""gilets jaunes"" movement because protesters took to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow jackets that are required to be carried in every vehicle by French law. The government has since agreed to scrap the fuel tax increase and has frozen electricity and gas prices for 2019. But protests have also erupted over other issues, including calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements. The movement's core aim, to highlight the economic frustration and political distrust of poorer working families, still has widespread support. This video can not be played Gilets Jaunes: Are nationalists infiltrating the ""yellow vests""? An opinion poll on Friday suggested a dip in support for the protests, but it still stood at 66%. Meanwhile, President Macron's ratings have fallen to 23% amid the crisis, polls suggest. 17 November: 282,000 protesters - one dead, 409 wounded - 73 in custody 24 November: 166,000 protesters - 84 wounded - 307 in custody 1 December: 136,000 protesters - 263 wounded - 630 in custody 8 December : 136,000 protesters - 118 wounded - 1,220 in custody Police fire tear gas.

French PM seeks 'unity' after new unrest,"Many more people were detained on 8 December than during the previous weekends French Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe has vowed to ""restore national unity"" after violence broke out during a fourth consecutive weekend of protests. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets on Saturday - the latest day of ""yellow vest"" demonstrations against fuel tax rises and high living costs. More than 1,700 people were arrested, but the violence was not on the same level as a week earlier. Discussions with peaceful protesters ""must continue"", Mr Philippe said. He added: ""No tax should jeopardise our national unity. We must now rebuild that national unity through dialogue, through work, and by coming together."" In pictures: France's latest protests Why the 'yellow vests' won't stop protests French students 'humiliated by police' He said President Emmanuel Macron - who many protesters want to stand down - would soon ""put forward measures to foster this dialogue"". French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner praised police - who had been deployed in force - for containing much of the unrest. This video can not be played Protesters surged forward before tear gas was fired In a tweet late on Saturday,Mr Macron thanked the security forces,externalfor their ""courage and exceptional professionalism"". An estimated 125,000 people took part in marches across the country on Saturday, the interior ministry said. Nearly 90,000 officers had been deployed, including 8,000 in Paris where 12 armoured vehicles were also used. Around 10,000 people demonstrated in the capital, where the scenes were the most destructive. Windows were smashed, cars were burned and shops were looted. Video footage showed protesters hit by rubber bullets - including in the face. At least three members of the press were among those hit. Seventeen police officers were also hurt, Mr Castaner said. 17 November: 282,000 protesters - one dead, 409 wounded - 73 in custody 24 November: 166,000 protesters - 84 wounded - 307 in custody 1 December: 136,000 protesters - 263 wounded - 630 in custody 8 December : 125,000 protesters - 118 wounded - 1,723 arrested By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris The French government is relieved that its worst forebodings about the protests did not come to pass. There was certainly some violence in Paris, but it was not on the scale of the week before. The new tactics of the police - record numbers of officers deployed, moving quickly to occupy the ground and not hesitating to make arrests - paid off. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the escalation of violence had been stopped. It is a relief for President Macron - but not much more. He must know that the moment will be thrown away if he does not move in quickly now with ideas that go some way to satisfying the more moderate of the yellow vests. The time is for dialogue, the government says, and the president will make an address to the nation early this week. The question is will he give the protesters what they want, which is something very simple: more money in their pockets. Does he think France can afford to economically? The ""gilets jaunes"" protesters are so-called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law. Over the past few weeks, the social media movement has morphed from a protest over fuel prices to a leaderless spectrum of interest groups and differing demands. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Who supports the protesters? Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Its core aim, to highlight the economic frustration and political distrust of poorer working families, still has widespread support. This video can not be played Gilets Jaunes: Are nationalists infiltrating the ""yellow vests""? An opinion poll on Friday showed a dip in support for the protests, but it still stood at 66%. Meanwhile, President Macron's ratings have fallen to 23% amid the crisis, polls suggest. The government has said it is scrapping the unpopular fuel tax increases in its budget and has frozen electricity and gas prices for 2019. The problem is that protests have erupted over other issues. Granting concessions in some areas may not placate all the protesters, some of whom are calling for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions, easier university requirements and even the resignation of the president.

Mum rang jail hours before son's suicide,"HMP Chelmsford has one of the highest suicide rates in the Prison Service A prison inmate killed himself hours after his mother phoned the jail concerned for her son's safety, the Prison and Probation Ombudsman said. Warren Sampson's mother had rung HMP Chelmsford on 4 September 2015 because of messages he had left. A report said ""no-one spoke to [him] about this or tried to gauge his risk"", a response that was ""inadequate"". The 29-year-old was later found hanged. A Prison Service spokeswoman said the jail had since made improvements. Mr Sampson was remanded at the Essex prison on 4 August after being charged with assaulting his partner and was placed under suicide and self-harm procedures from 12 August until his death. The Ombudsman said these ""did not operate fully effectively"" and ""staff missed signs that Mr Sampson's vulnerability and risk of suicide had increased"" on 4 September. HMP Chelmsford was nearly referred to the Justice Secretary under the Urgent Notification protocol in October After a mental health review, a counsellor was concerned about his anxiety and that he had made a noose, but wing staff and others did not ""explore this further"". A prisoner in the next cell to Mr Sampson said he looked like ""a broken man"" and told an officer while gesturing a ""hanging"" motion, but the officer said she could not remember what had been said or if any gesture was made. He had also called his partner and mother that afternoon and could not get through but left messages suggesting he intended to kill himself, the report said, including one to his partner which said ""if she had answered the phone he would have told her she had just saved his life"". His mother called the prison between 19:15 and 19:30 BST and officers did go to his cell but did not ask about his safety concerns. Mr Sampson was found hanged in his cell between 21:40 and 21:45 and was pronounced dead an hour later. The ombudsman investigates every prison death and although Mr Sampson died three years ago, this report has only now been published. Why are prisons in such a state? Lost in the prison system Minister 'will quit if drugs and violence don't go down' This October, the charity Inquest said the jail, which has one of the highest suicide rates in the country, made""the same systemic failings with dismal regularity"". A Prison Service spokeswoman said: ""This is a tragic case and our thoughts remain with Mr Sampson's family and friends. ""We accepted all the recommendations from the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman and the prison has since made a number of improvements to the work it does to prevent suicide and self-harm. ""The prison has provided specialist training for staff to help them identify, monitor and support vulnerable offenders, and have also recruited an extra 60 prison officers in the last year giving staff more time to provide dedicated support to every prisoner.""

Push to take up 'well-matched' flu jab,"Public Health England (PHE) is urging pregnant women and those over 65 to get the flu jab, after a fall in take-up compared to this time last year. PHE said it was best to get the jab ahead of Christmas, before flu typically starts to circulate. Social gatherings can increase the risk of it spreading. Early indications suggest the vaccine will be more effective this year because it is well-matched to the predominant strain circulating. This is thought to be Influenza A (H1N1), commonly calledswine flu,external. Uptake of the vaccine among pregnant women and those over 65, who are at a higher risk of flu complications, is lower than last year. Paul Cosford, medical director at PHE, said only around 40% of pregnant women and 65% of over-65s had been vaccinated so far. ""It is even more important than ever that all those eligible take up the offer of the flu vaccine, especially before Christmas when many people will be gathering together with the added risk of spreading infection that this brings,"" he said. PHE said there is strong evidence that pregnant women have a much higher risk of serious illness as a result of flu compared with the general population, with the risks highest in the last three months of pregnancy. Serious complications of flu include pneumonia, septic shock, meningitis and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). An enhanced flu jab for people over 65 wasintroduced this yearwhich contains extra ingredients to give better protection. In November, GPsreported a shortageof the new vaccine for the over-65s after a staggered delivery of supplies from the manufacturer to GPs and pharmacies meant some older patients had to wait to be vaccinated. The final batches of the vaccine have now delivered. PHE estimates this enhanced or adjuvanted vaccine will save hundred of lives this winter and ease pressures on the health service. A 'quadrivalent' vaccine, which offers protection against four strains of flu, is being given to those under 65 with underlying health conditions. Another change this year has seen the nasal spray vaccine being offered to an extra school year - Year 5. Children are seen as super-spreaders of the disease, as they are likely to infect more vulnerable older family members.

Key Trump aide John Kelly to leave job,"Some reports suggest Mr Kelly's relationship with Mr Trump has deteriorated President Donald Trump has announced that his chief of staff John Kelly will leave his job by the end of the year. There have been persistent reports for several days that Gen Kelly was under pressure to go. Some reports said that the retired Marine Corps general's relationship with Mr Trump had deteriorated. But Mr Trump described Mr Kelly as a ""great guy"" and said a replacement would be named ""over the next day or two"". The White House revolving door: Who's gone? The people around Donald Trump ""He's been with me almost two years now, between two positions,"" Mr Trump said. ""I appreciate his service very much."" Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America correspondent John Kelly came into the job promising to bring military discipline to an administration riddled with leaks and palace intrigue. He can claim some success - but the leaks never completely disappeared and, by the end, the chief of staff was as deep into the back-stabbing and personnel drama as anyone. A White House job is never easy, but this administration has chewed through senior staff at a record pace. Donald Trump is on his third national security adviser, fifth communications director and soon to be third chief of staff. The one constant is the man in the Oval Office. He likes to say his administration operates like a well-oiled machine, but the grinding gears are amassing quite a professional body count. In total, 28 people have resigned or been fired from the White House during Mr Trump's administration. Last month Reuters news agency quoted a source as saying that Vice-President Mike Pence's chief of staff Nick Ayers was a possible contender for the chief of staff role. This video can not be played What Mr Kelly said in October 2017: 'I was not brought in to control Trump' Earlier this year Gen Kelly was forced to deny that he had called Mr Trump an ""idiot"" after the quote was included in a book about Mr Trump by the veteran investigative journalist Bob Woodward. Gen Kelly is said to have used the description repeatedly and also allegedly said that ""it's pointless to try to convince him of anything"". Woodward on Trump - the explosive quotes Why the Woodward effect damages Trump Mr Trump initially nominated Gen Kelly to oversee Homeland Security before promoting him to chief of staff last July, replacing Reince Priebus. On Saturday, the president also announced that his highest-ranking military officer, Gen Joe Dunford, would be retiring as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He tweeted to say Gen Mark Milley, the current Chief of Staff of the US Army, would replace Gen Dunford.

Brazil 'faith healer' accused of sex abuse,"Self-declared spiritual healer Joao Texeira de Faria denies abusing women who came to him as patients A dozen women have come forward in Brazil to accuse a prominent self-styled spiritual healer of sexually abusing them at his clinic. Joao Teixeira de Faria - known as ""Joao of God"" - is based in the town of Abadiania but has followers worldwide. A Dutch photographer, Zahira Leeneke Maus, told Globo TV that he had manipulated her into performing sex acts and then raped her. In a statement to Globo, Mr Faria's office strongly denied the allegations. It said the 76-year-old had used his powers to treat thousands of people, and ""vehemently rejects (allegations of) any improper practice during his treatments"". Nine Brazilian women, who remained anonymous, also told Globo TV that the self-declared healer had abused them on the premise of transferring his ""cleansing"" energy. Some said they had been seeking a cure for depression when the alleged abuse took place. The related O Globo newspaper later said it had spoken to two further women with similar allegations. Brazil country profile Mr Faria who is not a medical doctor, has previously been fined and jailed for operating without a licence. US TV host Oprah Winfrey travelled to Brazil in 2013 to meet him, and witnessed him performing his ""psychic surgery"" at his clinic, west of the capital Brasilia. According to ABC News, Mr Faria claims that the spirits of more than 30 doctors and other entities can enter his body,external, and that they perform the healings.

NI Atlantic rower's boat develops leak,"Shirley Thompson is attempting to become the oldest woman to row across the Atlantic The Belfast woman aiming to become the oldest woman to row solo across the Atlantic has developed a leak in her boat after a week at sea. Sixty-year-old Shirley Thompson said she is hoping to fix it and continue her record-breaking attempt. Ms Thompson has had to turn back once already, and does not want to have to do so again. She said the leak in her boat is extremely small. Ms Thompson discovered it on Friday, but high winds and stormy seas have hampered her attempts to fix it. On her voyage blog, which she posted online, she said the leak is in the footwell of the cabin on the boat. On Saturday evening, Shirley posted: ""My leak is still leaking and I have yet to find its source. I have investigated but no luck so far. ""I have a wee pool about five inches deep."" She also complained of repeated seasickness. Ms Thompson said she is also suffering from repeated seasickness ""I had thought I would have my sea legs by now but I don't. I stumble around like I am drunk - not that there is anywhere to stumble to - and still have the constant nausea. ""I am confident that will lessen in time."" She is trying to reach the Caribbean after setting off from the Canary Islands, and has more than 2,000 miles to go. She has been at sea for a week and made good progress. She said she is going to bail out the water and keep going until she is able to fix the leak. Ms Thompsonpreviously had to turn back due to a malfunctioning tracker.

Has this teen model got what it takes to crack Paris?," It’s a Monday morning at the end of February and the Louvre-Rivoli metro station in Paris looks rather unusual. Every minute you see a tall, slim girl with a heavy bag and a black folder under her arm getting off a train. In a dark, damp basement, just a few minutes’ walk from the station, a casting for Paris Fashion Week is taking place. Dozens of models, shivering in the cold, are queuing in front of the heavy closed door. Despite the freezing weather they are all dressed in tight black jeans and tight-fitting T-shirts – it’s the mandatory dress code for a casting. They have to be perfect. The perfect body, perfect skin, perfect walk They are waiting for a short casting - if successful, it can lead to a show. Seventeen-year-old Anna Vasilieva from the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod is one of them. For her, like the others, fashion week begins with hours spent in casting queues.Casting director Michelle Mode needs 30 girls for her show. Within an hour she sees dozens of girls but seems to be unhappy with the result. “They have to be perfect. The perfect body, perfect skin, perfect walk,” she says. From the casting room comes the word: “Next”. Anna rushes in, but in the blink of an eye is back out again. The casting she’s waited for for so long has only lasted 10 seconds. The teenager quickly swaps her high-heels for winter boots and heads back out. Today Anna has nine more casting calls to make.I tentatively ask Michelle what was wrong with Anna. “You want me to tell you?” she asks. “Her body is not perfect. Her legs are not perfect. I need girls from 178cm (5.8ft), so she is a little bit small.” Anna arrived in Paris with a packet of buckwheat and a determination to get a modelling job. Her dream is to walk the catwalk for her favourite brand, Yves Saint Laurent. She remembers well the day she was discovered by an agency. “A scout from Nizhny Novgorod wrote to me on a Russian social media network called Vkontakte,” she tells me inside a Parisian brasserie over a cup of coffee and a Caesar salad. “She said she liked my pictures and that I could be a model. She invited me and my mum for an interview.” After an audition Anna was soon sent to South Korea on her first modelling assignment. She was just 14. “My parents were worried but the agency’s director and my personal agent there Ravida talked to them,” remembers Anna. “They said it was safe and that the agency bookers take care of their girls. The youngest was just 12.” Teachers think I am travelling on holiday but they can’t imagine what it takes to do 10 castings a day. At night all you can do is just collapse on your bed Anna’s family is what can be described as middle-class. When I meet her, she is in her final year at a local school in Nizhny Novgorod - a city about 250 miles (402km) east of Moscow. She admits that her modelling jobs – which can last for two months – can, at times, put her under pressure. “The teachers are always pressuring me saying that I am missing a lot and I won’t pass my exams,” she says. “Many of them say: ‘Why are you are taking so much time off?’They think I am travelling on holiday but they can’t imagine what it takes to do 10 castings a day. At night all you can do is just collapse on your bed.” For many Russian teenagers, the ideal scenario would be to get a free place at one of the local universities. But the number of government-financed places is limited, so most of the students will have to pay for their education. An academic year costs around $900 (approximately £700). With an average monthly income of $500 (£400), combined with the lack of a student loan scheme, many families have to start saving from the time their children start school. But for ambitious teenagers like Anna, who is already well-travelled, Nizhny can feel small. Inspired by social media and Instagram in particular, young people in Nizhny are increasingly interested in creative jobs and some of them told me that the Soviet teaching style at local universities is too old-fashioned for them. Moscow, just four hours away by train, has far better universities but the competition for places is extremely tough. Anna says she is likely to enrol at the local university but dreams of studying design at Parsons School of Design in New York in the future. Thanks to her modelling career, she believes this dream has more chance of becoming reality. She proudly says she can afford to pay for her shopping and food (and occasionally send her parents flowers while she is abroad). Like hundreds of other models in Paris, Anna is fully dependent on her agency. The agency pays for her flights, her accommodation, and gives her a weekly allowance, or what is called “pocket money”. Most importantly, it finds the jobs. But if the model doesn't live up to expectations, it's the agency that will send her home. All the costs, including printing portfolio pictures and catwalk lessons, are deducted from the models’ net earnings. The agency I visit in Paris feels like a stock exchange. In a bright spacious room, 10 people sit around a long table endlessly making phone calls and loudly shouting at each other. Girls who don’t speak the language look panic-stricken when they catch their name amidst a long stream of French. The office is covered wall-to-wall with photographs of models. Every photo has the label ""IN"" under it – meaning ""in town"". Each model knows that if she isn’t successful at castings ""IN"" will be replaced with “OUT” under her photograph. Sometimes they don’t get castings and they come to me for help. If they’ve spent all their money they come to me. The young girls are really just children. I get really worried about them Anna is here for her weekly measurement check and to receive her pocket money. Every Monday the agency’s manager Tatyana measures the chest, waist and hips of each girl. Being the “right” size is an entry point to the fashion world. “The most important are the hips. They should be between 86cm and 88cm,” explains 19-year-old Ukrainian-born Tatyana. “If the hips are bigger than 90cm, the girl won’t get work.” Despite working with new models all year round Tatyana still gets emotional about the girls. “I am almost the same age as them but I feel like their mum. I need to ensure they are working,” she explains. “Sometimes they don’t get castings and they come to me for help. If they’ve spent all their money they come to me. The young girls are really just children. I get really worried about them.” Every week Anna receives an allowance of $90 (£70). This is meant to pay for transport, food and mobile phone bills for a week. According to Anna’s accounts, a third of her allowance goes on her weekly metro card, leaving her with as little as $5 (£4) for food a day. When I started modelling about 10 years ago, the agency was giving us the same amount. How is it possible to live on this money today? “It’s quite hard,” says Anna. “You should eat in the apartment to save money and buy food on the street so it’s cheaper.” Yet for most of the models, the only way to avoid being hungry in Paris is to bring their own food with them. Anna is no exception. Half of her suitcase was filled with groceries, including buckwheat, tea and instant noodles. Anna takes me to her apartment, which she shares with six other aspiring models. The apartment has a few lights and basic furniture. The “house rules” are attached to the entrance door. There are a few spacious bedrooms, which girls share between two, but there is only one bathroom. Every morning this becomes a little problem, especially when everyone has castings starting at the same time. After a long casting day the girls gather in a small kitchen over a bowl of pasta. After noticing my surprised expression one of them looks guilty and says that they only “eat this type of food once a month”. It’s an industry that says yes or no. And if you cry on your first casting you are not cut out for it They talk about how the day went and wonder about a new model who was supposed to have arrived. “The girls come and go so fast so we sometimes don’t even know who else lives here,” says Australian model Owey, who came to Paris after Milan Fashion Week. “One of the girls is like a ghost in the house.  She comes in and leaves whenever and no-one even knows her.” I wonder what makes Paris so special that so many models fly in. “There is a game-changing opportunity here,” says 26-year-old Bayana from Kazakhstan. “Imagine you come for the Yohji Yamamoto casting, he likes you, books you for the show, then gives you a campaign job and you become more well-known.” However, the girls agree that with so much competition there is not much prospect of that happening. With many of the models being just 16, I wonder how they cope with the constant rejection at castings. “It’s a cut-throat industry,” says Owey. “It’s an industry that says yes or no. And if you cry on your first casting you are not cut out for it.” Every year the founders of the Silent modelling agency, Vincent Peter and Eric Dubois, bring dozens of new faces to the Parisian market in the hope that one of the girls will make it big. With so much competition during fashion week, I ask the agency founders what makes a certain model stand out and get the job. Eric argues that personality is the key to their success. There is no-one more insecure than the designer. They don’t know if the dress is right or wrong until 10,000 women buy it in the shop “This is also about attitude. The way you take a cigarette, the way you smoke, take a glass. You are so sure of yourself that people around you feel it,” says Eric, who’s been in the industry for a few decades. “There is no-one more insecure than the designer,” he continues. “They don’t know if the dress is right or wrong until women buy it in the shop. The designer has to feel the energy in the model, find something that resonates with his collection, so then she has better chances to get the show.” Watching the models passing by the agency, I wonder if this is still the look the industry wants in the age of diversity. “The job of the models is to make clothes look nice,” explains Vincent Peter. “If the girl is tall and slim off course this will make the coat look even more beautiful.” Can plus-size models be as successful on a catwalk? “If you look at the Olympics, you don’t see plus-size models jumping,” he says. “You see athletes who are long and slim. Same in fashion. In order to wear a coat the nicest way possible you have to be tall and slim.” Paris doesn't feel much like a city of love in February. The cold wind goes right through you and your hands hurt from the cold. The weather doesn’t affect Anna’s determination. Following directions on her phone she heads to the next casting. It’s not easy to find an address in the maze of winding streets. Finally Anna knocks on the right door. The casting room is warm and full of life. There is a crowd of make-up artists surrounding a model who is trying to hold it together. They don’t tell you if they like you or if they don’t like you. You can just read it in their faces She has only just been chosen from hundreds of potentials to act as a blank canvas for the make-up artists to test catwalk looks on. There aren’t many girls in this casting. It gives Anna more confidence. She walks towards the designer with a smile.“If he asks me to change my clothes, I will have some time to warm up,"" she says. But the designer simply looks Anna up and down and says: ""Thank you. Bye."" “They don’t tell you if they like you or if they don’t like you,” Anna says. “You can just read it in their faces.” I have a quick chat with another model who has just arrived. Sarah,18, from Holland looks lost. She has done five castings with no success and has 10 more to do. I ask her how she feels about the rejection. “It’s so hard,” she responds. “Because you don’t know what is wrong and what you can improve. It sucks.” “When you come to Paris you are sure that everyone will like you,” says Anna. “But then you come to the first, second, ninth casting and no-one notices you. Your self-esteem drops, you start doubting yourself.” She slowly begins to realise that this season she is unlikely to book any shows. None of Anna’s flatmates is booked for shows either. The kitchen, where the girls used to gather in the evenings, is now empty. The girls sit quietly in their rooms. In a cold, dark corridor I meet 17-year-old Alisa from Russia. With a touch of disappointment on her face she tells me that success during fashion week has nothing to do with the model herself. “The casting-director has to wake up in a good mood, get a delicious cup of coffee and see a girl at the right moment,” she says. “It’s a shame when your efforts are not appreciated, but this is life, this is modelling.” After two weeks in Paris, Anna’s debt to her agency has reached more than 2000 euros (£1,800). With no casting success during fashion week, she was sent to work in a designer brand showroom. “You come, try on clothes, appear in front of the clients, they look at you, sometimes they can touch you,” Anna says of her new job. “You are sort of working between the tables - it's not something I like.” Fifteen people, including models and staff, are put together in a tiny room waiting for the fashion buyers to come. You come, try on clothes, appear in front of the clients, they look at you, sometimes they can touch you Once the clients arrive, Anna’s job is to stay still in an outfit and smile. Turn and move upon request. In one day Anna can have up to a few hundred outfit changes. “The most difficult thing is the hours,” she says. “Working in a showroom takes up to 10 hours a day. Standing for so long is quite tiring. “But when I have a free minute I can read my book,” she adds. A model’s success during fashion week is measured by the number of shows she is booked for. For the agencies it’s the amount of money they can make from these shows. Anna’s manager Roman is not happy with the result. “I did my calculations yesterday. We made approximately 100,000 euros. Could be more,” he says. For models like Anna, the girl arrives, she works, then the agency gets back everything it advanced for her. So the agency is always the winner Will Anna make any money during this trip? Roman doubts it. “For models like Anna, the girl arrives, she works, then the agency gets back everything it advanced for her. So the agency is always a winner,” he says. “Probably she won’t make any money, but she is not alone.” Comp cards are cards with the model’s photo, agency and measurements on “It’s not a question of agency or model, it’s just the market system,” he shrugs. The last time I meet Anna she is late finishing work and I wait for her outside the showroom for a couple of hours. To my surprise, Anna is fully aware that she might leave Paris empty-handed. And even more surprisingly she is OK with it. In a few days Anna will head back to Nizhny for her end-of-year exams. Despite getting no shows this time in Paris, she still plans to try again next year. She does have some work lined up - once her exams are over she is heading East. “I work quite a lot in China. I have a good agency there,” explains Anna, who has worked there four times already. Due to the country's vast production of clothes, the need for models in recent years has rapidly increased. Local designers admire the Eastern European look, so it comes as no surprise that models like Anna can get work much more easily there than in Europe. In China most of the girls work for catalogues, shooting anything between 20 to 200 outfits a day. At times it may feel tedious and repetitive, but, unlike in Paris, it actually pays. “I already have many regular clients there. Sometimes I don’t even need to go for castings,” Anna says. “To me going to China feels almost like home.” Author: Alina Isachenka (BBC Russian Service) Project coordinator and editor: Emma Wells Design: Denis Korolev Illustrations: Natallia Trayan Images: Getty, Anna Vasilieva’s archive, Direct Scouting.

Mum rang jail hours before son's suicideA report found no staff raised concerns with the prisoner after he left suicidal messages for his mum.Essex,"HMP Chelmsford has one of the highest suicide rates in the Prison Service A prison inmate killed himself hours after his mother phoned the jail concerned for her son's safety, the Prison and Probation Ombudsman said. Warren Sampson's mother had rung HMP Chelmsford on 4 September 2015 because of messages he had left. A report said ""no-one spoke to [him] about this or tried to gauge his risk"", a response that was ""inadequate"". The 29-year-old was later found hanged. A Prison Service spokeswoman said the jail had since made improvements. Mr Sampson was remanded at the Essex prison on 4 August after being charged with assaulting his partner and was placed under suicide and self-harm procedures from 12 August until his death. The Ombudsman said these ""did not operate fully effectively"" and ""staff missed signs that Mr Sampson's vulnerability and risk of suicide had increased"" on 4 September. HMP Chelmsford was nearly referred to the Justice Secretary under the Urgent Notification protocol in October After a mental health review, a counsellor was concerned about his anxiety and that he had made a noose, but wing staff and others did not ""explore this further"". A prisoner in the next cell to Mr Sampson said he looked like ""a broken man"" and told an officer while gesturing a ""hanging"" motion, but the officer said she could not remember what had been said or if any gesture was made. He had also called his partner and mother that afternoon and could not get through but left messages suggesting he intended to kill himself, the report said, including one to his partner which said ""if she had answered the phone he would have told her she had just saved his life"". His mother called the prison between 19:15 and 19:30 BST and officers did go to his cell but did not ask about his safety concerns. Mr Sampson was found hanged in his cell between 21:40 and 21:45 and was pronounced dead an hour later. The ombudsman investigates every prison death and although Mr Sampson died three years ago, this report has only now been published. Why are prisons in such a state? Lost in the prison system Minister 'will quit if drugs and violence don't go down' This October, the charity Inquest said the jail, which has one of the highest suicide rates in the country, made""the same systemic failings with dismal regularity"". A Prison Service spokeswoman said: ""This is a tragic case and our thoughts remain with Mr Sampson's family and friends. ""We accepted all the recommendations from the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman and the prison has since made a number of improvements to the work it does to prevent suicide and self-harm. ""The prison has provided specialist training for staff to help them identify, monitor and support vulnerable offenders, and have also recruited an extra 60 prison officers in the last year giving staff more time to provide dedicated support to every prisoner.""

Police restrictions for 'Brexit Betrayal' march,"The UKIP-organised ""Brexit Betrayal"" march started after midday Thousands of people have taken to the streets in London to march in a UKIP-organised rally and a counter-protest march. A UKIP spokesman said ""quite a few thousand"" supporters turned up to their ""Brexit Betrayal"" march alongside controversial activist Tommy Robinson. Marching in opposition were anti-fascist groups and Labour-backed campaigners. A spokeswoman said 15,000 turned up to oppose Mr Robinson's rally. Laura Parker of Labour grassroots group Momentum claimed their counter-demonstration ""vastly"" outnumbered UKIP's ""nearly five to one"". She said: ""Even with the UKIP machine in tow, he [Robinson] only managed to bring a few thousand supporters out on the streets while we mobilised nearly 15,000 to march against his racism and bigotry."" Police have not provided an estimate of crowd sizes. By Richard Galpin Despite fears there could be clashes between the pro and anti-Brexiteers today, the marches which streamed through the streets of central London passed off peacefully. Thousands of people took part on both sides of the divide, making their feelings known ahead of the key vote in parliament due to take place on Tuesday. Those marching under the UKIP banner called for Theresa May's Brexit deal to be dumped. One demonstrator carried an effigy of the prime minister describing her as a traitor, while another held a model scaffold and hangman's noose. Later in a rally close to parliament and Downing Street, the UKIP leader Gerrard Batten said it had been an achievement to get the far-right activist Tommy Robinson involved in the demonstration. Mr Robinson who denies claims he is a racist and fascist, joined the front of the march saying it was ""a beautiful day."" Scotland Yard imposed restrictions,externalon both marches and urged people to protest peacefully. A simple guide to Brexit Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Former leader Nigel Farage quits UKIP Counter-demonstrators marched to Parliament with placards and signs Mr Robinson and his supporters gathered outside the Houses of Parliament where they were addressed by UKIP leader Gerard Batten. The former English Defence League leader was recently appointed as an adviser to Mr Batten, prompting a number of people to resign from the party,including former leader Nigel Farage, Mr Batten told the crowd: ""If Parliament does not take Britain out of the European Union it will be the biggest constitutional crisis since the English Civil War. ""In 1642 the king put himself in opposition to parliament. Parliament won and the king lost his head."" UKIP leader Gerard Batten carried a banner with supporters Weyman Bennett, of Stand Up To Racism and one of the counter-protest organisers, said: ""I believe that the majority of people in this country reject fascism and racism. ""There's deep concern in Britain about the growth of the far right in this country, under the guise of Tommy Robinson and UKIP."" He added: ""We are excited about the amount of women organisers, Muslim groups and trade unions that have come out. UKIP had earlier predicted its ""Brexit Betrayal"" march would be ""the largest pro-Brexit event of the year"", with party leaderGerard Batten telling supporters,externalit was the ""only pro-Brexit rally to be held before the vote next week"". Unite Against Fascism and grassroots group Momentum march against Tommy Robinson Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, had urged people to join the rally against Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. Scotland Yard said it had imposed conditions - which include the marches sticking to planned routes and limits on the time they could take place. Mr Robinson and his supporters met outside the Dorchester hotel on Park Lane before marching along a pre-determined route to Westminster. Police barriers separated them from the counter-protesters, who had gathered outside the BBC's Portland Place headquarters prior to marching to Whitehall.

Who was the 'Thai bride' dumped in the hills?,"When Richard Hill posed for this picture, he did not realise a body was wrapped around the rocks behind him Moments after Richard Hill posed for this picture, he and his friends discovered a corpse lying in the mountain stream. More than 14 years later, police remain baffled as to the identity of the woman dumped in the Yorkshire Dales. But forensic advances have at last offered a clue, giving weight to a new theory about the final years of her life. Stormy weather battered the five walkers as they set off from the quaint village of Horton in Ribblesdale for Yorkshire's famous Three Peaks. After reaching the summit of the smallest, Pen-y-ghent, they were forced back to flat land by the wind and rain and took a detour along the Pennine Way. The group decided to stop near a network of caves known as Sell Gill Holes - it was a natural break point and a chance to grab a bite and take a few pictures. Minutes after they were taken, walker Peter Goodhew spotted the body of a half-naked woman in the stream, curled around the jagged grey rocks. ""We were having a look around, peering down the cave, and then I glanced to my left and at first I thought it was a mannequin. ""But as I got up closer it was the missing fingernails that struck me. I realised then it was a corpse."" ""He shouted that there was a dead body,"" said his friend Mr Hill. ""It was so surreal. It really shook me to the core and once it had all sunk in, what had happened, the next day I cried."" Cold case reviewers said an artist's impression released at the time was not necessarily an accurate reflection of her because it was based on her after death Despite extensive inquiries, North Yorkshire Police has so far failed to answer the two most important questions: who is this woman and how did she die? Examination of her body put her height at 4ft 11ins (149 cm) and her weight at about 10 stone (63kg). She was believed to be aged somewhere between 25 and 35; her hair was shoulder length, and dark brown. Pertinently, she was believed to be of south-east Asian origin. But this could only be narrowed down so far - she could have been from Thailand, the Philippines, Laos, Vietnam or Indonesia. The Pennine-way footpath to Pen-y-ghent crosses the rail track at Horton in Ribblesdale, close to where the walkers began their trek But no-one ever came forward to identify the woman, who those in Horton in Ribblesdale would come to call the Lady of the Hills. Saddened by the lack of interest in her, the parish council organised her funeral, which more than 40 people attended. She is buried in a plot in the village graveyard. Villagers in Horton in Ribblesdale claimed the woman as their own ""It's an incredibly sad story. Everyone in the village was so upset at the thought of this young lady just being left all by herself,"" said Sheila Millman, who was council chairman at the time. ""We felt a responsibility for her, like she belonged to us and we wanted to make sure she had a final resting place should her family ever get traced."" Police believe the woman was originally hidden behind the mound on the right and her body was dislodged by heavy rain Inquiries by police were met with repeated dead ends. Pathologists concluded she had been dead for between one and three weeks but there were no obvious signs of major trauma, such as being shot or bludgeoned, and they could not determine how she had died. Decomposition of her organs meant doctors could also not say she died of a natural cause, such as by heart attack or stroke, but the lack of insect infestation suggested she had not been outside for long - perhaps only a few days. Crucially, detectives favoured an explanation for her death that ruled out anything suspicious. The fact she was found wearing only socks, a pair of green Marks & Spencer jeans, and a bra with broken hooks hanging off her left arm, suggested she might have become lost and died of hypothermia - the lack of clothes explained by a case of paradoxical undressing, where someone freezing to death might strip off under the illusion they are burning up. She was buried in the village graveyard after the parish council donated a plot A trawl of missing person databases, inquiries with foreign embassies, and anthropology and orthodontic tests failed to come up with any leads about her identity. The case was eventually passed to the cold case team, which took a fresh look in 2016 - and came up with rather different conclusions from the original investigating team. It began to consider the line of inquiry that the woman may have been a ""Thai bride-type"", according to lead investigator, retired Det Ch Insp Adam Harland. ""The term Thai bride does not necessarily mean the woman comes from Thailand but that she is a lady who has taken up a relationship with a white gentleman and has come back to live in the UK in the late 1990s or early 2000s,"" he explained. ""The fact that no-one has reported her missing suggests the relationship has broken down and her disappearance was because she's 'gone back home'. ""In this case, her partner had a natural excuse to explain her absence and for that reason I think, for now, he's got away with it."" Mr Harland and his team believe the woman had been living in a rural community in north Lancashire or south Cumbria and was murdered by her partner, then dumped outdoors. The stream where she was found is a mile from the main road and several from the nearest town of Settle. Tellingly, she wore a band on her wedding ring finger which, because of its high percentage of gold, was traced to Bangkok. According to the Office of National Statistics, in 2004 there were 3,000 people in Cumbria and Lancashire who were born in a south-east Asian country. Investigators made use of a unique database that produces profiles of killers based on previous murder cases. It shows that most bodies are carried no more than 50m (164ft) from a vehicle and that most drivers dumping a corpse travel no further than between 50 and 80 miles (80 to 130km). The location of her body was off a rocky track only accessible by a 4x4, suggesting the killer may have lived in a rural location. The mystery of the Milk Carton Kids In Madeleine's shadow The mystery of the airman who disappeared However, she was probably dumped in a more secluded spot and only became visible due to the heavy rain. ""That part of the Yorkshire Dales has its own microclimate,"" said fellow investigator and former detective, Max Jowett. ""We managed to track down a fell runner, who every morning would take a reading of the water level. ""When he gave us the charts it showed that there had been a massive spike in rainfall the 24 hours before she was found - enough to move a body."" Mr Harland maintains the killer was familiar with the area. ""If you came across this location by chance you'd maybe think about disposing the body in the cave,"" he said. ""But someone who knows this place would know that there's a metal grille at the bottom of the cave and that it's regularly visited by walkers. ""The likelihood is that she's been dead at home, they've needed to get rid of her quickly and they've brought her up here, over the hump and put her out of sight."" The local quarry donated a slab of limestone which was used for her headstone The newest and most compelling evidence has come from advances in forensic science. Stable isotope analysis was not available to the original inquiry team, but has determined where the woman spent the last two years of her life. It involves examining the levels of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen - found in soils or drinking water - in samples of the hair, teeth or bones, which can provide information about where a person lived. The tests on the woman's bones and teeth confirmed she grew up in south-east Asia, but a cutting of her hair showed isotopes found in only a few places in Britain - including in south Cumbria and the northern tip of Lancashire. A poem by an unknown author surfaced after the woman's death ""We do not find the needle in the haystack but we reduce the haystack to a manageable size,"" said Prof Wolfram Meier-Augenstein, who carried out the tests. ""We provide investigators with information to enable them to focus their efforts on a few select regions, thus increasing the chances of getting a match on, for example dental records, or next-of-kin DNA."" Cases such as these are not so much about solving the crime by ""that lightning bolt moment"" but by building a theory based on the most likely explanation and probabilities, said Mr Harland. ""Often you're peering down the telescope the wrong way and wondering why everything looks so small,"" he added. ""Once we find out who this lady is and the last person associated with her, I imagine they'll have a fair bit of explaining to do. ""We don't have many unsolved cases. This is not an easy one to solve, but it is solvable.""

Government bans fax machines in the NHS,"The NHS will be banned from buying fax machines from next month - and has been told by the government to phase out the machines entirely by 31 March 2020. In July, the Royal College of Surgeons revealed nearly 9,000 fax machines were in use across the NHS in England. The Department of Health said a change to more modern communication methods was needed to improve patient safety and cyber security. An RCS spokesman said they supported the government's decision. In place of fax machines, the Department of Health said secure email should be used. NHS still reliant on 'archaic' fax machines Oxford University Hospitals Trust scraps fax machines Why is hi-tech Japan using cassette tapes and faxes? Richard Kerr, who is the chair of the RCS's commission on the future of surgery, said the continued use of the outdated technology by the NHS was ""absurd"". He added it was ""crucial"" that the health service invested in ""better ways of communicating the vast amount of patient information that is going to be generated"" in the future. The group's report from earlier this year found the use of fax machines was most common at the Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Trust, which still relied on 603 machines. Three-quarters of the trusts in England replied to the survey - 95 in total. Ten trusts said that they did not own any fax machines, but four in ten reported more than 100 in use. Rebecca McIntyre from Manchester, who works as a cognitive behavioural therapist, said fax machines are ""a continued risk to the confidentiality and safeguarding of patients"". ""You would not believe the palaver we have in the work place trying to communicate important documents to services (referrals etc),"" she said. ""We constantly receive faxes meant for other places in error but this is never reported."" Meanwhile, Taz, from Doncaster, works in a pharmacy and said discharge notes, emergency documents and out-of-hours services ""all are stuck in the dark ages"". ""I hope this is just the start of many changes,"" he said. ""The amount of time wasted and potential errors that exist from not using technology is shocking and often it's the patients that suffer. ""My next hope is that hand written prescriptions are scrapped completely and we use tablets to send them electronically for patients like most GPs have been doing for years."" Malicious fax leaves firms open to attack Why the fax machine isn't quite dead yet However, Tim Owen. from Bolton, who works in blood services, asked: ""So what happens when a computer virus attacks a hospital's IT infrastructure, as happened recently? ""During theWannaCry attack of 2017our 'out-dated, redundant' piece of equipment ensured that blood products, not routinely held in our on-site blood bank, could be ordered without delay and therefore not compromising patient safety."" One GP in the Midlands said they currently rely on a fax machine for requesting x-rays at local hospitals because of an ongoing IT problem which has not been fixed. Meanwhile, outside of the NHS, Nina Mowbray, from Northampton, works for one of the top 10 accountancy firms where she said they still fax documents to HM Revenue and Customs. ""We could email but we need to have this set up first which means we have to get formal approval from a director/partner which we don't do,"" she said. ""It does seem very outdated."" And Joseph Vincent, from Macclesfield, said he still uses his fax machine to communicate with his brother, who lives in a remote part of Scotland. ""The internet is slow there and sometimes we send funny messages to each other using a fax machine. The sound it makes is really satisfying although it is a bit of a running gag between us."" The first ""facsimile"" machinewas invented in 1842by Scotsman Alexander Bain Bain's invention worked by scanning a message written with special ink on a metallic surface. This picked up the electrical impression of the original and a telegraph circuit could be used to transmit it By the beginning of the 20th Century, fax machines were being used commercially by organisations such as newspapers After technological improvements by Japanese companies, fax machines became widespread in the 1970s and 1980s The technology reached its peak around the end of the 20th Century, and was then gradually replaced by more modern methods of communication NHS still reliant on 'archaic' fax machines NHS trust scraps faxing of patient data Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Peer's son who killed himself failed by NHS,"Lord Monson believes his son's mental health problems were related to his use of strong cannabis A peer's son who took his own life was let down by an NHS trust, a coroner has ruled. Rupert Green, a user of strong cannabis and son of hereditary peer Lord Monson, killed himself in January 2017 after displaying symptoms of psychosis. Sitting in Woking, Surrey, assistant coroner Anna Crawford said there had been a failure on the part of Surrey and Borders NHS Trust. The trust said it was ""deeply sorry"" for 21-year-old Mr Green's death. The inquest heard he had been under the care of the Early Intervention in Psychosis Team, a branch of the Surrey trust, since 2016. On 15 January 2017, Mr Green was taken by his mother to an out-of-hours service for people with mental health issues. He was displaying acute psychotic symptoms, ""stating he was the son of God"", and threatening to kill himself if not believed, the inquest heard. Mr Green, pictured here in his childhood, became addicted to skunk cannabis A mental health nurse was said to be ""very concerned about him"" and asked her colleagues at the trust's Home Treatment Team (HTT) to carry out an assessment, but they refused the referral. Instead he was seen for a planned review the following day. He continued to display signs of psychosis but stopped threatening to kill himself. On 18 January he began the threats again, and told his mother there ""would be blood on her hands"" if she did not believe him. He was found dead later that day in the family's garden. Lord Monson has appealed for tougher penalties for those who deal in the skunk strain of cannabis Concluding Friday's inquest hearing, Ms Crawford said there had been ""a failure on the part of the HTT to assess and care for Rupert during the period of 15-18 January 2017"", but there was not a sufficient connection ""between that failure and Rupert's death"" to conclude there had been neglect. Justin Wilson, the trust's chief medical officer, said after the hearing: ""Our serious investigation into the care and treatment provided to Rupert has shown the communication between our Safe Haven service and Home Treatment Team was not clear and requires improvement. ""There was a missed opportunity for more intensive support from our Home Treatment Team and we have worked closely with the services involved to make positive changes."" In 2017, Nicholas Monson told the BBC his son, who was heir to the family's Burton estate in Lincolnshire, had suffered from psychosis as a result of an addiction to skunk - a strong form of cannabis. The peer has campaigned for the legalisation of milder forms of cannabis and tougher penalties for those dealing the skunk strain. In 2012, his son Alexander Monson, 28, died in police custody in Mombasa, Kenya. NHS probe over 'skunk death' of peer's son Aristocrat's son died 'violently' Skunk dangers prompt health fears.

May warns of 'uncharted waters' for UK,"Theresa May has attended a church service near her Maidenhead constituency The Commons vote on Tuesday will not be delayed, the Brexit Secretary has said, amid growing calls for the PM to go back to Brussels to renegotiate. Stephen Barclay also said Theresa May could stay in post if, as expected, MPs reject her Brexit plan. The PMhas warned Tory rebels,externalit could lead to a general election, and there was a ""very real risk of no Brexit"". Boris Johnson said the PM could stay on if she lost but must renegotiate the deal with Brussels. The withdrawal deal negotiated between the UK and EU has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by Parliament. Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Brexit deal 'huge step into the unknown' Brexit: A really simple guide But the government is widely expected to lose the vote with Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the DUP, the SNP and dozens of Conservative MPs saying they cannot support the deal. European Council President Donald Tusktweeted on Sunday,externalit would be ""an important week for the fate of Brexit"", after a phone call with Theresa May. This video can not be played Stephen Barclay said MPs shouldn't ""let the perfect be the enemy of the good"" Despitenewspaper speculation it could be called off,external, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said: ""The vote is going ahead and that's because it's a good deal and it's the only deal"". He warned against suggesting negotiations could be reopened: ""The French, the Spanish and others will turn round, if we seek to reopen the negotiation, and ask for more."" Alternative ways to break Brexit impasse The backstop explained And he insisted that Theresa May could remain prime minister, even if her deal is heavily defeated by MPs: ""Yes, the prime minister is fighting for us and will continue in post."" Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit strategy, told the BBC he did not want a ""no-deal"" Brexit or another referendum, but it was not right to say there were no other alternatives. He said theNorthern Ireland ""backstop""- effectively an insurance policy to prevent a hard border if no free trade deal is struck in time - put the UK in a ""diabolical negotiating position"". MPs could give Mrs May ""a powerful mandate to change that backstop"" by voting it down on Tuesday, he said. The border issue should instead be covered in negotiations over a future trading relationship with Europe, he said, and the UK should ""incentivise"" the EU by withholding ""at least half"" of the UK's agreed Â£39bn ""divorce"" payment, until a free trade is signed at the end of 2020. This video can not be played Boris Johnson said it was a ""relatively simple job"" to change the withdrawal agreement He dismissed suggestions he had already offered other Tory MPs jobs if they backed a future leadership bid by him as ""nonsense"" and said the public wanted to see a plan ""to get out of this mess"" rather than ""stuff about leadership elections and personalities"" - although he did not rule out challenging Mrs May for the leadership. And the former foreign secretary, a key figure in the 2016 campaign to leave the EU, said: ""Don't underestimate the deep sense of personal responsibility I feel for Brexit and what's happened. ""It breaks my heart to think that after all we fought for... that we should consign ourselves to a future in which the EU effectively rules us in many respects and yet we have no say around the table in Brussels."" By BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley Some Conservatives are urging Theresa May to defer Tuesday's vote, fearing a humiliating defeat which would destabilise the government. They hope more clarity or compromise on the backstop issue can be provided - and some wavering Tories won over. But others point out that no acceptable compromise has been found so far - and question whether one will be found now. They also point out that Brussels has shown little enthusiasm for revisiting the backstop. Indeed there are some who believe only a strong rejection of Theresa May's deal will encourage the EU to rethink. The Brexit Secretary said the vote would go ahead. With some still seeking to persuade the prime minister, it cannot be completely certain the vote will go ahead until Monday. If the deal is rejected, it is unclear what happens next.Mrs May told the Mail on Sunday,externalit would mean ""grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal"". Protesters calling for another referendum to decide the issue were joined by politicians from across the political spectrum at a rally on Sunday, including Tory peer Lord Heseltine, Green MP Caroline Lucas, and Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan. Actor Charles Dance was among those at the rally Conservative former minister Philip Lee told the rally in east London: ""I think a People's Vote is the best hope that we have of reuniting our country after this sorry episode."" Ms Lucas said the message to Mrs May was: ""We don't want your vision of a mean-minded little Britain, with our borders closed and our horizons narrowed."" And Dr Allin-Khan said: ""The promises made in 2016 are so far removed from the reality of the 585-page Withdrawal Agreement that it's time to take the Brexit decision back to the people."" She was careful to say that the vote should only take place if there was not a general election - it is Labour Party policy to call for an election and, only if that does not happen, to keep ""all options"" open, including a referendum. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn told ITV News that he would ""have a discussion"" with Rosena Allin-Khan, who is a shadow minister, about her appearance at the rally: ""She's entitled to her point of view. I would rather she and every other Labour MP spent today and tomorrow and Tuesday concentrating solely on making sure we defeat this deal."" And former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said there was ""a very large chunk of people who would feel utterly betrayed"" if another referendum was called. AUKIP-organised ""Brexit Betrayal"" march also took placein London, amid controversy over leader Gerard Batten's decision to appoint controversial activist Tommy Robinson as an adviser. On Saturday, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd suggested a so-called ""Norway Plus"" option - which would see the UK remaining in the European Economic Area and joining a customs union with the EU - could be another possibility, if the deal was rejected. But Mr Barclay told the BBC: ""I don't think it honours the referendum result"" - saying it would not give the UK control over immigration. Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet over the deal, also said Mrs May should ""immediately"" renegotiate with Brussels, if MPs reject her deal. Asked if she would consider a leadership bid, she told Sky News it was not about ""personalities"" and she would back the PM if she renegotiated the deal. This video can not be played The BBC's Leila Nathoo on how the Commons vote will play out But she did not rule it out, saying she'd give it ""serious consideration"" if she were asked to stand. Justice Minister Rory Stewart told the BBC that the government ""should come back again"" to Parliament if it loses Tuesday's vote, potentially with some ""small adjustment"" to the deal but suggested some MPs were using the backstop ""as an excuse"" to reject it. Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey would not confirm that Labour would immediately put down a motion of no confidence in the prime minister. She said: ""We will have to see what happens on Tuesday... we will have to make an assessment at the time and we will be in discussions with other political parties across the House to assess the best thing to do."" She added that the PM should call a general election, having lost a key proposal, but added ""alternatively she could offer to renegotiate around a deal that would provide consensus in Parliament"".

Hundreds detained in violent French riots,"This video can not be played Protesters surged forward before tear gas was fired Police in Paris have fired rubber bullets and tear gas as a fourth weekend of anti-government protests across France turned violent. Almost 1,000 people have been taken into custody nationwide. Parisian hospital authorities said 126 people had been injured in the city, but none seriously. At least three police officers were also hurt. The ""yellow vest"" movement opposed fuel tax rises but ministers say it has been hijacked by ""ultra-violent"" protesters. An estimated 125,000 demonstrators gathered across the country during the day, with 10,000 of them in the capital, where the scenes were the most destructive. Looters have been seen smashing shop fronts, and cars have been set on fire. In pictures: France's latest protests Why the 'yellow vests' won't stop protests French students 'humiliated by police' In a television address on Saturday evening, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the ""casseurs"" (troublemakers) were still at work. He called for more communication between the government and protesters to resolve the conflict. ""The dialogue has begun,"" he said. ""It is now necessary to rebuild the national unity."" Apart from Paris, there were demonstrations in several other cities on Saturday including Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Marseille and Grenoble. Some places also had separate climate change marches taking place. There have been a number of confrontations in the capital. Video footage showed one demonstrator being hit in the torso with a rubber bullet while standing in front of a line of police with his hands up. At least three members of the press were also hit. Water cannon were deployed on a street east of the city centre. Who supports the 'gilets jaunes' As night fell, protesters converged on Place de la RÃ©publique, and a heavy police presence remained on the  Champs-ElysÃ©es. Nearly 90,000 officers were deployed countrywide in anticipation of clashes, including 8,000 in Paris where 12 armoured vehicles were also utilised. Last week, hundreds of people were arrested and 162 were injured in violence in Paris - some of the worst street clashes in the French capital for decades. This weekend, six matches in the top tier of France's football league were postponed. The Louvre, MusÃ©e d'Orsay and other sites were also closed all day in Paris. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris The French government is relieved that its worst forebodings about the protests did not come to pass. There was certainly some violence in Paris, but it was not on the scale of the week before. The new tactics of the police - record numbers of officers deployed, moving quickly to occupy the ground and not hesitating to make arrests - paid off. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the escalation of violence had been stopped. It is a relief for President Macron - but not much more. He must know that the moment will be thrown away if he does not move in quickly now with ideas that go some way to satisfying the more moderate of the yellow vests. The time is for dialogue, the government says, and the president will make an address to the nation early this week. The question is will he give the protesters what they want, which is something very simple: more money in their pockets. Does he think France can afford to economically? The sentiment of the anti-government protests has inspired other spin-off protests in nearby countries. About 100 people were arrested in the capital Brussels. Some threw paving stones, fireworks, flares and other objects at police, according to AP news agency. In the Netherlands, a protest was held outside parliament in The Hague, with an estimated 100 participants. The ""gilets jaunes"" protesters are so-called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law. Over the past few weeks, the social media movement has morphed from a protest over fuel prices to a leaderless spectrum of interest groups and differing demands. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Its core aim, to highlight the economic frustration and political distrust of poorer working families, still has widespread support. This video can not be played Gilets Jaunes: Are nationalists infiltrating the ""yellow vests""? An opinion poll on Friday showed a dip in support for the protests, but it still stood at 66%. Meanwhile, President Emmanuel Macron's ratings have fallen to 23% amid the crisis, polls suggest. The government has said it is scrapping the unpopular fuel tax increases in its budget and has frozen electricity and gas prices for 2019. The problem is that protests have erupted over other issues. Granting concessions in some areas may not placate all the protesters, some of whom are calling for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions, easier university requirements and even the resignation of the president.

The shop where it's OK to be different,"Two brothers on the autistic spectrum were looking for work when one had the idea of opening a comic shop. It turned out to be an inspired choice. When Adam Makey told his mother that he wanted to open a comic shop, she laughed out loud. The idea seemed ""ridiculous"", Angela Makey says. She knew he'd been obsessed with comics since childhood. But how would he deal with customers and suppliers and all the other jobs that running a business entails? His Asperger syndrome would be a big hindrance, she thought. On the other hand, it wasn't clear what else Adam would do for a living. He had a degree in philosophy and had learned to live independently, but there didn't seem to be any suitable jobs going. The family had hoped he and his younger brother Guy, also on the autistic spectrum, could find work that matched their strengths: reliability, punctuality and attention to detail. But all available opportunities seemed to involve occasional shift work - and they needed a regular routine. Angela had seen statistics from the National Autistic Society, which said that only about one in six people with autism were in full-time employment. Fewer still had found jobs that matched their abilities. ""We knew the cards were stacked against them,"" she says. So the ""laughable"" comic shop idea began to grow on her. Eventually she used her savings to buy a quaint Tudor shop in Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, and seven years ago Niche Comics was born. Guy (left), Angela and Adam Like many people with autism, Adam and Guy love comics for their world of rich detail and visual expression. For some it helps that the characters' emotions are so clearly signposted. There is also something appealing about the stories they tell. ""Comics became very important to me when my parents told me about my Asperger syndrome diagnosis,"" explains Adam Makey. ""They are a reminder that it's OK to not be like everyone else."" Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the name for a range of conditions, including Asperger syndrome, that affect a person's social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour It can be difficult for people with ASD to find a job - for example, they may find the work environment too noisy, or travelling to work may be too stressful because of the crowds... sudden changes in routine can also be upsetting A report from the National Autistic Society estimates thatonly 16% of autistic adults are in full-time, paid work,external See also:Help and support for people with ASD (NHS),external Adam was seven at the time, and just graduating from an interest in Beano and Dandy to Marvel comic heroes on TV. He's now 30, and comics and their heroes have been part of his life all that time. There's also the escapist fantasy element, says Guy. He pauses to consider something else. The larger-than-life superheroes with a moral mission are appealing. ""Their motivations are easier to understand, their aims and goals are easier to decipher than, say, someone you've met in the street."" Adam says he was drawn particularly to Spiderman. ""It's because of the whole, 'with power comes great responsibility' theme,"" he says. ""He was just a regular person who had powers and wanted to help people."" According to Angela another big factor is that comics are ""not seen as judgmental, there is no age-limit, there isn't any measure of ability"". An adult is just as welcome in the world of comics as a child. Comic fans can also relish building up encyclopaedic knowledge of characters, editions, publishers, authors, illustrators, one-off collaborations - and this is something the brothers are adept at. Interested in comics about Vampires in the horror genre? Adam would humbly suggest American Vampire by Vertigo Comics. ""Originally it was a collaboration between Scott Snyder who does some of the current Batman stuff for DC and Stephen King the famous horror writer,"" he points out. He continues without pausing: ""Vertigo was the home of Hellblazer, which is the home of John Constantine, which is a very popular character, to the point where he got his own TV show for a while and he is still a character on Legends of Tomorrow, the DC TV show. And also they did the Keanu Reeves film, which is very different from the comic. And they do Sandman as well, which is Neil Gaiman's big-name comic."" The brothers relish acting as guides in this universe, introducing customers to new comics. ""The beauty of it is you can hand-pick the comics in your own shop. It's an embarrassment of riches,"" says Guy, 26. ""We have a system of organised chaos."" But the brothers can pinpoint where every comic is and lead customers straight to them. There is some friendly rivalry when it comes to generating sales, and converting newcomers to their favourite genres: for Guy, the classics from the 40s and 50s, featuring Superman and Captain America, for example; for Adam, newer comics like Black Panther and Sandman. In the early days, problems with numeracy and communication - with customers and suppliers - threatened the very existence of the shop. Typically with autism you don't find uniform levels of ability across subject areas, explains Angela, but peaks in some and troughs in others. ""Adam and Guy are both very visual, incredibly interested in literature and plays,"" she says. ""However one of their troughs is mathematics. Letting loose two young adults with autism was quite a risky business."" Customer payments were a big problem. The brothers struggled to enter prices into the till, and then to enter the same total on the card-reader machine. ""Numbers went the wrong way round, or there was a zero missing,"" recalls Angela. To get round this, the shop invested in a till where barcodes, prices and the card-reader machine are all integrated and no numbers are inputted at the point of sale. There were also problems dealing with the companies that provide stock. People with autism need very clear, literal instructions and don't like uncertainty, Angela says. Important information needs to be well sign-posted whereas in everyday conversation, sentences are often left incomplete and thoughts unfinished. A joint email inbox became necessary so Angela could intervene if she saw any confusion creeping in. These days Angela describes her main role in the shop as ""interferer"". Working full-time with an IT Services company outside Huntingdon, she can only devote so much time to her sons' business. She looks after accounts, tax returns and online sales, but they take care of the day-to-day running of the shop. Financially it has always remained in the black, though the brothers only draw a small wage. Of course, the majority of customers who come to the shop are not on the autistic spectrum. But the brothers do get a steady stream of customers who are, both male and female, from young children to pensioners. These people may deliberately seek out the shop because of its reputation for offering a welcoming experience. ""Being on the autistic spectrum ourselves is a big help dealing with neurodiverse people,"" Adam says. Not every customer with autism wants to discuss their condition, but the brothers are good at spotting the signs. ""It's an instinctual thing,"" says Adam. ""Maybe it's the tone of the voice, the motion of a hand,"" says Guy. ""Small details that most people won't pick up on that I might have insight into; rubbing of the fingers, fidgeting, or just a sense of distraction."" The shop has been laid out with these customers in mind. People with autism feel textures, sounds and light very keenly, to the point where they can become overwhelming. ""We make sure there aren't too many distractions and we are aware that people with autism might have very specific interests,"" Adam says. One of the reasons the shop is called Niche is that it has nooks and crannies where customers can retire to read in peace and quiet, away from undesired sensory stimulation. Once the shop had established itself, the brothers also began reaching out to people with autism beyond the shop. Three years ago Adam started giving talks to young people who are learning-disabled. As a result, some teachers realised that graphic novels were a great way to reach out to people on the spectrum. Building on those links, the brothers began to take regular ""referrals"" for work experience from schools and colleges. The idea is people with disabilities can practise for working life in a safe space. This is one way the shop can serve the community, says Angela, providing opportunities that less sympathetic employers would not. ""The hidden disabilities of communication and autism are forgotten or overlooked by many people,"" she says. ""Individuals on the spectrum can be articulate, opinionated, excellent problem solvers, but also incredibly reliable."" In short, excellent employees, if given the right support. Young people on work experience are first set a task in isolation, often sorting out comics at the rear of the shop, which is repetitive and methodical. Eventually they will graduate to working behind the till. ""After a few days,"" says Angela, ""people who were perhaps not communicating at all come outside themselves and start engaging. ""That's the joy, to see the change."" Seven years on, Angela is glad she took the risk of helping her sons create their dream shop. ""It's been an emotional journey and if I'd known what I know now, I would have had to dig deep to go ahead with it,"" she says. ""But it was the right decision. This shop has a soul.""

Snowdonia hill becomes a mountain,"Surveyor Myrddyn Phillips said the popularity of Foel Penolau might increase now it has been upgraded to a mountain Two Welshmen went up a hill, but came down a mountain. That's because Myrddyn Phillips and Aled Williams are surveyors who found a Snowdonia hill was in fact a mountain. While Foel Penolau is over the 2,000ft (609.6m) required to be a mountain, the minimum drop between the col - the lowest point on a ridge between two peaks - and summit was under 98ft. The pair have found that the drop has now increased to 104.6ft, and is therefore a mountain. As a result of the survey, Foel Penolau has been included in the list of Hewitts - hills in England, Wales or Ireland over 2,000ft high which have a minimum drop of 98ft. Antarctic mountain heights re-measured How Greenland would look without its ice sheet Rocket rumbles give volcanic insights Foel Penolau, in the northern Rhinogydd range, was previously classified as a hill because there was just 85ft (26m) of drop from col to summit. This is how Foel Penolau compares to other mountains in the UK and further afield Myrddyn Phillips has been measuring mountains for almost 20 years Col is a French word used universally to refer to the lowest point on a mountain ridge between two peaks. The feature is called a bwlch in Welsh, or a saddle in English. Mr Phillips and Mr Williams suspected the drop at Foel Penolau might have changed because the col is made up of a large boulder field liable to movements. ""It is one of the many ridges I and colleagues measured over many years - it is a fantastic ridge,"" said Mr Phillips, 57, a mountain surveyor andblogger,externalfrom Welshpool. In August,Fan y Big in the Brecon Beacons was downgraded to a hillafter Mr Myrddin measured its col to summit height at 93.5ft. Previously mountain heights were recorded by a process called photogrammetry, which involved flying over and taking measurements of the distance to the land below. The Trimble GeoXH 6000 is far more accurate - and easier - than older methods Mr Phillips explained that the device he uses, a Trimble GeoXH 6000, has a margin of error of just 4in (10cm) compared with 9.8ft (3m) for the older process. But the decision to measure Foel Penolau came from good old-fashioned gut instinct. Drone's film shows Scots climber injured in Himalayas Nepal storm kills climbers on Himalayan peak Gurja Mountain rescue plea after man's Snowdon climb in pants Foel Penolau is in the Rhinogydd range of Snowdonia National Park ""We had an inkling. It is one we have wondered about for a few years but you never know until the results come in,"" he said. ""But everything tied up so nicely and all matched. It is a stunning mountain, and one of the best in Wales in my opinion."" Wales now has 136 Hewitts and it is the first time a Welsh hill has entered the classification due to its drop value since the list was first published in 1992.

'I thought parental leave would be easy',"Andy Shelley says his time on parental leave was ""eye-opening"" Following the release of a poll which suggested 27% of mothers did not enjoy their maternity leave as much as they thought they would, parents have been sharing their experience of parental leave - both good and bad. Many people got in touch followingBBC Radio 5 Live presenter Emma Barnett's open and honest accountof her time away from work looking after her baby son, a time which she described as being ""bloody hard and at times, lonely"". So what's it like to be the one who stays at home and looks after the baby? Three parents share their very different experiences. Andy Shelley's girlfriend gave birth to their daughter in March and the couple decided to takeshared parental leave. Prior to making that choice, Andy's partner had been looking after their daughter while he worked 12-hour days. ""It was difficult because I felt like I wasn't doing enough,"" he says. Thirty-year-old Andy took over full-time care for two months in July, but admits he was not aware just how much work was involved in staying home and looking after his daughter. ""Initially I thought parental leave would be a nice break from work - but it wasn't easy. ""Some days she would be upset and I just didn't know what to do. Your entire day revolves around feeds. It becomes a full-time job in itself. ""I would be happy when my partner came home from work as it meant I could have a break."" The Stoke-On-Trent resident says his experience of parental leave was important as he realised how much his girlfriend had been doing when he thought she was ""just off work"". ""It made me appreciate everything she had done and ultimately cemented my relationship with my daughter. ""It's a shame more fathers don't take parental leave as it really opens your eyes and you realise what your partner has to deal with."" Sandrine Charpentier says she had a ""clear vision"" for her maternity leave and made sure it was a ""wonderful experience"" Sandrine Charpentier, from Hayes in Bromley, says her maternity leave with both of her daughters, who are now aged six and nine, was a ""really positive experience"". Despite not knowing many people where she lived, Sandrine made sure she wasn't isolated by booking a different activity every day. ""We would do baby swimming, yoga, singing and play groups. It motivated me to get dressed and get out of the house. ""The whole time I was really tired but I thought that was just part of the job. ""It was great to meet people, be social and talk about our experiences. I was really happy during that time and it was great for my daughters."" As much as she enjoyed her maternity leave, the mum-of-two admits it was also nice to return to work. ""Being at work was like a holiday because I was free to do what I wanted. I didn't have somebody glued to me all the time. ""It was good to do something different, to meet people and not talk about nappies and babies all the time."" People were shocked when Craig Smith said he was going to be a stay-at-home father Craig Smith, 42, from Staffordshire became a stay-at-home dad to his daughter, Matilda, in January when she was eight months old. His wife has a high-level job so they decided that it would be best for him to give up work and focus on their daughter's early years. ""I was very up for the challenge as I've always wanted children, but I didn't really think about what was involved in being a full-time dad. ""Sometimes it's hard because all Matilda wants is her mum."" Craig says his experience made him realise there is not enough support for stay-at-home dads. ""I tried to integrate with local playgroups, but the mums can be quite cliquey and it's very difficult for a dad to be accepted. ""A lot of mum-and-baby groups say fathers are welcome but in reality it's not like that - the mums can be quite cold."" Craig is planning on going back to work part-time when Matilda starts nursery, but says he feels anxious at the prospect of returning to normality. ""It feels like my brain has been conditioned to sing to Peppa Pig or nursery rhymes. The thought of carrying out serious and responsible tasks within a role kind of scares me.""

Should we stop listening to these Christmas songs?,"Ricardo Montalban and Esther Williams sang Baby, It's Cold Outside in the 1949 film Neptune's Daughter Baby, It's Cold Outside is one of those Christmas songs that's about as traditional as mince pies. Butan American radio station's decision to pull it from playlistsbecause it's seen as unsuitable in the #MeToo era has reignited a debate about the song, and raised questions about other potentially questionable Christmas classics. Baby, It's Cold Outside found a wide audience as a duet between Ricardo Montalban and Esther Williams in the 1949 film Neptune's Daughter, and in recent years has been covered by the likes of Lady Gaga and Michael BublÃ©. Critics of the song see it as the story of a man pressuring a woman into spending the night when she doesn't want to. In particular, the line ""Say what's in this drink?/No cabs to be had out there"" has led people to make a link with date rape. Glenn Anderson, a DJ on Star 102, said the lyrics now felt ""manipulative and wrong"", and that it has no place in a world where people are ""extra sensitive"". However, a former English teacher wrote a feminist defence of the song ina viral Tumblr post,external, suggesting the woman ""is excusing her uncharacteristically bold behaviour (either to the guy or to herself) by blaming it on the drink"". ""It is not a joke about how she's drunk and about to be raped,"" the blog's author wrote. ""It's a joke about how she's perfectly sober and about to have awesome consensual sex and use the drink for plausible deniability because she's living in a society where women aren't supposed to have sexual agency.""

Lee Thompson, a music consultant who has worked in radio and TV for more than 30 years, thinks debates over such songs have grown in recent years. ""In all of my time working at radio stations, I've never had anyone come to me and say 'we shouldn't play a song',"" he says. ""It only seems to be in the last few years that the sensitivity around particular songs are magnified. I think social media is responsible for magnifying these arguments nowadays. ""Some people think, 'since this is my interpretation of the song, therefore everyone else needs to think its the correct interpretation of the song'."" Baby, It's Cold Outside isn't the only seasonal song that some people find problematic. The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl first had a hit with the song in 1987 In 2007, BBC Radio 1 edited out the words ""faggot"" and ""slut"" from The Pogues' Fairytale of New York to avoid offence. But later that evening, the station changed its mind after criticism from listeners. Justin Myers, a columnist for GQ Magazine,wrote on his blog,externalin November how allowing the song to be played on radio uncensored ""legitimises"" the slur and ""burdens"" the LGBT+ community. ""The word still has power, sharp cruel fangs, and is still used to demean and destroy lives of young people up and down the UK,"" he said. The song is heading back into the UK top 40 this week, however, as it has done for the past 13 Decembers, since downloading and streaming made it easier for old tunes to resurface. Magic Radio - which has devoted itself to Christmas songs for the month of December - has said it will keep playing both Baby, It's Cold Outside and Fairytale of New York this year. A spokeswoman for BBC Radio declined to say whether its stations would play the tunes. The BBC doesn't ban songs, she said - but ""tracks are chosen on musical merit and their relevance to our audience on a case-by-case basis"". Bob Geldof gave critics of the lyrics characteristically short shrift Despite being written to raise funds to combat famine in Ethiopia, the 1984 song doesn't refer to the country at all but rather the entire continent, leading to accusations that it fuels the tired trope that everywhere in Africa is the same, rather than a place filled with distinct countries, each with their own unique culture. ""There exists a paternalistic way of thinking about Africa, likely exacerbated by the original (and the second, and the third) Band Aid singles, in which it must be 'saved', and usually from itself. We say 'Africa' in a way that we would never say 'Europe', or 'Asia',"" wrote Bim Adewunmi inThe Guardian in 2014,external. She also pointed out that the lyrics reflected a ""popular narrative"" that those in the West were the ""benevolent elders, helping out poor Africans, mouths always needy and yawning"". Co-writerBob Geldof gave the critics short shrift,external, saying: ""It's a pop song, it's not a doctoral thesis."" The original record raised Â£8m for famine relief by selling 3.8 million copies, making it the second biggest-selling single in UK chart history. Before you tweet ""PC gone mad!"" in all caps, read the following information first. In 2017, Professor Kyna Hamill of Boston University published aresearch paper,externaloutlining the racist origins of the beloved Christmas ditty. Her peer-reviewed paper found that the song was originally performed in blackface in a minstrel show as One Horse Open Sleigh in Boston in September 1857. The song was written by James Pierpont, who was desperate for work after failing at other professional ventures, and Prof Hamill's research suggests he ""capitalised on minstrel music"" and used making fun of black people in the snow as a ""'safe' ground"" for his show. Prof Hamill has said itwasn't her intention,externalto stop your kids from singing this particular tune, however.

Missing mosaic pieces returned to Turkey,"The missing pieces were smuggled out of Turkey in the 1960s Missing fragments of an ancient mosaic known as the Gypsy Girl have been put on display in a museum in Turkey after being returned from the United States. The fragments are being displayed next to the incomplete, almost 2,000-year-old mosaic of a young girl. Her haunting eyes have become a symbol of the southern city of Gaziantep. The missing pieces were smuggled out of Turkey in the 1960s and bought by a US university, which finally agreed to give them back. The Gypsy Girl mosaic was excavated in 1998 Archaeologists discovered the mosaic 20 years ago while excavating the remains of the city of Zeugma, founded by a general of Alexander the Great and destroyed in the 3rd Century. However, several pieces had already been looted and smuggled out of the country. Satanic statue installed at US statehouse Rare white reindeer spotted in Norway Afghanistan's 'Little Messi' flees home They had been bought by Bowling Green State University in Ohio. In 2012 Turkey asked for their return, which was finally agreed after five years of talks. On Saturday the missing pieces were exhibited in Gaziantep's Zeugma Mosaic Museum.

Police restrictions for UKIP march in London,"The UKIP-organised ""Brexit Betrayal"" march started after midday Thousands of people have taken to the streets in London to march in a UKIP-organised rally and a counter-protest march. A UKIP spokesman said ""quite a few thousand"" supporters turned up to their ""Brexit Betrayal"" march alongside controversial activist Tommy Robinson. Marching in opposition were anti-fascist groups and Labour-backed campaigners. A spokeswoman said 15,000 turned up to oppose Mr Robinson's rally. Laura Parker of Labour grassroots group Momentum claimed their counter-demonstration ""vastly"" outnumbered UKIP's ""nearly five to one"". She said: ""Even with the UKIP machine in tow, he [Robinson] only managed to bring a few thousand supporters out on the streets while we mobilised nearly 15,000 to march against his racism and bigotry."" Police have not provided an estimate of crowd sizes. By Richard Galpin Despite fears there could be clashes between the pro and anti-Brexiteers today, the marches which streamed through the streets of central London passed off peacefully. Thousands of people took part on both sides of the divide, making their feelings known ahead of the key vote in parliament due to take place on Tuesday. Those marching under the UKIP banner called for Theresa May's Brexit deal to be dumped. One demonstrator carried an effigy of the prime minister describing her as a traitor, while another held a model scaffold and hangman's noose. Later in a rally close to parliament and Downing Street, the UKIP leader Gerrard Batten said it had been an achievement to get the far-right activist Tommy Robinson involved in the demonstration. Mr Robinson who denies claims he is a racist and fascist, joined the front of the march saying it was ""a beautiful day.""
