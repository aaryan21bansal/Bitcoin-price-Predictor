Chimps for saleThe shocking global trade in our closest relatives," A secret network of wildlife traffickers selling baby chimpanzees has been exposed by a year-long BBC News investigation. The tiny animals are seized from the wild and sold as pets. The BBC’s research uncovered a notorious West African hub for wildlife trafficking, known as the “blue room”, and led to the rescue of a one-year-old chimp. In a dusty back street of Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s largest city, a tiny chimpanzee cries out for comfort. His black hair is ruffled and his dirty nappy scrapes the concrete floor as he crawls towards the familiar figures of the men who have been holding him captive. The baby chimp, ripped away from his family in the wild, is the victim of a lucrative and brutal smuggling operation, exposed by a 12-month-long BBC News investigation spanning half a dozen countries. In demand as pets in wealthy homes or as performers in commercial zoos, baby chimpanzees command a price tag of $12,500, a little under £10,000, but sometimes more. Each capture of a live infant like this one exacts a terrible cost on chimp populations. The usual tactic used by poachers is to shoot as many of the adults in a family as possible. This prevents them from resisting the capture of the baby and their bodies can then be sold as bushmeat. To obtain one infant alive, up to 10 adults are typically slaughtered. “One has to kill the mother, one has to kill the father,” explained Colonel Assoumou Assoumou, an expert in wildlife crime with Ivory Coast Police. “If our ancestors had killed them, nowadays we wouldn't even know about chimpanzees.” Once captured, these baby chimps then enter a sophisticated chain that stretches from the poachers in the jungles to middlemen, who arrange false export permits and transport, and ultimately to the buyers. The animals are in high demand in the Gulf states, south-east Asia and China, with buyers prepared to pay high prices and additional fees to help bypass international controls. And while they may be well looked-after while they are young, chimpanzees soon become too strong and potentially violent to be kept in a home. Karl Ammann, a Swiss wildlife activist who campaigns against chimp trafficking, describes it as a “kind of slavery” and warns that when chimps cease being cute infants, they face a terrible fate. “They still have 90% of their life ahead of them,” he said. “They get locked in some cage and maybe even killed in some cases because they have outlived their useful pet stage. That for me is just impossible to accept.” The baby chimp discovered by the BBC had been bought from a poacher, according to one account, for 300 Euros (£257). But it was rescued en route as a result of our research - leading Interpol officials and Ivorian detectives to expose a major trafficking ring. After months of work building relationships with dealers across a number of countries, our team tracked down the smuggling ringleaders to a house in Abidjan. Posing as prospective buyers, undercover reporters confirmed the infant chimp was at the property before alerting Interpol and local police who were waiting nearby. During the police operation, a small room about the size of a shower cubicle was discovered, decorated with small blue tiles. Inside it, they found a tiny chimp cowering in a wooden crate. The discovery was not only a moment of liberation for the little animal, but also a crucial turning point in a long search by wildlife campaigners to track down a notorious “blue room”, known to be used as a holding pen by traffickers and constantly restocked. For years, when dealers had circulated videos showing captive baby chimpanzees ready for sale, the same distinctive blue tiles were visible. Understood to be in West Africa, no-one knew which country it might be in, let alone which city, until our research led police to it. This revelation provides new insight into the potential scale of loss suffered by great apes, including chimpanzees. An estimated 3,000great apes, including orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees, are lost from the wild every yearas a result of illegal trade, according to the UN Environment Programme. They are either sold, killed during the hunt or die in captivity. About two thirds of the apes lost are chimpanzees - an endangered species. Western chimpanzees, like the one freed in Abidjan, are judged to be especially vulnerable, so are categorised as critically endangered. There are no more than 65,000 left and probably far fewer. Some1,800 apes were seized by authorities in 23 countries while being traffickedbetween 2005 and 2011, according to the Great Ape Survival Partnership, an alliance of more than 100 governments and other organisations. A quarter of those apes rescued were chimps. Although it is unknown how many smuggled apes reach their destinations undetected, the BBC’s investigation suggests the total is almost certain to be higher than previously thought. The illegal trade in great apes is made possible by the determination of the smugglers and the ease with which international laws on buying and selling endangered species can be evaded. Trading of endangered wild animals and plants is tightly controlled under the Cites agreement - theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora- which aims to protect all wildlife under threat. Under the convention, chimpanzees, which are awarded the highest level of protection (a listing under what is known as Appendix 1), can only be exported under a very limited number of exemptions. For example, the animals need to have been bred in captivity (which is not known to happen in West Africa) and exporting and importing organisations need to be registered with Cites. Despite this, the BBC’s investigation revealed that with the right money and the right connections the smuggling networks can evade these controls. In fact, our team was able to buy two permits to export chimps for $4,000 each. Posing as buyers for a client in Thailand, the team obtained their first permit in the Egyptian capital Cairo, which has long been known as a centre for animal trafficking. Our undercover reporter began negotiations over a secure messaging service with two pet traders, Mahmoud Khaled and Ramadan Abdelnaiem. The pair shared videos of infant chimps held inside the infamous blue-tiled room and offered to secure Cites permits allowing the animals to be exported. Khaled even promised to provide video footage of the chimp’s progress en route to its destination. “When [the] thing is shipped and put in boxes, you will receive a video,” he said. “When it goes to the airport, you receive a video, when it lands at the airport, you will receive a video. [When] it is shipped, you will receive a video. When it is put in the airplane, you receive a video...” While Khaled offered to obtain a Cites Appendix 1 permit, enabling the export of chimps, Ramadan suggested an alternative technique: getting permits for less endangered animals and then hiding the chimps among them. Both these methods are recognised by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime as “wildlife laundering”, when smugglers use fraudulent paperwork or mix protected species with legal shipments of wildlife. A video sent to the BBC’s undercover team by a dealer in West Africa shows how chimps and other endangered animals are smuggled in secret compartments in specially-designed crates. Here, this baby chimpanzee was hidden below animals including parrots, civet cats and mongoose which have less protection in international law. The shipment was made from West Africa and destined for Nepal. The chimp shown in this video, however, never made it. Messages found on the dealer’s mobile phone revealed that the chimpanzee had died, still hidden in the crate in transit at Istanbul airport. The BBC undercover team accepted Khaled’s offer and picked up the Appendix 1 permit two weeks later. Clumsily filled-in, with spelling mistakes and other inaccuracies, it appeared to be signed and stamped by a Jordanian government official. It showed our fake address and a simple internet search would have revealed it was not a Cites-registered institution. The next step was to see if we could arrange to buy the chimps, but at this point Khaled, called the deal off, afraid of being exposed. With the Egyptian deal fallen through, the team decided to deal directly with the source of the chimpanzees in West Africa. This time pretending to be an Indonesian pet shop acting for wealthy clients, our team made contact with a young dealer in Guinea called Ibrahima Traore. Again communicating over a secure messaging service, the team built up a relationship with Traore, aged just 22, who began to send us videos of chimpanzees -  once more in the setting of the blue room. It became clear that the room was being constantly re-stocked. Traore said he could sell us one or two baby chimps as well as a Cites permit. This time, the document the BBC team received looked genuine, though it was falsely filled in, and was signed and stamped by the national parks of Liberia. As the relationship with Traore developed, he began to reveal the scale of his illegal operation. He said he held chimpanzees at farms in Guinea, his home country, as well as in Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ivory Coast. In a conversation filmed secretly, Traore boasted of being able to circumvent international controls and having “someone important on the inside”. “I’m not afraid - you can import everywhere you want - send everywhere you want,” he said. Traore also told of how he shipped chimpanzees without any Cites documentation at all - by hiding them amongst other less-protected animals. One of his videos demonstrated how to smuggle chimps in secret compartments. Confronted with the BBC’s evidence, the secretary-general of Cites, John Scanlon, said that while he wasn’t shocked by the ease with which fraudulent permits for the export of baby chimps were purchased, he was “dismayed”. Although he believed the permit system was “sound and secure” overall, he said there were instances, particularly in West and Central Africa, where there was “an abuse of permits”. “There is corruption in the system,” he told the BBC. “We’ve brought it to the attention of our governments at a standing committee meeting several months ago. We said if we can’t get a handle on corruption, we are not going to stop illegal trade in wildlife.” For this reason, Cites was pushing to introduce an electronic system of permissions that would be harder to fake, he explained. “These things are not easy, but we are onto it, we are seeing it and we are doing our best.” But, despite this, Mr Scanlon said he did not believe there was a surge in the illegal trade in great apes, including chimpanzees. “If we did, I can assure you there would be a rush of attention to this issue and a rush of resources to stop it, but we are not seeing it,” he said. He stressed that wherever the abuse of permits was observed, the governments of those countries implicated were warned and punished. There were about 30 trade suspensions currently in place, he confirmed. Law enforcement efforts, however, appear to lag far behind the rates of illegal trade. Just 27 arrests were made in Africa and Asia in connection with the great ape trade between 2005 and 2011, and one-quarter of the arrests never led to prosecutions prosecuted, according to the UN Environment Programme. At Interpol, which facilitates international law enforcement cooperation, wildlife smuggling is a priority, but national governments have stipulated that the funding and investigative effort should be focused on the highest-profile threats, such as the slaughter of elephants and rhinos. David Higgins, manager of Interpol’s Environmental Security Unit, admitted the region of West Africa had not been a priority - and nor had the smuggling of great apes. Because such crimes did not threaten the economic well-being of a country, or its political stability, they did not compel governments to respond, he said, and the resources were simply not there. “Without the funding, we can’t do anything,” he said. “So with primates, unfortunately, our information is not as strong as it could be.” He urged states to step up and offer the required financial investment. “Yes, we need the global community’s attention on this and we call upon that level of support.” Back in Ivory Coast, it was the trafficking ringleader, Ibrahima Traore, who eventually led our reporters - and Interpol - to the blue room. He sent a video of the baby chimp and himself inside the room holding a piece of paper showing the date at the time of the deal - to show that the footage was genuine and that the animal had previously been captured and was ready for sale. His face was clearly visible and he seemed not to worry about incriminating himself. Days later our undercover reporter visited the property - purportedly to discuss arrangements for buying the chimpanzee - where they confirmed its presence and tipped off police. Ibrahima Traore was arrested and, along with his uncle Mohamed, is facing charges related to wildlife trafficking. The data captured from his phones and laptops revealed a goldmine of information about a sprawling international network of great ape traffickers, working across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Cites certificates found on Traore’s computer documented the possible illegal movement of dozens of different species of primates, as well as other endangered species. The evidence also implicated Traore’s brother, Aboubacar, who was named in a Cites document last year because of his smuggling of endangered birds including African grey parrots. Ibrahima Traore’s father, Alhassane, also appeared to be involved. Records showed his bank account in Guinea’s capital Conakry was used to deposit payments – and it was that account that the BBC team was told to use. The detective in charge in Ivory Coast, Colonel Assoumou Assoumou, pledged to delve into the entire illegal supply chain - from the hunters to the traffickers to the buyers. “In 10 years, in 20 years, we won’t have any more chimpanzees,” he warned. “This species will disappear. That’s the reason why this cause was taken up by Interpol. Personally I am committed to fight against this phenomenon. “These are rare species and it should not be us, in our generation, that wipes them out.” As for the baby male chimp discovered in the blue room, he was initially taken to the Interpol building in Abidjan, before being handed over to wildlife officials from the Ministry of Water and Forests. They took him to the zoo in Abidjan, where he was fed and comforted and given a name by keepers: Nemley junior. He was then shown an older female who acts as an adoptive mother to two other infant chimps. After being gradually introduced to this new family, Nemley junior may live with them. But caring for an infant chimp is a long-term and costly commitment so two wildlife organisations with experience of infant chimpanzees have offered him homes in specialists sanctuaries, including the Born Free Foundation. Will Travers, president of Born Free, described the exotic pet trade as “sickening and cruel” and promised to help relocate the baby chimp. “If given the opportunity, we will do all we can, with the help of our specialists and the full participation of the local government agencies, to try and relocate Nemley junior to a registered chimpanzee sanctuary, where this little victim of the illegal wildlife trade can be given a life worth living, in the company of other chimps, for the rest of his life.” But whatever happens next, the orphan has certainly been left traumatised, according to Dr Cleve Hicks of the University of Warsaw, a specialist in chimp behaviour who set up a chimp sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo. “Mainly they have a broken heart - they’ve seen their mothers die,” he said. Dan Bucknall, of the wildlife charity Tusk, agreed that recovery could be “very difficult with such clever sentient animals” but added that chimpanzees were resilient creatures. “In the right hands, with good carers, and with constant attention, they can do OK and the prospects are good.”"

Top-flight spending nears January record,"Mamadou Sakho, Craig Gordon, Asmir Begovic and Phil Jagielka have all been linked with deadline-day moves Premier League spending in the January transfer window could reach a record level on deadline day on Tuesday. Top-flight clubs have already paid out over Â£150m and a final flurry of activity could see the total spend pass the Â£225m mark of January 2011. Players may be leaving rather than joining the top sides, with Chelsea keeper Asmir Begovic and Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho perhaps moving. The transfer window closes at 23:00 GMT in England and midnight in Scotland. You can follow all the deals and Tuesday's seven Premier League fixtures across the BBC on TV, radio, online, the BBC Sport app and social media. The latest transfer gossip Track every Premier League transfer, day by day Lawro's midweek predictions v England cricketer Moeen Ali BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty January's transfer window is traditionally less hectic and with less quality on offer than August - but that does not mean Tuesday will be calm rather than chaotic. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp will be low key on incomings but one of the biggest deals of the day may yet be an Anfield outgoing, with Liverpool still hoping to secure nearly Â£20m for outcast France defender Sakho. The 26-year-old has drawn interest from Premier League rivals Southampton, Spanish side Sevilla and Turkish club Galatasaray - but word from inside Anfield is that this one could go down to the wire. This video can not be played Transfer deadline day: Was 31 January 2011 the best ever? Chelsea may see some departures as the day progresses, with Bosnia goalkeeper Begovic the subject of a Â£12m bid from fellow Premier League side Bournemouth and veteran defender Branislav Ivanovic wanted by Russian club Zenit St Petersburg. Begovic's departure will depend on the league leaders signing a replacement, so will they further pursue their interest inCraig Gordon from Scottish champions Celtic? Southampton may be consolidated in the Premier League and in the EFL Cup final against Manchester United, but manager Claude Puel is in the market for attacking reinforcements with Napoli's Manolo Gabbiadini in his sights. Gabbiadini was a target for Everton last summer only for a deal to fall down. His recent form does not inspire confidence, but theSaints have agreed a fee of about Â£14m for the player,who is set to have a medical on Tuesday. Down at the bottom of the table, Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce says he has been trying to sign between 20 and 30 players - and could David Moyes be tempted to test Everton boss Ronald Koeman's resolve to keep his former captain Phil Jagielka at Goodison Park? Koeman is a firm admirer of Burnley's fine young defender Michael Keane but faces a tough task prising him out of Turf Moor by close of play on Tuesday. This is one that might have to wait until the summer. West Ham United are in the mood to spend some of the Â£25m they reluctantly accepted fromMarseille for Dimitri Payet- so expect them to head in the direction of Brentford for Â£15m-rated striker Scott Hogan. The race for promotion from the Championship may also spark some high-profile deals. Newcastle United would like Everton's James McCarthy, but a Â£20m price tag and reluctance to sell makes that a tough deal for Magpies boss Rafael Benitez. Will Benitez also pursue a return to St James' Park for winger Andros Townsend, such a success on Tyneside last season but seemingly not to Allardyce's liking at Selhurst Park? Goals will make a difference in that division, so someone may be tempted to overlook Ross McCormack's attitude - so heavily criticised by Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce - and take a chance on his goalscoring. And if Bruce can sell McCormack, it would be no surprise to see him direct some of the cash towards Middlesbrough's out-of-favour Scotland international Jordan Rhodes. The names may not be A-List - but there are still potentially plenty of big deals to provide the usual ration of deadline day excitement.

Everton have spent the most by a Premier League club on a single player, paying Manchester United Â£24m forFrance midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin. But that fee is dwarfed by the Â£60m paid to Chelsea by Chinese Super League side Shanghai SIPG forBrazil attacking midfielder Oscar. At the other end of the financial scale - and in one of the most unlikely moves of this or any other transfer window - Arsenal recruited left-backCohen Bramallfrom non-league Hednesford Town for Â£40,000. The 22-year-old was a part-time footballer who had just been made redundant from his job in a car factory before he had his trial with the Gunners. As it stands, that is the only cash paid out by the Premier League's top six, with spending mainly being done by teams trying to stay in the top flight - a trend that is likely to continue on Tuesday. Crystal Palace stumped up Â£12m for Leicester City left-sided utility man Jeffrey Schlupp and another Â£14m forSunderland defender Patrick van Aanholt. Swansea recruited defender Martin Olsson and midfielder Tom Carroll for a combined Â£8.5m. Sunderland, the Premier League's bottom club, recruitedEverton pair Darron Gibson and Bryan Oviedo on Monday,while second-bottom Hull have sold midfielders Jake Livermore and Robert Snodgrass to West Brom and West Ham respectively for a total in excess of Â£20m. For the Hammers, the money spent on Snodgrass was less than half of the fee received for Payet, the France playmaker who refused to play in order to force a return to Marseille.

West Ham players 'wanted Payet out',"West Ham's players wanted Dimitri Payet out of the club prior to his move back to Marseille, says the club's joint-chairman David Sullivan. France forward Payet, 29, rejoined theLigue 1 club on Sunday for Â£25m,after allegedly refusing to play for the Hammers for the past month. ""As much as we didn't want him out, you can't go against the consensus of the team,"" Sullivan told BBC Radio 5 live. Sullivan went on to reveal that Payet sacrificed his wages for January. Listen: 'Payet didn't speak to anybody for six weeks' ""He's not been talking to anyone in the squad,"" said Sullivan of Payet, who joined West Ham in June 2015. ""He's been sitting in the corner of the room for his meals and he's isolated himself. Before that he was bubbly, happy, shaking everyone's hand before the match. ""Either it was a tactic or something in his head had changed. ""The team wanted him out, the manager - with great reluctance - wanted him out. We think it's bonded the team better together."" Dimitri Payet was far less influential for West Ham this season West Ham paid Marseille Â£10.7m for the attacking midfielder in 2015 and he signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract in February 2016. He excelled in his first season in the Premier League, scoring 12 goals and earning a nomination for the PFA Players' Player of the Year award. However, Payet scored only three goals from September to December last year, and manager Slaven Bilic said earlier this month thathe did not want to play for the club any more. ""You could make him sit in the reserves for six months, and cost you another two or three million pounds in wages, and we thought about it because what we got out of Marseille wasn't our valuation of the player,"" said Sullivan, who rejected two initial bids for Payet. ""The player's surrendered his January wages, so there's a bit of dignity we got with that. ""You've got to take a sensible view - the offer was just about what we could accept. I can't say I'm pleased with it. It's a damage limitation deal."" Podcast: Payet move discussed on European Football Show After re-signing for Marseille, where he had previously spent two years, Payet said it was a ""personal choice"" to return and he needed to go ""back to his roots"". Sullivan added: ""We tried to talk him round but we accepted we weren't going to be able to. We offered free flights home, help for his wife, everything we could possibly do - but he wanted to go back to Marseille. ""On his day he's an outstanding player. I feel very sad he's no longer a West Ham player.""

Is squatting art?,"The squatters have turned the house into a homeless hostel I've been thinking a lot about ANAL today. That is the Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians who are currently squatting in a whopping five-story house in Eaton Square, an upmarket part of London near Buckingham Palace. According to the Guardian, the ""1,329 square metre property has polished parquet floors, tasteful uplighting and a grand spiral staircase"" and is owned by a wealthy Russian man (media shorthand: an oligarch) called Andrey Goncharenko. He is not in residence, but apparently has representatives seeking a possession order at a hearing scheduled for tomorrow so he can (presumably) get on with adding the gym etc. for which he has sought planning permission. Meanwhile, Anal argue that London is full of unoccupied buildings such as 102 Eaton Square, and that's daft when there's a palpable need for housing in the city. So, they have put into place their own plans by turning Mr Goncharenko's house into a homeless shelter with a projector for movie nights. Emin was among many artists who lived in squats I'm not going to get embroiled in the rights or wrongs on either side of this coming together of world views, but I will admit I'm interested in Anal. Its members are doing something I feel I've rather missed out on. I have never lived in a squat, although I have lived in places that thought they were squats, like a flat in Swiss Cottage, which was so rank that when a friend from New York came to stay he actually chose to sleep in his rental car. Nevertheless, I paid to live there, entered through the front door, and stored my belongings, consisting of a record collection that slowly warped in the damp. But it was legit, and therefore not cutting edge 1980s cool. The mansion in Eaton Square, Belgravia, was entered through an open window Back then, hipsters didn't live in smart apartments in Hoxton or gentrified high rises in Stoke Newington. They lived in squats. Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Jeremy Deller - they all lived in squats. It's what you did if you were an artist, which I wasn't. But maybe Anal are: although to my knowledge they are not proclaiming to be - but that doesn't matter anymore. When the architectural and design collective Assemble were shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 2015, it marked an important moment in the history of art. Not one of the members of the ensemble of 20-something architect-activists considered him or herself to be an artist; without asking or knowing, they were anointed to be such by the art world. Assemble won the Turner Prize for their work in Liverpool's Cairns Street No matter that Assemble members were handier with a slide-rule than a paintbrush, they won the Turner Prize anyway. And it was for a project that wasn't wildly dissimilar in conception to Anal's Eaton Square squat. They were working with local residents in the Toxteth area of Liverpool on a direct-action project to regenerate the run-down Granby Four Streets area, with ""the intention of bringing empty homes back into use"". There's a long history in art of political protest in the form of direct action. Dadaists, Surrealists and Situationists all sought to break down the barriers between art and life through protest, action and undermining the establishment. Property was often their conduit, as it has been more recently for street artists and performance artists such as Petr Pavlensky, who, when he's not nailing his scrotum to Red Square or sewing his lips together, makes his political point via interventions - including setting light to the front door of the FSB building in Moscow. Is there a huge difference between any of them and Anal? I don't think so. Will they be shortlisted for the 2017 Turner Prize in Hull? I doubt it. But it's not impossible. And if they were I assume they'd set up a squat as their entry (Assemble created an Arts & Crafts shop for its exhibit), which would be in the richly refurbished Ferens Art Gallery: An intervention I suspect its eponymous founder, the campaigning Thomas Ferens, would wholeheartedly support.

Will Trump's ban affect IS fight?,"President Trump's order will be read as proof that the US government is anti-Muslim Yes, in a word. There is no scientific way of accurately measuring how many people will be so incensed by President Trump's executive order on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries that they feel compelled to carry out a violent act against a US or Western target. Perhaps dozens, perhaps none. There is also no scientific way of measuring how many potential violent extremists have now been shut out of the US because of the order. But one thing is clear: in the ever-shifting ideological battle to win hearts and minds, this is one-nil to the extremists of so-called Islamic State (IS). Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, whose country is currently helping Iraqi forces drive out IS, said the US move would ""be recorded in history as a great gift to extremists and their supporters"". He added that it ""only serves to provide a fertile ground for more terrorist recruitment by deepening the ruptures and fault-lines which have been exploited by extremist demagogues"". In Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, a foreign ministry spokesman said it deeply regretted the move ""because we believe it would affect the global fight against terrorismâ¦ It is wrong to link radicalism and terrorism with one particular religion"". Even America's closest ally, Britain, has been critical. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnsontweeted that in his personal view the move ""is divisive, discriminatory and wrong"",external. US travel ban: Why these seven countries? First 100 days: What executive actions has Trump taken? What if Trump tries to bring back torture? One million sign Stop Trump petition Behind the scenes, where the ideological battle against violent extremism is fought in internet chatrooms, over anti-terrorist hotlines, and with tip-offs from the public, one effect of the immigration order will be to, at least temporarily, inhibit co-operation between the US and the very countries whose help it needs in fighting Islamic extremism. Iraq, whose forces have undergone an extensive retraining programme with help from US advisers, has been quick to retaliate by imposing similar restrictions on US visitors. Many Americans have joined protests to show their opposition to the divisive policy At street level, anything that portrays the US government as being anti-Muslim - and that is exactly how this is going down in much of the Middle East - makes it harder to fight the narrative of IS and other extremists. Largely obscured by the tumult and confusion over President Trump's Executive Order is one simple, compelling fact: the people whose actions bear the original blame for much of the mistrust and negative stereotyping of Muslims, on both sides of the Atlantic, are not the mainstream Muslim populations themselves. It is the extremists from al-Qaeda, IS, al-Shabab and other affiliate groups who have waged violent jihad in the name of their common religion. Through their actions, these extremists are looking to separate Muslims from non-Muslims and to create a gulf between them. They crave a return to a time when much of the inhabited world was divided into Dar al-Islam (lands inhabited and ruled by Muslims according to Sharia, Islamic law) and Dar al-Harb (literally ""the House of War"", meaning all the other lands). Anything that helps polarise the world's populations further down this path of segregation and an ""us and them"" mentality is welcomed by the extremists. When refugees surged out of Syria and headed west towards Europe instead of into the self-styled IS caliphate centred on Raqqa, IS's leadership was baffled and angry, viewing this as treachery. The executive order on immigration now risks playing into their hands. As IS finds itself ruling an ever-shrinking area of territory in the Middle East, it can be counted on to take maximum advantage of this latest development to recruit new followers and urge existing ones to carry out attacks. Some of those may already be living inside the United States.

Paul Moss: The Irish model - how low should taxes go?,"Facebook, which has a slogan-festooned office in Dublin, admits Ireland's low tax regime is attractive - but says it's not the only draw As the UK government hints it could slash tax rates for foreign businesses after Brexit, Paul Moss looks at how the low corporate tax model is working in neighbouring Ireland. There is something rather cult-like about the Facebook office in Dublin. Everyone smiles, everyone seems genuinely delighted to be working for one of the biggest tech firms in the world. Then there are the primary colours everywhere, the games provided for staff to play, from chess to ping-pong. But what most catches your eye are the posters, exhorting staff to improve their performance with slogans like ""Proceed and Be Bold,"" and even ""Move Fast and Break Things"". I resisted the temptation to kick over one of the vases in reception, or perhaps hurl a fire extinguisher through the window. Facebook creates 200 more jobs in Dublin UK 'won't lie down' over Brexit trade May: UK will lead world on free trade Instead, I proceeded, as planned, to interview the man who runs this office, about why Facebook had chosen Ireland for its international headquarters. I wanted to ask about the importance of one specific attraction: that companies in Ireland do not have to pay much in the way of tax. ""It is a significant part of our reason for coming here,"" Gareth Lambe acknowledges. He is dressed casually, as you might expect of the boss in charge of a major tech company - jeans, v-neck jumper, not a suit or tie in sight. ""The 12.5% corporation tax, which is lower than a lot of other jurisdictions... we've had that for a long time now. It's been very helpful having that kind of certainty here."" Mr Lambe is at pains to emphasise that low tax was certainly not Ireland's only appeal. This is an English-speaking country, with a highly educated workforce, and low costs. And he also wants me to know how much Facebook contributes to Ireland aside from tax, the 1,600 jobs, and the knock-on wealth these in turn create. ""Restaurants, rents paid, cinemas... these multinationals in Ireland actually generate a hell of a lot of economic activity."" And yet, most of these same multinationals were remarkably unwilling to talk to me about their presence in Ireland. Getting businesses to talk is not usually such a problem, but when I said I wanted to mention the subject of tax, various organisations which represent the commercial world here said it might be impossible to find any companies which would be interviewed. Economist Tom Healy says that now other countries have introduced aggressive tax cuts, Ireland is struggling to compete In the event, Facebook was the only one which came forward. Part of the problem, I was told, is the sticky topic of tax avoidance. Companies stand accused of banking their profits in Ireland, where the tax rate is low, even though their operations are really based elsewhere. Yet the economist Tom Healy believes there may be another reason why CEOs seem to have developed a new-found shyness when it comes to the subject of Ireland's tax rate. The fact is, as he puts it: ""The party is over."" Mr Healy is director of the left-leaning Nevin Institute for Economic Research, and his argument is a simple one: that Ireland had a competitive advantage when it was the only developed nation cutting corporation tax so low, allowing it to lure companies away from other countries. Now, however, many of those other countries have decided to play the same game. ""A number of East European countries, one or two of the Baltic states, have gone down the road of aggressive tax cuts. And you've really reached the point where it's impossible for a developed economy like Ireland to compete with that sort of policy."" Phillip Hammond and Theresa May have hinted that the UK could use corporate tax cuts to draw business away from the EU However, East European countries are not though the only ones engaged in this corporate tax-cutting competition. The United Kingdom under its current Conservative government has already lowered the rate from 28% to 20%, and it is set to drop further, to 17% by 2020. But more than that, the Prime Minister Theresa May and her Chancellor of the Exchequer, Phillip Hammond, have dropped heavy hints that further cuts could be on the way. Indeed, this has been an implicit threat to other European Union states: that if they do not offer Britain an agreeable deal on trade, post-Brexit, Britain might use corporate tax cuts to draw business away from the EU, turning the UK into what one commentator described as ""Singapore on the Thames"". ""Don't do it,"" says Tom Healy, with a certainty that belies his otherwise cautious manner. His fear is that the UK will become part of an international race to the bottom on corporate tax, with countries eventually demanding so little from business that they will no longer be able to fund public services. ""Tax is a factor, but the best way to bring in investment,"" he believes, ""is to develop infrastructure, skills and innovation."" The UK Treasury insists that its corporate tax-cutting approach has so far worked, encouraging investment and enterprise, and thus creating jobs. Questioned about this recently, Mr Hammond said ""By being globally competitive, that's how we protect the living standards and the jobs of our people."" Dublin City Councillor Michael O'Brien refuses to buy the idea that a lower corporate tax rate is an overall benefit to the economy On a freezing cold and windy evening I put these arguments to a Dublin city councillor as we walked through the ward he represents in Coolock, one of the poorer neighbourhoods in Dublin's northern suburbs. Michael O'Brien points out a local hospital, which he says is suffering from a shortage of beds and staff. And he tells me about the housing issues he has to deal with, the families in temporary accommodation, and the people sleeping rough. He refuses to buy the idea that a lower corporate tax rate is an overall benefit to the economy. ""If more tax was demanded of the multinationals and domestic businesses, it would bring in billions of extra revenue that could be spent to deal with the housing crisis, deal with the healthcare crisis,"" he argues. ""It's insufferable to hear the likes of Facebook extolling this low tax regime. I think people see a basic issue of tax justice."" And with that, Councillor O'Brien heads off to try and deal with a few more problems among his constituents. And I use my smartphone to order a taxi, check emails and what my friends are posting on Facebook, and soon leave Coolock far behind.

Teenage years,"A series of pictures by Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert capture young participants in Scotland's Common Ridings festivals. Frances Kearney's photograph shows a bleak landscape with just a solitary figure. Yvette Monahanâs portrait is of a boy whose DNA is similar to that of a 3,000-year-old skeleton found in a cave in Burren, Ireland. The young man lives less than a mile from the cave. This girl is a member of a biking community that Spencer Murphy documented, capturing their often brightly coloured clothes and bikes. Baptiste Lignelâs images chart the development of nine American teenagers, looking at how their psychological conditions are managed. Anthony Luvera collaborated with lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people in Brighton to explore contemporary attitudes and representations. By filming her daughter for one minute, once a month from the ages of 11 to 18, Melanie Manchot built up a moving portrait of adolescence. Sophie Green documents those involved in the boy-racer subculture through portraits of them and their cars.

Can she win?,"This video can not be played Lucie Jones explained to BBC Breakfast why there may be ""slight changes"" to the song It's been a trying few years for the UK at Eurovision. Since 2012, we've come 25th, 19th, 17th, 24th... and last year, 24th again. Out of 26. Ouch. On Friday, former X Factor finalist Lucie Jones was chosen by the public to go to Kiev in May and fly the flag. She's already told BBC Breakfast that ""the public are calling for changes [to the song] - that's the great thing about social media... we're looking into it"". Eurovision fans on Twitter were split on the ballad, titled Never Give Up on You (interpret that as you wish). Nicholas Gibb tweeted: ""Lucie is actually giving me goosebumps,external."" Another fan said:""Have this on repeat, our best song in years, you'll do us proud."",external But some weren't so impressed, including @Gateauxchoc: ""It's bottom 3. She's got chops, she needs a song,external."" So what do the experts think of our chances? Eurovision pundit Liam Jarnecki and ""superfan"" Ben Royston gave us their reaction to the song. I definitely think we've got a chance of doing better than we usually do. I think it's exactly the right sort of song. I'm pretty sure we'll do better than we've done at any point since 2011. Some people have contextualised it politically because its easy to conflate Eurovision with the EU, although they're very different things. Some people think there'll be some consequence, but I don't think that's what most people vote on. It's a music competition and I think Lucie is an excellent singer. She'll be one of the best singers there. And the song is OK. That's usually enough to do quite well. I'm not saying she's going to win but I think she'll do well and we could get on to the legendary left-hand side of the scoreboard in the top 13! I think she's our best bet for a long time, certainly since we put Lord Lloyd-Webber on stage in Moscow (in 2009 with Jade Ewen). Jade Ewen sang Lord Lloyd Webber's song It's My Time in Moscow Lucie's one of the people who is so talented. She stood out on the X Factor - she almost transcended it as a contestant and she had that classic British underdog thing where she was beaten by Jedward [in 2009]. So she's already been pushed away by the cruelty of electoral dynamics once in her career! Personally, it wasn't my choice but I can understand why it won. But it does need a lot of work if that's going to stand out in a run of 26 songs in Kiev. That's not to take anything away from the singer, she's fantastic. We've chosen our song early and I honestly think they want to put in the work and polish it up and have it Eurovision-ready.  Of the six songs, that seemed to be the one that will be hardest to repackage. This video can not be played Listen to Never Give Up On You She sings from start to finish, there's no breaks in the vocal. It's going to be very hard to rework that song but they need to do it - we'll be lucky to finish outside the bottom three without some serious reworking. I know it's very early and we've only got six songs [from other countries] announced, but five of them are ballads. As much as it's a brave step and the quality is there, I think we did have a song [out of the shortlisted entries] that could have made the top five this year and I'm very surprised it didn't win - Holly Brewer. I've not been able to get her song out of my head since last Monday when it was on the radio. I was trying to remember Lucie's song and I was struggling. I'm not saying it's a bad song - it's a nice song but for Eurovision I think we're going to struggle. I hope I'm wrong. Jones was just 18 when she entered the X Factor competition Lucie Jones is a proven quality singer and she delivered a stunning performance of her song. ""It's a simple song, but sometimes simplicity is best for Eurovision, with a strong ballad such as this being able to cut through all the gimmickry and over-the-top performances that sometimes become a feature of Eurovision. With the song being co-written by former Eurovision winner Emmelie de Forest, all the signs are there for a good result - 20 years on since our last victory and in the year that marks our 60th participation at the contest.

Jack Goodman: Why these seven countries for travel ban?,"President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that banned travel into the United States for citizens from these seven countries for 90 days: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The restrictions were part of wide ranging immigration controls,externalthat also suspended refugee arrivals. It appears that existing restrictions in place during the Obama administration informed Mr Trump's list. These countries were already named as ""countries of concern"" after a law passed by a Republican-led Congress in 2015 altered a visa admissions programme. The Visa Waiver Program allows citizens from 38 countries to enter the US for 90 days without a visa. The UK, France and Germany are among those countries allowed in under the waiver programme. Visitors apply for an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (Esta). In December 2015 Congresspassed a law - created by senators from both parties,external, and supported and signed by the White House - that removed waiver benefits for foreign nationals who had visited certain countries since March 2011. The countries were identified as having a terrorist organisation with a significant presence in the area, or the country was deemed a ""safe haven"" for terrorists. The executive order has been followed by demonstrations across the United States After Libya, Somalia and Yemen were added to the list in February 2016, the ""countries of concern"" were the seven named in Mr Trump's order. According to the restrictions, citizens who had been eligible for the waiver programme and had visited one of those seven countries in the time period were forced to apply for a visa. The Obama administration passed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 after the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. The Act, however, unlike Trump's much more broad order, only affected people eligible for the visa waiver programme, rather than suspend all citizens' travel from one of those seven countries. Trump's executive order: Who does travel ban affect? Trump's 'extreme vetting' order sows seeds of panic White House stands firm over travel ban Million sign petition to stop UK visit In a statement on 29 January, President Trump said his policy was ""similar"" to an Obama order that ""banned visa for refugees from Iraq"". Trump referred to an incident in May 2011 when the FBI indicted two Iraqi citizens in Kentucky on federal terrorism charges. Both were accused of providing material support to al-Qaeda and had been involved in attacks against US forces in Iraq. A hearing before the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence found that the pair had ""exploited special Iraqi refugee programs"". The vetting system came under review and this resulted in fewer Iraqi refugee admissions that year. The number of refugees from Iraq dropped from 18,016 to 9,388 as a result of the suspension. That number increased to 12,163 the following year. Mr Trump's order said that foreign-born individuals have been responsible for ""numerous"" terrorism-related crimes since 9/11, including foreign nationals who have entered the country on visa or refugee programmes. The 9/11 attackers came from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Lebanon and Egypt. In September 2015the Homeland Security Committee reported,externalthat the so-called Islamic State had inspired or directed 60 terror plots or attacks in Western countries, including 15 in the United States. There are 250 American citizens known to have joined Islamist extremist groups. Significant recent attacks in the US were not committed by citizens from any of the seven countries included in the order. This list includes: Fort Lauderdale airport shooting (January 2017): A US citizen Orlando nightclub shooting (June 2016): A US citizen with Afghan parents San Bernardino shooting (December 2015): A US citizen with Pakistani parents, and a Pakistani citizen Chattanooga shootings (July 2015): A Kuwait-born US citizen Charleston church shooting (June 2015): A US citizen Boston marathon bombing (April 2013): Two men originally from Chechnya, Russia There have been a few non-fatal attacks by individuals from two of the countries on the banned list. According to the New America Foundation,external, 82% of all terrorism incidents since 2001 were conducted by citizens and permanent residents. Since 9/11, jihadists have killed 94 people inside the United States. A Cato Institute study,externalfound that Americans are 253 times more likely to die in a regular homicide than dying in a terrorist attack committed by a foreigner in the US. US Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) have said the order ""may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security"", because of the signal it sends to the Muslim world. But President Trump has rejected that notion, saying in an interview that America's enemies were already angry and it was his number one responsibility to keep the country safe. And his supporters wholeheartedly agree. ""Donald Trump says this is temporary and I trust him,"" said one resident in New York's Staten Island. ""His number one job is to protect the American people."" What are executive orders?

Tim Harford: The warrior monks who invented banking,"Temple Church is not just an important architectural, historical and religious site On London's busy Fleet Street, opposite Chancery Lane, is a stone arch through which anyone may step, and travel back in time. A quiet courtyard houses a strange, circular chapel and a statue of two knights sharing a single horse. The chapel is Temple Church, consecrated in 1185 as the London home of the Knights Templar. But Temple Church is not just an important architectural, historical and religious site. It is also London's first bank. The Knights Templar were warrior monks. A religious order, with a theologically inspired hierarchy, mission statement, and code of ethics, but also heavily armed and dedicated to holy war. How did they get into the banking game? 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. The Templars dedicated themselves to the defence of Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem. The city had been captured by the first crusade in 1099 and pilgrims began to stream in, travelling thousands of miles across Europe. Those pilgrims needed to somehow fund months of food and transport and accommodation, yet avoid carrying huge sums of cash around, because that would have made them a target for robbers. Pope Honorius II granted official recognition to the Knights Templar in 1128 Fortunately, the Templars had that covered. A pilgrim could leave his cash at Temple Church in London, and withdraw it in Jerusalem. Instead of carrying money, he would carry a letter of credit. The Knights Templar were the Western Union of the crusades. We don't actually know how the Templars made this system work and protected themselves against fraud. Was there a secret code verifying the document and the traveller's identity? The Templars were not the first organisation in the world to provide such a service. Several centuries earlier, Tang dynasty China used ""feiquan"" - flying money - a two-part document allowing merchants to deposit profits in a regional office, and reclaim their cash back in the capital. But that system was operated by the government. Templars were much closer to a private bank - albeit one owned by the Pope, allied to kings and princes across Europe, and run by a partnership of monks sworn to poverty. King Henry III took advantage of the Templars' financial services The Knights Templar did much more than transferring money across long distances. As William Goetzmann describes in his book Money Changes Everything, they provided a range of recognisably modern financial services. If you wanted to buy a nice island off the west coast of France - as King Henry III of England did in the 1200s with the island of Oleron, north-west of Bordeaux - the Templars could broker the deal. Henry III paid Â£200 a year for five years to the Temple in London, then when his men took possession of the island, the Templars made sure that the seller got paid. And in the 1200s, the Crown Jewels were kept at the Temple as security on a loan, the Templars operating as a very high-end pawn broker. The Knights Templar were not Europe's bank forever, of course. The order lost its reason to exist after European Christians completely lost control of Jerusalem in 1244, and the Templars were eventually disbanded in 1312. So who would step into the banking vacuum? If you had been at the great fair of Lyon in 1555, you could have seen the answer. Lyon's fair was the greatest market for international trade in all Europe. But at this particular fair, gossip was starting to spread about an Italian merchant who was there, and making a fortune. He bought and sold nothing: all he had was a desk and an inkstand. Day after day he sat there, receiving other merchants and signing their pieces of paper, and somehow becoming very rich. The locals were very suspicious. But to a new international elite of Europe's great merchant houses, his activities were perfectly legitimate. He was buying and selling debt, and in doing so he was creating enormous economic value. Bills of exchange allowed Florence's celebrated wool trade to flourish in the Middle Ages A merchant from Lyon who wanted to buy - say - Florentine wool could go to this banker and borrow something called a bill of exchange. This was a credit note, an IOU, but it was not denominated in the French livre or Florentine lira. Its value was expressed in the ecu de marc, a private currency used by this international network of bankers. And if the Lyonnaise merchant or his agents travelled to Florence, the bill of exchange from the banker in Lyon would be recognised by bankers in Florence, who would gladly exchange it for local currency. Through this network of bankers, a local merchant could not only exchange currencies but also translate his creditworthiness in Lyon into creditworthiness in Florence, a city where nobody had ever heard of him - a valuable service, worth paying for. The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart How fertiliser helped feed the world The simple steel box that changed the face of global trade The hidden strengths of unloved concrete Every few months, agents of this network of bankers would meet at the great fairs such as Lyon's, go through their books, net off all the credit notes against each other and settle any remaining debts. Our financial system today has a lot in common with this model. An Australian with a credit card can walk into a supermarket in Lyon and walk out with groceries. The supermarket checks with a French bank, which talks to an Australian bank, which approves the payment, happy that this woman is good for the money. But this web of banking services has always had a darker side to it. By turning personal obligations into internationally tradable debts, these medieval bankers were creating their own private money, outside the control of Europe's kings. Rich, and powerful, they had no need for the coins minted by the sovereign. The 2008 collapse of the Lehman Brothers bank led to financial instability across the globe That description rings true even today. International banks are locked together in a web of mutual obligations that defies easy understanding or simple control. They can use their international reach to try to sidestep taxes and regulations. And, since their debts to each other are a very real kind of private money, when the banks are fragile, the entire monetary system of the world also becomes vulnerable. We are still trying to figure out what to do with these banks. We cannot live without them, it seems, and yet we are not sure we want to live with them. Governments have long sought ways to hold them in check. Sometimes the approach has been laissez-faire, sometimes not. Few regulators have been quite as ardent as King Philip IV of France. The last grandmaster of the Templars, Jacques de Molay, was burned to death in Paris in 1314 He owed money to the Templars, and they refused to forgive his debts. So in 1307, on the site of what is now the Temple stop on the Paris Metro, Philip launched a raid on the Paris Temple - the first of a series of attacks across Europe. Templars were tortured and forced to confess any sin the Inquisition could imagine. The order was disbanded by the Pope. The London Temple was rented out to lawyers. And the last grandmaster of the Templars, Jacques de Molay, was brought to the centre of Paris and publicly burned to death.

"Who's affected by ban?Legal limbo at US airportsAmateur hour at the White House?Starbucks to hire 10,000 refugees","Protests were organized in many US cities On 27 January President Donald Trump signed an executive order halting all refugee admissions and temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries. The move sparked numerous protests and legal challenges. A week later a federal judge in Seattle suspended it nationwide, allowing banned visitors to travel to the US pending an appeal by the administration. Mr Trump and his supporters say the controversial executive order makes good on election promises to ""make America great again"". But what is the order, dubbed the ""Muslim ban"" by those rallying against it, and who exactly does it affect? Here are some key points from thefull text,externalexplained. It brings in a suspension of the US Refugee Admissions Programme for 120 days There is also an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees And anyone arriving from seven Muslim-majority countries - Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen - faces a 90-day visa suspension. Some visa categories, such as diplomats and the UN, are not included in the suspension The order also introduces a cap of 50,000 refugees to be accepted in 2017, against a limit of 110,000 set by former President Barack Obama Priority will be given to religious minorities facing persecution in their countries.In an interview,Mr Trump singled out Christians in Syria Exceptions could be made on a case-by-case basis Victims vent fury World reaction Order sows seeds of panic All travellers who have nationality of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen are not permitted to enter the US for 90 days, or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa. People who have dual nationality with a non-restricted country are not affected, so long as they travel on the passport from the other country. Under the executive order, Green Card holders - permanent legal US residents - from the seven countries were initially subject to the same restrictions, causing widespread concern and confusion. Two days after it was signed, the department for homeland security issueda statement,externalsaying that permanent legal residents would be determined on a case-by-case basis. But, it said, in the absence of significant information that they posed a threat, their permanent legal status would gain them entry to the US. However, on 1 February, Donald McGahn, the legal counsel to the president, then issueda memo,externalsaying the travel ban did not apply to lawful permanent residents of the United States. Mr Trump said the halt on the refugee programme was needed to give government agencies time to develop a stricter vetting system and ensure that visas were not issued to individuals posing a national security threat. ""To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,"" the president said in a statement released on Facebook. ""This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order."" Mr Trump's order has been strongly criticised by rights groups Syrians applying for resettlement in the US were already subject to a complex process of background investigation and security screenings, in a process that could takebetween 18 to 24 months. Mr Priebus said the seven countries had been included because Congress and the Obama administration had identified them as ""the most watched countries harbouring terrorists"". This is being hotly contested through the US court system, with dozens of lawsuits filed, and the issue thought likely to end up in the Supreme Court. Key dates: 3 February:A Seattle federal judge suspends the order nationwide, in response to a challenge by the Washington State attorney general, who argued that the executive order violated a clause in the US constitution that prohibits the favouring of one religion over another. 5 February:A request by Mr Trump's administration for an immediate reinstatement of the order is rejected by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. 9 February:A three-judge panel in the same courtrules,externalunanimously against reinstating the ban, after hearing arguments from lawyers from the Department of Justice and Washington State. In a series of tweets since the Seattle ruling, Mr Trump has criticised the suspension, saying the ruling came from a""so-called judge"",external, and that the courts were""making the job very difficult!"",external, and later describing the courts as ""so political"". After the San Francisco appeals court decision, he tweeted ""SEE YOU IN COURT"". In the past, the US used toban entrants from specific countries and entire regions,external. But in 1965, the US Congress passed theImmigration and Nationality Act,externalwhich said that no person could be ""discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence"". So, the exclusion of all Syrians would be enough to challenge Mr Trump in court. The fact that they are all Muslim countries lends weight to the critics's argument that the order is ""anti-Muslim"". Supporters of Mr Trump's order mentioned the post-9/11 attacks and the ability of the administration to take measures to protect national security. And they cited the president's powers stemming from a1952 law on ""Inadmissible Aliens"",externalto ""suspend the entry"" of ""any class of aliens"" that he finds are detrimental to the interest of the US. They also suggested that US presidents can set aside the 1965 law. The most cited example is that of President Jimmy Carter who barred some Iranians during the 1980 hostage crisis. The order initially triggered a lot confusion and uncertainty. Before its temporary suspension on Friday, a federal judge issued a temporary halt to the deportation of visa holders or refugees stranded at US airports. More than 100 people were detained at airports or in transit Air passengers were prevented from boarding US-bound flights American citizens travelling to the seven countries could be detained for questioning as well in the future, Mr Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said Demonstrations against the order were held in Dallas and other US airports Rights groups say Mr Trump's order targeted Muslims because of their faith and that no refugees had been convicted of terrorism-related crimes. They also said that the most recent attacks in the US were carried out by US nationals or citizens from the countries not included in the travel ban: Fort Lauderdale airport shooting (January 2017):A US citizen Orlando nightclub shooting (June 2016):A US citizen with Afghan parents San Bernardino shooting (December 2015):A US citizen with Pakistani parents, and a Pakistani citizen Chattanooga shootings (July 2015):A Kuwait-born US citizen Charleston church shooting (June 2015):A US citizen Boston marathon bombing (April 2013):Two Russian citizens with Chechen ethnicity Out of the 84,995 refugees that entered the US in 2016, 12,486 were from Syria, according to the Pew Research Center While announcing the plan, Mr Trump cited the attacks of 11 September 2001. But none of the 19 hijackers who committed the attacks came from countries included in the suspension. They were from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Lebanon. Some pointed out that the list did not include countries where President Trump had business interests - like Saudi Arabia - a suggestion dismissed by the president's chief of staff as not related.

"Legal limbo at US airportsAmateur hour at the White House?Starbucks to hire 10,000 refugees","This video can not be played Protesters gather at Dulles airport: ""Welcome to the USA!"" Said Hajouli, a second-year medical resident, had waited over a year to see his bride. They met in Turkey, after ""Leen"" - Said did not want to use her real name - fled her university in Syria when the war broke out. They were engaged for a year, married in 2015, then spent only one week together as husband and wife before Said had to return to Virginia on his J-1 visa, a non-immigrant visa commonly given to scholars and doctors. In the meantime, the couple applied and were approved for a J-2 visa for Leen, which is a permit reserved for spouses and dependents of J-1 holders. Finally, on Saturday 28 January, Leen boarded a flight in Istanbul bound for Dulles International Airport in Virginia, about 45 minutes outside of Washington DC. It was supposed to be a happy day. ""It was supposed to be, but I don't know what's going to happen,"" 29-year-old Said said, not long after arriving at Dulles. Almost exactly 24 hours earlier,President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled, ""Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States"". It shut down the US refugee programme for 120 days, indefinitely suspended the resettlement of Syrian refugees, and halted all immigration to the US from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. The order led to chaos at airports all over the world. Travellers were prevented from boarding planes abroad and, in some cases, were pulled off flights. They were detained at US airports. And there seemed to have been little instructions given to US Customs and Border Patrol on how to handle refugee and immigrant arrivals under the new rules. Lawyers gathered to represent those facing travel bans Earlier that morning, Said's friend's wife also attempted to enter the country with a J-2 visa, but he says she was immediately stopped and sent back. So, instead of flowers, Said brought Rob Robertson to the airport, a tall, burly immigration lawyer. Said had found him just hours earlier after putting out a desperate plea for help on social media. ""They've done everything they need to do. It's already clear she's not a threat,"" said Mr Robertson. ""It worries me that they're just going to turn around and send them back, pursuant to an executive order that is not law, that does not override the Immigration and Nationality Act,"" he said, referring to the 1965 law that bans discrimination against immigrants based on ""nationality, place of birth, or place of residence"". This video can not be played Protesters against the ban also gathered at New York's JFK Airport Mr Robertson was one of roughly 30 volunteer lawyers who showed up to Dulles on Saturday afternoon. They deployed en masse following news that two Iraqi men with valid visas were detained at John F Kennedy Airport, in New York, and faced deportation. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued on their behalf and they were later released. Rumours spread that more were trapped in legal limbo at other airports around the country - including Dulles. ""This is not the country I was born in. This is not the country that I loved,"" said lawyer Lena Albibi, who was moved to tears. ""It's very painful seeing this happenâ¦ They're breaking families apart."" Reaching prospective clients was a tricky errand for the lawyers, since anyone who needed legal help - travellers being detained in the ""secondary inspection"" area of US Customs and Border Patrol at Dulles - had no way to communicate with lawyers waiting outside. Lawyer Lena Albibi said this did not feel like the US she knew ""We cannot get the information that we need so we can figure out how we can assist them,"" said immigration lawyer Sari Long. ""We're trying to do our best to canvas family members."" Dispersed in the waiting area near baggage claim number 15 were people like Elmira Tayary, who had no idea she would need a lawyer to collect her 63-year-old mother, a green-card holder. Just hours earlier, Department of Homeland Security officials had revealed that the executive order would extend to permanent residents of the US coming from the seven banned countries. Tayary said her mother splits her time between the US and Iran, and has for years. ""I'm very, very sad, but I'm hopeful she may show up any minute,"" said Elmira. ""This is very disappointing."" Relatives and supporters waited to greet arrivals who had been detained As hours ticked by, and more and more protesters arrived carrying signs that read ""Refugees Are Welcome"" and ""Love Your Neighbour"", it became clear that something like 50 to 60 people, including green-card holders, were being held at customs. Lawyers were still not permitted to speak to them. However, there were small acts of rebellion. Employees of the airport itself managed to ferry information to family members who were waiting, including Elmira, to tell them that green card holders would soon be on their way. Immediately soothed, Elmira bought her mother a red-white-and-blue balloon. One by one, the permanent residents were released, walking down a corridor now teeming with demonstrators shouting ""Welcome home!"" and singing ""This Land is My Land"". Ali and his wife Hajer wore weary smiles as they pushed their luggage through the gauntlet of well-wishers, their 11- and 7-year-old boys in tow. Someone handed Hajer flowers. Ali worked for three years as an interpreter for the US Army and gained admittance to the US through a Special Immigrant Visa, reserved for Iraqi and Afghan nationals who face threats of violence for working for Americans during the conflicts there. He now has a green card, and returned to Iraq for his father's funeral, only to be delayed for hours for questioning at Dulles. ""We are not terrorists. We are not bad people,"" said Ali. ""It's so hard. I hope they will change their minds on this position."" US citizen Alaa was finally able to connect with his wife Jinan, a green card holder, only after she answered a series of questions about her family and her husband's business. ""That's way over the limit. She's got a green card,"" Alaa said. ""Are we going to blow up our system because we are afraid? Then, you know, whoever we are afraid from are winning."" Just then, a thin man carrying a sign that read ""This Veteran Stands With You"" stopped Alaa, told him he is an Iraq veteran, and with little explanation fastened a Purple Heart medal to Alaa's jacket. ""That's a great thing, that's a great thing!"" Alaa cried, elated. ""This is what America is all about!"" Ali, Hajer and their sons, legal residents in the US, finally make it through to the arrivals hall As the green-card holders began to depart, more good news arrived - first a judge in Brooklyn declared that deporting refugees and valid visa holders who'd already arrived in US airports would cause ""irreparable harm"", thereby blocking the deportations. Next, a judge in Virginia issued a temporary restraining order to stop the expulsion of green card holders. Each time the news arrived, the lawyers huddled together and then broke out into rowdy cheers. ""We are optimistic that pretty soon all those people back there will be allowed to come through,"" said lawyer Dan Press. By the time some detainees made it through, they were so exhausted that several fell weeping into the arms of loved ones - to the frenzied glee of the now-enormous protest group. It wasn't all good news. Rumours that deportations took place continued to swirl, though it is unclear how many. The Virginia court decision lasts only a week and Trump's executive order still holds for anyone who did not make it to US shores in time for this brief, legal reprieve. By 11 pm, Said still had no definitive answer about his wife, Leen. She called to say she was being sent back to Turkey, but then later was shuffled off to another room in customs. ""She may come walking out of there for all I know,"" said Said's lawyer. So Said leaned against a wall, eyes fixed on the path out of customs, and waited, as patiently as the previous year.

"Amateur hour at the White House?Starbucks to hire 10,000 refugees","History will have its own take on President Trump's immigration order It's only one week into Donald Trump's presidency, and he already has his first ""heckuva job"" moment. For those who don't remember, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, President George W Bush publicly praised his emergency management head, Michael Brown, for doing a ""heckuva job"" with recovery efforts. That comment was hung around the president's neck like an anvil, as flood waters swamped parts of New Orleans and the city descended into chaos. It started a public approval downward spiral that led to sweeping Democratic victories in the 2006 mid-term elections. History will judge the long-term impact of Mr Trump's Friday afternoon immigration order, but his early praise for its implementation will not easily be forgotten. This video can not be played Protesters shouted ""let them in"" at demonstrations in JFK Airport in New York ""It's working out very nicely,"" Mr Trump said in a brief response to a question on Saturday afternoon. ""You see it in the airports, you see it all over. It's working out very nicely, and we are going to have a very, very strict ban, and we are going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years."" On the ground at major US airports, things weren't going quite so nicely, however. Immigration officials were having a difficult time implementing Mr Trump's order after receiving conflicting instructions on who to bar from entry into the US - and what to do with them once they were held. And as the day progressed, and word spread of the detentions, crowds of protesters at international terminals grew from dozens to hundreds to thousands. While on the campaign trail, it was easy for Mr Trump to roundly decry the US immigration system as broken and make a general call for bans and moratoriums. As president, however, his team has had to fill in the details - and it seems they faced some difficulty translating his pre-election rhetoric into policy. Mr Trump's Friday afternoon executive order reportedly wascrafted without consulting legal aides and enacted over the objection of homeland security officials,external, who balked at including permanent US residents in the ban. This video can not be played President Trump: ""It's not a Muslim ban, but we're totally prepared"" This made for an awkward scene Saturday night at a New York courthouse, where government attorneys had to defend measures that were creating chaos at airports across the nation. ""I think the government hasn't had a full chance to think about this,""said federal judge Ann Donnelly,external, as she ruled that individuals with valid paperwork on US soil couldn't be deported. Her temporary ruling - and those like it in other courts - are only the opening salvo in what will likely be a protracted legal battle. Trump administration lawyers will surely be better prepared in future hearings. The orders could be re-instated following full trials on the merits, and no judge has yet to rule on the fate of individuals who hold valid US visas and are still on foreign soil. In the meantime, however, this has proven to be an embarrassing episode in what looks like a not-ready-for-primetime White House. At a New York courthouse, a judge issued a stay blocking the deportation of travellers who arrive in the US with valid visas A handful of Republicans in Congress have come out with varying levels of objection to the programme, and although the Republican leadership is playing along for the moment, that could change quickly if the political heat increases. The president may have broad powers in setting immigration policy, but Congress can pass legislation that overrules him at any time. Meanwhile, Democrats are scrambling to take advantage of the political opportunity. ""History will judge where America's leaders stood today,"" Democratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois said. It was a warning some of his party's 2020 presidential contenders seemed to take to heart. Senator Elizabeth Warren greets demonstrators protesting against the executive order at Boston's Logan Airport New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered airport trains to resume service to JFK Airport, after transit officials had suspended service to prevent protesters from continuing to flood in. Senator Elizabeth Warren spoke to crowds at Boston's Logan Airport, as did Senator Cory Booker at Dulles near Washington, DC. All three are considered near the top of the Democratic presidential field. 2020 is a long way off, of course. Of more pressing concern is where the Trump administration goes from here. On Sunday morning, press secretary Sean Spicer, chief of staff Reince Priebus and top aide Kellyanne Conway took to the airwaves to defend the White House policy and explain its implementation. Mr Trump himself fired back on Twitter - although only after firsttaking a swipe at the ""failing"" New York Times for the second day in a row,external. ""Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW,""he tweeted,external. ""Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!"" This video can not be played ""I feel he has a reason for doing what he's doing"" said one Staten Island resident While championing US security is usually a winning issue, protracted detention of children and the elderly at airport checkpoints is ""bad optics"", as they say. Watching a five-year-old re-united with his mother and 70-year-olds facing indefinite detention puts a human face on Mr Trump's immigration programme - and the results aren't flattering for the White House. During the presidential primary, a majority of Republican voters backed Mr Trump's calls for a sweeping ban on Muslims entering the US, so the president's core support may hold firm after this weekend's events. The views in the American heartland, far removed from major international airports, sometimes differ greatly from the liberal bastions on the coast. At best, however, this is an unnecessary distraction for the White House, calling its organisational ability into question. At worst - if the majority of the nation turns on the president - Mr Trump may find his power and influence starting to ebb before his administration even gets fully under way.

"Starbucks to hire 10,000 refugees","Starbucks has pledged to hire 10,000 refugees globally over the next five years, in response to US President Donald Trump's recentimmigration ban. Inan open letter,externalto staff, chief executive Howard Schultz said the president's order had caused ""confusion, surprise and opposition"". Recruitment will begin in the US and focus on people who had served or supported the military. Mr Schultz is the latest US corporate chief to criticise the ban. Silicon Valley heavyweights including Facebook, Google and Tesla have made public statements, while Airbnb isoffering free accommodationto people affected by the travel restrictions and unable to get into the US. On Friday, President Trump signed an executive order barring immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries for a minimum of 90 days, and suspending the US refugee program for 120 days. Mr Schultz said he wrote to employees with ""deep concern, a heavy heart and a resolute promise"" - adding he wanted them to know that the firm would ""neither stand by, nor stand silent, as the uncertainty around the new administration's actions grows with each passing day"".

Silicon Valley lashes out at Trump ban,"Google founder Sergey Brin joined protesters at San Francisco airport on Saturday evening For months, Silicon Valley seemed to be heeding the advice of one of its most powerful figures, billionaire investor Peter Thiel, who said President Trump should be taken ""seriously, but not literallyâ. But at the international arrivals gate at San Francisco airport at the weekend, things were getting very literal, very quickly. What the tech industry had feared might happen, was happening. The impact of President Trumpâs immigration ban on tech companies has been immediate. And one by one, the major firms and personalities in this part of the world spoke out with a fervour some felt was long overdue. It was Googleâs Sundar Pichai who really got the ball rolling. Late on Friday, he sent a memo to all employees raising his concerns and revealing that more than 100 Google staff were directly affected. His words were quickly shared beyond the inboxes of the search giant. On Saturday, Google co-founder Sergey Brin briefly joined protesters at the airport. Also seen was Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, the leading âacceleratorâ programme for new tech start-ups. Through social media, we heard from Netflixâs Reed Hastings who said the executive order was ""so un-American it pains us allâ. Twitter co-founder and chief executive Jack Dorsey said the repercussions were âreal and upsettingâ. Apple chief executive Tim Cook told staff the order was ânot a policy we supportâ. The city's main airport has become the focal point of the protests It kept on coming. âMisguided,â said Microsoft. âIgnores history,â said Mozilla. AirBnB co-founder Brian Chesky offered free housing to anyone caught outside the US, unable to return home. Slackâs Stewart Butterfield invoked historical comparisons in his statement, tweeting: ""My grandfather came from Poland between the wars, at 17, sponsored by an elder sister. Two more siblings made it. Everyone else died."" ""Trumpâs immigration ban is antithetical to both Lyft's and our nation's core values,â said Logan Green, head of ride-sharing firm Lyft, a company less well-known in Europe but one that competes with Uber in the US. Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick said âthis ban will impact many innocent peopleâ, and set up a $3m (Â£2.4m) fund to support staff, including drivers, caught up by the orders. (Still, the company that doesnât like to let a good PR banana skin go to waste outdid itself when itappeared to be capitalising on a taxi strike at JFK airport by removing surge pricing,external.) The cause for concern is about skilled immigration, the lubricant that keeps Silicon Valley working. The US doesnât create nearly enough software engineers and developers to sustain these enormous companies, and so foreign brainpower does more than plug the skills gap. âThereâs still a massive shortage of talent necessary for our organisations,â said Aaron Levie, chief executive and co-founder of Box, an online storage firm worth just over $2bn. âWe should be doing whatever makes America the most competitive as possible in terms of creating future jobs, in terms of being at the bleeding edge of key industries. ""Any policy that hurts high-skill immigration is a disaster."" The ban affected several of his employees, Mr Levie said. One of its co-founders is of Iranian descent. âWe think itâs a very dangerous policy,â Mr Levie continued. ""We think it has long-term ramifications and implications that have not been thought out, as well as near-term implications that clearly havenât been thought out as well.â Still, among the praise directed at firms over their statements this week, there were voices wondering: what took them so long? In a region - and indeed a state - where liberal thinking is front and centre, many were left aghast when it seemed the tech companiesâ first reaction was to get around a table with the then president-Elect and talk policy. The suggestion remains that while Silicon Valley likes to paint its decisions with colourful ethical values, itâs the bottom line that is the be all and end all. Firm morals and good business sense can co-exist, Box's Mr Levie said But both goals need not be mutually exclusive, Mr Levie said. âWeâre getting to a point in the world where itâs really hard to separate morals from our organisations,â he said. ""We are built on people, and we are built on having cultures of people that can come together and work productively and be welcome in their communities. It is both a business issue and a moral issue.â Tess Townsend, a journalist for tech news website Recode - the publication which has been most outspoken about the tech industryâs willingness to embrace President Trump - said any prior restraint from the companies was flipped upside down when the executive order was enforced. âPeople are seeing the real impact in a way thatâs not theoretical,â she told me. ""I think often times when we talk about policies being passed, we think about it having an impact but itâs not super immediate - the impact may not be felt for another few months, or maybe a year later. âBut this is something where people are being stopped at the airport now."" Google fund So what now? Uberâs Travis Kalanick, and Teslaâs Elon Musk, are both part of an advisory panel scheduled to meet with President Trump on Friday. Mr Musk used Twitter to solicit concerns about the orders that he said he will raise with the President, though he urged his followers to read the policy for themselves and not rely on media coverage. Several large donations have been made to groups offering legal support In addition to the earlier statements, companies - and the wealthy individuals within them - rallied around groups offering assistance to those affected by the orders. Google set up a âcrisis fundâ of $2m which could rise to $4m with employeesâ own contributions. Lyft said it would give the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) $1m over the next four years. Big-time investors such as Chris Sacca shared news of their own donations - $150,000 in his case - to various groups. The executive order is only intended to be a temporary measure, President Trump has said. For the time being, as I type, there is still a sizeable crowd gathered at San Francisco airport, cheering in each arrival. And on several placards, the face of this regionâs most revered figure, Steve Jobs - the son of a Syrian, adopted by Americans.

What is a state visit?,"This video can not be played The BBC's Jonny Dymond on what to expect from President Trump's visit to the UK US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are making a state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June. Here's a rundown of what we can expect. It's a formal trip to the UK by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. Although they're grand occasions, they're not just ceremonial affairs - they're also used by the government to further what it sees as Britain's national interests. The Queen usually receives one or two heads of state per year and has hosted 112 of these visits since becoming monarch in 1952. The official website of the Queen and the Royal Familyhas a full list of all the other state visits,external, and details ofhow the ceremonies unfold,external. Visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, but because Buckingham Palace is being renovated the US president is not expected to stay there. While Mr Trump is only the third US president to make a state visit to the UK, the Queenhas met almost all the US presidents in office during that time, either in the UK or in the US. On Monday, the first day of Mr Trump's three-day trip, a ceremonial welcome attended by the Queen, Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall was held in the Buckingham Palace garden. After the welcome, the Duke of Sussex joined the group for a private lunch at the palace. This video can not be played Here's what happened on day one of Donald Trump's state visit to the UK (tweets not included). Mr and Mrs Trump then visited Westminster Abbey for a tour and met Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall for tea at Clarence House. Astate banquet in the palace's ballroom took place on Monday evening, with Mr Trump, the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall joined by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with other UK public figures and prominent Americans living in Britain. The banquet was held in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace On Tuesday, Mr Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May will host a business breakfast attended by the Duke of York at St James's Palace. Business leaders understood to be attending include Barclays CEO Jes Staley, GlaxoSmithKline chief executive Emma Walmsley, BAE Systems chairman Sir Roger Carr and the National Grid's John Pettigrew. Mr Trump will then visit Downing Street for talks with Theresa May. They are expected to discuss a range of issues on which they hold differing views - includingclimate changeandHuawei. Trump visit: A barometer of political power The talks will be followed by a joint press conference. Mrs May is due to step down as prime minister on 7 June. Thousands of people are expected to join protests against Mr Trump's visit in UK cities on Tuesday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to address the London rally in Trafalgar Square, where he will be joined by members of other political parties including the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. In the evening, the Trumps will host a dinner at the residence of the US ambassador attended by Charles and Camilla on behalf of the Queen. The trip is expected to culminate on Wednesday 5 June with Mr Trump, the Queen and Prince Charles attending the national commemorative event in Portsmouth for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. More than 300 veterans will be at the ceremony, which will feature musical performances, testimonial readings and military displays. Trump visit 'will detract from D-Day event' Following the D-Day event Mr Trump will travel to his hotel and golf resort in Doonbeg, in the Republic of Ireland. He will hold a meeting with Irish premier Leo Varadkar at Shannon Airport. A visiting leader will sometimes speak at the Houses of Parliament during a state visit, but Commons Speaker John Bercow said on Tuesday he had not received a request for Mr Trump to do so. The president has suggested he ""may"" meet Conservative MP and leadership hopeful Boris Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage during his visit -both of whom he described as ""friends"" and ""good guys"". The prime minister says the visit is a chance for the UK and the US to strengthen their ""already close relationship"". Talks will cover areas such as trade, investment, security and defence. But Mr Trump is a controversial figure and many have opposed the visit. Thousands gathered to protest against President Trump's policies when he visited the UK in 2018 His policies - from the executive order that restricts entry to the US from certain countries, to the wall with Mexico, and his rejection of the Paris climate deal - have provoked criticism, both domestically and internationally. And that is to say nothing about some of the comments he's made - including outspoken attacks against political opponents, the media, and his critics - and the investigation into his links to Russia. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to attend Mr Trump's state banquet, accusing the president of using ""racist and misogynist rhetoric"", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also declined an invitation. Others argue that the US is a key ally of the UK and that Mr Trump should be welcomed accordingly. When the president's on the move - you know about it The security operation surrounding Mr Trump's visit could cost more than Â£18m. It is intended to createan impenetrable ring of steelaround the US president. The president arrived in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, with space for conference and dining rooms and a medical facility with an operating table. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines nicknamed The Beast and other security and communications vehicles, was flown across ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. In 2018, almost 10,000 officers from the UK were deployed for Mr Trump's trip, with nearly every force in the country providing staff to support the operation. This video can not be played Dinner, talks and golf: A look back at President Trump's last visit to the UK It was certainly eventful. As well as holding talks with Mrs May at her country residence, Chequers, and having tea with the Queen at Windsor Castle, the trip was marked by demonstrations. Tens of thousands of peoplegathered in central London to protest against him. There was also a six-metre ""Trump baby"" blimp - depicting the president as a nappy-wearing infant - inflated outside Parliament. And at his golf resort at Turnberry, Ayrshire,one protester paraglided over the hotelas Mr Trump played the course. Campaigners have claimed they will mobilise ""huge numbers"" in response to Mr Trump's arrival. On Monday supporters of the human rights charity Amnesty unfurled five banners facing the US embassy on Vauxhall Bridge, reading ""Resist sexism"", ""Resist racism"", ""Resist hate"", ""Resist cruelty"" and ""Resist Trump"". A ""national demonstration"" in London's Trafalgar Square will start at 11:00 BST on Tuesday, while protests are also planned in Birmingham, Stoke, Sheffield, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Chester, Leicester, Oxford and Exeter. A 16ft talking robot of Mr Trump sitting on a golden toilet is also expected to make an appearance. Trump visit: A barometer of power Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing?

Reality Check: The US and refugees,"On 28 January, President Trump signed an executive order, which, among other things, indefinitely bans Syrian refugee arrivals as well as all other refugees for 120 days. He also promised ""to prioritise refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality"". The executive order imposed a cap of 50,000 on the number of refugees for 2017, less than half of the 110,000 admissions that President Obama planned. Has the number of refugees in the US and, in particular, those from Syria, risen in recent years? Thenumber of refugees admitted,externalto the US over the past 10 years has fluctuated, from the low of 48,282 in 2007, to the high of 84,995 in 2016. In the first three months of the new financial year, a total of 25,671 were admitted. In 2016, of the nearly 85,000 refugees admitted, the highest number - 16,370 - arrived from DR Congo, followed by Syria with 12,587 and Myanmar (Burma) with 12,347. The number of Muslim refugees who entered the US in 2016 was 38,901, making up almost half (46%) of the total, according to thisPew Research report,externalfrom October 2016. The report says this is the highest number of Muslim refugees in any year since data on self-reported religious affiliations first became publicly available in 2002. Between 2011, when the conflict in Syria started, and 2015, the US admitted a relatively small number of Syrian refugees - a total of 201. In 2015 the number increased to 1,682 and in 2016 to 12,587, bringing the total, since the start of the war, to 14,470. By comparison, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees'latest figures,externalshow that the highest number of refugees from Syria since the start of the crisis was taken by Turkey with 2.9 million, Lebanon with one million and Jordan, which took 655,000. In the same period, the EU took 844,000 Syrians,according to Eurostat,,externalwith more than half of the total admitted by Germany. There have been big differences in the number of refugees arriving year-on-year in the US over the past four decades: from the peak of 207,116 in 1980 to the lowest of 27,131 in 2002. In total, since 1975, the US has admitted about 3.4 million refugees. Itscurrent population,externalis about 323 million.

Why Hindu hardliners want to sideline Gandhi,"Handmade cotton yarn or khadi was one of Gandhi's pet themes during India's freedom struggle Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on this day 69 years ago but his ideas of Hindu-Muslim unity still haunt India's Hindu hardliners, writes BBC Hindi's Rajesh Joshi. The discomfort of the Hindu hardline right with Mahatma Gandhi became apparent once again when a senior leader of the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) recently described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a ""bigger brand name"" than the iconic leader of India's freedom struggle. Anil Vij, a senior minister in the BJP government in the northern state of Haryana, also said that Gandhi's picture would eventually be phased out of the currency notes. His comments came soon after a government department replaced Gandhi's pictures on its calendars and diaries with Mr Modi's. Critics perceived it as a move to slowly replace Gandhi with the prime minister. The irony was not lost on anyone because the government department in question is responsible for popularising handmade cotton yarn or khadi - one of Gandhi's pet themes during India's freedom struggle. As the controversy erupted and social media started buzzing with unfavourable comments, the BJP distanced itself from Mr Vij's anti-Gandhi statement. The controversy died down after he agreed to retract his statement in the face of growing outrage. But this was not the first time that a BJP politician has made anti-Gandhi remarks. Past examples show that many right-wing Hindu leaders never mince words when it comes to criticising Gandhi. In recent times Sakshi Maharaj, a BJP MP from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, described Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse as a ""patriot"".  Godse's association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)  - which has umbilical ties to the BJP - has been well documented. The Hindu hardliners who see Modi as their own Inside a far-right Hindu 'self defence' camp Way back in 1998, then RSS chief Prof Rajendra Singhpraised,externalGodse for his commitment to the concept of Akhand Bharat - a unified India which includes Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and even Myanmar (Burma). ""His intentions were good but he used wrong methods,"" Mr Singh said. The biggest issue the RSS has with Gandhi is that he advocated Hindu-Muslim unity while proclaiming himself to be a devout Hindu. The cornerstone of its worldview is Hindu supremacy. Gandhi was assassinated by a man who saw him as a traitor to India's majority Hindu population Madhav Sadashiva Golwalkar, one of the founding fathers of the Sangh, described Muslims and Christians, along with the Communists, as an ""internal threat to the nation"". Historian and author Ramchandra Guha puts the Hindu right-wing dilemma about Gandhi into perspective. ""The RSS was deeply influenced by two Hindu thinkers - Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and Madhav Sadashiva Golwalkar - and both of them deeply detested Gandhi."" In fact, Savarkar was made an accused in the Gandhi murder case - though eventually he was exonerated of all charges. ""His rivalry with Gandhi went back to 1909 when he openly abused Gandhi. While Savarkar believed in violent methods, Gandhi was a pacifist,"" Mr Guha told the BBC. ""It was much later when the RSS decided to expand into the political arena, that they started saying nice things about Gandhi and included him in their list of 'revered' leaders,"" he added. But there is another, probably more serious, reason for their hatred of Gandhi. Ten days before Godse killed Gandhi, a young Hindu refugee man from Pakistan, Madanlal Pahwa, exploded a bomb on 20 January, 1948, at Delhi's Birla Bhawan where Gandhi was participating in his routine evening prayer. Gandhi directly challenged the ideologies of India's Hindu rightwing parties Delhi and many parts of north India were in the grip of Hindu-Muslim violence after the partition of India and Pakistan. A day after Pahwa exploded the bomb, Gandhi described him as a ""mere tool"" in the hands of Hindu fanatics. He directly challenged the forces of Hindu hardliners saying, ""Don't do this. The Hindu religion is not going to be saved by such acts. I insist that if the Hindu religion is to be saved, it can be saved only through the kind of work I am doing."" No wonder that Praveen Togadia, an important leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), an affiliated organisation of the RSS, declared during the height of anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002 that ""terrorism came because Gandhi's ideology is being followed in this country"". Mr Togadia, like Mr Modi and Mr Vij, also learnt his politics in the shakhas - the morning military-style drills - of the RSS. The only difference is that mainstream BJP leaders, especially those holding constitutional posts, avoid openly criticising Gandhi because of a variety of reasons: the compulsions of electoral politics, Gandhi's international stature and his place in the hearts of the Indian people as the ""father of the nation"". Still, even though it has been nearly seven decades since Gandhi was assassinated, Hindu right-wing forces feel compelled to question his authority and challenge his idea of Hindu-Muslim unity. And leaders like Sakshi Maharaj, Anil Vij and Praveen Togadia continue to eagerly oblige.

Which are strongest Leave and Remain constituencies?,"The claim:The six strongest pro-Leave constituencies and the six strongest pro-Remain constituencies all have Labour MPs. Reality Check verdict:The best estimates available suggest that two of the six most pro-Remain constituencies have SNP MPs, while three of the six most pro-Leave constituencies have Conservative MPs. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said on Friday that any leader would be challenged by the situation in which the six most passionate pro-Leave and pro-Remain constituencies all had MPs from their party. The EU referendum vote nationwide was close, with 48.1% voting Remain and 51.9% Leave. But Remain voters tended to be clustered in big cities and in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while the Leave vote was more evenly spread. This means that while a small majority of the country voted Leave, a large majority of the country's 650 parliamentary constituencies did so. The votes in June were counted by council, of which there are far fewer - about 400. This is because cities tend to have one council but several Westminster constituencies. This means in most cases we cannot say exactly how each parliamentary constituency voted. However, Chris Hanretty, an academic at the University of East Anglia, has used the results for local authorities to makedetailed estimates for each constituency,external. These are based on other things we know about the area, such as age, education, ethnicity and income, and how strongly those factors correlate with a vote for Brexit in the places where we know the vote at constituency level for sure. Mr Hanretty estimates that most constituencies where Remain support was the highest did indeed vote Labour in 2015, although Glasgow North and Edinburgh North, both represented by the SNP, are exceptions. But that's not the picture in the areas that most passionately backed Leave. The Brexit vote was strongest in parts of eastern England, especially Lincolnshire, which backed the Conservatives in 2015. Mr Hanretty estimates that Conservative-held Boston and Skegness was the constituency with the highest Leave vote. It covers the Boston council area, which recorded the strongest vote to leave the EU of any local authority, and part of East Lindsey, another overwhelmingly pro-Brexit area. It's true that some places where Leave support was strongest voted Labour in 2015, such as Doncaster North, Ed Miliband's constituency. But the Leave vote was highest in Conservative parts of eastern England.

Winona steals show at awards,"Politically-charged speeches were the order of the day at this year's Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards, with many attendees choosing to speak out against President Trump's controversial immigration ban. Yet that wasn't the only talking point at the Los Angeles ceremony, which also saw some more light-hearted moments, the odd surprise - and more than one fashion catastrophe. Here are seven things that grabbed our attention. Kidman was up for a supporting actress award but lost out to Fences' Viola Davis The Oscar-winning star of Moulin Rouge turned heads on the red carpet by wearing two of them on her shoulders. The Australian actress - who was up for an award for her work in Lion - frocked up in a green Gucci gown adorned with feathered parrot heads. The dress saw her crowned by some media as theworst-dressed star,externalat the event and quickly had people squawking in the Twittersphere.

Will someone try to top her bold fashion choice at Hollywood's next awards bash? After all, toucan play at that game. Ryder was among those recognised for their contribution to sci-fi series Stranger Things Stranger Things actor David Harbour gave an impassioned speech when the show won its best ensemble award, calling on his fellow ""craftsmen and women"" to ""battle against fear, self-centredness and exclusivity"". But his thunder was stolen somewhat by the facial expressions sported by his co-star Winona Ryder as she stood beside him. Initially surprised at the weight of her prize statuette, the 45-year-old went on to emote delight, amazement and confusion before raising her fist in what appeared to be a mock salute. The faces that launched a thousand gifs ""Next time Trump gives a speech, make Winona Ryder stand next to him and translate for all of us through her facial expressions,"" wrote the TV criticEmily Nussbaum,external. Harbour himself made reference to his co-star afterwards, describing the memes and gifs she had unwittingly generated as ""epic,external"". Newton had been nominated for a best actress prize for her work in Westworld Stranger Things's success came at the expense of another highly regarded sci-fi show that had also begun the evening with three nominations. The TV makeover of Michael Crichton's Westworld ended up a bridesmaid though, missing out in all three categories in which it was shortlisted. As well as missing out on the outstanding ensemble in a drama series prize, the show was also pipped to a stuntwork prize by Game of Thrones. Thandie Newton, meanwhile, had to applaud politely when fellow Brit Claire Foy received the best actress in a drama series award. But the 44-year-old made light of being passed over, postinga humorous picture on Twitter,externalof herself necking a bottle of champagne. Macy previously won a SAG award for his Shameless role in 2015 Even William H Macy was surprised when he beat Transparent's Jeffrey Tambor to the award for outstanding performance by a male actor in a comedy series. ""I'm shocked,"" the Shameless star told the audience. ""I'm probably not as shocked as Jeffrey, but I'm pretty shocked."" Macy went on to ""thank President Trump for making Frank Gallagher"" - the debauched single father he plays in the Showtime TV series - ""seem so normal"". Felicity Huffman, Macy's actress wife,tweeted a picture,externalof her own delight at her husband's third SAG win. Meryl Streep got a shout-out on Sunday from The Crown award-winner John Lithgow, who dedicated part of his acceptance speech to praise her for her much-publicisedTrump tiradeat the Golden Globes.

Yet Kenneth Lonergan's film went away empty-handed when Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges and Michelle Williams were all beaten in their respective awards categories. The film also missed out on the outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture prize - the SAG equivalent of a best picture award. Affleck's failure to win the best actor award - a prize won by Denzel Washington instead - was one of the bigger upsets of the night.

""This award came just in the nick of time.""

""Live your life so that when you are being honoured for your achievements, the people called upon to make laudatory remarks can feel reasonably honest about their comments,'' she went on.

Great Scottish Run course 150m too short,"The Great Scottish Run half-marathon course in 2016 has been found to be about 150m short after remeasurement. Organisers measured the Glasgow route on Sunday after some competitors raised concerns about the distance. The course, beginning in George Square and ending at Glasgow Green, was 149.7m short of the full 13.1 miles. This invalidatesthe record set by winner Callum Hawkinsand the personal best times recorded by a number of runners on the day. About 9,500 competitors took part in the Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run half-marathon on Sunday 2 October last year. A 10k event also took place. Officials remeasured the route on Sunday The Newcastle-based Great Run Company has apologised to all runners and winner Callum Hawkins. Race director Andy Mitchelmore said: ""Great Run take responsibility for the miscalculation and we apologise unreservedly to the runners and to the City of Glasgow. ""This was an isolated incident. In the 30 years since the company was formed, more than four million people have participated in hundreds of our running events and the distances, which are measured by qualified independent parties, have been correct."" Organisers said the miscalculation of the distance was down to human error, with two problems identified. They said a small section of the prescribed route was not followed correctly in Bellahouston Park which accounted for about 50m of the shortfall. The remainder of the shortfall was as a result of the difference between measuring on closed roads compared to a measure on unclosed roads. When the Great Scottish Run half-marathon route was measured in August the roads were unclosed due to essential utilities works affecting the course. It is easier for measurers to take the exact line athletes will take when the roads are closed, but when working on unclosed roads they have to be mindful of safety and follow the legal rules of the road. The Glasgow course uses a number of major roads in the city, including the M8 Kingston Bridge, where the course runs against the normal traffic flow. Organisers said they had introduced several extra check steps to ensure the situation would not be repeated.

'Miracle' twins born at 23 weeks,"The girls are still wearing 0-3 months baby clothes Identical twins, thought to be among the most premature ever recorded in Britain, have been described by their parents as ""little miracles"". Imogen and Annabelle Weir were born at just 23 weeks and four days, weighing about a pound each. They spent four months in hospital enduring blood transfusions and emergency surgery. The girls have now been settling in at home in Paisley in Renfrewshire with their parents Claire and James. They have been supported by the Twins and Multiple Births Association (Tamba) who said the fact that the twins were born so early but have gone on to do so well was ""truly incredible"". They were born three days under the 24-week legal limit for abortion in the UK. The girls were born last April, more than three months early. The twins spent four months in hospital Mrs Weir, 31, said: ""They are the youngest and smallest surviving twins to be born in Scotland. ""I'd never heard of twins so small surviving. It didn't seem possible for one, let alone two. ""The consultant told us that if the girls had been born just two years ago they wouldn't have survived - that's how fast medical technology is advancing. ""They have surprised everyone. They will always be our little miracles."" Mr and Mrs Weir met at university in Dundee nine years ago and married in 2013. Mrs Weir was given an early scan and the couple were told that there were two strong heartbeats. Mr Weir, also 31, added: ""We don't have a history of twins as a family, so it was a shock. ""We were over the moon and pretty overwhelmed."" Mrs Weir's 20-week scan showed the twins were growing well, but just a fortnight later, at 22-and-a-half weeks, her waters broke. She was taken to The Royal Alexandria Hospital in Paisley before being transferred to the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital in Glasgow. She said: ""I was just trying to keep the babies inside me for as long as possible. It was a really horrible time, filled with worry. ""After 23 weeks, they would at least have a chance of resuscitation so I hoped they would stick in there. Each day brought more hope. ""I got to more than 23 weeks but then I got very ill with a sepsis infection and they had to induce me. The fact that they were twins, that I had an infection and they were so premature all lowered their chance of survival. ""I didn't have a lot of hope."" The twins were born in the early hours of 3 April. Mrs Weir said: ""They were whisked away to intensive care - I didn't even get to see them. ""I got to hold Imogen after about six days but Annabelle was smaller and more vulnerable, so I didn't get to hold her for a few weeks. They were so tiny they fitted in one hand."" The girls still weigh only 11lbs and 12lbs and have to wear 0-3 month baby clothes. ""It was a terrifying experience but wonderful to be at home now as a family,"" Mrs Weir added. ""Now we are experiencing all the normal struggles new parents have but we have loved every minute. We know how lucky we are."" Helen Peck, Tamba's Scottish co-ordinator, said: ""We are delighted for Claire and James and the twins. Imogen and Annabelle's story is just remarkable. ""They are truly incredible - a pair of miracles. ""To see premature babies born this early and go on to do so well is incredibly rare. It is a testament to the wonderful medical staff that they are now growing well.""

US travel ban dominates front pages,"Protests against the travel ban took place across the UK on Monday The row about the US travel ban is the lead for most papers on Monday. The Times,externalsays the high-level conversations between Washington and Westminster yesterday to clarify how British citizens with dual nationality would be affected by the ban are the latest sign of the strength of transatlantic ties after Theresa May's meeting with President Trump. According to the Daily Mail,,externalministers were told to pass on ""forthright"" demands for UK citizens to be exempted - and sources indicated that Mrs May had been prepared to ring Mr Trump personally if the US refused to give way.  The Mail describes what it calls the easing of the ban as a diplomatic breakthrough. The Daily Telegraph,externalsays the news that British citizens are exempted represents a significant boost for Mrs May after the row threatened to overshadow the success of her visit to the US. The Guardian,externalsays Boris Johnson is still expected to face questions in the Commons today - and will be pressed about why Britain took longer than other countries to receive assurances, and why Mrs May didn't condemn the policy in the same way as other European leaders.The Daily Mirror,externalfocuses on demands to cancel Mr Trump's planned State visit to Britain.  It has the headline: ""You are not welcome here, Mr President"". A number of papers seize on the remarks of the former Minister for International Development, Grant Shapps, that Britain's spending on foreign aid is ""out of control"". Writing in the Sunday Times,external, he called for the Department for International Development to be abolished.  The Daily Express says it's a pity Mr Shapps didn't say this when he was in office.  The Telegraph supports his suggestion that the department should revert to being an arm of the Foreign Office.  Then - it says - we could be sure its work really was in Britain's national interest.  The Mail asks when the government will get the message and finally abandon what it calls its ludicrous pledge to shovel 0.7% of national income into this bottomless foreign pit when our own pensioners are denied vital social care. The Mail,externaland theSun,externalreport that the number of patients in England placed on mixed-sex wards has soared by seventy percent in a single year.  The Sun says ministers had vowed to end the practice in 2010 following a public outcry.  The Mail says it's true that NHS hospitals are under intense pressure for beds - but insists there's no excuse for denying patients the basic dignity of single-sex accommodation. Finally, the papers salute Roger Federer for his 18th Grand Slam title - after beating Rafa Nadal at the Australian Open.For the Mail,external, he's ""simply the best"". The Sun says he wrote the most astonishing chapter yet in one of the greatest sporting stories of all time. The Guardian says Federer's claim to greatness has never been in question, not even in the five years since he won his 17th Grand Slam.  However, his right to be regarded as peerless in the history of his sport was cemented beyond argument yesterday.  He took greatness to a new level, the paper says.

The young boy who wants to be a girl,"This video can not be played The family of a transgender child, who was born a boy but now lives as a girl, have spoken about her transition. Nicholas, from near Sheffield, often dressed as a girl at home, but in 2015 aged eight she started going to school as Amber. Her mother said, despite difficulties, she realised she could have a ""miserable son or a happy daughter"". The BBC's Inside Out programme followed Amber for several months up to her ninth birthday. Her story comes as figures suggest a significant rise in under-18s being referred to the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS). In 2009/10 there were 97 referrals but in 2015/16 that figure rose to 1,419. GIDS is a specialised clinic, funded by the NHS, for young people experiencing difficulties with their gender. It has two centres, one in Tavistock, London, and another in Leeds. You can see Amber's story on BBC Inside Out Yorkshire and Lincolnshire at 19:30 GMT on BBC One on Monday 30 January or via iPlayer afterwards. The young boy who wants to be a girl.

Legal limbo at US airports,"This video can not be played Protesters gather at Dulles airport: ""Welcome to the USA!"" Said Hajouli, a second-year medical resident, had waited over a year to see his bride. They met in Turkey, after ""Leen"" - Said did not want to use her real name - fled her university in Syria when the war broke out. They were engaged for a year, married in 2015, then spent only one week together as husband and wife before Said had to return to Virginia on his J-1 visa, a non-immigrant visa commonly given to scholars and doctors. In the meantime, the couple applied and were approved for a J-2 visa for Leen, which is a permit reserved for spouses and dependents of J-1 holders. Finally, on Saturday 28 January, Leen boarded a flight in Istanbul bound for Dulles International Airport in Virginia, about 45 minutes outside of Washington DC. It was supposed to be a happy day. ""It was supposed to be, but I don't know what's going to happen,"" 29-year-old Said said, not long after arriving at Dulles. Almost exactly 24 hours earlier,President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled, ""Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States"". It shut down the US refugee programme for 120 days, indefinitely suspended the resettlement of Syrian refugees, and halted all immigration to the US from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. The order led to chaos at airports all over the world. Travellers were prevented from boarding planes abroad and, in some cases, were pulled off flights. They were detained at US airports. And there seemed to have been little instructions given to US Customs and Border Patrol on how to handle refugee and immigrant arrivals under the new rules. Lawyers gathered to represent those facing travel bans Earlier that morning, Said's friend's wife also attempted to enter the country with a J-2 visa, but he says she was immediately stopped and sent back. So, instead of flowers, Said brought Rob Robertson to the airport, a tall, burly immigration lawyer. Said had found him just hours earlier after putting out a desperate plea for help on social media. ""They've done everything they need to do. It's already clear she's not a threat,"" said Mr Robertson. ""It worries me that they're just going to turn around and send them back, pursuant to an executive order that is not law, that does not override the Immigration and Nationality Act,"" he said, referring to the 1965 law that bans discrimination against immigrants based on ""nationality, place of birth, or place of residence"". This video can not be played Protesters against the ban also gathered at New York's JFK Airport Mr Robertson was one of roughly 30 volunteer lawyers who showed up to Dulles on Saturday afternoon. They deployed en masse following news that two Iraqi men with valid visas were detained at John F Kennedy Airport, in New York, and faced deportation. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued on their behalf and they were later released. Rumours spread that more were trapped in legal limbo at other airports around the country - including Dulles. ""This is not the country I was born in. This is not the country that I loved,"" said lawyer Lena Albibi, who was moved to tears. ""It's very painful seeing this happenâ¦ They're breaking families apart."" Reaching prospective clients was a tricky errand for the lawyers, since anyone who needed legal help - travellers being detained in the ""secondary inspection"" area of US Customs and Border Patrol at Dulles - had no way to communicate with lawyers waiting outside. Lawyer Lena Albibi said this did not feel like the US she knew ""We cannot get the information that we need so we can figure out how we can assist them,"" said immigration lawyer Sari Long. ""We're trying to do our best to canvas family members."" Dispersed in the waiting area near baggage claim number 15 were people like Elmira Tayary, who had no idea she would need a lawyer to collect her 63-year-old mother, a green-card holder. Just hours earlier, Department of Homeland Security officials had revealed that the executive order would extend to permanent residents of the US coming from the seven banned countries. Tayary said her mother splits her time between the US and Iran, and has for years. ""I'm very, very sad, but I'm hopeful she may show up any minute,"" said Elmira. ""This is very disappointing."" Relatives and supporters waited to greet arrivals who had been detained As hours ticked by, and more and more protesters arrived carrying signs that read ""Refugees Are Welcome"" and ""Love Your Neighbour"", it became clear that something like 50 to 60 people, including green-card holders, were being held at customs. Lawyers were still not permitted to speak to them. However, there were small acts of rebellion. Employees of the airport itself managed to ferry information to family members who were waiting, including Elmira, to tell them that green card holders would soon be on their way. Immediately soothed, Elmira bought her mother a red-white-and-blue balloon. One by one, the permanent residents were released, walking down a corridor now teeming with demonstrators shouting ""Welcome home!"" and singing ""This Land is My Land"". Ali and his wife Hajer wore weary smiles as they pushed their luggage through the gauntlet of well-wishers, their 11- and 7-year-old boys in tow. Someone handed Hajer flowers. Ali worked for three years as an interpreter for the US Army and gained admittance to the US through a Special Immigrant Visa, reserved for Iraqi and Afghan nationals who face threats of violence for working for Americans during the conflicts there. He now has a green card, and returned to Iraq for his father's funeral, only to be delayed for hours for questioning at Dulles. ""We are not terrorists. We are not bad people,"" said Ali. ""It's so hard. I hope they will change their minds on this position."" US citizen Alaa was finally able to connect with his wife Jinan, a green card holder, only after she answered a series of questions about her family and her husband's business. ""That's way over the limit. She's got a green card,"" Alaa said. ""Are we going to blow up our system because we are afraid? Then, you know, whoever we are afraid from are winning."" Just then, a thin man carrying a sign that read ""This Veteran Stands With You"" stopped Alaa, told him he is an Iraq veteran, and with little explanation fastened a Purple Heart medal to Alaa's jacket. ""That's a great thing, that's a great thing!"" Alaa cried, elated. ""This is what America is all about!"" Ali, Hajer and their sons, legal residents in the US, finally make it through to the arrivals hall As the green-card holders began to depart, more good news arrived - first a judge in Brooklyn declared that deporting refugees and valid visa holders who'd already arrived in US airports would cause ""irreparable harm"", thereby blocking the deportations. Next, a judge in Virginia issued a temporary restraining order to stop the expulsion of green card holders. Each time the news arrived, the lawyers huddled together and then broke out into rowdy cheers. ""We are optimistic that pretty soon all those people back there will be allowed to come through,"" said lawyer Dan Press. By the time some detainees made it through, they were so exhausted that several fell weeping into the arms of loved ones - to the frenzied glee of the now-enormous protest group. It wasn't all good news. Rumours that deportations took place continued to swirl, though it is unclear how many. The Virginia court decision lasts only a week and Trump's executive order still holds for anyone who did not make it to US shores in time for this brief, legal reprieve. By 11 pm, Said still had no definitive answer about his wife, Leen. She called to say she was being sent back to Turkey, but then later was shuffled off to another room in customs. ""She may come walking out of there for all I know,"" said Said's lawyer. So Said leaned against a wall, eyes fixed on the path out of customs, and waited, as patiently as the previous year.

Who's affected by ban?,"Protests were organized in many US cities On 27 January President Donald Trump signed an executive order halting all refugee admissions and temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries. The move sparked numerous protests and legal challenges. A week later a federal judge in Seattle suspended it nationwide, allowing banned visitors to travel to the US pending an appeal by the administration. Mr Trump and his supporters say the controversial executive order makes good on election promises to ""make America great again"". But what is the order, dubbed the ""Muslim ban"" by those rallying against it, and who exactly does it affect? Here are some key points from thefull text,externalexplained. It brings in a suspension of the US Refugee Admissions Programme for 120 days There is also an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees And anyone arriving from seven Muslim-majority countries - Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen - faces a 90-day visa suspension. Some visa categories, such as diplomats and the UN, are not included in the suspension The order also introduces a cap of 50,000 refugees to be accepted in 2017, against a limit of 110,000 set by former President Barack Obama Priority will be given to religious minorities facing persecution in their countries.In an interview,Mr Trump singled out Christians in Syria Exceptions could be made on a case-by-case basis Victims vent fury World reaction Order sows seeds of panic All travellers who have nationality of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen are not permitted to enter the US for 90 days, or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa. People who have dual nationality with a non-restricted country are not affected, so long as they travel on the passport from the other country. Under the executive order, Green Card holders - permanent legal US residents - from the seven countries were initially subject to the same restrictions, causing widespread concern and confusion. Two days after it was signed, the department for homeland security issueda statement,externalsaying that permanent legal residents would be determined on a case-by-case basis. But, it said, in the absence of significant information that they posed a threat, their permanent legal status would gain them entry to the US. However, on 1 February, Donald McGahn, the legal counsel to the president, then issueda memo,externalsaying the travel ban did not apply to lawful permanent residents of the United States. Mr Trump said the halt on the refugee programme was needed to give government agencies time to develop a stricter vetting system and ensure that visas were not issued to individuals posing a national security threat. ""To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,"" the president said in a statement released on Facebook. ""This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order."" Mr Trump's order has been strongly criticised by rights groups Syrians applying for resettlement in the US were already subject to a complex process of background investigation and security screenings, in a process that could takebetween 18 to 24 months. Mr Priebus said the seven countries had been included because Congress and the Obama administration had identified them as ""the most watched countries harbouring terrorists"". This is being hotly contested through the US court system, with dozens of lawsuits filed, and the issue thought likely to end up in the Supreme Court. Key dates: 3 February:A Seattle federal judge suspends the order nationwide, in response to a challenge by the Washington State attorney general, who argued that the executive order violated a clause in the US constitution that prohibits the favouring of one religion over another. 5 February:A request by Mr Trump's administration for an immediate reinstatement of the order is rejected by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. 9 February:A three-judge panel in the same courtrules,externalunanimously against reinstating the ban, after hearing arguments from lawyers from the Department of Justice and Washington State. In a series of tweets since the Seattle ruling, Mr Trump has criticised the suspension, saying the ruling came from a""so-called judge"",external, and that the courts were""making the job very difficult!"",external, and later describing the courts as ""so political"". After the San Francisco appeals court decision, he tweeted ""SEE YOU IN COURT"". In the past, the US used toban entrants from specific countries and entire regions,external. But in 1965, the US Congress passed theImmigration and Nationality Act,externalwhich said that no person could be ""discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence"". So, the exclusion of all Syrians would be enough to challenge Mr Trump in court. The fact that they are all Muslim countries lends weight to the critics's argument that the order is ""anti-Muslim"". Supporters of Mr Trump's order mentioned the post-9/11 attacks and the ability of the administration to take measures to protect national security. And they cited the president's powers stemming from a1952 law on ""Inadmissible Aliens"",externalto ""suspend the entry"" of ""any class of aliens"" that he finds are detrimental to the interest of the US. They also suggested that US presidents can set aside the 1965 law. The most cited example is that of President Jimmy Carter who barred some Iranians during the 1980 hostage crisis. The order initially triggered a lot confusion and uncertainty. Before its temporary suspension on Friday, a federal judge issued a temporary halt to the deportation of visa holders or refugees stranded at US airports. More than 100 people were detained at airports or in transit Air passengers were prevented from boarding US-bound flights American citizens travelling to the seven countries could be detained for questioning as well in the future, Mr Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said Demonstrations against the order were held in Dallas and other US airports Rights groups say Mr Trump's order targeted Muslims because of their faith and that no refugees had been convicted of terrorism-related crimes. They also said that the most recent attacks in the US were carried out by US nationals or citizens from the countries not included in the travel ban: Fort Lauderdale airport shooting (January 2017):A US citizen Orlando nightclub shooting (June 2016):A US citizen with Afghan parents San Bernardino shooting (December 2015):A US citizen with Pakistani parents, and a Pakistani citizen Chattanooga shootings (July 2015):A Kuwait-born US citizen Charleston church shooting (June 2015):A US citizen Boston marathon bombing (April 2013):Two Russian citizens with Chechen ethnicity Out of the 84,995 refugees that entered the US in 2016, 12,486 were from Syria, according to the Pew Research Center While announcing the plan, Mr Trump cited the attacks of 11 September 2001. But none of the 19 hijackers who committed the attacks came from countries included in the suspension. They were from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Lebanon. Some pointed out that the list did not include countries where President Trump had business interests - like Saudi Arabia - a suggestion dismissed by the president's chief of staff as not related.

Amateur hour at the White House?,"History will have its own take on President Trump's immigration order It's only one week into Donald Trump's presidency, and he already has his first ""heckuva job"" moment. For those who don't remember, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, President George W Bush publicly praised his emergency management head, Michael Brown, for doing a ""heckuva job"" with recovery efforts. That comment was hung around the president's neck like an anvil, as flood waters swamped parts of New Orleans and the city descended into chaos. It started a public approval downward spiral that led to sweeping Democratic victories in the 2006 mid-term elections. History will judge the long-term impact of Mr Trump's Friday afternoon immigration order, but his early praise for its implementation will not easily be forgotten. This video can not be played Protesters shouted ""let them in"" at demonstrations in JFK Airport in New York ""It's working out very nicely,"" Mr Trump said in a brief response to a question on Saturday afternoon. ""You see it in the airports, you see it all over. It's working out very nicely, and we are going to have a very, very strict ban, and we are going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years."" On the ground at major US airports, things weren't going quite so nicely, however. Immigration officials were having a difficult time implementing Mr Trump's order after receiving conflicting instructions on who to bar from entry into the US - and what to do with them once they were held. And as the day progressed, and word spread of the detentions, crowds of protesters at international terminals grew from dozens to hundreds to thousands. While on the campaign trail, it was easy for Mr Trump to roundly decry the US immigration system as broken and make a general call for bans and moratoriums. As president, however, his team has had to fill in the details - and it seems they faced some difficulty translating his pre-election rhetoric into policy. Mr Trump's Friday afternoon executive order reportedly wascrafted without consulting legal aides and enacted over the objection of homeland security officials,external, who balked at including permanent US residents in the ban. This video can not be played President Trump: ""It's not a Muslim ban, but we're totally prepared"" This made for an awkward scene Saturday night at a New York courthouse, where government attorneys had to defend measures that were creating chaos at airports across the nation. ""I think the government hasn't had a full chance to think about this,""said federal judge Ann Donnelly,external, as she ruled that individuals with valid paperwork on US soil couldn't be deported. Her temporary ruling - and those like it in other courts - are only the opening salvo in what will likely be a protracted legal battle. Trump administration lawyers will surely be better prepared in future hearings. The orders could be re-instated following full trials on the merits, and no judge has yet to rule on the fate of individuals who hold valid US visas and are still on foreign soil. In the meantime, however, this has proven to be an embarrassing episode in what looks like a not-ready-for-primetime White House. At a New York courthouse, a judge issued a stay blocking the deportation of travellers who arrive in the US with valid visas A handful of Republicans in Congress have come out with varying levels of objection to the programme, and although the Republican leadership is playing along for the moment, that could change quickly if the political heat increases. The president may have broad powers in setting immigration policy, but Congress can pass legislation that overrules him at any time. Meanwhile, Democrats are scrambling to take advantage of the political opportunity. ""History will judge where America's leaders stood today,"" Democratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois said. It was a warning some of his party's 2020 presidential contenders seemed to take to heart. Senator Elizabeth Warren greets demonstrators protesting against the executive order at Boston's Logan Airport New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered airport trains to resume service to JFK Airport, after transit officials had suspended service to prevent protesters from continuing to flood in. Senator Elizabeth Warren spoke to crowds at Boston's Logan Airport, as did Senator Cory Booker at Dulles near Washington, DC. All three are considered near the top of the Democratic presidential field. 2020 is a long way off, of course. Of more pressing concern is where the Trump administration goes from here. On Sunday morning, press secretary Sean Spicer, chief of staff Reince Priebus and top aide Kellyanne Conway took to the airwaves to defend the White House policy and explain its implementation. Mr Trump himself fired back on Twitter - although only after firsttaking a swipe at the ""failing"" New York Times for the second day in a row,external. ""Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW,""he tweeted,external. ""Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!"" This video can not be played ""I feel he has a reason for doing what he's doing"" said one Staten Island resident While championing US security is usually a winning issue, protracted detention of children and the elderly at airport checkpoints is ""bad optics"", as they say. Watching a five-year-old re-united with his mother and 70-year-olds facing indefinite detention puts a human face on Mr Trump's immigration programme - and the results aren't flattering for the White House. During the presidential primary, a majority of Republican voters backed Mr Trump's calls for a sweeping ban on Muslims entering the US, so the president's core support may hold firm after this weekend's events. The views in the American heartland, far removed from major international airports, sometimes differ greatly from the liberal bastions on the coast. At best, however, this is an unnecessary distraction for the White House, calling its organisational ability into question. At worst - if the majority of the nation turns on the president - Mr Trump may find his power and influence starting to ebb before his administration even gets fully under way.

Travel ban attacked at film awards,"This video can not be played Bryan Cranston: 'We have hard fought civil liberties to protect' Hidden Figures was the surprise winner of the top prize at this year's Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards, which was dominated by anger over Donald Trump's policies on immigration. The film, which tells the true story of black female mathematicians during the 1960s space race, won the best ensemble prize at the Los Angeles ceremony. Denzel Washington was named best actor for Fences. Several winners attacked Mr Trump's ban on immigration from seven countries. The tone was set by host Ashton Kutcher, who began the evening by greeting ""everyone at home and everyone in airports that belong in my America"". ""We're in a really tricky time in our country and things are very inexcusable and scary,"" said Emma Stone as she won the best actress prize for La La Land. Mahershala Ali, meanwhile, spoke about his Muslim faith as he accepted the best supporting actor prize for Moonlight. Mr Trump's executive order, signed on Friday, halted the entire US refugee programme for 120 days, indefinitely banned Syrian refugees, and suspended all nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries. Lithgow and Foy were recognised for playing Winston Churchill and the Queen in The Crown Julia Louis-Dreyfus called the immigration ban ""a blemish"" and ""un-American"" as she won best comedy TV actress for Veep. And there were cheers for actress Taylor Schilling when she described the award-winning cast of Orange is the New Black as ""a diverse group of people, representing generations of families who have sought a better life here"". Denzel Washington's Fences co-star Viola Davis was named best supporting actress at an event where several non-white actors were honoured. Yet the actress told reporters that every black nominee had been shortlisted ""because they deserve to be"" and ""not... because of the colour of their skin."" Meanwhile, Lily Tomlin was presented with a lifetime achievement award by her 9 to 5 co-star Dolly Parton at Sunday's ceremony. This video can not be played Hidden Figures' cast includes Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae and Taraji P Henson There were also awards for John Lithgow and Britain's Claire Foy for their work in The Crown, Netflix's drama about the British royal family.

West Ham hit out as Payet departs,"Payet has not played for West Ham since coming on as a substitute in a 5-0 FA Cup defeat by Manchester City West Ham have accused Dimitri Payet of showing a lack of ""commitment and respect"" after the France international rejoined Marseille for Â£25m. The Hammers insist they did not need to sell Payet and joint-chairman David Sullivan said he wanted the player to stay to ""make an example"" of him. But Sullivan added that manager Slaven Bilic approved the sale in ""the interests of squad unity"". Payet said he needed to ""return to his roots"" at his former club. The 29-year-old has signed a four-and-a-half-year deal with the Ligue 1 club. He said: ""I lived an exceptional year at West Ham, I have a great memory of the fans of the club. ""Going back to Marseille is a personal choice. I no longer felt well at West Ham, I needed to return to my roots. ""Marseille is a very pleasant city to live in."" Joint-chairman David Sullivan The club would like to place on record its sincere disappointment that Dimitri Payet did not show the same commitment and respect to West Ham United that the club and fans showed him, particularly when it rewarded him with a lucrative new five-and-a-half-year deal only last year. I would like to make it clear that we have no financial need to sell our best players and that the decision to allow Payet to leave was in accordance with the wishes of the manager and the interests of squad unity. To be frank, my board and I would have preferred for him to have stayed in order to make an example of him, as no player is bigger than the club. I am confident that with the quality of the players we have brought in during January already, the squad will be stronger at the end of this transfer window than it was at the start. The attacking midfielder joined West Ham from Marseille for Â£10.7m in June 2015 and signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract in February 2016. He excelled in his first season with the London club, scoring 12 goals and earning a nomination for the PFA Players' Player of the Year award. During the 2015-16 season West Ham won 50% of the Premier League games that Payet played in, but just one of the eight matches he missed. He then helped France reach the final of Euro 2016, where the hosts were beaten by Portugal. Dimitri Payet was far less influential to West Ham this season This season Payet's influence on the Hammers has waned, with the team winning three of the four games he has missed but only 27.8% of those he has featured in. However, statistics suggest that his individual displays have not changed drastically. Over 90 minutes he averaged 3.27 shots this season compared to 2.42 last term, created 4.4 chances per game compared to 4.17 last season and had more touches and a better passing accuracy this season. He also made more sprints per game this season and covered just 100m less per match (10.3km to 10.4km). Bilic said earlier this month that Payet, who has scored three goals this season, did not want to play for the club any more. West Ham insisted he would not be sold, but after rejecting two bids from Marseille andsigning Robert Snodgrass,they decided to sell the France international on Sunday. As well as the purchase of Snodgrass this month, the Hammers have also signed centre-back Jose Fonte from Southampton for Â£8m.

Hungry penguins help keep car code safe,"Penguins would starve if they had not figured out efficient feeding strategies Hungry penguins have inspired a novel way of making sure computer code in smart cars does not crash. Tools based on the way the birds co-operatively hunt for fish are being developed to test different ways of organising in-car software. The tools look for safe ways to organise code in the same way that penguins seek food sources in the open ocean. Experts said such testing systems would be vital as cars get more connected. Engineers have often turned to nature for good solutions to tricky problems, said Prof Yiannis Papadopoulos, a computer scientist at the University of Hull who, together with Dr Youcef Gheraibia from Algeria, developed the penguin-inspired testing system. The way ants pass messages among nest-mates has helped telecoms firms keep telephone networks running, and many robots get around using methods of locomotion based on the ways animals move. Penguins were another candidate, said Prof Papadopoulos, because millions of years of evolution has helped them develop very efficient hunting strategies. This was useful behaviour to copy, he said, because it showed that penguins had solved a tricky optimisation problem - how to ensure as many penguins as possible get enough to eat. ""Penguins are social birds and we know they live in colonies that are often very large and can include hundreds of thousands of birds. This raises the question of how can they sustain this kind of big society given that together they need a vast amount of food. ""There must be something special about their hunting strategy,"" he said, adding that an inefficient strategy would mean many birds starved. Prof Papadopoulos said many problems in software engineering could be framed as a search among all hypothetical solutions for the one that produces the best results. Evolution, through penguins and many other creatures, has already searched through and discarded a lot of bad solutions. Studies of hunting penguins have hinted at how they organised themselves. As cars get more connected and autonomous they will have more software onboard ""They forage in groups and have been observed to synchronise their dives to get fish,"" said Prof Papadopoulos. ""They also have the ability to communicate using vocalisations and possibly convey information about food resources."" The communal, co-ordinated action helps the penguins get the most out of a hunting expedition. Groups of birds are regularly reconfigured to match the shoals of fish and squid they find. It helps the colony as a whole optimise the amount of energy they have to expend to catch food. ""This solution has generic elements which can be abstracted and be used to solve other problems,"" he said, ""such as determining the integrity of software components needed to reach the high safety requirements of a modern car."" Integrity in this sense means ensuring the software does what is intended, handles data well, and does not introduce errors or crash. By mimicking penguin behaviour in a testing system which seeks the safest ways to arrange code instead of shoals of fish, it becomes possible to slowly zero in on the best way for that software to be structured. The Hull researchers working with Dr Gheraibia turned to search tools based on the collaborative foraging behaviour of penguins. The foraging-based system helped to quickly search through the many possible ways software can be specified to home in on the most optimal solutions in terms of safety and cost. Modern car production unites parts and code from many different sources Currently, complex software was put together and tested manually, with only experience and engineering judgement to guide it, said Prof Papadopoulos. While this could produce decent results it could consider only a small fraction of all possible good solutions. The penguin-based system could crank through more solutions and do a better job of assessing which was best, he said. Mike Ahmadi, global director of critical systems security at Synopsys, which helps vehicle-makers secure code, said modern car manufacturing methods made optimisation necessary. ""When you look at a car today, it's essentially something that's put together from a vast and extended supply chain,"" he said. Building a car was about getting sub-systems made by different manufacturers to work together well, rather than being something made wholly in one place. That was a tricky task given how much code was present in modern cars, he added. Algorithms based on the way ants communicate have helped telecoms firms organise networks ""There's about a million lines of code in the average car today and there's far more in connected cars."" Carmakers were under pressure, said Mr Ahmadi, to adapt cars quickly so they could interface with smartphones and act as mobile entertainment hubs, as well as make them more autonomous. ""From a performance point of view carmakers have gone as far as they can,"" he said. ""What they have discovered is that the way to offer features now is through software."" Security would become a priority as cars got smarter and started taking in and using data from other cars, traffic lights and online sources, said Nick Cook from software firm Intercede, which is working with carmakers on safe in-car software. ""If somebody wants to interfere with a car today then generally they have to go to the car itself,"" he said. ""But as soon as it's connected they can be anywhere in the world. ""Your threat landscape is quite significantly different and the opportunity for a hack is much higher.""

Awkward moments on the red carpet,"Politically-charged speeches were the order of the day at this year's Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards, with many attendees choosing to speak out against President Trump's controversial immigration ban. Yet that wasn't the only talking point at the Los Angeles ceremony, which also saw some more light-hearted moments, the odd surprise - and more than one fashion catastrophe. Here are seven things that grabbed our attention. Kidman was up for a supporting actress award but lost out to Fences' Viola Davis The Oscar-winning star of Moulin Rouge turned heads on the red carpet by wearing two of them on her shoulders. The Australian actress - who was up for an award for her work in Lion - frocked up in a green Gucci gown adorned with feathered parrot heads. The dress saw her crowned by some media as theworst-dressed star,externalat the event and quickly had people squawking in the Twittersphere. ""Every night in America should end with Nicole Kidman in a bird dress,"" wrote Vanity Fair columnistRichard Lawson,external. Will someone try to top her bold fashion choice at Hollywood's next awards bash? After all, toucan play at that game. Ryder was among those recognised for their contribution to sci-fi series Stranger Things Stranger Things actor David Harbour gave an impassioned speech when the show won its best ensemble award, calling on his fellow ""craftsmen and women"" to ""battle against fear, self-centredness and exclusivity"". But his thunder was stolen somewhat by the facial expressions sported by his co-star Winona Ryder as she stood beside him. Initially surprised at the weight of her prize statuette, the 45-year-old went on to emote delight, amazement and confusion before raising her fist in what appeared to be a mock salute. The faces that launched a thousand gifs ""Next time Trump gives a speech, make Winona Ryder stand next to him and translate for all of us through her facial expressions,"" wrote the TV criticEmily Nussbaum,external. Harbour himself made reference to his co-star afterwards, describing the memes and gifs she had unwittingly generated as ""epic,external"". Newton had been nominated for a best actress prize for her work in Westworld Stranger Things's success came at the expense of another highly regarded sci-fi show that had also begun the evening with three nominations. The TV makeover of Michael Crichton's Westworld ended up a bridesmaid though, missing out in all three categories in which it was shortlisted. As well as missing out on the outstanding ensemble in a drama series prize, the show was also pipped to a stuntwork prize by Game of Thrones. Thandie Newton, meanwhile, had to applaud politely when fellow Brit Claire Foy received the best actress in a drama series award. But the 44-year-old made light of being passed over, postinga humorous picture on Twitter,externalof herself necking a bottle of champagne. Macy previously won a SAG award for his Shameless role in 2015 Even William H Macy was surprised when he beat Transparent's Jeffrey Tambor to the award for outstanding performance by a male actor in a comedy series. ""I'm shocked,"" the Shameless star told the audience. ""I'm probably not as shocked as Jeffrey, but I'm pretty shocked."" Macy went on to ""thank President Trump for making Frank Gallagher"" - the debauched single father he plays in the Showtime TV series - ""seem so normal"". Felicity Huffman, Macy's actress wife,tweeted a picture,externalof her own delight at her husband's third SAG win. Meryl Streep got a shout-out on Sunday from The Crown award-winner John Lithgow, who dedicated part of his acceptance speech to praise her for her much-publicisedTrump tiradeat the Golden Globes. ""I would like to honour... a great and underrated actress who somehow managed to speak my exact thoughts three weeks ago at another awards ceremony, and that's Meryl Streep,"" said the 71-year-old. Meryl Streep adjusts Ryan Gosling's tie at the Screen Actors Guild awards Streep - who was up for the best actress prize for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins - got additional love after photos were taken of her reaching over to straighten Ryan Gosling's dickie bow.

Lucas Hedges and Casey Affleck were both nominated for their work in Manchester by the Sea Manchester by the Sea - a cheery tale about a janitor coping with a series of tragic bereavements - had gone into Sunday's awards with the most nominations -four in all. Yet Kenneth Lonergan's film went away empty-handed when Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges and Michelle Williams were all beaten in their respective awards categories. The film also missed out on the outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture prize - the SAG equivalent of a best picture award. Affleck's failure to win the best actor award - a prize won by Denzel Washington instead - was one of the bigger upsets of the night. Not everyone was sad to see Ben Affleck's little brother miss out for once following a string of successes at other awards ceremonies. though: ""Denzel winning over Casey Affleck at the SAG Awards is the best thing I've heard today,""wrote one Twitter user,external.

""This award came just in the nick of time."" The 77-year-old went on to offer such safe words of actorly advice as ""don't be anxious about missing an opportunity"" and ""don't leave the house when you're drunk"". ""Live your life so that when you are being honoured for your achievements, the people called upon to make laudatory remarks can feel reasonably honest about their comments,'' she went on.

Fake news: 'A war on alternative media',"This video can not be played MPs are launching a parliamentary inquiry into the ""growing phenomenon of fake news"". The Culture, Media and Sport Committee said it would investigate concerns about the public being swayed by propaganda and untruths. Sean Adl-Tabataba, editor-in-chief of Yournewswire.com, told theToday programmethis is a war on ""alternative media"". A story by his website saying the Queen was threatening to abdicate should Britain leave the EU was shared on Facebook over 23,000 times. It was also untrue. Culture secretary Damian Collins says it's important consumers know when stories are coming from legitimate news sources. So does Mr Adl-tabataba think he is a purveyor of fake news?

Calling out lies,"There may be actual solutions to the spread of fake news. Fake news - from false celebrity gossip to the fabricated story of Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump - became a huge issue during the US election campaign. Those who peddled falsehoods were motivated sometimes by profit and sometimes by politics. British parliamentarians arelaunchinga committee to look at the problem.  But globally, there are various methods being offered to fix it. The team behind BBC World Hacks -our news solutions-focussed journalism unit-  has been looking into some of the most promising potential solutions. Facebook, which came underheavy criticismfor allowing fake news to be circulated during the election period, have taken steps to offer combat the issue. One of those steps is the enlisting of the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN), a branch of the Florida-based journalism think tankPoynter,external. Facebook users in the US and Germany can now flag articles they think are deliberately false, these will then go to third-party fact checkers signed up with the IFCN. Those fact checkers come from media organisations like the Washington Post and websites such as the urban legend debunking siteSnopes.com,external. The third-party fact checkers, says IFCN director Alexios Mantzarlis ""look at the stories that users have flagged as fake and if they fact check them and tag them as false, these stories then get a disputed tag that stays with them across the social network."" Another warning appears if users try to share the story, although Facebook doesn't prevent such sharing or delete the fake news story. The ""fake"" tag will however negatively impact the story's score in Facebook's algorithm, meaning that fewer people will see it pop up in their news feeds. Mantzarlis says there is as of yet no firm evidence that this actually stops fake news spreading on a large scale, and there are questions over how sustainable the programme might be. Facebook is not paying the IFCN members to provide fact-checking services. There's also nothing stopping the fake news from being posted and spread in the first place - and perhaps quite widely before being tagged. ""There is a lag, so until and unless a story is flagged as false that story does continue to spread on the social network,"" says Mantzarlis. A screenshot of how Facebook's fact-checking system appears to users in the US and Germany In 2009,Le Monde,external, one of the biggest French newspapers, set up a fact-checking unit calledLes Decodeurs,external(The Decoders). Increasingly the unit is turning its attention to fake news, and they've devised a web extension called Decodex. ""You just put it on your browser and then when you come to a fake news site you get a pop up appearing saying 'warning this is a fake news site',"" says Samuel Laurent, editor of Les Decodeurs. ""If you click on the tool you will have access to a little paper describing the website and saying why we think it's not trustworthy."" The extension is linked to a database that Les Decodeurs has compiled which ranks sites as ""fake"", ""real"" or ""satire"". But there are several hurdles which likely prevent a relatively simple piece of software from being the silver bullet for fake news. Users firstly have to be aware of the problem of false stories. They have to know about the extension and be concerned enough to download it. And they have to trust Le Monde journalists and the paper's centre-left perspective. ""We know that we won't convince everyone and we know that fake news readers already think we are the fake news,"" Laurent says. ""Our goal is to just provide this tool for people who are really sceptical or who just don't know who to trust. ""People who have already fallen into the fake news vortex, it's too late for them."" Algorithms are part of what spreads fake news - because juicy yet false stories which become popular can be pushed out to new eyeballs by the software that runs social networks. But some programmers think computer code could also be part of the solution. ""From an algorithmic perspective it's possible for social media sites to recognise that website was only created two weeks ago, therefore it's probably likely that this is a less trustworthy site,"" says Claire Wardle of journalism non-profit First Draft News. First Draft,externalis working with Google and Facebook to explore whether they could incorporate code to stop the spread of fake news. Wardle is adamant that tweaking algorithms is not like censorship. ""I'm talking about a bit like a spam folder in your email, those emails still sit there, but you have to go to your spam folder to look for it,"" she says. But human language and news stories are complicated in ways that computers have difficulty dealing with, and any automated method of fact checking risks reflecting the biases of the programmers who created it. ""There are some very smart people looking at automated solutions now, around automated fact checking, which can get up to about 80% accurate,"" Wardle says. ""I would argue we are always going to need human eyes at the very end to say 'hang on, have we got entirely duped'â¦ we want a combination of algorithms and human experience.""

His proposal would incorporate digital literacy into school curriculums. ""We already have a curriculum right now that teaches critical thinking skills but it hasn't kept up with the digital age,"" says Dodd, a Democratic lawmakers who has introduced a bill in the California state senate. Senator Dodd admits not all the detail has yet been worked out, and it it would be the job of the California Board of Education to update the curriculum, but he has some of what might be included, including ""trying to discern what the reputation of different sources are. ""If you are dealing with the BBC or the New York Times, chances are you don't have to go any further, but if you are dealing with some unnamed source, you are going to have to go in a little deeper to determine whether or not that's fact or fiction,"" he says. And of course, his solution would take years to implement, and would apply to just one state in one country. ""There's so much news coming at kids, and many adults have this as well, but you got to start somewhere,"" Dodd says. Visit theTrending Facebook page,external During the US election, many fake news stories were written not by politically motivated Donald Trump supporters, but by people looking to make some quick cash. And so one way to stop such output would be to eliminate the financial incentives that make fake news profitable. ""To make any decent money, and a lot of the fake news sites do make decent money, you need to start serving millions of ads,"" says Cliff Lampe, an associate professor at the University of Michigan, ""which is why the viral content market has been so important over the last few years."" In November, Google and Facebook announced moves torestrict advertisements on fake news stories,external. But fake news producers, like others making content designed to go viral, are quick to adapt to platform rule changes. ""I think this will work for the moment, but I believe that people are going to be able to come up with a workaround and be able to manipulate that attention market in the future,"" Lampe says. In addition to removing the carrot, there's some big sticks being considered. In Germany, for instance, lawmakers are even proposingcriminalising people who post fake news,external.

Abandoned,"Police and social services were baffled when an elderly man with an American accent was found lost on the streets of the English city of Hereford. He didn't know who he was or have any ID, and he was dressed in brand new clothes from Tesco. The quest to find out who he was had results that nobody could have predicted. It was 7 November 2015 when the man was found in a bus station car park. Tests at the county hospital showed why he wasn't able to reveal his identity - he had dementia. Sgt Sarah Bennett, from West Mercia police, was tasked with finding out who the mystery man was. She initially assumed it would be a formality. Dementia patients regularly go missing and most are found in hours. But when she checked missing persons' reports locally she couldn't find anybody listed matching his description, so she expanded her search nationwide. The abandoned man in hospital Police trawled through CCTV, launched an appeal through the press appeal, contacted the national crime agency and Interpol. Missing persons' databases in the UK and abroad were checked and the Canadian and US authorities were contacted. Nothing. While in hospital the man was repeatedly asked his name. Once, and once only, he replied ""Roger Curry."" The police were aware it might not be his name at all - it might, for example, be someone from his past. Watch Panorama: The Mystery of the Unknown Man on Monday 30 January at 20:30 on BBC One. You can catch up after broadcast via theiPlayer Even so, he was called Roger by staff of the residential nursing home he was moved to while investigations continued. Months passed, but the police still had no idea who Roger really was. They looked at a number of possibilities. Was he being cared for by someone locally and something happened to the carer? Had they died and Roger simply wandered off? ""We have a person.  We have a possible name but we have nothing else.  We have no identity documents - no indication of where he's from,"" said Sgt Bennett. Amanda Bow with Roger in the nursing home One afternoon in March 2016 I visited Roger at the nursing home. He looked content, even though he was clearly lost in his own world.  I asked him his name and where he was from. But the questions, never mind the answers, were beyond him. He seemed a gentle sort, just very lost. Roger was clearly well looked after. Staff had fallen in love with this gentleman who enjoyed chocolate muffins and the odd sherry at night. Amanda Bow, the manager of the nursing home, said that they'd learned nothing about Roger since he arrived there. ""He's a blank canvas, completely blank,"" she told me. But she said tears would be shed if he was eventually identified and had to leave.  ""It'll be devastating, because he's our Roger. We've adopted him."" Darragh MacIntyre with Jim - a former classmate of Earl Roger Curry - and his wife Helen Shortly after, a BBC Midlands news bulletin put out a fresh appeal. It led to the first breakthrough. The report had a big response from viewers and inspired a small army of social media sleuths to investigate. One post on a BBC Facebook page was particularly intriguing. A woman called Debbie Cocker posted a photograph of a man called Earl Roger Curry, from a 1958 US high school yearbook. The photograph was of an 18-year-old man. He looked a bit like Roger and was about the same age. Roger Curry in his 1958 high school yearbook The yearbook picture was from Edmonds High School. Edmonds is just north of Seattle, in the northwest state of Washington. I travelled there to meet a woman called Helen who looked after the web pages for the class of 1958 Edmonds High School. Helen was in the same school year as Roger, and her husband Jim was in the same class. Both Helen and Jim believed that young man in the yearbook picture was the same person as the unknown man in the English nursing home. Over the next weeks, I traced Earl Roger Curry down the US west coast to a house in Los Angeles, in an area called Whittier. It's a classic American suburb (the movie Back To The Future was filmed there), and the street where I believed Roger lived was the very picture of middle-class respectability. But Earl Roger Curry's house stood out - an eyesore in an otherwise prosperous area. It had been badly damaged by fire and abandoned. The Currys' fire-damaged house Jerry Maiques lives opposite the old Curry home. I showed him pictures of Roger taken in the nursing home in England. ""That's Roger."" No hesitation. ""No question about it. No doubt."" Another neighbour also recognised Roger. It was the end of the search, but it marked the start of another mission - to find out how Roger was apparently abandoned halfway around the world. No-one here imagined that he could have travelled to England on his own. Everyone we spoke to had only good things to say about Roger. Another neighbour, Jennifer Apon, said: ""I'd see him come and go from work. He would wear white scrubs, so I knew he was a nurse."" She liked him: ""He just seemed like a very wonderful, kind family man and I just had a very good feeling around him."" The more we talked the more we learned. Roger was married with two grown-up children, but trouble and illness had haunted the family. Apart from Roger's dementia, his wife Mary Jo is also unwell. Their son Kevin acted as their carer in recent years but not so long ago he hadn't been welcome at the family home. Zania, a neighbour, described the relationship between Kevin and his parents as ""volatile"". ""You could hear him [Kevin] at all different hours of the night just pounding on their door trying to get in screaming and yelling at them profanities, we worried for their safety,"" she said. In 2014 their home was badly damaged in a fire and fenced off by the local authorities. No-one was home at the time of the fire but Roger and his wife moved out - the neighbours didn't see them again until one sweltering August morning in 2015. Jerry Maiques, a neighbour of the Currys Shortly after 06:00, Jerry saw Roger walking aimlessly behind the chain link fence guarding the family home. Jerry climbed the fence only to find Mary Jo lying on an inflatable mattress outside in the backyard of the burnt-out house. A cool box packed with food and water was close by. It had been 32 degrees the previous day. Another hot day was forecast. The couple were locked behind the fence and couldn't get out, so Jerry called the police. It emerged that Kevin had been bringing them food and he was suspected of locking them in behind the gate. But Kevin wasn't prosecuted. His mom told police it was her idea. They took no further action. All this happened just three months before Roger was found in England. While I was talking to Jerry outside his home, he spotted Roger's son Kevin, and his mother Mary Jo, parking across the street. We registered the alarm on her face. She looked frightened. Kevin stared, then they drove off quickly. Kevin Curry It emerged that Kevin was a complicated character. A restraining order was taken against him 17 years ago by his father. Did Kevin abandon his father in Britain? It's not unheard of in the States. They call it ""granny dumping"" - abandoning your elderly relatives to avoid the costly medical bills. I phoned Kevin. I wrote to him. He didn't get back to me. But I did manage to find his sister, Jeanette, who I knew had been estranged from the family for some years. The 27-year-old was upset when I told her about her father. She knew nothing about him turning up in England but thought Kevin could have arranged it. Her biggest worry though was that he might be returned to LA. As far as she was concerned he was safe and well in Britain. Back in the UK, the authorities were brought up to date about these new facts. Within two days a man was arrested in England. US social services and the FBI joined the investigation. Then in July 2016, Roger Curry was taken from the nursing home he'd been staying in for the previous eight months and quietly flown back to the US. A few weeks ago I flew back to Los Angeles. Roger was now living in a nursing home a few miles from his Los Angeles home. I walked straight in but nearly didn't recognise him. He appeared dishevelled - unwashed and thinner than I remembered. This video can not be played Roger's son Kevin wouldn't speak to the BBC on camera He also had what appeared to be a cut on the crown of his head. When I visited a second time he looked better. Shaven and washed. But again I had walked in - unchallenged - and there didn't seem to be anything to stop Roger wandering away. I still didn't know how he travelled to Britain in the first place, but I believed his son, Kevin knew the truth. I eventually found him at the remains of the family home. He ran and hid in the property before later agreeing to answer my questions. He called me inside the fence to talk but what he told me made little sense. He denied that he had anything to do with the abandonment of his father in England. He said his father became ill when they were visiting England on a holiday and that he asked someone to take him to hospital. But this account didn't add up.  Why hadn't he tried to find his father all those months he was in care? When he later emerged from behind the fence he'd pulled his jacket hood over his face. I asked him again for one proper interview but he accused me of harassing him before driving off - very slowly, because he couldn't see where he was going. It was the strangest of getaways. Roger's future is now being decided by US courts. The Los Angeles authorities have taken control of his care. That's being challenged by Kevin and his mother but the legal papers show that the authorities accuse them of taking Roger to the UK and abandoning him there. We now know that all three flew into the UK in November 2015, but only two flew home. An elderly and vulnerable man was dumped overseas by his family. The mystery has been solved. But this isn't the ending to Roger's story that anybody expected or even wanted. And now - as Roger faces an unknown future - I'm left wondering whether he'd have been better off had his identity been left undiscovered.

Costly habit,"Australia was the first country in the world to introduce mandatory plain packaging for tobacco products - and the UK will have followed suit by May this year. But will any country copy Australia's plan to keep increasing taxes until a packet of cigarettes costs AUD$40 (Â£24)? It's not easy being a smoker in Australia. The smoking bans started inside - in workplaces, bars and restaurants - and moved out. ""Smokers would congregate on footpaths and near public transport creating clouds of smoke - what we call 'smoking hotspots',"" says Mark Driver, Sydney's Park and Recreation Planner. ""Now, smoking is prohibited within 10m (33ft) of a playground, within 4m (13ft) of the entrance to a public building, at rail platforms, taxi ranks and bus stops."" Those are the rules in New South Wales, but they are mirrored in many other states. Smoking is banned on many beaches, and most Australian states have now banned cigarettes in jail. All states ban smoking in vehicles if children are present. Fines vary, but in some places you may be fined AUD$2,000 (Â£1,210) if you smoke in the wrong place. And even if you don't, you'll be paying more than that each year by 2020, if you smoke just one AUD$40 pack a week. It's already five years since Australia became the first place in the world to make plain cigarette packaging compulsory. Tobacco-advertising has long been banned, and now branding has too. The boxes are a drab, dark brown colour (deemed the ugliest in the world by a team of Australian researchers), they carry no logos, and graphic health warnings cover most of the front of the box. ""You see this gigantic, see-and-never-forget kind of image of throat cancer - a hole in the neck, or what a stroke looks like with a brain sliced open,"" Chapman explains. ""Some smokers say they don't even look at it, but there has been research which shows that with the people who engage in those avoidance strategies, it's actually a predictor of them quitting later on."" All this came on top of anti-smoking campaigns that have been driving down smoking rates in Australia since the 1970s. ""It's a toxic, poisonous mix of substances, including ammonia, the bleach in toilet cleaner; acetone, the chemical in nail polish remover; benzene, found in paint stripper; and hydrogen cyanide, used in rat poison,"" went one advertisement. ""And smoking delivers it straight to your body."" ""The evidence shows that these hard-hitting, graphic ads that really show the harms of smoking are some of the most effective,"" says Scott Walsberger, head of tobacco control at Cancer Council NSW. But other campaigns have also tried a gentler approach, emphasising how quickly a smoker's health starts to improve once he or she has quit. It was this approach that was taken by the creators of an interactive, behavioural change app called My Quit Buddy, launched in 2012. Offering tips for giving up, daily motivational messages, distractions to overcome cravings, and a place to share success stories and celebrate milestones, it has now been downloaded more than 400,000 times in Australia alone. In a world where a lot is going wrong, there is also a lot going right. So, what if you could build a country with policies that actually worked, by homing in on ideas from around the world that have been truly successful? Listen toMy Perfect Countryon the BBC World Service Ordownload the podcast Email the programme,external ""It shows people that just by even quitting for five days, you can start to see changes - you'll have more money in your wallet, your skin becomes clearer,"" says Paul Den, one of My Quit Buddy's creators. ""And the community forum shows people that they're not alone - people generally trust other people more than they trust the government."" The cumulative effect of these policies is that smoking rates for adults have almost halved since 1980, says Henrietta Moore, of the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College, London, and are now at about 13%, compared to a global average of about 20%. There has also been a decrease of almost 23% in the rate of hospital admissions caused by smoking. Simone Dennis, an associate professor at Australian National University, says a culture of shame surrounding smoking has begun to emerge, and that itself has become a smoking deterrent. Take, for example, the policy of confining smokers to areas where they will not create a public nuisance. ""If you think about smoking in public, those tend to be spaces that no-one wants to hang out in anyway,"" she says. ""So smokers feel marginalised because they can't be citizens in public spaces any more, because they're restricted to these kind of 'dirty spaces.'"" The government has committed to reduce the number of adults smoking on a daily basis to 10% by 2018 Plain-packaging rules insist that 75% of the front of a cigarette pack is covered by a health warning, and 90% of the back Tobacco taxes rose 25% in 2010, and are now rising 12.5% every year The Tasmanian parliament has discussed a bill that would ban smoking for those born after 2000 Australia has not gone as far as Bhutan, andreportedly also Turkmenistan, which have banned the sale of tobacco products Read:The battle for control of the cigarette packet These days, smoking is often taken up by people who are on the lowest rungs of the socio-economic ladder, she points out, ""and that adds a burden of shame to people who might already be marginalised"". If it's the poor who are now the most likely to smoke, it's hard to see how they will ever afford the AUD$40 pack of cigarettes.

From relief to regret,"On Thursday we published the story of Diane Munday, who had an abortion before the change in the law - 50 years ago - which made it legal in Britain. In responseto her story, many women sent emails with their own experiences of abortion over the last half century and more. Here are a selection. I was 20 when I had an abortion in 1982.  My boyfriend was black and my parents would not have approved.  I'd already left home at 18 and was living with him without their knowledge when I became pregnant.  I ignored it for quite a while and when I eventually went to a hospital clinic to discuss abortion they sent me away and told me I was old enough to have a baby.  I didn't know what to do until I contacted the Pregnancy Advisory Service  who put me in touch with a charity that paid for it to be done privately.  By this time I was around 18 weeks pregnant and only just within the timescales for a legal abortion.  I think I went ahead because I panicked about the consequences and felt completely unable to cope with bringing up a child.  Sometimes I regret my decision as I never got pregnant again but it's something I live with.Jackie It was 1996 and I lived in South America. I was 16 years old  when I found I was pregnant. My father had died the year before and my family of six siblings and my mother was struggling with poverty. Some days we used to have dinner 10 pm after my mum brought home money she had earned cleaning people's houses. My older sisters promised to support me if I chose to have an abortion and so did my mum. The ultimate decision was mine. My boyfriend's father came to see my mum the following day with the money to pay for a backstreet abortion. It almost seemed the logical thing to do. And then my mum out of nowhere refused the money and decided to do not allow me to have the abortion. And the truth is: I was relieved.  I needed someone willing to believe that it was possible for me to keep my child. I needed an excuse to do it. I did not feel until my mother stood up for my pregnancy that I had the right to say ""I want to have this baby."" Last December he became a 20-year-old smart and caring boy. My life as a teen mother was hard. But it was hard even before he came to my life.Maria, London I'm now 38, I'm a paediatric sister on a high-dependency unit. I had two abortions at 17 and 18 years old, they were both with the same partner, and the relationship ended after the second abortion. I now have a three-year-old daughter who I had wanted for several years - my husband and I had three attempts at IVF and we are very lucky. I have never regretted having the abortions, even in later years when infertility played a big part in my life. I still feel guilty and somehow my punishment was my two failed IVF treatments. But I know that I made the right decision 21 years ago. I do think about how old they would be from time to time, and they are in my thoughts at times.Laura, Birmingham I was booked to have a abortion in 2015, after being put under pressure, and already having a very young child. I cancelled my abortion the day before it was due, and honestly wouldn't change a thing now. My baby, who was due to be aborted, is happy and healthy. I suffered serious mental health problems back then and having this abortion would have made it much much worse. My miracle baby is now one, and due to be a big brother himself very soon.Sophie, Birmingham I have had two abortions. For me, both were sad experiences, but I will always defend my right to a safe termination and in no way do I feel guilty, though the grief remains with me. The second termination was for a very much wanted girl who was found to have Edwards Syndrome (described as ""incompatible with life""). After much, deep thought I took the decision that it was kinder to her to have her life brought to a close while still tiny rather than either be stillborn or die a few days after birth. It was heartbreaking for me, but I am certain it was the best outcome for her, the most humane, to protect her from future pain. Some people may find this shocking - but it's none of their business. My great-grandmother died of an illegal abortion in 1901. My grandpa was an orphan at 18 months old. Safe abortion should be a woman's choice and right.Sue I was forced to have an abortion by my then boyfriend. He was violent and controlling and I found out after having the abortion that he was married. Over time I have mixed emotions, sometimes I am relieved I had an abortion but I mostly feel guilt. I already had one child from another partner and the abortion experience left me with the feeling that I would not have any more children. I did go on to have another child with my now husband and the feelings of guilt were dreadful. I love my children dearly and hated myself for ending a pregnancy.  I have recently had a miscarriage and the feeling of guilt is back. I have thought my miscarriage is karma for my abortion. I can't change the past and have to live with my decision. It was a terribly difficult decision to make and should not be made lightly. I have only told my mum and husband about the abortion as the stigma is terrible.Louise, Staffordshire I am currently pregnant with our fourth child, unplanned. I had two appointments for an abortion but couldn't do it - it would be awful if my children ever found out that I had terminated their younger sibling. However, I'm not nesting and am not particularly excited about this baby. My husband was very upset about it and really wanted me to abort. However, I (we?) trust that in a year or two the dust will have settled and we'll have become used to a larger family. I think that it's so important women have open access to abortion services. However, I worry that abortion has become normalised for men who view it as an emergency contraception, whilst for women it's still a very taboo subject. I would never tell anyone that I can booked in for an abortion but, statistically, I must know many women who have had terminations and don't talk about them. If you use this, please publish it anonymously.Anonymous I almost had an abortion in 1981. I was unmarried and it was an unplanned pregnancy. The doctor I saw at the hospital was not very kind and I found myself saying that I would not have an abortion in response. My daughter was born in Jan 1982. I don't regret having her and I am very proud of the woman she has become but I do regret having become pregnant as I was too young and too unsettled to have a child at that time. I found that I was blamed for the pregnancy and my partner was not. There was still a stigma against unmarried mothers at that time and I did feel quite alone. The ward sister, when I had a c-section, was particularly nasty and I was not as tough then as I am now and did not stand up for myself.  I believe very strongly in a woman's right to choose and for better sex education and access to birth control for all girls and women.Beth, Cambridge I became pregnant at the age of 24 and was delighted at first, even though my partner was mentally unstable and both psychologically and physically abusive.  The relationship broke down and I left, but because of the pregnancy I went back to try once more.  It was soon clear nothing would ever improve, and I decided very regretfully on an abortion. I had grown up in a two-parent family and felt most strongly that a baby would need both a mother and a father to care for it. I also had no funds to raise a child in my mother's tiny home. I was prepared to end my own life to escape the situation and I let the doctors know this. While my mother was keeping me company in hospital when the termination was taking place - sadly late at around 20 weeks - she shared that she herself had a late backstreet abortion in the early 1940s, before she and my father could get married.  It had made her very ill and she really disliked anything to do with childbirth.  My experience in 1980, although scary and sad, was far less traumatic and did not affect my health.  Thanks to a more merciful culture, I was free to enjoy giving birth later to three healthy babies in a stable and loving marriage.Clare I feel that the two doctors approval is an important safety net to prevent women and girls from being forced into terminations against their will... as I was when my parents forced me to have an abortion when I was 16. Unfortunately this rule was not adhered to in my case - I never saw anyone who presented themselves as a doctor and I was never seen alone. I am strongly pro-choice even though mine was taken away; I am immensely grateful that this is a freedom we have.H, Taunton I had an abortion when I was 19, in 1997. When I arrived at the clinic there were protesters outside. I am married to the man who got me pregnant and now have two beautiful children. We had only been together for three months when I got pregnant and were using birth control. I don't regret the decision we made because I don't think we would have made it as a couple. We were far too young and didn't know each other enough. I would have ended up as another single mother. Nineteen years later we are very happy.Toni, Stafford I had an abortion.  I was 18, 1961, it was illegal.  My husband (we were newly weds) managed to find an abortionist through a friend.  It was the syringe and dettol water job, I was aware and conscious throughout.  It did not work immediately, and the abortionist sent me home, frightened she would be located and found.  The abortion happened hours later,  bloodily and horribly.  I was over four months pregnant because we had been unable to find help before.  I had no bad medical effects afterwards, and never doubted what we did.  My husband (now ex) has never recovered from what he saw that day, and having to dispose of the foetus.  Of course abortion is never ""good"" but it is frequently necessary.Sue, Fleet I was 21 the first time I fell pregnant. I'd only been with my boyfriend a couple of months and I was eight months off completing my final exams at university. I knew straight away what I needed to do, and with the support of my (visibly scared) boyfriend I had a medical abortion a couple of weeks later at the local hospital. I told a few friends and the next day I told my mother who wasn't as sympathetic as I'd hoped. Unfortunately, two years later it happened again - I was still with the same boyfriend and we were now in low-paid jobs but there was no way we could have taken care of a baby. This time I asked for a surgical abortion. And this time I only told one close friend. Ten years later and we are still together, we now have good careers and own our own home. We also have a one-year-old son who is the light of our lives. Absolutely no regrets.E, Cardiff I had an abortion three weeks before I was due to start university, and I simultaneously regret and don't regret the decision. It's sometimes hard to think of what my four-year-old child would be like now. Emotionally I wasn't ready for a baby. Financially, I wasn't read for a baby. Selfishly, I wasn't ready for a baby. I was 20, with my life ahead of me. Yes, a baby would have interrupted my career plans, but at the forefront of my decision was the fact that I was having those thoughts in the first place; if I had a child I would look at them every day and think of what it had cost me - and no innocent child deserves that. On top of that, I couldn't bring a baby into this world without knowing how I was going to feed it, clothe it, love it and nurture it. I grew up with six siblings and a single mum; who tried her best but we struggled. I looked at my friends lives, and resented them. I didn't want that for my child. I think of how far I've come in these four years, and how much I've contributed to society; these are things I wouldn't have achieved if my decision had gone the other way. I've grown into a person I never imagined I could, because that decision was the hardest one I'll ever have to make, and it affected me in a way I never thought possible. I made it my mission to ensure a positive outcome - I channelled the emotion into achieving great things. I will have children when I'm ready, emotionally and financially, but most importantly, when I can give them the best possible start in life.Anonymous I had an abortion about five years ago when I was 26. I was only four-to-five weeks along and the decision was made between my partner and I based on the fact that we didn't feel ready for a child. We were living in a rented flat, had little savings and worked full-time to pay the bills. Childcare is so expensive and neither of our parents would have been able to help care for the child whilst we would have been at work. We also were not married and it meant a lot to me that we either be engaged or married before I fell pregnant. Looking back, I think we do regret it now. A lot of our friends are having children and I do not seem to be able to conceive.Felicity, Uckfield I'm in my 20s, I've had two abortions and the stories could not be more different. The first pregnancy was due to my doctor prescribing me antibiotics but not noticing I was on the pill. This medication stops the pill if they're taken together and - eventually - I fell pregnant. I didn't find out this mistake until later and blame was heaped upon me from the father and my family. I knew from the second I took the test that I would not have the child, either I had an abortion or I would kill myself. It's impossible to explain the certainty of that thought to other people. The second abortion was with my current partner and we fully intended to have the child. My family are career-orientated and pressured me to have an abortion, I'd just started a new job that week and felt I'd be let go and that would make my parents even more disappointed. I decided to make the choice to terminate. The timing wasn't right, I told myself. This abortion does weigh on my mind and I've had therapy. The strangest thing about having an abortion is knowing you're now hated by a wide range of people who don't know you. You can't take part during debates because people say you just want to feel better about the choice you made. What I remember most clearly about having an abortion is - as I was being put under - finding myself thanking the attending physicians over and over again, almost to the point of tears. Swelling with gratitude that this was an option for me, that these doctors and nurses were helping me. That and the fact that the waiting room was full of women with children already, who simply couldn't afford any more. Not the stereotypical view of young stupid girls having casual sex at all.Kayleigh, Plymouth I am completely opposed to abortion for two reasons: 1) religion and 2) if it had been widely available 50-odd years ago I probably would not be writing this note! However, that is only me, I cannot judge others. OK, you might say... but I've been a personal tutor in a Sixth Form college and of course some of the youngsters in my charge have wanted to find out about sex... and when talking to those young women who found themselves pregnant I'd tell them: ""This is YOUR decision, and whatever you decide is the right choice. There will be times when you'll regret what you choose to do, but lay them aside, your choice is the right choice because you have made it."" Whatever they decided, I would support them, encourage them, help them... and never tell them what I myself believed, as that would have been inappropriate.Megan, Cheshire Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

Flawed plan,"In 1960s and 70s Britain, immigrant ethnic minority children were dispersed across schools in the hope that it would help them integrate. The process saw children - largely of south Asian and African or Caribbean descent - being ""bussed"" out of their local areas to go to school. Eleven Local Area Authorities (LEAs) decided there should be no more than 30% of immigrants at any one school. It meant once that quota was reached, children were taken elsewhere. The process, which became known as ""bussing"", is now at the heart of a project in Bradford where Shabina Aslam istrying to trace children,externalwho, like herself, were sent to school away from where they lived. She moved to Bradford, West Yorkshire, from Kenya when she was seven years old. She remembers how the buses were marked so the children knew which one to get on. ""We were all told to look for signs, like a yellow sun, black football, or a red diamond,"" she said. Some of the children who were bussed said they were educated in different parts of the school ""So you'd wait for your red diamond bus, you'd get on it, you'd get to school and suddenly it was the 'Paki bus'."" She said the practice made her and the others who were bussed feel more segregated, instead of integrated. Raj Samra, who was a 1960s child bussed in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, said there was a key flaw in the plan which stopped pupils integrating properly. This video can not be played The scheme was set up to help migrant children integrate with others ""We were in an annexe of the main school, so we weren't mixing,"" he said. ""Had we been in another school mixing with all the other children, then the project would have worked."" It was a plan conceived at a time when large numbers of Asian and Afro-Caribbean families were heading to the UK. Many of them could not speak English and the LEAs came up with this as a solution. The councils that adopted a bussing policy were: Blackburn, Bradford, Bristol, Ealing (Southall), Halifax, Hounslow, Huddersfield, Leicester, Luton, Walsall and West Bromwich. Speaking in 1979, City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council's director of education Frederick Adams said: ""The idea is to put the children from overseas in a situation where they have to mix, and if as is the case in this city, about 75% of them are non-English speaking when they arrive, this means they are going to have to communicate, they will hear English spoken, they have got to."" Bussing took place in West Yorkshire between 1965 and 1980 By then, Bradford was sending out 24 buses a day, but in Ealing, west London, campaigners had challenged bussing in court claiming it fell foul of the new race relations legislation. Brenda Thomson was a teacher in Bradford when bussing was the norm. She said it was done ""with the very best of intentions"". ""It was assumed that the children would learn English better in a naturally English-speaking environment,"" she said. ""Which is OK if you speak to your mates in the classroom, but if you don't it doesn't help very much does it?"" Mohammed Ajeeb organised a petition to get bussing stopped in the late 1970s, saying the practice was racially motivated. Shabina Aslam is studing the practice of bussing in West Yorkshire ""In March 1979 a petition was presented to the then chair of the education committee signed by 1,600 parents that demanded the end of bussing. ""It was one-way traffic. Only children from the inner-city areas, the black children, were being bussed into the middle-class areas."" In 1980 Bradford became the last place in the UK to phase out bussing for good. Mrs Aslam believes that although some had positive experiences of bussing and said they enjoyed school, it made her and many others feel more isolated. ""We'd walk in late in a group and we'd always have to leave early. The bus monitor used to come round and say 'can we have all the immigrants please?' and all the black children would stand up,"" she said. ""I didn't really have any friends in the classroom, nobody ever spoke to me. ""I was always looking at the others thinking: 'how do I become like them?'"" Migrant student bus scheme remembered.

Mood monitor,"Daniel Raven-Ellison measured his brain activity as he travelled National Geographic explorer Daniel Raven-Ellison has just completed a 2.5 million step walk across Britain's cities and parks and electronically measured his changing mood with each step. Wearing an EEG monitor strapped to his head he collected millions of snapshots of the activity in his brain as he crossed 69 cities over seven months in the UK from June last year. The monitor measures the electrical activity of the brain from sensors located across key areas of the scalp. Its software provided metrics on how stressed, relaxed, excited, focused, interested and engaged he was during his walks. He says the monitor helped him become more aware of his response to his surroundings. ""You become more attuned to the things you find interesting, uninteresting, stressful, unstressful. ""If you scale that principle up that could be very powerful for the design of cities in the future."" Of course it is far from infallible and the readings can also be affected by many things beyond the environment. A moment when his stress, excitement, focus and engagement levels peaked while walking across Cardiff was not down to its beauty but rather his need just at that moment to go to the toilet. Climbing hills in the Lake District created stress, as did crossing busy dual carriageways, but the machine does not differentiate between experiences that are pleasurable and those that are not. Although the monitor helped him become more aware of his surroundings, he said: ""What's interesting is that for about half my walk across cities I'm not focused and I'm not actually in tune with my emotions."" However, the monitor did pick up on key times when his stress levels altered in line with his environment. His trip across Cardiff started well, with low levels of stress as he began his walk in woodland, although he came across the more familiar sight of a pile of rubbish. Indeed, fly-tipping was a recurring blight that seemed to prompt a rise in his stress levels. Similarly each time he encountered a road, his stress and focus levels increased, whereas by contrast water had an immediate calming effect on him. As he continued his walks, he often found himself alone although many cities could be crossed in around an hour or less. In Aberdeen, its appeal was that much of his route followed an old railway line. ""It's full of interest and completely functional. Aberdeen as a walk just worked,"" he says. Out of all the cities he visited, Swansea was one of his favourites to walk through as he described it as ""surprisingly green with a ribbon of woodland"". Indeed, he was surprised by how green many cities are. Swansea's green spaces were a surprise to Daniel Sheffield was similarly mapped for its greenery Elsewhere he found Newcastle to be the ""best city for seeing children playing out in the wild"" while in Wolverhampton he loved ""Dudley with its hills and great views across the city"". If there was anything he could change immediately having travelled through so many cities on foot, he said: ""I would speak to people about not putting dog poo in bags and adorning trees at head height for other people to pick up, it's all over the country and it's a shameful problem we need to deal with."" Most of his journeys began with either a rail or bus journey to the outskirts of a city. Accommodation was often a tent or a B&B and given he is a vegan, he made more than a few visits to curry houses. To avoid blisters he put a plaster on the problem area before the walk. For the most part the weather was good and perfect for his walks. ""I did have to protect my headset from the elements though, so always carried a sturdy umbrella with me,"" he said. His walk, which began in June last year with a walk across St David's in Wales, ended in December in Birmingham. Along with 69 cities, he also visited 15 national parks to compare urban and rural environments. Having completed his trips, he said: ""If lots of people were wearing these monitors it could inform how we build cities to make them less stressful and more interesting to walk."" Now he will upload the data to begin to build an ""emotional"" map of Britain and hopes others will follow. ""I'm going to be using the five million points of geolocated data to see how my emotions changed across different kinds of places. ""My plan is to release all of the data as open data, so that anyone can interpret it and present it in interesting ways."" The information isnow going online,external.

'Miracle' youngest twins born at 23 weeks,"The girls are still wearing 0-3 months baby clothes Identical twins, thought to be among the most premature ever recorded in Britain, have been described by their parents as ""little miracles"". Imogen and Annabelle Weir were born at just 23 weeks and four days, weighing about a pound each. They spent four months in hospital enduring blood transfusions and emergency surgery. The girls have now been settling in at home in Paisley in Renfrewshire with their parents Claire and James. They have been supported by the Twins and Multiple Births Association (Tamba) who said the fact that the twins were born so early but have gone on to do so well was ""truly incredible"". They were born three days under the 24-week legal limit for abortion in the UK. The girls were born last April, more than three months early. The twins spent four months in hospital Mrs Weir, 31, said: ""They are the youngest and smallest surviving twins to be born in Scotland. ""I'd never heard of twins so small surviving. It didn't seem possible for one, let alone two. ""The consultant told us that if the girls had been born just two years ago they wouldn't have survived - that's how fast medical technology is advancing. ""They have surprised everyone. They will always be our little miracles."" Mr and Mrs Weir met at university in Dundee nine years ago and married in 2013. Mrs Weir was given an early scan and the couple were told that there were two strong heartbeats. Mr Weir, also 31, added: ""We don't have a history of twins as a family, so it was a shock. ""We were over the moon and pretty overwhelmed."" Mrs Weir's 20-week scan showed the twins were growing well, but just a fortnight later, at 22-and-a-half weeks, her waters broke. She was taken to The Royal Alexandria Hospital in Paisley before being transferred to the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital in Glasgow. She said: ""I was just trying to keep the babies inside me for as long as possible. It was a really horrible time, filled with worry. ""After 23 weeks, they would at least have a chance of resuscitation so I hoped they would stick in there. Each day brought more hope. ""I got to more than 23 weeks but then I got very ill with a sepsis infection and they had to induce me. The fact that they were twins, that I had an infection and they were so premature all lowered their chance of survival. ""I didn't have a lot of hope."" The twins were born in the early hours of 3 April. Mrs Weir said: ""They were whisked away to intensive care - I didn't even get to see them. ""I got to hold Imogen after about six days but Annabelle was smaller and more vulnerable, so I didn't get to hold her for a few weeks. They were so tiny they fitted in one hand."" The girls still weigh only 11lbs and 12lbs and have to wear 0-3 month baby clothes. ""It was a terrifying experience but wonderful to be at home now as a family,"" Mrs Weir added. ""Now we are experiencing all the normal struggles new parents have but we have loved every minute. We know how lucky we are."" Helen Peck, Tamba's Scottish co-ordinator, said: ""We are delighted for Claire and James and the twins. Imogen and Annabelle's story is just remarkable. ""They are truly incredible - a pair of miracles. ""To see premature babies born this early and go on to do so well is incredibly rare.

Turning the clock back,"Roger Federer claimed his 18th Grand Slam with his victory over Rafael Nadal Of course it was going to go to five sets. Of course it was going to make you feel sick for four hours. Of course it was going to go places that no other final and no other players could possibly go. Before this Australian Open final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal even began, it felt like the Beatles reforming in 1979 for a one-off gig. When Federer's forehand finished it, deep into the Melbourne night, it was as if they had released a new Revolver too. Federer, supposed to be not only past his prime but past the period when he was past his prime, took on logic, his nemesis and the unarguable passing of time. In coming past all three he may have pulled off not only the best of his 18 Grand Slam singles titles but possibly the greatest Slam victory of all. Federer beats Nadal to win 18th Grand Slam Serena beats Venus to set Grand Slam record Is Serena the greatest? Out injured for the past six months. Adrift in the rankings; superseded by the younger, fitter, faster. Thirty-five years old, a father of four - in recent seasons worshipped as a relic rather than real-time contender. And then a break down in the deciding set, off court for a lengthy medical time-out, receiving further treatment between games as Nadal's forehand pulled the legs off him like a cruel kid playing with a crane fly, only to reach back into the years for one final dazzling burst. Most meetings between the world number 17 and the world number nine are not like this. But then no-one has ever been like Federer and Nadal, the two finest players in history, the rivalry between them approached only by McEnroe and Borg. It is 31 months since Nadal last got past a quarter-final at a major, seven years since Federer last won the title here, and this was the past come back gloriously to the present: a beautiful final for troubled times, sport playing to perfection its role as the sweetest of distractions. Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer (pictured at Wimbledon in 2006) have met in nine Grand Slam finals A fortnight ago, the odds on a Federer-Nadal andVenus-Serena pair of finalswas 5000-1. It should have been impossible, and that has made it all the more impossible to resist. When Nadal opened his tennis academy in Majorca four months ago,Federer turned upto wish him well. Both were injured, reduced to hitting sponge balls against kids, old warriors turned battle-damaged friends. They wore suits, and looked ready for slippers. All those Slam campaigns, all those slugfests on hard courts and knee-jarring slides on clay and chasing on slick grass, seemed to have taken their toll. Federer's back had gone, and then his knee. Nadal's knees for once seemed OK, but his wrist had failed instead. At Wimbledon, where the 2008 final between the two took its sport to new heights, Nadal's last four appearances have ended in defeat to the world number 100, 135, 144 and 102. This video can not be played Australian Open: Roger Federer beats Rafael Nadal to win 18th Grand Slam title For the two to be reunited like this, on such a stage, felt like one last glorious treat from a pair who had already given so much. With the happiness came melancholia too, for nothing marks your own ageing process like the fading of the sporting stars who have defined your fondest years. They looked different, marching out into the Rod Laver Arena on Sunday, following the same path as most men in maturity: thinner hair, longer sleeves. The crowd in Melbourne, and the millions postponing critical Sunday chores around the world, reacted differently too. You were always either Roger or Rafa. There was no in between, not when their styles and characters were so distinct. For this 35th meeting, there was instead confusion. There are some sporting contests when you want both sides to lose. England football supporters may recall West Germany v Argentina in the World Cup final of 1990. This was one when you wanted both to win. Roger Federer has won 12 of his 35 matches against Rafael Nadal since 2004 A home-made banner in the stands read, 'Let's Go Fedal!' For the first four sets the players themselves appeared to be similarly compromised. Federer dominated the first, going at 63% on his first serve, winning 93% of points on it. He hit 13 winners, shortening points as much as he could, coming in to the net and winning five of seven points there. Nadal found himself outpaced and sometimes wrong-footed. The second saw Rafa reborn in a storm of thrashed forehands and screamed vamooses, Federer not only crumpled by that left-handed howitzer but pummelled by a percussive body serve. The third - Federer three break points down in his opening service game only to save them all with aces out wide, and then breaking with aggression and sweaty toil. The fourth - Nadal's energy and endurance opening a lead, the set garlanded by the exchange of the night for 4-1, the Spaniard flicking an outrageous squash-style forehand cross-court for a winner when Federer's own backhand crashed cross-court seemed to have won the point. Federer applauded that one, and grinned across the net. But this was a contest about the dramatic tension as much as its early quality, and it was a match that will be remembered for its final titanic set rather than the preceding four. Federer, broken in his first service game with a weary forehand wide. Nadal, saving three break-back points in his first, saving two more in his next. Federer, setting up break points yet unable to take them, finally levelling it up at 3-3. And then the eighth game, Federer 4-3 up. Three break points, Nadal double-faulting, the plot's course surely set. Nadal responding with two winners; Federer, at 30-40 and on a feeble second serve, chunking a backhand into the tramlines. Another break point, a Nadal ace. A 26-shot rally on the next. Roger Federer leads the list of all-time men's major winners with 18 Grand Slam titles It was almost too much - less a final hurrah than a crescendo that no-one could have seen coming and few could handle. Even when Federer finally broke, even when he was serving for the championship, Nadal clawed his way to two break points. On the first championship point there was a successful challenge. On the second, the challenge fell short. The game, at last, was up. ""Tennis is a tough sport,"" said an exhausted Federer afterwards, tears in his eyes and aches in his bones. ""There are no draws. If there were, I would have been happy to accept one tonight and share it with Rafa."" As a champion who was supposed to be spent, it brought to mind Jack Nicklaus winning his 18th major at Augusta in 1986. As a smooth warrior expected to be felled by the muscular jabs and hooks of the younger man, it was reminiscent of Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa. And it brought back the words of BBC commentator Harry Carpenter as George Foreman finally fell under Ali's assault, amended to fit a player who has spent a career making precedent redundant.

College digs,"From left to right: Miguel Amaro, Ben Grech and Mariano Kostelec - the founders of Uniplaces While many people look back on their university days with fondness, the one thing they probably don't miss is the student accommodation. If it wasn't grotty, it was too expensive, or often both. Recalling their college days, friends Miguel Amaro, Ben Grech and Mariano Kostelec all say that their biggest problem was finding somewhere to live in the first place. ""Our experience was horrible,"" says 28-year-old Englishman Ben. ""As an international student from Argentina, Mariano had to pay 12 months' rent up-front to get his place in London. ""Meanwhile, Miguel [who is from Portugal] booked some random super-expensive residence in Nottingham because he didn't know any better, and I was looking around the streets of Nottingham knocking on doors trying to find a place."" Student accommodation can be a bit bleak While it was irksome at the time, a year after graduating from their respective universities - Miguel and Ben from Nottingham University, and Mariano from King's College in London - the three men realised that there was a business opportunity. They came up with a plan to create an online marketplace matching students with accommodation. Ben says: ""It was clear that people were doing more online and that marketplaces such as Airbnb were a great solution for travel, but finding accommodation was such a problem for students around the world."" So in 2011 the three started work on their business and website Uniplaces. The trio invested around Â£50,000 - a sum whipped up from their savings, student loans and help from parents. Kitchen facilities at a flat in London listed on Uniplaces To save on costs, the men stayed at Miguel's parents' holiday home in Ponte de Lima in northern Portugal, before participating in start-up competitions to win free office space, first in Porto, the country's second city, and then in the capital Lisbon. Later that year they won first round funding of 200,000 euros ($215,000; Â£172,534) led by the founder of UK property website Zoopla. From there it was down to business, getting a permanent office in Lisbon, and wooing landlords to join the site and checking properties. The Uniplaces website was then officially launched in 2013, with an initial 50 properties in the Portuguese capital listed on the site. Mariano, 28, says: ""We picked Lisbon as our first city as it totally made sense to stay [and open headquarters here]. ""It is a low cost, good location with access to great talent such as good engineers, and people with excellent language skills, which is great when dealing with so many international students. ""For the first hundred plus properties we actually went round them ourselves with our cameras taking pictures, cleaning the places up and asking people to get out of the room."" Students using Uniplaces pay one month's rent upfront via the website, and the sum goes through to the landlord 24 hours after they move in. Thereafter they pay directly to the landlord. Uniplaces takes a service fee of 20-25% of the student's first month's rent, and then a commission of 5-12% of the total value of the contract from the landlord. The website-based business had to pull back from a quick global expansion More than half of all properties featured on the site are still verified by Uniplaces staff who visit the property to take pictures and videos, draw up a floor plan and inventory list. Since its launch, three million nights have been booked through the platform, which currently lists over 40,000 properties. Revenues grew four-fold in 2016 compared to the previous year, but with the money being reinvested into the business Uniplaces is yet to turn a profit. The company, which now has 132 employees, has also continued to attract the attention of investors. Last year it received $24m (Â£19m) in its fourth round of funding. The capital has been used to fund expansion, build brand awareness, fine-tune the product, and appoint extra staff. Finding student accommodation was historically not an enjoyable activity But it hasn't been all plain-sailing for the three entrepreneurs. Initially they were too ambitious and tried to expand too quickly. Miguel, 27, says: ""We wanted to be a global start-up so we quickly launched in 70 cities. But then you start compromising."" With properties spread across so many cities, they were no longer able to verify enough of the properties. Miguel adds: ""Investors want results, but then you realise you need to focus and deliver a good experience for the customer and make sure landlords' properties are getting filled up. ""That helps grow a more successful company. It's a balance of ambition. We want to get out to the world but we have to stage it. So in 2016 we went down to six cities and focused on them."" Today the business has expanded back up to 15 cities - London, Manchester, Nottingham, Lisbon, Coimbra, Porto, Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Rome, Bologna, Milan, Paris, Berlin and Munich. Jack Wallington, community director at student community website, The Student Room, notes that in recent years student accommodation has changed dramatically. ""Dedicated companies have popped up offering purpose-built student flats across the UK and other accommodation services. ""Alongside the standard mix of landlords it can be hard for students to know who to turn to and trust. Uniplaces is fairly innovative because its interest lies more with the student, supporting first-time renters to find good deals."" The company has its headquarters in Lisbon, but also has an office in London While Uniplaces retains global ambitions, Mariano says that for the time being it will focus on Europe. The ambitious trio also have visions of creating a more wide-ranging university brand. From next year students will receive a welcome pack including useful materials such as a sim card, and a travel card when they arrive at their new digs. There'll also be the launch of an app where Uniplaces brand ambassadors will be on hand to answer any questions students might have about their new city. Further in the pipeline are plans to enable students who might have booked to rent a room in the same property to build a relationship through social media before they move in. Ben says that the aim of such initiatives is to make renting student accommodation through Uniplaces as ""welcoming"" as possible. Could students leave Cardiff's Cathays?

My music,"This video can not be played Since it launched in 2012 Anghami has attracted 30 million users At the turn of the century, as mobile phones were taking off, there was a fad for novelty ringtones. People were paying small sums for their new Nokia phones to play a simple version of popular tunes as a call alert. ""It was a silly trend at the time,"" says Eddy Maroun, co-founder of Anghami, which is today the Arab world's biggest home-grown music streaming service. ""I would compose the melodies,"" he says. His co-founder, Elie Habib, meanwhile, took care of the technical and distribution side. To go from two men with some ringtones to creating one of the most successful regional technology companies took years, inspiration and the battle to overcome the limitations of launching in a region where new tech companies are the exception rather than the rule. Eddy Maroun can pinpoint the moment the idea for Anghami came to him. While at a technology conference in 2010 he wrote in his notebook: ""Piracy"". The notebook with a note about piracy which was the original inspiration for Anghami ""At that point piracy was killing the economics of producing music,"" he says. ""Producers were at the point where they were making almost no money."" By coming up with a platform that was convenient and affordable the founders believed that consumers would be willing to pay rather than illegally download music. Anghami makes its money from people subscribing to the service, advertising to people who stream the service for free, and by doing deals with mobile phone companies who carry the app. From one word in a notebook the two founders have built a service which claims a music library of more than 20 million songs and which streams 500 million songs a month to 30 million users. ""We contribute in a big way to the funding of the music industry,"" Mr Maroun says. Anghami's founders Elie Habib (left) and Eddy Maroun started the company with their own money ""I can say that the hardest part is fundraising in the Middle East. ""When we came up with the idea of Anghami there were people in America and in Europe doing the same, so international labels knew about it, but for Arabic labels that was something new."" As a show of good faith both founders quit their jobs and put up their own money. ""If you invest your own money that means you have the passion and the willingness to make your project a success. Labels and investors like that. They see you as reliable."" The pay-off came quite quickly a year after having the original idea. In 2011 they signed their first million-dollar investment and quickly after a second. They were able to start hiring people and closing deals with labels to finally launch Anghami in 2012. Anghami's headquarters are in a skyscraper in the hip Zaqla neighbourhood of Beirut The company says revenues are on the rise, doubling year after year and they exceeded $10m (Â£8m) by the end of 2016. The other major challenge was the problem of data distribution in the region. ""Internet in the Middle East is notoriously bad,"" Elie Habib says. ""We can do nothing about it, bit by bit we realised the more we can actually work on making the music smaller while maintaining quality, the better the user experience will be."" Still, even if the size of the music is small, data remains very expensive in countries like Lebanon, where topping up your phone with 500 megabytes costs about $12. Potential users who want to save on their data are left with two options: paying for Anghami Premium, an advert-free service with unlimited downloads, or streaming exclusively while on a free wi-fi network. Digital executive Moe Hamzeh says international competitors could draw some of Anghami's market share ""People here are not ready to pay,"" says Moe Hamzeh, a music and digital entertainment executive based in Beirut. ""Subscription services are not doing well."" Mr Hamzeh also says Anghami could face problems if international competitors establish themselves in the Middle East. Anghami currently dominates the market along with the American tech giant Apple's music service. ""We have the local flavour,"" says Eddy Maroun. ""We understand the artists and the Middle East music better than the competition, 75% of our business comes from this region. The other 25% comes from the Arab diaspora. ""Even if Anghami reaches 30 million people, that only accounts for less than 10% of the population,"" he says.  In short, he believes there's plenty of room for growth.

Beautifying Baghdad,"Mural on wall in Baghdad, with message which reads: ""Let us live in peace in unity"" When Ali Abdulrahman was coming to the end of his time at university, he wanted to do something to brighten up his community in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. With the support of the dean, Ali got together with nearly 100 fellow students to paint graffiti along the walls of the campus. Seeing how the grey concrete walls were transformed by colour, the students decided to go a step further. In January 2015, they took to the streets and painted graffiti along the main roads of the city, and so beganImprint of Hope,external. Red, yellow, green, and blue replaced the drab facades of bombed-out houses. Colourful landscapes, images of children playing in the streets, and messages of co-existence started to appear across the city. The war and its aftermath changed Baghdad dramatically. In 2007, following a spike in suicide attacks and other bombings, the government adopted new security measures to try to protect civilians. Baghdad became increasingly divided into neighbourhoods, separated by brick walls. The once lively and energetic city started to lose its character and atmosphere. The walls did not only serve security purposes, but political and armed groups also used them as canvasses for sectarian slogans and political propaganda. Locals complained that the city's litter was left along the walls, attracting rodents and creating a stench, particularly during the hot summer months. Imprint of Hope sought to change this. Since it was founded, the group has painted hundreds of brick walls across Baghdad. It has swelled to more than370 volunteers,externalfrom a range of backgrounds, including students, carpenters, ironsmiths, artists and doctors. In addition to decorating the city's walls, the group also paints orphanages, nurseries and public buildings, including a children's cancer hospital. Ali says its graffiti sends messages of peace and denounces sectarian violence. Sometimes, the murals are meant to raise awareness about issues such as water consumption, electricity usage, and the importance of community work. Last December around Christmas time, the group painted parts of Our Lady of Salvation Syrian Catholic Church, which was heavily damaged in explosions in 2010. They also painted graffiti on the bricks that were later set up to protect the church from further attacks. While making life in Baghdad more liveable is a priority, Ali also wants to change the perception people worldwide have of his city. At the moment, the group does not receive outside funding. Volunteers pay a monthly subscription of 10,000 Iraqi Diners ($8), which is used to buy the paint and brushes. Similar to many civil society groups in Iraq, securing funding is a challenge. Sometimes, Imprint of Hope gets commissioned to produce artwork for private homes. The money they make is used to fund new projects. Although the Iraqi government has promised to financially support civil society movements, so far the group has only received donations in the form of materials, from Unicef and the EU. This was used to paint murals and graffiti across 121 schools in Iraq. ""Glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace, goodwill to all people"" Initially, Ali and his friends faced pressure when some political parties tried to sabotage the group, suspecting a hidden political agenda. ""No-one wanted to fund us,"" says Ali. ""They didn't understand what we do."" Over time though, he says ""with the positive reaction we received from the public, everyone is now trying to befriend us"". Ali is very proud of everyone who works for the group, though he feels that if his volunteers were living in another country in the Middle East, or in Europe, they would get more recognition and appreciation. The group hopes to achieve other goals through its work. Ali says that as well as with making Baghdad look prettier, the group would like to encourage people to become more active in society. He says that through engaging in communal work, a greater feeling of citizenship could be fostered among Iraqis. This would ease sectarian tension and potentially create a stronger sense of unity, he says. ""Let's support the handicapped and those with special needs"" Despite the widespread feeling of despair and frustration among Iraq's younger population, Imprint of Hope feels it is succeeding in creating a more positive atmosphere - a small step on a long path.

But this was a contest about the dramatic tension as much as its early quality, and it was a match that will be remembered for its final titanic set rather than the preceding four. Federer, broken in his first service game with a weary forehand wide. Nadal, saving three break-back points in his first, saving two more in his next. Federer, setting up break points yet unable to take them, finally levelling it up at 3-3. And then the eighth game, Federer 4-3 up. Three break points, Nadal double-faulting, the plot's course surely set. Nadal responding with two winners; Federer, at 30-40 and on a feeble second serve, chunking a backhand into the tramlines. Another break point, a Nadal ace. A 26-shot rally on the next. Roger Federer leads the list of all-time men's major winners with 18 Grand Slam titles It was almost too much - less a final hurrah than a crescendo that no-one could have seen coming and few could handle. Even when Federer finally broke, even when he was serving for the championship, Nadal clawed his way to two break points. On the first championship point there was a successful challenge. On the second, the challenge fell short. The game, at last, was up. ""Tennis is a tough sport,"" said an exhausted Federer afterwards, tears in his eyes and aches in his bones. ""There are no draws. If there were, I would have been happy to accept one tonight and share it with Rafa."" As a champion who was supposed to be spent, it brought to mind Jack Nicklaus winning his 18th major at Augusta in 1986. As a smooth warrior expected to be felled by the muscular jabs and hooks of the younger man, it was reminiscent of Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa. And it brought back the words of BBC commentator Harry Carpenter as George Foreman finally fell under Ali's assault, amended to fit a player who has spent a career making precedent redundant.

"Legal limbo at US airportsAmateur hour at the White House?Starbucks to hire 10,000 refugeesTravel ban attacked at SAG Awards","This video can not be played Protesters gather at Dulles airport: ""Welcome to the USA!"" Said Hajouli, a second-year medical resident, had waited over a year to see his bride. They met in Turkey, after ""Leen"" - Said did not want to use her real name - fled her university in Syria when the war broke out. They were engaged for a year, married in 2015, then spent only one week together as husband and wife before Said had to return to Virginia on his J-1 visa, a non-immigrant visa commonly given to scholars and doctors. In the meantime, the couple applied and were approved for a J-2 visa for Leen, which is a permit reserved for spouses and dependents of J-1 holders. Finally, on Saturday 28 January, Leen boarded a flight in Istanbul bound for Dulles International Airport in Virginia, about 45 minutes outside of Washington DC. It was supposed to be a happy day. ""It was supposed to be, but I don't know what's going to happen,"" 29-year-old Said said, not long after arriving at Dulles. Almost exactly 24 hours earlier,President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled, ""Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States"". It shut down the US refugee programme for 120 days, indefinitely suspended the resettlement of Syrian refugees, and halted all immigration to the US from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. The order led to chaos at airports all over the world. Travellers were prevented from boarding planes abroad and, in some cases, were pulled off flights. They were detained at US airports. And there seemed to have been little instructions given to US Customs and Border Patrol on how to handle refugee and immigrant arrivals under the new rules. Lawyers gathered to represent those facing travel bans Earlier that morning, Said's friend's wife also attempted to enter the country with a J-2 visa, but he says she was immediately stopped and sent back. So, instead of flowers, Said brought Rob Robertson to the airport, a tall, burly immigration lawyer. Said had found him just hours earlier after putting out a desperate plea for help on social media. ""They've done everything they need to do. It's already clear she's not a threat,"" said Mr Robertson. ""It worries me that they're just going to turn around and send them back, pursuant to an executive order that is not law, that does not override the Immigration and Nationality Act,"" he said, referring to the 1965 law that bans discrimination against immigrants based on ""nationality, place of birth, or place of residence"". This video can not be played Protesters against the ban also gathered at New York's JFK Airport Mr Robertson was one of roughly 30 volunteer lawyers who showed up to Dulles on Saturday afternoon. They deployed en masse following news that two Iraqi men with valid visas were detained at John F Kennedy Airport, in New York, and faced deportation. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued on their behalf and they were later released. Rumours spread that more were trapped in legal limbo at other airports around the country - including Dulles. ""This is not the country I was born in. This is not the country that I loved,"" said lawyer Lena Albibi, who was moved to tears. ""It's very painful seeing this happenâ¦ They're breaking families apart."" Reaching prospective clients was a tricky errand for the lawyers, since anyone who needed legal help - travellers being detained in the ""secondary inspection"" area of US Customs and Border Patrol at Dulles - had no way to communicate with lawyers waiting outside. Lawyer Lena Albibi said this did not feel like the US she knew ""We cannot get the information that we need so we can figure out how we can assist them,"" said immigration lawyer Sari Long. ""We're trying to do our best to canvas family members."" Dispersed in the waiting area near baggage claim number 15 were people like Elmira Tayary, who had no idea she would need a lawyer to collect her 63-year-old mother, a green-card holder. Just hours earlier, Department of Homeland Security officials had revealed that the executive order would extend to permanent residents of the US coming from the seven banned countries. Tayary said her mother splits her time between the US and Iran, and has for years. ""I'm very, very sad, but I'm hopeful she may show up any minute,"" said Elmira. ""This is very disappointing."" Relatives and supporters waited to greet arrivals who had been detained As hours ticked by, and more and more protesters arrived carrying signs that read ""Refugees Are Welcome"" and ""Love Your Neighbour"", it became clear that something like 50 to 60 people, including green-card holders, were being held at customs. Lawyers were still not permitted to speak to them. However, there were small acts of rebellion. Employees of the airport itself managed to ferry information to family members who were waiting, including Elmira, to tell them that green card holders would soon be on their way. Immediately soothed, Elmira bought her mother a red-white-and-blue balloon. One by one, the permanent residents were released, walking down a corridor now teeming with demonstrators shouting ""Welcome home!"" and singing ""This Land is My Land"". Ali and his wife Hajer wore weary smiles as they pushed their luggage through the gauntlet of well-wishers, their 11- and 7-year-old boys in tow. Someone handed Hajer flowers. Ali worked for three years as an interpreter for the US Army and gained admittance to the US through a Special Immigrant Visa, reserved for Iraqi and Afghan nationals who face threats of violence for working for Americans during the conflicts there. He now has a green card, and returned to Iraq for his father's funeral, only to be delayed for hours for questioning at Dulles. ""We are not terrorists. We are not bad people,"" said Ali. ""It's so hard. I hope they will change their minds on this position."" US citizen Alaa was finally able to connect with his wife Jinan, a green card holder, only after she answered a series of questions about her family and her husband's business. ""That's way over the limit. She's got a green card,"" Alaa said. ""Are we going to blow up our system because we are afraid? Then, you know, whoever we are afraid from are winning."" Just then, a thin man carrying a sign that read ""This Veteran Stands With You"" stopped Alaa, told him he is an Iraq veteran, and with little explanation fastened a Purple Heart medal to Alaa's jacket. ""That's a great thing, that's a great thing!"" Alaa cried, elated. ""This is what America is all about!"" Ali, Hajer and their sons, legal residents in the US, finally make it through to the arrivals hall As the green-card holders began to depart, more good news arrived - first a judge in Brooklyn declared that deporting refugees and valid visa holders who'd already arrived in US airports would cause ""irreparable harm"", thereby blocking the deportations. Next, a judge in Virginia issued a temporary restraining order to stop the expulsion of green card holders. Each time the news arrived, the lawyers huddled together and then broke out into rowdy cheers. ""We are optimistic that pretty soon all those people back there will be allowed to come through,"" said lawyer Dan Press. By the time some detainees made it through, they were so exhausted that several fell weeping into the arms of loved ones - to the frenzied glee of the now-enormous protest group. It wasn't all good news. Rumours that deportations took place continued to swirl, though it is unclear how many. The Virginia court decision lasts only a week and Trump's executive order still holds for anyone who did not make it to US shores in time for this brief, legal reprieve. By 11 pm, Said still had no definitive answer about his wife, Leen. She called to say she was being sent back to Turkey, but then later was shuffled off to another room in customs. ""She may come walking out of there for all I know,"" said Said's lawyer. So Said leaned against a wall, eyes fixed on the path out of customs, and waited, as patiently as the previous year.

"Amateur hour at the White House?Starbucks to hire 10,000 refugeesTravel ban attacked at SAG Awards","History will have its own take on President Trump's immigration order It's only one week into Donald Trump's presidency, and he already has his first ""heckuva job"" moment. For those who don't remember, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, President George W Bush publicly praised his emergency management head, Michael Brown, for doing a ""heckuva job"" with recovery efforts. That comment was hung around the president's neck like an anvil, as flood waters swamped parts of New Orleans and the city descended into chaos. It started a public approval downward spiral that led to sweeping Democratic victories in the 2006 mid-term elections. History will judge the long-term impact of Mr Trump's Friday afternoon immigration order, but his early praise for its implementation will not easily be forgotten. This video can not be played Protesters shouted ""let them in"" at demonstrations in JFK Airport in New York ""It's working out very nicely,"" Mr Trump said in a brief response to a question on Saturday afternoon. ""You see it in the airports, you see it all over. It's working out very nicely, and we are going to have a very, very strict ban, and we are going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years."" On the ground at major US airports, things weren't going quite so nicely, however. Immigration officials were having a difficult time implementing Mr Trump's order after receiving conflicting instructions on who to bar from entry into the US - and what to do with them once they were held. And as the day progressed, and word spread of the detentions, crowds of protesters at international terminals grew from dozens to hundreds to thousands. While on the campaign trail, it was easy for Mr Trump to roundly decry the US immigration system as broken and make a general call for bans and moratoriums. As president, however, his team has had to fill in the details - and it seems they faced some difficulty translating his pre-election rhetoric into policy. Mr Trump's Friday afternoon executive order reportedly wascrafted without consulting legal aides and enacted over the objection of homeland security officials,external, who balked at including permanent US residents in the ban. This video can not be played President Trump: ""It's not a Muslim ban, but we're totally prepared"" This made for an awkward scene Saturday night at a New York courthouse, where government attorneys had to defend measures that were creating chaos at airports across the nation. ""I think the government hasn't had a full chance to think about this,""said federal judge Ann Donnelly,external, as she ruled that individuals with valid paperwork on US soil couldn't be deported. Her temporary ruling - and those like it in other courts - are only the opening salvo in what will likely be a protracted legal battle. Trump administration lawyers will surely be better prepared in future hearings. The orders could be re-instated following full trials on the merits, and no judge has yet to rule on the fate of individuals who hold valid US visas and are still on foreign soil. In the meantime, however, this has proven to be an embarrassing episode in what looks like a not-ready-for-primetime White House. At a New York courthouse, a judge issued a stay blocking the deportation of travellers who arrive in the US with valid visas A handful of Republicans in Congress have come out with varying levels of objection to the programme, and although the Republican leadership is playing along for the moment, that could change quickly if the political heat increases. The president may have broad powers in setting immigration policy, but Congress can pass legislation that overrules him at any time. Meanwhile, Democrats are scrambling to take advantage of the political opportunity. ""History will judge where America's leaders stood today,"" Democratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois said. It was a warning some of his party's 2020 presidential contenders seemed to take to heart. Senator Elizabeth Warren greets demonstrators protesting against the executive order at Boston's Logan Airport New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered airport trains to resume service to JFK Airport, after transit officials had suspended service to prevent protesters from continuing to flood in. Senator Elizabeth Warren spoke to crowds at Boston's Logan Airport, as did Senator Cory Booker at Dulles near Washington, DC. All three are considered near the top of the Democratic presidential field. 2020 is a long way off, of course. Of more pressing concern is where the Trump administration goes from here. On Sunday morning, press secretary Sean Spicer, chief of staff Reince Priebus and top aide Kellyanne Conway took to the airwaves to defend the White House policy and explain its implementation. Mr Trump himself fired back on Twitter - although only after firsttaking a swipe at the ""failing"" New York Times for the second day in a row,external. ""Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW,""he tweeted,external. ""Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!"" This video can not be played ""I feel he has a reason for doing what he's doing"" said one Staten Island resident While championing US security is usually a winning issue, protracted detention of children and the elderly at airport checkpoints is ""bad optics"", as they say. Watching a five-year-old re-united with his mother and 70-year-olds facing indefinite detention puts a human face on Mr Trump's immigration programme - and the results aren't flattering for the White House. During the presidential primary, a majority of Republican voters backed Mr Trump's calls for a sweeping ban on Muslims entering the US, so the president's core support may hold firm after this weekend's events. The views in the American heartland, far removed from major international airports, sometimes differ greatly from the liberal bastions on the coast. At best, however, this is an unnecessary distraction for the White House, calling its organisational ability into question. At worst - if the majority of the nation turns on the president - Mr Trump may find his power and influence starting to ebb before his administration even gets fully under way.

"Starbucks to hire 10,000 refugeesTravel ban attacked at SAG Awards","Starbucks has pledged to hire 10,000 refugees globally over the next five years, in response to US President Donald Trump's recentimmigration ban. Inan open letter,externalto staff, chief executive Howard Schultz said the president's order had caused ""confusion, surprise and opposition"". Recruitment will begin in the US and focus on people who had served or supported the military. Mr Schultz is the latest US corporate chief to criticise the ban. Silicon Valley heavyweights including Facebook, Google and Tesla have made public statements, while Airbnb isoffering free accommodationto people affected by the travel restrictions and unable to get into the US.

Travel ban attacked at SAG Awards,"This video can not be played Bryan Cranston: 'We have hard fought civil liberties to protect' Hidden Figures was the surprise winner of the top prize at this year's Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards, which was dominated by anger over Donald Trump's policies on immigration. The film, which tells the true story of black female mathematicians during the 1960s space race, won the best ensemble prize at the Los Angeles ceremony. Denzel Washington was named best actor for Fences. Several winners attacked Mr Trump's ban on immigration from seven countries. The tone was set by host Ashton Kutcher, who began the evening by greeting ""everyone at home and everyone in airports that belong in my America"". ""We're in a really tricky time in our country and things are very inexcusable and scary,"" said Emma Stone as she won the best actress prize for La La Land. Mahershala Ali, meanwhile, spoke about his Muslim faith as he accepted the best supporting actor prize for Moonlight. Mr Trump's executive order, signed on Friday, halted the entire US refugee programme for 120 days, indefinitely banned Syrian refugees, and suspended all nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries. Lithgow and Foy were recognised for playing Winston Churchill and the Queen in The Crown Julia Louis-Dreyfus called the immigration ban ""a blemish"" and ""un-American"" as she won best comedy TV actress for Veep. And there were cheers for actress Taylor Schilling when she described the award-winning cast of Orange is the New Black as ""a diverse group of people, representing generations of families who have sought a better life here"". Denzel Washington's Fences co-star Viola Davis was named best supporting actress at an event where several non-white actors were honoured. Yet the actress told reporters that every black nominee had been shortlisted ""because they deserve to be"" and ""not... because of the colour of their skin.""

The Irish model: How low should taxes go?,"Facebook, which has a slogan-festooned office in Dublin, admits Ireland's low tax regime is attractive - but says it's not the only draw As the UK government hints it could slash tax rates for foreign businesses after Brexit, Paul Moss looks at how the low corporate tax model is working in neighbouring Ireland. There is something rather cult-like about the Facebook office in Dublin. Everyone smiles, everyone seems genuinely delighted to be working for one of the biggest tech firms in the world. Then there are the primary colours everywhere, the games provided for staff to play, from chess to ping-pong. But what most catches your eye are the posters, exhorting staff to improve their performance with slogans like ""Proceed and Be Bold,"" and even ""Move Fast and Break Things"". I resisted the temptation to kick over one of the vases in reception, or perhaps hurl a fire extinguisher through the window. Facebook creates 200 more jobs in Dublin UK 'won't lie down' over Brexit trade May: UK will lead world on free trade Instead, I proceeded, as planned, to interview the man who runs this office, about why Facebook had chosen Ireland for its international headquarters. I wanted to ask about the importance of one specific attraction: that companies in Ireland do not have to pay much in the way of tax. ""It is a significant part of our reason for coming here,"" Gareth Lambe acknowledges. He is dressed casually, as you might expect of the boss in charge of a major tech company - jeans, v-neck jumper, not a suit or tie in sight. ""The 12.5% corporation tax, which is lower than a lot of other jurisdictions... we've had that for a long time now. It's been very helpful having that kind of certainty here."" Mr Lambe is at pains to emphasise that low tax was certainly not Ireland's only appeal. This is an English-speaking country, with a highly educated workforce, and low costs. And he also wants me to know how much Facebook contributes to Ireland aside from tax, the 1,600 jobs, and the knock-on wealth these in turn create. ""Restaurants, rents paid, cinemas... these multinationals in Ireland actually generate a hell of a lot of economic activity."" And yet, most of these same multinationals were remarkably unwilling to talk to me about their presence in Ireland. Getting businesses to talk is not usually such a problem, but when I said I wanted to mention the subject of tax, various organisations which represent the commercial world here said it might be impossible to find any companies which would be interviewed. Economist Tom Healy says that now other countries have introduced aggressive tax cuts, Ireland is struggling to compete In the event, Facebook was the only one which came forward. Part of the problem, I was told, is the sticky topic of tax avoidance. Companies stand accused of banking their profits in Ireland, where the tax rate is low, even though their operations are really based elsewhere. Yet the economist Tom Healy believes there may be another reason why CEOs seem to have developed a new-found shyness when it comes to the subject of Ireland's tax rate. The fact is, as he puts it: ""The party is over."" Mr Healy is director of the left-leaning Nevin Institute for Economic Research, and his argument is a simple one: that Ireland had a competitive advantage when it was the only developed nation cutting corporation tax so low, allowing it to lure companies away from other countries. Now, however, many of those other countries have decided to play the same game. ""A number of East European countries, one or two of the Baltic states, have gone down the road of aggressive tax cuts. And you've really reached the point where it's impossible for a developed economy like Ireland to compete with that sort of policy."" Phillip Hammond and Theresa May have hinted that the UK could use corporate tax cuts to draw business away from the EU However, East European countries are not though the only ones engaged in this corporate tax-cutting competition. The United Kingdom under its current Conservative government has already lowered the rate from 28% to 20%, and it is set to drop further, to 17% by 2020. But more than that, the Prime Minister Theresa May and her Chancellor of the Exchequer, Phillip Hammond, have dropped heavy hints that further cuts could be on the way. Indeed, this has been an implicit threat to other European Union states: that if they do not offer Britain an agreeable deal on trade, post-Brexit, Britain might use corporate tax cuts to draw business away from the EU, turning the UK into what one commentator described as ""Singapore on the Thames"". ""Don't do it,"" says Tom Healy, with a certainty that belies his otherwise cautious manner. His fear is that the UK will become part of an international race to the bottom on corporate tax, with countries eventually demanding so little from business that they will no longer be able to fund public services. ""Tax is a factor, but the best way to bring in investment,"" he believes, ""is to develop infrastructure, skills and innovation."" The UK Treasury insists that its corporate tax-cutting approach has so far worked, encouraging investment and enterprise, and thus creating jobs. Questioned about this recently, Mr Hammond said ""By being globally competitive, that's how we protect the living standards and the jobs of our people."" Dublin City Councillor Michael O'Brien refuses to buy the idea that a lower corporate tax rate is an overall benefit to the economy On a freezing cold and windy evening I put these arguments to a Dublin city councillor as we walked through the ward he represents in Coolock, one of the poorer neighbourhoods in Dublin's northern suburbs. Michael O'Brien points out a local hospital, which he says is suffering from a shortage of beds and staff. And he tells me about the housing issues he has to deal with, the families in temporary accommodation, and the people sleeping rough. He refuses to buy the idea that a lower corporate tax rate is an overall benefit to the economy. ""If more tax was demanded of the multinationals and domestic businesses, it would bring in billions of extra revenue that could be spent to deal with the housing crisis, deal with the healthcare crisis,"" he argues. ""It's insufferable to hear the likes of Facebook extolling this low tax regime. I think people see a basic issue of tax justice."" And with that, Councillor O'Brien heads off to try and deal with a few more problems among his constituents. And I use my smartphone to order a taxi, check emails and what my friends are posting on Facebook, and soon leave Coolock far behind.

The warrior monks who invented banking,"Temple Church is not just an important architectural, historical and religious site On London's busy Fleet Street, opposite Chancery Lane, is a stone arch through which anyone may step, and travel back in time. A quiet courtyard houses a strange, circular chapel and a statue of two knights sharing a single horse. The chapel is Temple Church, consecrated in 1185 as the London home of the Knights Templar. But Temple Church is not just an important architectural, historical and religious site. It is also London's first bank. The Knights Templar were warrior monks. A religious order, with a theologically inspired hierarchy, mission statement, and code of ethics, but also heavily armed and dedicated to holy war. How did they get into the banking game? 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. The Templars dedicated themselves to the defence of Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem. The city had been captured by the first crusade in 1099 and pilgrims began to stream in, travelling thousands of miles across Europe. Those pilgrims needed to somehow fund months of food and transport and accommodation, yet avoid carrying huge sums of cash around, because that would have made them a target for robbers. Pope Honorius II granted official recognition to the Knights Templar in 1128 Fortunately, the Templars had that covered. A pilgrim could leave his cash at Temple Church in London, and withdraw it in Jerusalem. Instead of carrying money, he would carry a letter of credit. The Knights Templar were the Western Union of the crusades. We don't actually know how the Templars made this system work and protected themselves against fraud. Was there a secret code verifying the document and the traveller's identity? The Templars were not the first organisation in the world to provide such a service. Several centuries earlier, Tang dynasty China used ""feiquan"" - flying money - a two-part document allowing merchants to deposit profits in a regional office, and reclaim their cash back in the capital. But that system was operated by the government. Templars were much closer to a private bank - albeit one owned by the Pope, allied to kings and princes across Europe, and run by a partnership of monks sworn to poverty. King Henry III took advantage of the Templars' financial services The Knights Templar did much more than transferring money across long distances. As William Goetzmann describes in his book Money Changes Everything, they provided a range of recognisably modern financial services. If you wanted to buy a nice island off the west coast of France - as King Henry III of England did in the 1200s with the island of Oleron, north-west of Bordeaux - the Templars could broker the deal. Henry III paid Â£200 a year for five years to the Temple in London, then when his men took possession of the island, the Templars made sure that the seller got paid. And in the 1200s, the Crown Jewels were kept at the Temple as security on a loan, the Templars operating as a very high-end pawn broker. The Knights Templar were not Europe's bank forever, of course. The order lost its reason to exist after European Christians completely lost control of Jerusalem in 1244, and the Templars were eventually disbanded in 1312. So who would step into the banking vacuum? If you had been at the great fair of Lyon in 1555, you could have seen the answer. Lyon's fair was the greatest market for international trade in all Europe. But at this particular fair, gossip was starting to spread about an Italian merchant who was there, and making a fortune. He bought and sold nothing: all he had was a desk and an inkstand. Day after day he sat there, receiving other merchants and signing their pieces of paper, and somehow becoming very rich. The locals were very suspicious. But to a new international elite of Europe's great merchant houses, his activities were perfectly legitimate. He was buying and selling debt, and in doing so he was creating enormous economic value. Bills of exchange allowed Florence's celebrated wool trade to flourish in the Middle Ages A merchant from Lyon who wanted to buy - say - Florentine wool could go to this banker and borrow something called a bill of exchange. This was a credit note, an IOU, but it was not denominated in the French livre or Florentine lira. Its value was expressed in the ecu de marc, a private currency used by this international network of bankers. And if the Lyonnaise merchant or his agents travelled to Florence, the bill of exchange from the banker in Lyon would be recognised by bankers in Florence, who would gladly exchange it for local currency. Through this network of bankers, a local merchant could not only exchange currencies but also translate his creditworthiness in Lyon into creditworthiness in Florence, a city where nobody had ever heard of him - a valuable service, worth paying for. The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart How fertiliser helped feed the world The simple steel box that changed the face of global trade The hidden strengths of unloved concrete Every few months, agents of this network of bankers would meet at the great fairs such as Lyon's, go through their books, net off all the credit notes against each other and settle any remaining debts. Our financial system today has a lot in common with this model. An Australian with a credit card can walk into a supermarket in Lyon and walk out with groceries. The supermarket checks with a French bank, which talks to an Australian bank, which approves the payment, happy that this woman is good for the money. But this web of banking services has always had a darker side to it. By turning personal obligations into internationally tradable debts, these medieval bankers were creating their own private money, outside the control of Europe's kings. Rich, and powerful, they had no need for the coins minted by the sovereign. The 2008 collapse of the Lehman Brothers bank led to financial instability across the globe That description rings true even today. International banks are locked together in a web of mutual obligations that defies easy understanding or simple control. They can use their international reach to try to sidestep taxes and regulations. And, since their debts to each other are a very real kind of private money, when the banks are fragile, the entire monetary system of the world also becomes vulnerable. We are still trying to figure out what to do with these banks. We cannot live without them, it seems, and yet we are not sure we want to live with them. Governments have long sought ways to hold them in check. Sometimes the approach has been laissez-faire, sometimes not. Few regulators have been quite as ardent as King Philip IV of France. The last grandmaster of the Templars, Jacques de Molay, was burned to death in Paris in 1314 He owed money to the Templars, and they refused to forgive his debts. So in 1307, on the site of what is now the Temple stop on the Paris Metro, Philip launched a raid on the Paris Temple - the first of a series of attacks across Europe. Templars were tortured and forced to confess any sin the Inquisition could imagine. The order was disbanded by the Pope. The London Temple was rented out to lawyers. And the last grandmaster of the Templars, Jacques de Molay, was brought to the centre of Paris and publicly burned to death.

âDon't give us flakâ,"Gwen's girlfriend Becky (left) was with her throughout the transition A transgender woman who let people ask her questions about her life on an internet forum was inundated with even morewhen the BBC reported on her story. Many readers wrote to Gwen asking for advice about a friend or family member who is transitioning. Here Gwen, from Pennsylvania, addresses some questions from BBC website readers. ""There are going to be a lot of people out there who might hate her for who she is, but tell her that she has plenty of people in her life who are going to love her much more than any amount of hate she could receive. ""My personal rule is:Just don't read the comments.If you're going to read any comments people make, don't bother responding. They usually have their minds made up and no amount of arguing is going to make them apologise."" South Yorkshire transgender child on her transition- Read more here. ""The best advice is to just listen to what they have to say and try not to make it a big deal. ""When I was starting to transition, all I wanted was for life to feel 'normal' again. ""I didn't really want to talk about transitioning too much, but it was nice to have friends who just listened to me on the days where it was especially hard and told me they loved me anyway."" This video can not be played Gwen's story ""The best thing would be to address someone by what it looks like they're going for. If this customer comes in every day in a dress and make-up, I would assume they wanted to be greeted as 'Ms'. ""It's always best to go by what you see and then, if they correct you, just go by what they'd rather be called instead. ""Maybe this person isn't comfortable being called 'Ms' yet, but that's something only they could know."" ""I don't tell people until they need to know. I've found that letting people get to know me as everything I am first, aside from my trans status, helps them see me as someone other than a token trans friend after I disclose, if I ever choose to. ""If I'm not going to be having a sexual relationship with someone, they really don't need to know because it's not relevant. ""For jobs, it has to come up when listing former names on applications. But I don't treat it like a big deal and they follow suit. ""A lot of my colleagues still don't know that I'm trans, although my manager does and was really supportive."" ""Kids have a pretty good idea what their gender is the same way kids have a pretty good idea if they're straight or gay."" ""My biggest advice here is not to conflate passing with attractiveness. ""Being beautiful does not mean you will pass and passing doesn't mean that you're beautiful either. ""Passing as the other gender is far more attainable than a lot of trans people realise, and I see many ""new"" transitioners fall into the trap of thinking that if they aren't pretty, they aren't passing. ""I wish that we lived in a world where people were treated fairly and respectfully even if they're 'ugly' and don't pass, but the reality of the world we live in right now is that it makes life much easier if you do pass, so please don't give trans people flak for trying to just fit in to get by."" ""A woman to me is a culmination of her experiences, the people in her life, the choices she makes."" ""My girlfriend and I actually dated a year before I transitioned. I broke up with her out of fear of her breaking my heart and breaking up with me, after telling her that I felt I should have been born a woman. ""I should have told her though, because when I finally did tell her a year later, she was 110% accepting and supportive and we started dating again shortly thereafter. ""I've been with her since a couple of weeks after starting HRT [hormone replacement therapy]."" ""I'm not a lesbian - I'm bisexual - I experience attraction to men as well. What someone looks like doesn't matter as much to me as who they are as a person. ""Being trans and transitioning isn't about sexuality - it's about your gender identity. Gender is who you go to bed as and sexuality is who you go to bed with. ""There are trans people who are straight, gay, bisexual, asexual... the two aren't connected at all in terms of why or whether or not someone transitions. ""Although I'm not a lesbian, I appear as one to the public and there are difficulties surrounding that. I don't feel as safe holding my girlfriend's hand in public everywhere we go, but most people have been pretty accepting."" ""After spending time on both sides of the 'gender line', I can confidently say that there is really no quality that, in a vacuum, makes a person a man or a woman. ""A woman to me is a culmination of her experiences, the people in her life, the choices she makes, everything that has led her to where she is today. ""Sometimes she's born in a male body like I was, but our histories do not define us. I refuse to be limited by mine in the same way people do not want their past crimes or disabilities or embarrassments to define who they are today. ""I have (finally) found a body that I am mostly comfortable in and that's enough for me. Hopefully that's enough for you as well."" Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there's a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity It is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It's not a mental illness Treatment for gender dysphoria aims to help reduce or remove the distressing feelings For some people, it can mean dressing and living as their preferred gender For others, it can mean taking hormones or also having surgery to change their physical appearance Many trans people have treatment to change their body permanently, so they're more consistent with their gender identity, and the vast majority are satisfied with the eventual results Source: NHS,external ""Every day of living as a trans person is putting a wall up, protecting yourself from people who hate you for literally no reason."" ""What bothers me the most is when people blame the high suicide rate of trans people on our 'mental illness', like we're predisposed to it, and refuse to consider that maybe they are the reason so many trans youth kill themselves. ""How would you feel if every day people were calling you a freak, mentally ill, saying you belong in an asylum, telling you that you don't deserve to be loved? ""How would you feel being scared to date anyone because they might murder you once you tell them your history? ""Every day of living as a trans person is putting a wall up, protecting yourself from people who hate you for literally no reason, because you have zero impact on their lives. ""Eventually, the pressure gets to some people and they decide they don't want to live any more. Studies have shown that the suicide rate drastically decreases when a trans person transitions young and has a lot of love and support from their family. ""All we need is to be loved, just like anyone else. As for how I deal with them, I try to respond respectfully and show them I'm just a person like anyone else and if they respond negatively, I smile and walk away. ""Living well is the best revenge."" ""Aside from finally feeling at peace with the right hormone in my body, it hasn't affected my mood or emotions too much. ""I find it a lot easier to cry these days, physically speaking, and I'm not quite sure why that is. I get the feeling that I want to cry as often as I did in the past, but tears actually come out more often than they ever did before."" ""I've never had any problems, but that's because I pass and look like I 'belong' in the women's room. ""I always use the women's bathroom because if I walked into the men's room, something awful could happen to me. ""So I go to the ladies' room, fix my face and hair, make friends with the girl in the stall next to me and leave, like everyone else."" What would you ask a transgender woman?

Payet rejoins Marseille for Â£25m,"Payet has not played for West Ham since coming on as a substitute in a 5-0 FA Cup defeat by Manchester City West Ham have accused Dimitri Payet of showing a lack of ""commitment and respect"" after the France international rejoined Marseille for Â£25m. The Hammers insist they did not need to sell Payet and joint-chairman David Sullivan said he wanted the player to stay to ""make an example"" of him. But Sullivan added that manager Slaven Bilic approved the sale in ""the interests of squad unity"". Payet said he needed to ""return to his roots"" at his former club. The 29-year-old has signed a four-and-a-half-year deal with the Ligue 1 club. He said: ""I lived an exceptional year at West Ham, I have a great memory of the fans of the club. ""Going back to Marseille is a personal choice. I no longer felt well at West Ham, I needed to return to my roots. ""Marseille is a very pleasant city to live in."" Joint-chairman David Sullivan The club would like to place on record its sincere disappointment that Dimitri Payet did not show the same commitment and respect to West Ham United that the club and fans showed him, particularly when it rewarded him with a lucrative new five-and-a-half-year deal only last year. I would like to make it clear that we have no financial need to sell our best players and that the decision to allow Payet to leave was in accordance with the wishes of the manager and the interests of squad unity. To be frank, my board and I would have preferred for him to have stayed in order to make an example of him, as no player is bigger than the club. I am confident that with the quality of the players we have brought in during January already, the squad will be stronger at the end of this transfer window than it was at the start. The attacking midfielder joined West Ham from Marseille for Â£10.7m in June 2015 and signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract in February 2016. He excelled in his first season with the London club, scoring 12 goals and earning a nomination for the PFA Players' Player of the Year award. During the 2015-16 season West Ham won 50% of the Premier League games that Payet played in, but just one of the eight matches he missed. He then helped France reach the final of Euro 2016, where the hosts were beaten by Portugal. Dimitri Payet was far less influential to West Ham this season This season Payet's influence on the Hammers has waned, with the team winning three of the four games he has missed but only 27.8% of those he has featured in. However, statistics suggest that his individual displays have not changed drastically. Over 90 minutes he averaged 3.27 shots this season compared to 2.42 last term, created 4.4 chances per game compared to 4.17 last season and had more touches and a better passing accuracy this season. He also made more sprints per game this season and covered just 100m less per match (10.3km to 10.4km). Bilic said earlier this month that Payet, who has scored three goals this season, did not want to play for the club any more. West Ham insisted he would not be sold, but after rejecting two bids from Marseille andsigning Robert Snodgrass,they decided to sell the France international on Sunday. As well as the purchase of Snodgrass this month, the Hammers have also signed centre-back Jose Fonte from Southampton for Â£8m.
