Russia bans Johnson from country over Ukraine war,"Russia has banned Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other senior ministers from entering Russia over the UK's ""hostile"" stance on the war in Ukraine. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and 10 other senior politicians - mostly members of the Cabinet - have also been barred. Moscow said the decision had been made in retaliation to the UK's sanctions against it since it invaded Ukraine. In March, Moscow imposed a similar ban against US President Joe Biden. The full list is: Prime MinisterBoris Johnson Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss Defence SecretaryBen Wallace Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor, and Secretary of State for JusticeDominic Raab Secretary of State for TransportGrant Shapps Home SecretaryPriti Patel The ChancellorRishi Sunak Minister for Entrepreneurship, Energy and Industrial StrategyKwasi Kwarteng Minister for Digital, Culture, Media and SportNadine Dorries Minister for the Armed ForcesJames Heappey First Minister of ScotlandNicola Sturgeon Attorney General for England and Wales and advocate general for Northern IrelandSuella Braverman Conservative MP and former British Prime MinisterTheresa May In a statement,external, Russia's foreign ministry said: ""London's unbridled information and political campaign aimed at isolating Russia internationally, creating conditions for containing our country and strangling the domestic economy"" were responsible for its decision. It added: ""In essence, the British leadership is deliberately aggravating the situation around Ukraine, pumping the Kyiv regime with lethal weapons and coordinating similar efforts on the part of Nato."" The UK government said it remained ""resolute"" in its support for Ukraine despite the move, adding that it condemned Russia's ""reprehensible actions"" in the country. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also reacted to the sanctions, describing President Putin as ""a war criminal"" and vowing that she would not ""shy away from condemning him and his regime"". Earlier this week, the UK and US governmentsannounced further sanctions on Russia. The sanctions included financial measures designed to damage Russia's economy and penalise Russian President Vladimir Putin, high-ranking officials, and people who have benefited from his regime. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine? How sanctions have changed everyday life in Russia Nato countries - including the UK and US - are also supplying weapons, ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine, although they have ruled out sending in Nato troops or implementing a no-fly zone. On Wednesday, the US said that more sophisticated offensive weaponry would be sent to Ukraine as part of a $800m (Â£612m) package. In response, Moscow on Friday warned the US that there would be ""unpredictable consequences"" if it refused to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Retaliation of this kind was always likely. Russia sees the UK as one of the international actors most intimately involved in efforts to support Ukraine's militarily and isolate Russia economically and politically. Russia's move is unlikely to make a difference to the travel plans of the 13 British politicians. It is unlikely any of them had a trip to Moscow in their diaries. But it speaks to the Kremlin's growing anger at the way the West has responded to its invasion of Ukraine and its willingness to lash out against those who it sees as having played a role in isolating Russia in the past - Theresa May helped to orchestrate the mass expulsion of scores of Russian diplomats from more than 20 Western allies in the wake of Russia's use of a nerve agent in Salisbury in 2018. Russia has warned that further shipments of Western military equipment to Ukraine could result in ""unpredictable consequences"". Banning political leaders is not exactly unexpected. What worries officials in London, Washington and elsewhere is that Russia has the ability, and possibly even the desire, to resort to other military means, including the use of unconventional weapons.

Johnson to visit India in bid to boost defence ties,"Boris Johnson will meet India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi for trade and defence talks Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to make a long-delayed trip to India this week in a bid to strengthen security ties with the country. He will meet his counterpart Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Friday, with talks focused on defence and trade. It will be Mr Johnson's first major trip to India as PM after previous visits were postponed due to Covid. The UK has been trying to persuade India to reduce its reliance on Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine. Last month, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss visited Indiain an attempt to get the country to impose stronger sanctions against Russiaand to cooperate more closely on trade, defence, energy and food security. India has not criticised Russia directly since it invaded Ukraine on 24 February and did notcondemn the invasion at a United Nations voteon the issue. Mr Johnson's trip will also include a visit to Gujarat on Thursday, India's fifth-largest state, where he is expected to announce a major investment in key industries in the UK and India, as well as new collaboration on science, health and technology. Ahead of his visit, the prime minister said: ""As we face threats to our peace and prosperity from autocratic states, it is vital that democracies and friends stick together. ""India, as a major economic power and the world's largest democracy, is a highly valued strategic partner for the UK in these uncertain times. ""My visit to India will deliver on the things that really matter to the people of both our nations - from job creation and economic growth to energy security and defence."" In April last year,Mr Johnson cancelled a trip to Indiawhen the south Asian nation was added to the UK's red list, meaning people returning from there had to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. Initially the government hadinsisted the trip would go ahead, despite India's soaring coronavirus cases and the new delta variant. Instead Mr Johnson said he would speak to the Indian prime minister online, after questions as to why India had not ben put on the red list. A trip in January 2021 to India was also cancelled due to the UK lockdown.

What does the Rwanda deal mean?,"Home Secretary Priti Patel travelled to Rwandan capital Kigali to sign the deal There was only muted applause from a handful of officials as the politicians shook hands in the Kigali Conference Centre, smiling awkwardly for the cameras. But Home Secretary Priti Patel hailed the Rwandan deal as a world first, a major milestone. And it is. Potentially. Some nations have attempted to outsource their asylum processing offshore. But no country has ever tried to export its asylum responsibilities before. What the deal envisages is an end to the system of protection for those fleeing war and persecution that Britain signed up to more than 70 years ago. Last year 28,526 people crossed the Channel in small boats Instead of claiming asylum when they arrive in Britain, those fleeing persecution or war will have to find a legal and safe route to the UK or, for most, face being packed off to Africa. There are currently very few such routes and none available to the citizens of countries that make up the bulk of those granted refugee status in Britain. What is an asylum seeker form Iraq or Iran, say, supposed to do? They are faced with Catch 22. They can only claim asylum to Britain on British soil. But in reaching the UK, they make themselves inadmissible for asylum. Which other countries send asylum seekers overseas? UK criticised over 'cruel' Rwanda asylum plan Land of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinion For the home secretary and the prime minister, that appears to be the long-term aim: to stop all asylum seekers from coming to Britain. Instead, we are promised a network of safe routes from UN-run refugee camps. As things stand, the UK is a passive recipient of those asking for sanctuary. The government has no control over who the asylum seekers are. The new plan would mean politicians could pick and choose. This video can not be played Watch: Prime Minister outlines Rwanda immigration plans in April ""It's a striking fact that around seven out of 10 of those arriving in small boats last year were men under 40, paying people smugglers to queue jump and taking up our capacity to help genuine women and child refugees,"" was how the prime minister put it. Boris Johnson knew what buttons he was pressing when he said: ""We can't ask the British taxpayer to write a blank cheque to cover the costs of anyone who might want to come and live here."" There is concern the UK is being taken for a ride by people simply seeking a better life. He conflated the thousands of people risking their lives to reach the Kent coast in small boats with ""economic migrants taking advantage of the asylum system"". The problem with this argument is that a substantial majority of those who cross the channel are subsequently granted refugee status by the UK government. Home Office officials decide they do indeed have a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of origin. It was noticeable how upbeat the home secretary was as she jetted to Kigali to sign on the dotted line. Priti Patel signed the deal with Rwandan foreign minister Vincent Biruta Priti Patel has faced a great deal of criticism in recent weeks, often from MPs on her own side.  But she sees the Rwandan deal, nine months in the making, as an opportunity to defeat the ""evil people smugglers"" whose activities in the Channel are so humiliating for a government that promised to take back control of Britain's borders. I sense this home secretary relishes the opportunity of a battle against ""the naysayers"", her ""political opponents"" who ""condemn everything"" without a plan of their own, and the asylum ""lawyers who are fleecing the British taxpayer"". That is an argument that would play well with her core support, burnish her Brexit credentials, and helpfully change the conversation from visa delays and ""partygate"". One can see, then, why the UK government would want this deal, but what about the Rwandans? Are they happy about it? We don't know all the details of the arrangement, but there is an initial Â£120m for educational projects and other money to assist with processing sent by the UK. Rwandan ministers believe the arrival of motivated migrants will help boost their economy and the deal itself will encourage further investment. But one wonders what the ordinary Rwandan will think of a rich European country sending its problem to a small African state.

Man infected with sewage-linked parasite in river,"Lifeboat instructor David Deveney says it ""turns your stomach"" to think about ingesting human waste A lifeboat volunteer said he spent days in hospital after contracting a parasitic infection linked to sewage after a river training exercise. David Deveney suffered giardiasis after spending two hours in the River Severn and said an investigation found an 80% chance it came from human sewage. Sewage was spilt into Welsh rivers more than 95,000 times and for more than 791,000 hours last year, figures show. The illness has not been categorically linked to sewage or spills in Wales. Both the River Severn and River Wye, which end in the Severn Estuary, run through Wales and England. Welsh Water, which provides water and wastewater services to most households in Wales, said the spills had ""a limited impact"" on Welsh rivers. Mr Deveney, a lifeboat training manager with the Severn Area Rescue Association in Beachley, at the mouth of the Wye in Gloucestershire, became unwell after teaching volunteers how to enter and exit the water in October 2020. The training involved being submerged. Last chance to save Wales' rivers? Sewage dumping soars to 105,000 recorded incidents 'It's an ecological catastrophe on my doorstep' Giardiasis is an illness caused by the giardia parasite and can be caused by drinking water that's not been treated to kill germs,according to the NHS,external. He said getting a parasite during the exercise ""was the last thing on his mind"". But that evening, after the training exercise, he said he sat up in bed with ""projectile"" vomiting and severe diarrhoea. That went on for three days. Because he had not eaten in any restaurants or drunk non-treated water in the 48 hours before getting sick, his GP concluded he had probably ingested live parasites during his two hours in the water. Mr Deveney say the illness left him out of pocket after being off work for three-and-a-half weeks Mr Deveney spent three days in the gastrointestinal ward at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, recovered enough to go home for about a week but was then back in the Grange Hospital in Cwmbran for five days. The HGV recovery technician spent a total of three-and-a-half weeks off work with the illness, something he said he would not wish on ""his worst enemy"". ""I've been through physical hell with the after-effects of the contaminated water,"" he said. Giardiasis isa notifiable illness,external, meaning it had to be reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) and Natural Resources Wales (NRW), as well as the authorities in England. ""They said it was an 80% chance of human slurry or human waste,"" he said. ""It turns your stomach when you think about itâ¦ you've ingested that through no fault of your own when you thought you were just messing around in a normal river."" PHW said it could not comment on specific cases. Mr Deveney says when they conduct rescues, lifeboat crews are forced to expose themselves to contamination ""I think it would be very difficult to pinpoint it to one organization, maybe one farm or one sewage outfall, but it made me think about my water intake,"" he said. ""It won't stop me volunteering as a lifeboat helmsman or as an instructor, but we now try and carry more antibacterial wipes or trying not to have the head submerged in the water as often as we did before."" Wild swimming advice from NRW,externalsays ""bacteria, viruses, and toxic algae may be present in some water"" and to avoid water that ""looks or smells bad"". While the source of the parasite that caused Mr Deveney's illness will never be known for certain, he said he was told by investigators that heavy rains and high tides at the time meant the River Wye was the most likely source. There were more than 95,000 reported spills of sewage into Welsh rivers in 2021, lasting for more than 791,000 hours Thelatest figures from Welsh Water indicate,externalmore than 94,000 reported spills of sewage into Welsh rivers in 2021, with the discharges lasting for more than 785,000 hours. The figures come from monitors on more than 2,000 water treatment works and sewer overflows across the Welsh Water network. St Nicholas at Goodwick in Pembrokeshire had the most spills at 366, which lasted a total of 6,662 hours. In the Wye and its tributaries, there were 1,678 reported spills for a total duration of 10,315 hours. Welsh Water has been releasing data on spills - called combined sewer overflows (CSOs) - since 2019. This year's figures are down 11% from 2020 when there were 106,094 reported CSOs with 872,976 hours of discharge. 'Huge poo islands' prompt calls for river clean-up Urgent plan to stop sewage discharges into rivers Fury over water firm's open-mouth swimming comment The latest spill data from Hafren Dyfrdwy,external, which has sewage works in some parts of mid and north Wales, indicate 1,675 CSOs last year with a duration of 6,583 hours. That is more than the 1,269 CSOs in 2020 when the duration was nearly twice as high at 12,340 hours. The charity Afonydd Cymru, which translates as Welsh rivers, says river pollution is an urgent issue Afonydd Cymru, the umbrella body representing six river trusts across Wales, said spills were happening ""far too frequently and are not operating during exceptional rainfall only"". The charity also put the small decrease in CSOs in 2021 down to ""weather patterns"". ""CSOs are one element of a number of impacts to our watercourses and we expect funding and solutions to be prioritised to achieve the greatest environmental benefit,"" said the charity's chief executive Gail Davies-Walsh. ""Despite a climate change and nature emergency declared by the Welsh government, our Welsh rivers are still in decline, [with] one in six species at risk of extinction and salmon and sea trout populations either at risk or probably at risk across Wales,"" said Ms Davies-Walsh. She added: ""We need to see action, and quickly if the situation is to improve."" Lifeboat crews report regularly seeing toilet paper, condoms, tampons and brown froth in the Wye and Severn rivers As part of a team that responds to flooding and water incidents in Monmouthshire, Mr Deveney said crews had ""no choice"" but to go into contaminated water to help people in trouble. ""We know the contamination risk but somebody that needs our help, we will still go and help them,"" he said. The team trains on the River Wye between Bigweir Bridge and Monmouth. Mr Deveney said getting sick from river water had ""opened his eyes"" to the issue. ""We're always on the lookout forâ¦ contaminated water,"" he said. ""You see brown, you see toilet paper in some parts of it, condoms, sometimes sanitary products and when you think of it being in your river and the kind of brown foam you get in turbulent water."" Mr Deveney said he often sees people on the river between Monmouth and Chepstow, including paddle boarders, kayakers and swimmers, and was worried they may get sick too. ""Sometimes it's not the nicest environment,"" he said. ""It's not an advert... for the Wye Valley, and I would discourage people from swimming in it... and that goes against my belief in enjoying the water."" Welsh Water said CSOs played a ""vital role"" in preventing homes from being flooded, and that the system in Wales, which sees surface water draining into the same pipes as sewage, is ""highly monitored"". ""We are pleased that our investment in recent years has played a part in helping reduce the number of spills by 10% in 2021, despite us adding monitors to an additional 198 CSOs in the same year,"" a spokesperson said. The not-for-profit company said 99% of CSOs were now monitored in Wales, and that research by NRW showed they had ""a very limited impact on water bodies in Wales"". The spokesperson said removing them would cost between Â£9bn and Â£14bn and involve ""digging up almost every street in Wales"". Welsh Water added that it recognised more needed to be done to improve water quality, and would be investing Â£800m in the waste-water network over the five years to 2025, including Â£100m to improve CSOs. A spokesperson for Hafren Dyfrdwy's parent company, Severn Trent, said storm overflows accounted for ""3.5% of rivers not achieving good ecological status"", adding that 36% of river pollution comes from agriculture. Mr Deveney said he understood that fixing the problem would cost billions and would cause widespread disruption. ""But somebody needs to hold their hands up and deal with it,"" he said. ""Saying sorry or saying 'yes, we have identified x amount... has over spilt', well in my eyes one hour is too much because it could be somebody else's loved one that may not have the physical strength and or physical state to be able to cope with [giardiasis].""

Beauty chain L'Occitane in U-turn on Russian shops,"The French cosmetics chain L'Occitane says it will close its Russian shops and website, days after defending its decision to continue trading. The firm said the move follows the ""enormous human suffering and escalating military action in Ukraine"". L'Occitane told the BBC last weekit was keeping its shops open to protect staff from potential ""retaliation"". Some customers had criticised the company for its decision and called for a boycott of the brand. Its products are sold at more than 3,085 retail outlets worldwide and had sales of â¬1.5bn (Â£1.3bn) last year. Last week the firm told the BBC it had discussed closing its Russian stores ""at length"" but said it had not because it wanted to protect staff from potential ""retaliation"". The cosmetics firm, which has spas and stores in Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg, originally said it could not take the ""risk"" of closing its shops. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia Chanel restricts sales of goods to Russians abroad But in a statement issued on Friday evening, L'Occitane said the decision to shut its Russian operation had been approved by the company's board of directors. ""Given the enormous human suffering being caused by escalating military action in Ukraine and to protect our employees worldwide from potential public aggression, we have decided to close our own stores and e-commerce websites in Russia,"" the statement said. Hundreds of international brands including L'Oreal and Estee Lauder have already closed shops and ceased online sales in Russia in protest at the war in Ukraine. Tweeting a picture of a L'Occitane product one customer said: ""I've used this cream for years, never again. Even if they back out, they've showed their corporate integrity."" Allow Twitter content?

A number of firmsare still listed as still operating in Russia,externalby Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld at Yale University's School of Management. Among them are the French energy giant EDF, the UAE's Emirates airline, and China's Lenovo computer brand. Around 600 big firms have pulled out of Russia or suspended sales since it invaded, including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple. Other international outlets still open in Russia have said they are not able to shut stores due to complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. Burger King and the hotel groups Marriott and Accor are among the firms restricted by these arrangements. On Tuesday, some independent Nike stores were found to be operating in Russia over a week after the sportswear brand said it was temporarily closing all its shops in the country. Professor Vanessa Burbano, from Columbia Business School in the US, said that consistency between claims and actions is important for brands with operations in Russia. ""Customers and employees do pay attention to which companies are first in making these kinds of commitments and which firms don't go as far,"" Prof Burbano said. ""The risk of companies making claims that may not be perceived as consistent with their actions is that they could be seen as a green-washing in the Ukraine context which would be bad for their reputation.""

Six arrests after oil tanker XR protest,"Olympian Etienne Stott joined the protest on top of a Shell oil tanker Six people have been arrested after climate change activists, including two Olympians, scaled an oil tanker. Extinction Rebellion protesters surrounded the Shell tanker in Bayswater Road in London in protest at the use of fossil fuels. Gold medal-winning canoeist Etienne Stott and sailor Laura Baldwin had glued themselves to the top of the tanker, Extinction Rebellion said. The Met said six arrests for vehicle interference had been made. It is not known if the two Olympians were among those arrested. Mr Stott said he wanted to ""disrupt the toxic fossil fuel industry"". A large banner was unfurled after two people climbed Marble Arch The Met said protesters had been walking through central London and ""stopped at various locations along their unspecified route, causing disruption"". Shortly before 18:00 BST, a man and a woman climbed up two pillars on Marble Arch to hoist a green banner with ""End fossil fuels now"" on it. A group of eight activists later locked themselves on to a car in the road, while two glued themselves to the roof. Officers cleared the road and several people were detained. Allow Twitter content?

GB unable to secure BJK Cup finals spot,"This video can not be played Best shots by GB's Harriet Dart in her singles win Great Britain were unable to secure their place in the Billie Jean King Cup finals as Harriet Dart and Katie Swan lost the decisive doubles match against the Czech Republic. With the best-of-five tie locked at 2-2, Czech pair Marketa Vondrousova and Karolina Muchova sealed victory with a 6-1 7-5 win on the Prague clay. Earlier, Dart beat Linda Fruhvirtova 6-0 5-7 6-2 to keep the tie alive. That came after British number one Emma Raducanu lost 6-1 6-1 to Vondrousova. US Open champion Raducanu was unable to cope with 2019 French Open runner-up Vondrousova's excellent clay-court game and the 19-year-old Briton was also hampered by a blister on her foot. Relive Great Britain's BJK Cup tie in the Czech Republic With Raducanu sitting out the crucial doubles, Dart played alongside British number six Swan. The pair fought back from 4-1 down to 4-4 in the second set, but were unable to force a decider as Muchova and Vondrousova - who dropped just nine games on the way to winning all three of her matches in the tie - took control once again. The Czech pair won the deciding doubles to clinch a 3-2 victory for their nation and ensure they qualify for November's 12-team finals. Britain, who had a new-look team in the absence of recently-retired Johanna Konta and the unavailable Heather Watson, will face a play-off tie during the same week. However, Britain are among the countries bidding to stage the finals and could also still qualify as the host nation. This video can not be played Watch: Injured Raducanu loses to Vondrousova Captain Anne Keothavong's team were the huge underdogs going into the tie, with the hosts having a depth of talent and great pedigree in this event. Even without big-name trio Barbora Krejcikova, Karolina Pliskova and Petra Kvitova, the Czechs were in a strong position after Raducanu lost to Vondrousova in Saturday's first singles rubber. Raducanu, playing in only her second senior clay-court match after beating Tereza Martincova on Friday, was aiming to put Britain into the lead for the first time and give the momentum to her young side. But the world number 12 came up against a wily opponent in Vondrousova, who is a natural on the surface and has proved that with her results. Raducanu was unable to cope with her opponent's variety and court-craft in a one-sided first set, which lasted just 26 minutes. The Briton needed to go off court before the start of the second set for treatment on a blister on her right foot and struggled to move properly when the match resumed. Vondrousova, ranked 32nd in the world, moved 2-0 ahead but then seemed unsettled by Raducanu's lack of movement and lost concentration. Raducanu was gifted a break back, only for the Czech to refocus and win the next four games to seal victory in 62 minutes. Hampered by illness and injury, Emma Raducanu has struggled for momentum in 2022 and has won just three matches Experienced Czech captain Petr Pala made a shock move by picking 16-year-old Fruhvirtova to play against Dart instead of world number 50 Martincova. Dart suffered a heavy defeat by Vondrousova on Friday but showed no signs of any scars as she made a confident start against Fruhvirtova. The 25-year-old Londoner, who broke into the world's top 100 recently after reaching the fourth round at Indian Wells, asserted her authority and eased to the opening set in 29 minutes. When she moved into a 3-0 and 40-0 lead in the second set, the manner of victory looked as though it would be routine. Even though Fruhvirtova managed to hold serve in that game, Dart still had the chance to serve out herself at 5-2 but was unable to take her first match point before going on to be broken for 5-3. Another match point came Dart's way in the ninth game, only for Fruhvirtova to show further resistance. The Czech held and then won the next three games - with Dart showing her frustration by throwing her racquet - to force a deciding set. At the start of the third, Dart again showed her ability to reset and moved 5-0 in front before eventually serving out victory at the fourth attempt in the match. ""I definitely think I gave my team a little bit of a heart attack,"" said Dart. ""It's natural that I was a bit nervous to try and close it out. I was happy that I was able to reset after the second set. I'm really proud of myself to get through."" Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent Emma Raducanu, Harriet Dart and Katie Swan showed plenty of fight over the two days to make the scoreline closer than expected, but even with four star players missing, the Czechs just had too many talented options. Great Britain will next be in action in November, either in a play-off tie or as hosts of the finals. The Lawn Tennis Association expects a decision on the venue for the event before the end of May. Minds are now turning to the French Open, with Raducanu still hopeful of being able to play in the clay-court tournament in Stuttgart next week even though her blisters need regular bathing in surgical spirit. Blisters on her hands and feet, as well as a hip injury and a stiff back, have all held the 19-year-old back this season. The optimum training schedule is still under construction, and like any other athlete in the early stage of a career, Raducanu's body is not yet sufficiently tuned to the rigours of weekly competition. Poland also booked their place in the finals for the first time when world number one Iga Swiatek won 6-0 6-0 against Romania's Andreea Prisacariu. The 20-year-old, whorose to the top of the rankingsafter Ashleigh Barty's retirement, secured a 3-0 win for the Poles with her 19th consecutive match victory. Kazakhstan will also make their finals debut after a surprising victory over Germany, while Italy and Spain qualified after taking unassailable 3-0 leads in their ties against France and the Netherlands.

The multi-million-pound homes of sanctioned oligarchs,"A dozen sanctioned Russians are linked to an estimated Â£800m worth of property in the UK, analysis by the BBC reveals. Multi-million pound country manors in the south of England and luxury flats in London's most expensive areas are among the homes which have been snapped up by figures linked to Vladimir Putin. Some of the individuals deny ownership of the mansions, which may mean they are beyond the reach of the sanctions. To get to the bottom of who owns what, we carried out a detailed trawl of leaked offshore documents, the Land Registry and court papers - as well as previous reporting. Our findings highlight the UK's status as a place for super-rich Russians to set up home, and the difficulties of identifying the true owners of properties bought by offshore firms in tax havens. In response to the BBC's findings, anti-corruption group, Transparency International highlighted how hard it is to track who owns what in the UK. ""Because of the system of secrecy here in the UK and in relation to the Overseas Dependencies it's really easy for people to hide their assets and their funds in the UK and not even the police necessarily have sight of where those assets are,"" Rachel Davies, head of advocacy at the organisation, told the BBC. The UK, US and European Union have together sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and businesses, including wealthybusiness leaders - so-called oligarchs- who are considered close to the Kremlin. Most of those listed below were sanctioned after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, although some were already on the government's sanctions list. Properties linked to sanctioned Russians include: A Â£230m ($302m) property empire of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich A Â£65m Victorian mansion in north London with planning permission for a cigar room and wine cellar A Surrey manor house at the centre of a legal dispute involving Vladimir Putin's former judo sparring partner In early March, the British government imposed sanctions on the 55-year-old billionaire. The previous week Mr Abramovich had put Chelsea FC up for sale. He has a vast property portfolio in the UK with more than50 luxury residences, most on Fulham Road in west London. Through his UK company Fordstam Limited, he ownsdozens of apartmentsin Chelsea Village, plus the hotel and residential complex around Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium, according to the Land Registry. His most expensive London property is a15-bedroom houseon a street that is nicknamed Billionaires Row. With its vast stucco-faced Italianate mansions, it is home to royalty and ambassadors - as well as oligarchs. Mr Abramovich bought the property in west London using an offshore company in 2011, reportedly paying Â£90m. In 2016 he was granted planning permission for a Â£28m refurbishment, including a subterranean pool, although this did not go ahead. In planning documents submitted to the council, its existing pool was described as a ""miserable space"" that was ""too small to afford comfortable or meaningful swimming"". In 2017, Mr Abramovich used Fordstam Limited to buy anapartment just off the King's Roadfor Â£8.7m. In 2019, he paid Â£22.3m for athree-storey penthouse apartmenton the former Lots Road power station site in Chelsea. Mr Abramovich did not answer the BBC's requests for comment. The UK government imposed a full asset freeze and travel ban on Alisher Usmanov on 3 March, citing the Russian billionaire's ""close links to the Kremlin"". This followed a similar move by the EU. The Uzbekistan-born businessman and former Arsenal shareholder has been a close associate of Everton's majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, who resigned as chairman of Mr Usmanov's USM Holdings in early March following the imposition of sanctions on the oligarch. Everton have suspended all dealings with Mr Usmanov's businesses, including USM's sponsorship of their training ground. His wealth has been estimated at $18.4bn (Â£14bn), including""Beechwood House in Highgate[north London]â¦ and the 16th CenturySutton Place estate in Surrey"",the UK government said,external. But a spokesman for Mr Usmanov said most of the billionaire's UK property, plus a $600m (Â£456m) yacht, had already been ""transferred into irrevocable trusts"", potentially putting them beyond the reach of sanctions. Tracing the ownership of the two houses targeted by the UK government is extremely difficult. They have been held through a complex web of trusts and companies registered in places like the British Virgin Islands which, until recently, did not require the ultimate owner to be disclosed. Beechwood House, London Mr Usmanov bought Beechwood House for Â£48m in 2008 using an offshore company.  As part of an investigation with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the BBC has seen a document showing Usmanov secured a mortgage in 2005 to part-finance payments for Sutton Place via two firms in Cyprus. His two nephews each ownmulti-million pound properties in north London. When the UK government imposed sanctions on Oleg Deripaska, they described him as worth Â£2bn and a ""one-time business partner"" of Roman Abramovich. In early March, a court heard that he has a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK, including the art deco mansionHamstone House in Weybridge, Surrey.Sitting in eight acres of grounds, the Grade II listed property was acquired for Â£7.1m by a Cyprus-based company, Edenfield Investments Limited, in 2001. Mr Deripaska also owns alarge home in Belgrave Squarethat wasoccupied by protestors. However, a spokesman for the billionaire at the time said the property belonged to family members. There is evidence suggesting Mr Deripaska owns a building five minutes' walk from Buckingham Palace. The17th-Century terrace housewas bought in 2004 for Â£4.7m by Astibe Limited - an offshore shell company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, which appears in the annual accounts of EN+ (an energy and metals group that Mr Deripaska has a stake in). The property is listed as the address of the company, according to research by Transparency International. A judge hasfrozen UK bank accountsoperated by a British businessman amid allegations they are linked to Mr Deripaska - National Crime Agency investigators believe the accounts were being used to help the oligarch avoid sanctions. A spokesperson for Mr Deripaska said the sanctions were ""deeply misguided"" and based on ""unfounded and hollow accusations"". ""Mr Deripaska has never been involved in politics. It is wrong to suggest that Mr Deripaska is close to the Government of Russia and/or Vladimir Putin,"" the statement read. ""The decision to sanction him has nothing to do with justice or law, neither does the freezing of assets belonging to him or his family."" The UK-based billionaire oligarch Mikhail Fridman had his shares frozen in the investment firm LetterOne, which owns international health food chain Holland & Barrett, after the EU sanctioned him following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On 15 March, he was also sanctioned by the British government, which said he was ""closely associated with President Vladimir Putin"". Mr Fridman told the BBC that the imposition of sanctions by the UK government left him ""shocked"" and that the statement he was closely associated with Vladimir Putin was ""absolutely incorrect"". LetterOne, which is just under 50% owned by Mr Fridman and Petr Aven (see below), announced the business partners had ""ceased to have any involvement with the company"". Mr Fridman, who is thought to be wortharound $12bn,external, owns a huge property,Athlone Housein north London, for which he paid Â£65m in 2016. Athlone House, London Mr Fridman told his local newspaper, the Hampstead and Highgate Express, the building was originally designed for a Victorian industrialist, adding: ""It felt like fate that I, as a businessman, would be similarly drawn years later to the same property and grounds."" Mr Fridman secured planning permission for a significant restoration, including the addition of a wine cellar, cinema room, swimming pool, yoga room and cigar room. Mr Aven was named in EU sanctions as ""one of Vladimir Putin's closest oligarchs"" who ""does not operate independently of the President's demands"". Along with Mikhail Fridman, the Russian billionaire's shares in LetterOne were frozen. Land Registry records show a Cyprus-based company paid Â£8m in 2009 for his home,Ingliston House in Virginia Water, Surrey. Petr Aven pictured next to his Henry Moore sculpture Mr Aven reportedly owns an extensive private art collection, which includes works by Kandinsky, Louise Bourgeois and Henry Moore. He was photographed by the FT at his home alongside some of his pieces. After he was sanctioned by the EU, he stepped down as a trustee at the Royal Academy, which returned a donation from him. Petr Avenâs art collection Mr Aven told the BBC that his family also owned atwo-bedroom apartment and studio in central London. He said he ""strongly disagreed"" with UK government's description of him as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch"". He said the sanctions against him were ""understandable, but unfair"", adding he saw no fair reason to be sanctioned and that he never operated under the demands of Vladimir Putin. ""My partners and I always tried to be out of politics,"" he said. Born in Kyiv, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, Mr Khan is ""a close associate of Vladimir Putin who has been involved in destabilising Ukraine"", according to UK authorities, which sanctioned him in March. He and and his wife Anzhelika own several properties in England. The Panama Papers revealed the couple have shares in the Seychelles company Apilosa Corporation. Land registry papers show it paid Â£62m in 2008 fortwo apartments near Buckingham Palace. What are the Panama Papers? German Khan boughttwo more flatsin the area in 2005. In 2018, they were transferred to his wife's name, according to Land Registry documents. The couple also bought amansion in Virginia Water, Surrey,for Â£26m in 2014. Records show that the mansion was sold on 24 December 2021 to Ravenmorrow Limited for Â£31m. It is unclear who now owns the property. Ravenmorrow Limited was set up in December last year and no individual is identified on UK company records as the beneficial owner. Mr Khan did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. The UK government said Igor Shuvalov ""is a core part of Putin's inner circle"" when it imposed sanctions on him in March. Officials confirmed his assets in the UK includetwo luxury apartments in Whitehallworth an estimated Â£11m. That was first reported by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, set up by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Land registry documents show the properties are owned by Sova Real Estate LLC in Russia, which - according to official records obtained by the Anti-Corruption Foundation - indicated they were owned by Mr Shuvalov and his wife. In response to our questions,  a spokesperson for Mr Shuvalov confirmed that ownership of the apartments had been transferred to a Russian company ""controlled by the Shuvalov Family"" in 2014. The value of the flats significantly exceeds the Â£634,000 that Mr Shuvalov declared as his and Mrs Shuvalov's joint wealth to the Russian parliament in 2014. Mr Shuvalov's spokesperson told the BBC that these issues ""have been the subject of competent government audits"", and that ""no complaints were ever filed"". In August 2021, Mr Gutseriev was sanctioned by the UK because of his close relationship with Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko. Mr Gutseriev was the founder of Safmar Group, a Russian conglomerate, but is no longer involved in the company. Mr Gutseriev's son Said, a British citizen who has not been sanctioned, now part-owns SFI - a company previously known as Safmar Financial Investments. ThePandora Papers revealedSaid Gutseriev owns amulti-million-pound City of London office blockbought for more than Â£40m through a secret offshore company. A simple guide to the Pandora Papers Said Gutseriev's representatives told the BBC he did not have ""any business links with his father"". His lavish wedding, which madeheadlines in 2016,external, featured performances by Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias. Yuri Soloviev is a high-ranking executive at sanctioned Russian bank VTB and was sanctioned by the UK government on 15 March this year. The 51-year-old has Russian and British citizenship. According to US Treasury officials, his wife Galina Ulyutina ""was previously implicated in a golden passport scheme"" in Bulgaria. Golden passport schemes allow nationals of one country to acquire citizenship in another through investment. Mr Soloviev owns two London properties in his own name. One is apenthouse in Hampstead, the other is inWestminster. A thirdapartment near Kensington Palacewas bought outright in the name of a relative for Â£2.2m in 2006 and revealed in the 2016 Panama Papers leak. A spokesperson for VTB told the BBC that Mr Soloviev ""left VTB group on 24 February 2022"", the day that Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. ""Mr Soloviev was not sanctioned by any countries while working at VTB,"" the statement added. The chairman of the management board of state-owned Gazprombank, Andrey Akimov, was sanctioned by the US in 2018. He was sanctioned by the UK earlier this month. According to Catherine Belton in her book Putin's People, he is a former intelligence operative and ""one of the most important financiers behind Vladimir Putin's regime"". Working with the International Consortium of Journalists, the BBC has seen evidence in the Pandora Papers leak that link Mr Akimov to property in London. Land Registry documents show that Mr Akimov's partner Marianna Chaykina owns anapartment in Knightsbridge.It was bought for Â£10m by British Virgin Islands (BVI) company Inma Investments in 2012. Ms. Chaykina is listed as co-owner of a number of Mr. Akimov's firms in leaked corporate records and she has been described by Russian media as Mr. Akimov's wife. The BBC received no response to its questions from Mr Akimov. Polina Kovaleva is the stepdaughter of Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, according to the UK government. Lavrov was sanctioned by the British government at the same time as Vladimir Putin. A few weeks later, on 24 March, the UK government sanctioned Ms Kovaleva too - saying she reportedly owns a London property worth Â£4m. Land Registry documents show Polina Kovaleva bought anapartment in Kensingtonwith no mortgage in 2016, when she was 21. Ms Kovaleva did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. Arkady Rotenberg is one of Vladimir Putin's closest friends - the pair sparred in the same judo gym in St Petersburg. The US and the EU imposed sanctions on him in 2014 following Russia's annexation of Crimea. He is also under sanction in the UK, with the government citing his ""close personal ties to President Putin"". His brother Boris and son Igor were added to the sanction list last month. In July 2020, aninvestigation by the US Senateaccused the Rotenberg brothers of using secretive purchases of expensive art to evade sanctions. Upper Ribsdenin the village of Windlesham was bought in 2012 for Â£27.5m by Ravendark Holdings Limited, a company registered in the BVI. It received a loan of over Â£30m from another BVI company said to be owned by Mr Rotenberg. In November 2021, aHigh Court judge ruled,externalthe house was held on trust for the benefit of Mr Rotenberg by Ravendark. That was appealed and the case has yet to be decided. Mr Rotenberg did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. The difficulty faced by senior judges and lawyers in establishing who owns a UK mansion illustrates how hard it can be to trace the assets of sanctioned oligarchs.

Elderly deaths contradict Shanghai Covid figures,"This video can not be played Viral videos show anger and desperation in Shanghai Dozens of elderly patients at a hospital in Shanghai have died after contracting Covid-19, but official government figures claim no deaths in the city have been caused by the disease since 2020. The BBC has spoken to a hospital manager and had access to correspondence sent to relatives of patients who've died during the Omicron outbreak that is sweeping through China's biggest city. We've also had access to official documents that suggest at least 27 patients from a single hospital, who weren't vaccinated, have died from what it called ""underlying health problems"". Shanghai is enforcing a mammoth lockdown as authorities try to contain a new wave of the virus. Most of the city's almost 25 million population have been ordered to stay inside for three weeks. The BBC has previously reported evidencethat authorities in Shanghai are struggling to deal with the outbreak. We spoke to a nurse and a health worker at Donghai Elderly Care Hospital who, between them, described desperate attempts to help dozens of elderly patients, some of whom have died. We've contacted several other care homes or hospitals for the elderly since then, after social media postings suggested there was evidence of widespread infections among hundreds of patients in 12 other facilities here. One relative of a patient at another care home in Shanghai has told us that doctors and caregivers working there had informed her that everyone in the facility had tested positive. It has capacity for around 300 patients. The Donghai Elderly Care Hospital is one of the largest of its kind in Shanghai In a phone conversation a manager at Donghai Hospital told us: ""Of course there would be deceased with Covid. [In] Shanghai the situation is like this. How could there not be any death[s] without Covid?"" In a letter sent to relatives of patients who'd died management at the hospital apologised and admitted a ""lack of professionalism"". They also expressed their ""deepest guilt"". Official figures say there have been no deaths during the current outbreak across the city; none at all. China has a strict criteria for confirming Covid-19 cases, which includes evidence in patients of lung damage caused by the virus. This must be confirmed in a scan. Any underlying health conditions is also considered before deaths are officially attributed to Covid. One man whose 72-year-old sister died at Donghai earlier this month told us that he had struggled to get a full explanation from officials about the cause of death. He told us that she had tested negative in the weeks before she died on 3 April. But he was not able to get a record of her test results in the final days before she died. The man said his sister was one of six patients in a room, five of whom died. He told the BBC that ""the outbreak [was] so bad in that care home"". As far as he could tell the official record said ""she died with Covid negative"". He said he would not go ahead with her cremation until he knew what the cause of death was. Relatives of a 99-year-old woman who died on 1 April have also raised concerns about the cause of death, given that she tested positive in the final week of her life. In social media postings seen by the BBC, with accompanying audio records, her granddaughter said the woman had been transferred to Jinshan Public Health Clinical Centre in Shanghai on 27 March, where she tested positive a day later. She was treated for underlying health problems. Three days later she tested negative for Covid. A day later she died. The woman described her death as due to ""aggravation of underlying disease due to Covid"". The BBC tried multiple times to contact authorities at Donghai and Jinshan regarding the various allegations, but was not able to get a response. Shanghai's U-turn on its Covid approach Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on? Why China is locking down its cities China is facing its most serious crisis since the virus first emerged here in early 2020, when the city of Wuhan was locked down and sealed off. Despite efforts to limit the impact on the economy in the country's financial capital the lockdown of Shanghai has continued way beyond the initial nine day period planned for. Authorities have used various terms to refer to the strict restrictions being imposed on people, calling it ""static management"" and ""closed management"".

"Beware of scams over Â£150 tax rebate, say councils","Scammers are cold-calling people asking for their bank details to receive the government's Â£150 energy rebate, councils have warned. Chancellor Rishi Sunakannounced the rebate for homes in council tax bands A to D in February to help people cope with escalating cost of living prices. The Local Government Association (LGA) urged people to be alert to the scam and not give out personal information. It emphasised that councils would never request bank details over the phone. Anyone who unexpectedly received a text, email or phone call seeking information or payment should not give out personal information, including bank details, click any links or respond until they could be sure it was genuine, the LGA said. Most homes to get energy bill relief of Â£350 Poorest could miss out on Â£150 council tax rebate Government makes Â£150 tax rebate direct debit plea Eligible households in England that pay council tax by direct debit should receive the payment directly into their bank account. The government hasurged people to set up direct debitsand the LGA said those who did not pay their council tax by direct debit would be sent a letter with details of how to claim. During the Covid pandemic, there was a sharp increase in scams, including promises of a payment from HM Revenue and Customs to support individuals during lockdown or offers to book a vaccination for a fee. Mohan Iyengar, vice-chairman of the LGA's Safer and Stronger Communities Board, said councils were working to ensure residents received their energy rebate payments as soon as possible. He added: ""However, criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their attempts to take advantage of the financial worries people are facing and as a result many of these scams look legitimate on first impression.""

"Twitter board takes action to fight Musk bidThe so-called ""poison pill"" measure is in response to Elon Musk's $43bn cash buyout offer.US & Canada","Twitter's board has armed itself against a possible hostile takeover - a day after billionaire Elon Musk made a $43bn (Â£33bn) offer to buy the platform. It has adopted what is known as a ""limited-duration shareholder rights plan"", also known as a ""poison pill"". The move will prevent anyone from having more than a 15% stake in the company. It does this by allowing others to buy additional shares at a discount.

"Twitter board takes action to fight Musk bidThe so-called ""poison pill"" measure is in response to Elon Musk's $43bn cash buyout offer.","Twitter's board has armed itself against a possible hostile takeover - a day after billionaire Elon Musk made a $43bn (Â£33bn) offer to buy the platform. It has adopted what is known as a ""limited-duration shareholder rights plan"", also known as a ""poison pill"". The move will prevent anyone from having more than a 15% stake in the company. It does this by allowing others to buy additional shares at a discount.

Sailors said to be from the Moskva were shown on parade in a video released on Saturday Some 40 sailors were killed, several are missing and many more were wounded in the sinking of the warship Moskva, the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta Europe reports quoting the mother of a sailor believed to be on board. The mother said her son told her in a phone call that the Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, had been hit by three missiles from land, from Ukrainian territory. ""He called me and was crying because of what he had seen. It was terrifying,"" she said, adding that she herself was terrified of having to wait for him to finish his service. He said he would not give her the details of what he had seen because it was so terrible, adding that many of the wounded had lost limbs because of the explosions. The newspaper has not named the sailor or his mother to protect them. But it says it has documentary evidence which makes it plausible that the sailor was serving on the Moskva. Russia's defence ministry has so far given no word of any casualties in the sinking. However, earlier we reported that Radio Libertyhad confirmed the death of Midshipman Ivan Vakhrushev. Meanwhile the ministry on Saturday postedvideo which it says is of the ship's sailorsmeeting the commander of the Russian Navy in Sevastopol. It blames the sinking on a fire on board the ship and stormy weather. Ukraine says it hit the Moskva with two missiles. Novaya Gazeta Europe was set up earlier this month to get around Russia's crackdown on media freedom. Its Russian counterpart suspended its operations in March after being repeatedly threatened with closure over its coverage of the invasion of Ukraine. Joel Gunterreporting from Serhiivka, Donbas region Rayisa
Horislavets hasnât spoken to her sister for two weeks. The sisters live either
side of the frontlines in Donbas in eastern Ukraine - Rayisa in a village
controlled by Ukraine, her sister not far away in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, controlled by Russia. They
stopped speaking because the phone connection to the Russian-controlled part of
Donbas went down, but the relationship had already deteriorated before then,
Rayisa said. Her
sister believes that the news about Russiaâs attacks on Ukraine is fake. ""She
tells me not to believe anything I see in our media, that it is the Ukrainians
doing all the damage,â Rayisa said. âI told her there are witnesses, we see
what is happening in Kharkiv and elsewhere, but she doesnât believe me.â Rayisa's
story is not uncommon in eastern Ukraine, where frontlines have divided
families and Russian propaganda has convinced many on the Russian side that the
atrocities and attacks in international media are fake. âWhen
bad things came to their home we supported them,â Rayisa said, referring to
Russian hostilities in Donetsk starting in 2014. âNow bad things come to our
home, and they turn their backs,"" she said. Rayisa
would like to speak to her sister again. âOf course, she is my sister,â she
said. âBut we cannot talk now, we will only fight.â Read Joel Gunter's full report here. Joe InwoodReporting from Dnipro Kharkiv saw fresh shelling on Sunday Across eastern
Ukraine, air raid sirens have gone from sporadic to near constant. Areas we
visited where we expected to feel relatively safe, proved to be anything but. It seems nowhere
is that the case more than in the city of Kharkiv. Terrifying
footage, filmed by the Sun newspaperâs defence editor Jerome Starkey,
shows a team of paramedics coming under attack from above. A man in red shields
a wounded woman on the floor, while others flee in panic past him. Fires are said
to be raging throughout the city, with five people reported killed. But itâs not
just Kharkiv where Russia is reportedly taking civilian lives. Zolote is a
village right on the frontlines of the Donbas. We visited it a week ago,
filming in the trenches with Ukrainian soldiers. Even then it was
astonishing to think that civilians were still living in an area that felt like
a warzone. Now, with Russiaâs main offensive gathering pace, it is simply
incomprehensible that people are still there. But, with reports
of two dead and four injured in the area, it is evident that there are still
many civilians who have been unable or unwilling to flee. Ukrainian armed
forces say they have repelled a number of attacks today, taking out dozens of
tanks, armoured vehicles and drones. But, the more
Russia is frustrated on the ground, the more they are expected to vent their
anger from above. For the people of the eastern Ukraine, that is a terrifying
prospect. Ivan Fedorov was freed last month in a prisoner exchange Mayor of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov and three other Ukrainian lawmakers attended Pope Francis's Easter Vigil mass at St Peter's Basilica in Vatican City on Saturday evening. The Vatican said that the Pope met the Ukrainian delegation privately before the mass. Fedorov was detained by Russian forces last month but freed later in a prisoner exchange. His city remains under Russian occupation. Pope Francis said: ""In this darkness of war, in the cruelty, we are all praying for you and with you this night. We are praying for all the suffering. We can only give you our company, our prayer.""

Here's a round-up of the latest developments: Azovstal iron and steel plant in Mariupol, 4 Apr 22 The Ukrainian troops defending the huge Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol may hold out for a long time with guerrilla tactics, using its nuclear bunkers and tunnels, a military expert says. Justin Crump of security consultancy Sibylline told the BBC ""they are really well set for defence"", having had more than 50 days to fortify the site and build
escape routes. ""I suspect that unless they are wiped out theyâll be
there a long time - they could do nasty stuff at night, and go back in."" He estimates as many as 800 fighters are defending the plant, led by the far-right Azov Battalion - a group vilified by Russia as ""neo-Nazis"". ""The soldiers there donât want to get captured, I donât think they'll surrender. And Russia doesnât want to go in and clear it out metre
by metre, underground, that's horrendous,"" he said. Ukraine has managed to resupply its beleaguered forces in Mariupol in very risky night-time missions, he said. The steelworks is a key industrial site and, if Russia does get control of it, ""maybe the Chinese will get them back in operation, as they want the steel"", Mr Crump said. But it will take years to rebuild devastated Mariupol, he added. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, said Russia and Ukraine have not had any recent diplomatic communications. In an interview on CBS News, Kuleba said: ""Mariupol may be a red line"" for peace talks and the situation over there is ""dire"". Russia's guarantee that it would spare the lives of Ukrainian soldiers who surrender and lay their arms down has been rejected by Ukraine. Earier on, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukrainian soldiers have remained in the besieged city of Mariupol and they ""fight to the end"". The Kremlin has said that its forces had almost completely seized the city. A monument to the Soviet commander and hero of World War Two Marshal Georgy Zhukov has been pulled down in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. Video footage circulating on social media shows the bust being toppled from its pedestal. Local official Tatyana Topchiy told Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne the incident happened very quickly at about 11:00 local time (08:00 GMT), adding that she did not know who was responsible. Local authorities in the city have been long opposed to the dismantling of the monument. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Konstantin Nemichev, leader of a military unit called the Kraken, affiliated to the far-right National Corps, said the unit had carried out the act. A longer version of the video published in his Telegram channel shows the bust being driven away in a truck and dumped at a rubbish tip. Marshal Zhukov is regarded as the most important Soviet commander of the Second World War. He played key roles in the battles of Stalingrad and Kursk, and commanded the final assault on Berlin. The manner of the monument's removal is likely to be seen as a serious provocation by many Russians. In an interview with ABC, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that remaining Ukrainian forces in the southern port city of Mariupol are still fighting and will continue to defy Russia's ultimatum for them to surrender. ""The city has not fallen"", Shmyhal said. On Sunday, Russia said it would guarantee the lives of Ukrainian soldiers who would surrender, with the Kremlin adding that the only Ukrainian soldiers left in the city were at a giant steelworks. Other Ukrainian officials have been reiterating the same message. Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko told the BBC earlier on that he had spoken to soldiers in Mariupol and ""they're going to fight until the end"". A community kitchen set up by celebrity chef JosÃ© AndrÃ©s was among the buildings destroyed by Russian bombing in Kharkiv city on Saturday. Kharkivâs mayor said three people were killed and 34 wounded by missile strikes in the city. Nate Mook, CEO of World Central Kitchen,tweeted a video of himself,externalat the destroyed building, adding that four staff members were injured in the missile attack. AndrÃ©s founded World Central Kitchen in 2010 after the devastating earthquake in Haiti that displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Since then, the organisation has set up community kitchens in several disaster zones around the world. World Central Kitchen now operates kitchens in 30 Ukrainian cities and says it provides nearly 300,000 meals a day. The Associated Press news agency reported that AndrÃ©s said the Kharkiv attack in Kharkiv  showed that giving food âin the middle of a senseless warâ was an act of courage, and that his chefs wouldnât stop their work. At the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games on Saturday evening, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex paid tribute to the people of Ukraine and praised their bravery. The Duke of Sussex, who set up the sporting competition for injured military veterans, said the world was united with Ukraine. With the first full day of the event in the Netherlands under way, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle have been pictured with Ukrainian athletes. The Duchess praised the country's team for making the journey to take part. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine is fighting in the Donbas region and it has ""no intention of surrendering"". In an interview broadcast on Sunday by CNN, Zelensky brushed aside the idea of letting Moscow take over the Donbas and part of eastern Ukraine to stop the conflict. He added: ""Ukraine and its people are clear. We have no claim to anyone else's territories but we are not going to give up ours"". When Russian President Vladimir Putin talks about taking over the Donbas, he is referring to Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. What he really means is the entirety of two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border. Earlier on we reported on the deadly shelling in Kharkiv, which led to five people being killed and 13 injured, according to regional health officials. A series of strikes were heard across the city. The shelling hit the city centre and saw fire engines called into operation from all areas. Firefighters have been battling the blazes in residential buildings. Reporters from the news agency AFP were on the scene and have described what happened. They said that the shelling ignited fires throughout the city and tore roofs from buildings, showering debris onto the roads below. Ever since Russia pulled back from its offensive to capture the capital Kyiv, the Kremlin has scaled up attacks on the east of Ukraine including Kharkiv, which is just 21km (13 miles) from the Russian border. On Friday, shelling of residential areas of the city killed 10 people, and on Saturday a strike claimed two more lives. Catherine ByaruhangaReporting from Odesa The governor of Ukraineâs Mykolaiv region has told the BBC that there have been continuous rocket attacks in the city and surrounding areas since Sunday morning. Vitaliy Kim said: âToday in the morning there were rockets, which damaged the electricity lines that provide for one of the regions of our city.â A BBC team approaching the centre of town heard explosions in the distance. The military spokesman for the region says, the Russians are bombing power grids, houses and playgrounds with various types of missiles. One eyewitness in Mykolaiv said it was hard to pinpoint the location of the strikes. The military in Mykolaiv has held off Russian forces seeking to take over the south-eastern corner of Ukraine, including the strategic port city of Odesa. Kim said that despite the recent attacks, the Russians have not yet moved the front line. âThey [Russian forces] can't advance in one day, even in one a week, they canât advance and reach Mykolaiv. So people will have some time to leave Mykolaiv, if it becomes dangerous. And if I see it becoming dangerous in the city, I will tell everyone to leave,â he said. He added: âBut for now, we have no threat about them circling us or occupying us.â The region is now in its fourth day without water after an explosion on a central water pipe along the battle lines. Most people can get drinking water from wells, but thereâs no running water for hygienic purposes. The Moskva was the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet Journalists from Radio Liberty's Ukrainian service say they have confirmed one death during the sinking of the Russian warship Moskva, despite no casualties having been announced by the Russian authorities. They spotted that news of the death of Midshipman Ivan Vakhrushev, 41, had been posted by his wife on Russian social media site Odnoklassniki (Classmates). ""Our hero!!! He died doing his duty. He fought to his last breath for the life of the ship. We are in tears and in mourning. You'll always be a hero in our hearts,"" she wrote on the site. Varvara Vakhrusheva told the journalists that her husband had died as a result of the sinking. She was informed of his death on 14 April, adding that his body had been found but the circumstances of his death had not been revealed. Ms Vakhrusheva said that another 27 members of the crew were missing, but there has been no official confirmation of this. On Saturday Russia's defence ministrypublished video footage of a paradein Sevastopol of what it said were sailors from the sunken ship, the first evidence offered of the survival of any sailors from the vessel. They were met by Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm Nikolay Yevmenov. The ministry announced late on Thursday thatthe Moskva had sunk on stormy seasafter a fire caused by exploding ammunition. Ukraine said it had sunk the ship with two Neptune missiles. Five people have been killed and 13 injured in shelling of the city of Kharkiv, local officials say. ""Rescuers are operating in the sites,"" the Ukrainian Suspilne public broadcaster reports. We'll provide more details as we get them. A lenghty queue of trucks has formed on the Poland-Belarus border as Russian and Belarusian drivers try to leave the European Union following a sanctions deadline. In the run-up to the Saturday deadline, the line extended to 80km (60 miles), with some drivers stuck for up to 33 hours. Hours after the deadline passed, the waiting times had been shortened to 12 hours, the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw says. The EU has banned lorries from Russia and Belarus - except those carrying medicine, mail or petroleum products - from entering or staying in the bloc as part of arange of sanctionsover Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
