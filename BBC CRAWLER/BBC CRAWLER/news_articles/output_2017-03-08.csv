Lack of women at top of LTA 'wrong' - Murray,"Judy Murray was Britain's Fed Cup captain from 2011 to 2016 Judy Murray says it is ""completely wrong"" there are so few women in senior leadership roles at theLawn Tennis Association.,external Britain's former Fed Cup captain believes there must be more women at the top of the national governing body if female involvement in tennis in the UK is to grow. ""There probably haven't been anywhere near enough opportunities for women to develop: not just in coaching roles, but throughout the entire organisation,"" Murray told BBC Sport. Number of women in top jobs at UK sporting bodies declining, says study Top female coach in men's football 'a long way off' - Rachel Yankey Quiz: The Simpsons & Twitter dates - International Women's Day quiz ""If you look at our leadership team at the moment within the LTA [eight people on the executive team plus head coaches Leon Smith and Jeremy Bates] -  there is only one woman, and that's the lady who runs the Human Resources department. ""So in that very important team - the decision-making team - there is no female tennis voice and to me that is completely wrong: something that really needs to be addressed. We need a much better balance."" With the notable exception of the professional tour, women are under-represented throughout the sport. Inspiring more girls to take up tennis - and then crucially to continue playing as they approach their teenage years - is central to the issue, and Murray believes female coaches are a big part of the answer. Murray designed theMiss-Hits programme,which is aimed at girls aged between five and eight, and at the beginning of February launched a female coaching initiative calledShe Rallies.Both programmes are run in partnership with the LTA. ""I tried hard when I was Fed Cup captain to grow the women's side of the game,"" she said. This video can not be played Judy Murray's Miss-Hit mission ""We don't have anywhere near enough women coaches and I do believe there is a correlation between the number of female coaches and our ability to retain girls in competitive sport. ""Women so much better understand how girls think and behave and what their needs are. Teenage girls, in my experience, are not going to open up about their fears - such as issues with their bodies - to male coaches."" The disparity between the number of male and female coaches is starkly illustrated in the professional game. Britain's top three women - Johanna Konta, Heather Watson and Naomi Broady - have taken on male coaches in recent months - principally because there is a much bigger pool to choose from. ""My experience of working with women coaches is that there aren't egos,"" Murray continued. ""They are much more willing to work together, and network and share. And I think if we can use that as a starting point, then we get more women doing things together and we can really start to make some inroads."" World number 11 Johanna Konta hired Wim Fissette after her split with long-time coach Esteban Carril The LTA says it has insisted on there being at least one woman on the shortlist for the last three executive vacancies, and is proud of the fact that the nine women who have returned from maternity leave in the past 18 months have all been offered flexible working. A specific strategy aimed at women and girls is set to be launched later in the year. And as for increasing the number of women in the senior leadership team, chief executive Michael Downey says it is a priority for the LTA, but that it will not happen overnight. ""Given that our sport is pretty gender-balanced, we want to have more gender balance in leadership roles,"" Downey told the BBC. ""Change like that can take some time to get there, but we've got to keep working on it: it's the right thing to do. ""We spend a lot of time on the key hires, and hopefully more often or not there will be qualified women who give us an opportunity to achieve some of those metrics moving forward.""

Will the budget help ailing grandparents?,"The chancellor has announced a Â£2bn rescue package for the social care sector in England. Philip Hammond says the extra money - to be phased in over three years - will help support a system that is ""clearly under pressure"". It comes after months of warnings that services provided by councils for the elderly are under threat because of a lack of funding. The numbers getting help in care homes and in their own homes for daily tasks such as washing and dressing have been falling in recent years. This trend has been blamed for contributing to the growing pressures being seen in the NHS, particularly the rise in visits to A&E. Social care chiefs have said they will need to spend nearly Â£20bn on services this year. But even when you take into account the extra money being raised from council tax increases and NHS money that is being transferred across, (both previous policy announcements to help out the sector) councils are still nearly Â£1bn short of what they need. By 2020 that funding gap is predicted to grow to Â£2.6bn. The money announced in the Budget will go some way to plugging that gap, but clearly not all the way. It is expected to be phased in - with Â£1bn coming next year and the remaining Â£1bn spread out over the subsequent two. This will go into a pot shared across both services for the elderly, and those provided to younger adults with disabilities. Charities have called it a ""sticking plaster"" to the wider problems facing the sector. Although, to be fair to the chancellor, he said the extra money would be followed by a green paper later in the year to overhaul the entire system, which has remained largely unchanged since it was created along with the NHS, after the Second World War. About 500,000 people in England pay the full cost of their care in England. This can prove very expensive. One in 10 people face costs of over Â£100,000 once they pass the age of 65. And there is growing evidence these self-funders are helping to prop up the council-funded side of the market. Analysts LaingBuisson have calculated that the fees councils pay care home firms are Â£100 a week below the actual cost of providing the care. Its researchers say this shortfall has effectively created a ""hidden care tax"" with self-funders now paying more than 25% extra for the same care. To limit these costs the coalition government announced in 2013 it would be introducing a cap on the cost of care so no-one paid more than Â£72,000 over their lifetime. This was meant to be introduced in 2016, but that was delayed until 2020. The green paper that was announced in the Budget will set out how - indeed if - that policy will be incorporated into any future changes. But the extra money will do nothing to help these people. How the care system works across the UK The alternative options 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care More than 4m people over the age of 65 have care needs, but only about 1.35m of them get formal care - either by paying for it themselves or relying on council help. What happens to the rest? There are 1.5m people who are cared for by family and friends and another 1.2m who struggle by with little or no help. In theory councils could use the extra money to increase the number of people they help. But given there's already a shortfall in funding to maintain the status quo, it seems doubtful this will happen. Again, the promise of longer-term reform remains their best hope. They may also benefit from extra support announced in the Budget for the NHS. There is Â£100m extra to help A&Es ahead of next winter and Â£325m over the next three years to help with NHS reform by getting local plans off the ground to shift care out of hospitals and into community services. Eventually this should help boost services such as GPs and district nursing, which the frail elderly are heavy users of. However, given the health budget is currently nearly Â£120bn a year, the impact of this extra money will be limited.

CIA hacking tools: Should we be worried?,"Thousands of documents said to detail the CIA's hacking tools were published by Wikileaks on Tuesday. They included allegations that the CIA had developed ways to listen in on smartphone and smart TV microphones. The CIA has been criticised by civil rights groups who say the agency ""stockpiled"" security flaws in devices to use them for its work, but left the population at risk by doing so. ""Our digital security has been compromised because the CIA has been stockpiling vulnerabilities rather than working with companies to patch them,"" said Nathan White, from the civil liberties group Access Now. ""It's not a surprise that people who have a mission to find bad guys and protect nations are using every means at their disposal to gather intelligence on a focused target,"" said Don Smith from cybersecurity firm SecureWorks. ""If the CIA doesn't have capabilities for eavesdropping, it's not doing its job."" Alan Woodward, a security researcher who advises Europol and previously advised UK spy agency GCHQ, said the public should be ""encouraged"" by the information published. ""Most of the leaked documents are about targeted attacks. This is not about mass surveillance and vacuuming up a haystack of data to search for a needle,"" he told the BBC. ""They need warrants, they can't just tap in to any phone - it doesn't work like that. One of the reasons people have faith in the security services is that they tend to obey the law, and when they don't it comes out. ""If Wikileaks has the code behind these exploits, it has a responsibility not to publish that. To do so would expose the public to the very real danger of criminals reusing those exploits still working. These were kept in a controlled environment for a reason."" However, Access Now said the CIA's decision to keep security flaws to itself had ""significant repercussions for human rights and digital security"". Whistleblower Edward Snowden criticised the scope of the CIA's methods. ""Imagine a world where the actual CIA spends its time figuring out how to spy on you through your TV,"" hewrote on Twitter,external. ""That's today"". Many home gadgets are now connected to the internet Homes are becoming increasingly ""smart"", with everything from light switches to voice-activated kitchen appliances connected to the internet. If unsecured, these could reveal our activities in the home. ""The concept that intelligence agencies are doing broad personal surveillance using these devices is not realistic,"" said Mr Smith. ""I would be amazed if that was the case because the resources to make sense of all the data just aren't there. ""My concern is much more what online criminals might be able to achieve with these devices. There are plenty of examples of things such as baby monitors being open to the wider internet."" The documents published by Wikileaks detail ways in which some Samsung televisions could be used to spy on their owners. Mr Woodward said it was unlikely the exploit was widely used. ""They're talking about a few models of Samsung TV. If you read the documents, they have been vulnerable for a while. It would be surprising if the CIA was not looking into that,"" he said. ""Has the CIA remotely hacked them? No. They have to get into your home and plug a USB drive in to them. It's a high risk. If you have to get in to somebody's house you can give yourself away."" Even fridge-freezers can be connected to the internet Mr Woodward said anybody worried that their appliances were spying on them could ""unplug them at the wall"". That advice may not help those with a modern voice-controlled fridge-freezer, the likes of which have started to go on sale. However, SecureWorks' Mike McLellan, who previously worked at the UK government's National Cyber Security Centre, said the average household should have ""bigger concerns"". ""You are more likely to be a victim of cybercrime or ransomware, than happen to become a subject of interest for an intelligence agency."" Many messaging apps now encrypt content Encrypted messaging apps offer people some peace of mind that their private messages cannot be intercepted as they travel across the internet, as the messages are scrambled. The CIA documents describe methods to compromise smartphone operating systems such as Android and iOS, which could let agents read messages sent via encrypted services such as WhatsApp and Signal. Mr Woodward said the documents did not suggest the CIA had ""cracked"" the encryption of either platform. Instead, messages could be read by compromising the ""end point"" - the sender or receiver's smartphone - where the messages are already decrypted. He said the documents indicated that governments ""accept that encryption is going to become commonplace on networks"" and that they must focus efforts on ""getting in to the end points to read messages"". ""They know banning encryption is not going to work,"" he said. Mr Snowden has described the CIA as ""reckless beyond words"", for keeping knowledge of security holes in devices such as smartphones to itself. ""The CIA reports show the [United States government] developing vulnerabilities in US products, then intentionally keeping the holes open,"" hewrote on Twitter,external. ""Why is this dangerous? Because until closed, any hacker can use the security hole the CIA left open to break in to any iPhone in the world."" Mr Woodward said he was not surprised that the CIA had not disclosed security holes it had found to manufacturers such as Apple and Google. Software flaws in a smartphone could compromise security ""If your mission is to spy, are you going to tell people something only you know about?"" he asked. ""This is the CIA, not a computer security agency. If they have [exploits] they are going to use them. It's somebody else's job to fix them."" Mr McLellan said it was ""a fact of life that intelligence agencies will look for security vulnerabilities"", but added that private companies were also searching for flaws and ""selling them to the highest bidder"". That concerns Mr White, who suggests keeping flaws secret puts ordinary citizens at risk. ""It's simply a fantasy to believe that only the 'good guys' will be able to use these tools,"" hesaid in a blogpost,external. ""It is critical for governments, law enforcement, technologists, and civil society to have an honest conversation about the impact of government hacking in the digital age."" However, Mr Woodward said it was likely that many of the security flaws in the leaked documents had already been fixed. ""The idea that the CIA is hoarding [security flaws] is not true. These things are relatively rare... and fixes for them move so quickly that a year or two is almost another era in technical terms,"" he said. ""I would be surprised if they were 'stockpiling' such exploits.  I think you'll find they use them while they still can."" Routine recording of the population would be a huge, and potentially unfeasible, undertaking for an intelligence agency. However, developments in artificial intelligence could make processing data faster and easier. Companies - including Amazon and Google -  already sell voice-controlled speakers and smartphones that can understand commands and transcribe speech.  Such technology could one day be used to help monitor citizens. Speakers such as Google Home can understand voice commands ""There is the ability to collect telephony en masse now,"" said Mr Smith. ""AI may speed it up and make more sense of the data, but I don't think it's something the average person should be worried about. It could be a future risk, among many future risks."" Mr Woodward added: ""Think of the volumes of data you'd be dealing with. They don't have the ability to record every phone conversation in the world, let alone every conversation within ear-shot of a phone. ""If you're not a person of interest, they just don't have the capacity.""

Is Arsenal's Bayern Munich defeat end of road for Wenger?,"This was Arsene Wenger's 201st game in charge of Arsenal in the Champions League Arsene Wenger stood in isolation and desolation in his technical area as the pain he suffers this time every year nagged away at him once more - but now it was accompanied by an inescapable feeling of finality. As his Arsenal side dissolved and werebrutally dispatched by Bayern Munich- once they awoke from 45 minutes of complacency - Wenger will have felt every goal, every added humiliation, like a blow to the solar plexus. Five second-half goals. Five more questions to ponder. A proud man, Wenger will have surveyed the thousands of empty seats that increased in number at Emirates Stadium with every Bayern strike on the way to a humiliating 10-2 aggregate loss and surely questioned what more he can do at Arsenal. The Gunners were out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage for the seventh successive season. However, few nights could have been more chastening than this one for the man who has known such glory, but who now may be contemplating the end of the road. Wenger 'revolted' by referee performance Football Daily podcast: 'Arsenal a team of spoiled brats' Reaction to Arsenal's 10-2 aggregate humiliation Bayern could face fine over paper roll  protest Once the German champions were prodded into life by a generous penalty award and a red card after Laurent Koscielny fouled Robert Lewandowski, they delivered a ruthless verdict on just how far Arsenal have been marginalised from the elite European group they once occupied with style and with regularity. It underscored a dramatic fall from grace. Wenger was not subjected to widespread rebellion or mutiny inside the stadium, but there were ominous signs that can often be used as indicators that a manager's future has reached its defining moment. A group of Arsenal fans gathered for a 'Wenger Out' protest outside the Emirates stadium prior to kick-off A group of Arsenal fans, not huge in number but noisy, led a protest march on Emirates Stadium from their old Highbury home, brandishing banners that read ""Enough Is Enough"", ""No New Contract"", ""All Good Things Come To An End"" - and what looked like a rather hastily assembled affair that read: ""Stubborn. Stale. Clueless."" They chanted ""Arsene Wenger - You're Killing Our Club"" - harsh and heartbreaking words aimed at a man who, whatever even his fiercest critic will say, loves Arsenal and has done so much to enrich them. It was strictly a minority. But an even more significant indicator may have been the large number of empty seats inside the Emirates. It was announced that 59,911 tickets had been sold - but it was fair to say 59,911 had not pitched up, many clearly deciding they had better things to do despite having shelled out hard-earned cash. Arsenal equipped themselves well for 45 minutes, but the whole night and performance had the stench of too little, too late - and there is no good news, no consolation, no hard luck story about successive 5-1 defeats in the Champions League. The manner in which Arsenal collapsed once Bayern equalised was an alarming barometer of fragile confidence, belief and morale. It was understandable heads would go down as hope was snuffed out, but the manner in which they were picked apart was horrendous. Players were stretched hopelessly out of position and Bayern almost scored at will. Sanchez waved to the Emirates crowd after being substituted in the 73rd minute Alexis Sanchez was even robbed by Arjen Robben, hardly a tackling heavyweight, on the edge of his own area for one goal in an incident that summed up the Chile forward's night after the controversy of his exclusion at Liverpool. Sanchez was a central figureamid stories of training ground unrestbut he was restored here as Arsenal went in search of a miracle. He was greeted warmly by Arsenal's fans when his name was announced, but he was not able to make a point to Wenger or anyone else on this night and his wave as he was substituted late on could even have been construed as the start of a long farewell between now and the end of the season. After taking his seat on the bench, Sanchez was pictured chuckling briefly, something that riled some supporters on social media, despite it being impossible to determine precisely what he had found humorous. The backdrop to this dead rubber - there was never any realistic chance of this Arsenal side in their current condition reviving it even when they took the lead on the night - was a cloud of uncertainty over the club that is becoming increasingly toxic. This video can not be played Wenger angry at 'scandalous' decisions There are no guarantees about the future of arguably the three highest-profile figures at Arsenal, a state of affairs creating a mood of chaos around Emirates Stadium. Wenger is giving no clues as to whether he will sign a two-year deal that is on the table, amid mounting criticism of his methods. Sanchez looks certain to depart in the summer as his relationship with the club fractures. And Mesut Ozil's stock has fallen as his own contract situation is shrouded in mystery. This would be a situation to prey on the nerves and frustrations of Arsenal's fans even before it is set alongside a team that look further away than ever from a Premier League title challenge and now suffering from one of their most humiliating, harrowing Champions League experiences. The double figures aggregate loss actually might have been worse and this latest last-16 exit is made even more painful by being cloaked in the feeling of an end of an era after a Champions League story that has increasingly become one of diminishing returns for Wenger and Arsenal. They were made to look light years away from Europe's elite by Bayern. Wenger may have cursed the luck of the draw once more - and even the officials - but there was no escaping a seventh straight exit at the last-16 stage. No escaping the facts The Gunners are the first side to lose five consecutive home knockout ties in Champions League history. Arsene Wenger's side suffered the joint second heaviest aggregate defeat in Champions League history (2-10), and the highest for an English team. This is the first time Arsenal have conceded five goals at home since November 1998 (against Chelsea in League Cup - a 5-0 loss). As Arsenal fans gathered on Holloway Road and around Emirates Stadium before kick-off the pervading emotion was gloom. There was no sense this Arsenal could frighten Bayern in the same way they frightened AC Milan here almost five years ago to the day, when they had the Italian giants rocking at 3-0 down after losing the first leg 4-0. And so it proved. Not this time. Wenger's Arsenal, in this Champions League context at least, now find even a gallant near-miss beyond them. If there is the growing sense that this is Wenger's final fling, there was also an ominous feeling of an extra layer of fear to add to the frustration of Arsenal's supporters. Is this finally the time they end up without Champions League football for the first time this century? Wenger's sense of pride would be damaged enough by an elimination as wounding as this, an exit that left no room for debate about Arsenal's reduced status. It might hurt even more if he had to start life outside the European footballing environment that has become his and Arsenal's natural home. The Gunners have always managed to find a place in the Premier League's top four but this now faces its most serious threat, with Chelsea the champions-elect and Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool (and arguably even Manchester United) all looking in better shape. Wenger, who wrote about ""our pride and our honour"" being at stake in his match notes, might have to swallow his own pride should Arsenal end up with only a Europa League place at the end of this season. There was no pride or honour to take away from this night. Would Wenger, at 67, have the desire to effectively start again and rebuild in Europe's second-tier tournament, or would that be a timely cue for him to step aside for a successor? Is Arsene Wenger finally ready to make up his mind? There is still time for Wenger to salvage a measure of success and respectability from Arsenal's season and either stay or go on a high of sorts. Arsenal will be overwhelming favourites to reach the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley with a last-eight tie against non-league Lincoln City awaiting them this weekend, while there is still the top-four place on offer. The FA Cup has been the only silverware sustaining Wenger and Arsenal in the barren years since the title triumph of ""The Invincibles"" in 2003-04. If - and it is still a big ""if"" - he wins it, it will allow Wenger, Arsenal and their supporters a celebration. But even that may not prove to be enough to soothe the atmosphere of unease in this part of north London. Arsenal's last-16 hoodoo Season Opponent Aggregate score 2010-11 Barcelona 3-4 2011-12 Milan 3-4 2012-13 Bayern Munich 3-3 (Bayern win on away goals) 2013-14 Bayern Munich 1-3 2014-15 Monaco 3-3 (Monaco win on away goals) 2015-16 Barcelona 1-5 2016-17 Bayern Munich 2-10 Chastening nights like these, when the cavernous gap between Arsenal and those they wish to challenge was cruelly exposed, may carry more weight when it comes to Wenger's verdict on his own future and that of the supporters on him. Wenger was spared at the final whistle, with only a few jeers to be heard because so many had left. It looked and felt like a lonely existence for Arsenal's manager. He simply shook his head, a mixture of disappointment at the result and what he later said he felt was an injustice at the hands of officials - which carried a note of desperation and straw-clutching when examined through the prism of both legs. ""Every Good Story Has An Ending"" read one large banner being paraded outside the stadium before kick-off. And as Wenger headed down the tunnel and Arsenal's fans headed out into the night, it was hard to escape the growing belief that this one is moving towards its final chapter.

French election explained in five charts,"French voters are choosing a new president - amid considerable political uncertainty in Europe and the world following the British vote for Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as US leader. There arefive leading candidates- from across the political spectrum - who will contest the first round of voting on 23 April and unless one candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, the two leading contenders will then go through to a second round on 7 May. So who are the candidates and what are the issues likely to decide this election? France's presidential election On the far right, the National Front's Marine Le Pen appears to have achieved more electoral success sincedistancing herself from some of her father'smore extreme xenophobic policies. Latest opinion polls show Ms Le Pen is ahead of the other four candidates in the first round - though a long way short of 50% - and is therefore likely to get through to the run-off. In 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen got through to the second round, but lost to Jacques Chirac. Opinion polls currently suggest Marine Le Pen would be defeated in the second round byEmmanuel Macron. Without the backing of a traditional political party, the former economy minister, who has never held an elected office, is standing as a centrist candidate. The previous front-runner, centre-right RepublicanFrancois Fillon, has lost support over allegations his wife and children were paid public money for jobs they never had. Prosecutors have launched a full judicial inquiry into the affair but he has survived an attempt within his party to replace him as candidate. Socialist and former education ministerBenoit Hamon, with a reputation as a left-wing rebel, has a plan to introduce a universal income which would be rolled out initially to those on a modest income, being expanded to all French citizens some time after 2022. Far-left candidateJean-Luc Melenchonhas the backing of the French Communist Party and stood unsuccessfully for the presidency in 2012. French election 2017: Who are the candidates? What makes Marine Le Pen far right? Fillon payment inquiry: What you need to know One of the overriding issues facing French voters is unemployment - with at least one in four people aged under 25 unemployed. The national rate stood at 10% in thelast quarter of 2016,externaland according to the French official statistics office, Insee, it fell over the year by just 0.2%. Latest unemployment figures for the European Union show France had the8th highest jobless rate,externalout of the 28 member states in December - and more than double that of Germany and the UK. Last year's slight fall in the jobless rate came too late for President Francois Hollande, who had staked his reputation on creating more jobs during his time in office. Faced with very low ratings in the polls, hepulled out of the election race- the first French president not to run for a second term in modern history. The problem of reducing unemployment will now fall to his successor. Do French workers really have it easy? The French economy is the second-biggest in the eurozone - but its recovery from the financial crisis of 2008 has been slow. One of Mr Hollande's key policies was a new labour law, intended to help boost the economy by giving firms greater freedom to increase regular working hours, reduce pay and lay off workers. But measures were watered down to get the bill through and the hoped-for improvements in the economy have not yet materialised. France's economy, measured in terms of its Gross Domestic Product, has continuedto lag behindits closest European neighbours, Germany and Britain. All the leading candidates have argued that deep changes are needed in the French economy. Security and immigration are also high on the agenda in this election. France is still in a state of emergency following a number of terror attacks, including 14 July last year when 86 people died as alorry ploughed into a crowdin Nice celebrating Bastille Day. More than 230 people have died in terror attacks in France since January 2015. Hundreds of young French Muslims are known to havetravelled to Iraq and Syria,externalto fight for so-called Islamic State. Interior ministry figures say almost 700 French citizens are still in the region - although numbers havedropped off,externalin the past year. Some of theperpetrators of the Paris attacksin November 2015 are known to have travelled to Syria - French officials fear others who have been radicalised may now return to France to commit further atrocities. How France is wrestling with jihadist terror Tens of thousands of migrants have arrived in France as a result of the crisis which began in 2015, largely as a result of people fleeing the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. France received more than85,000 applications for asylum,externalin 2016 - more than 5,800 came from Syria. Although the figure has been rising steadily, the number of asylum-seekers applying to stay in France is lower than other European countries like Germany. Official figures from 2014 show8.9% of the 65.8m French population,externalwere immigrants. The figure has risen by 0.8% since 2006. There is no official breakdown of the figures, as it is illegal in France to collect data on race and religion, but there are thought to be about five million Muslims living in France, thebiggest Muslim population,externalin the EU. The majority of France's Muslim population live in the poorer suburbs of big cities like Paris, Marseille and Lyon, whereunemployment,externalis much higher than the national average. The National Front has made treatment of immigrants one of its key policy issues - saying jobs, welfare, housing and school places should go to French nationals before ""foreigners"".

How India's 'Real Marigold Hotel' changed my life,"Sheila Ferguson made her name singing in The Three Degrees in the 60s and 70s. She's one of eight famous people who went to Kerala to film the TV programme The Real Marigold Hotel, which is designed to make people think about growing old in India. She says the experience completely changed her life. I went to India as a sceptic. I'd never been there before. I did some research, saw that they've got arranged marriages, they've got snakes, they've got mosquitoes and I thought, ""What the hell do I want to go to India for?"" But I believe in the philosophy that you should try everything once, to see if you like it. So I found myself in Kerala riding sleeper trains - which I will never do again as long as I live - and living in a communal home with seven other OAPs. I got more than I bargained for. The first thing that struck me was how busy it was. The city was crowded and smelly but there wasn't as much poverty as I expected from watching the film Gandhi! It turns out that there's a good quality of life in Kerala. When we first got there I was behaving like the problem child, I was a real handful. I even asked Bill to swap rooms and he was gentleman enough to agree. The Three Degrees in 1974 - Sheila Ferguson with Valerie Holiday and Fayette Pinkney But that didn't last too long. I met some fascinating people and got some valuable perspective on my life back home. India entirely changed my attitude towards my life. Until I went to India I never realised that I was lonely. I thought I was just fine. But living with seven other people communally in India held a magnifying glass to how solitary my life actually is. In some respects, I've not had human contact for years. It's really the emotional and mental stimulation of talking to other people that I'm missing. Sheila and Jon I live on my own, one daughter's in Dubai, one's in England and I'm in Majorca. My partner Jon died in 2010 and it's time I got the hell out of here! My social life really dips in the winter because everybody hibernates. My cleaner comes to my house on Thursdays but other than that, I could go all week without seeing another soul. I could fall down on the steps in my house, or in the swimming pool and nobody would know for a week. I think my family are concerned about me living alone, but I never thought of it until now. Now I understand their worry. Residents of The Real Marigold Hotel: Amanda Barrie, Paul Nicholas, Bill Oddie, Lionel Blair, Dr Miriam Stoppard, Dennis Taylor, Rustie Lee and Sheila Ferguson In The Real Marigold Hotel, eight celebrities visit India to see how retiring there would differ from growing old in the UK. You can watch the programme on BBC One at 21:00 on Wednesday 8 March orcatch up later online. In India, at the dinner table the seven of us would be talking, Bill Oddie telling us about his grandchildren, Paul Nicholas showing pictures of his daughters and his wife. I would be thinking, ""They all have families to go back to and I'm going back to an empty house."" That's when it really sank in. If I'm not careful I will end up sitting alone, at the head of my 14-seater dining table in a wedding dress, like Miss Havisham. When my daughter, Alex, came out to visit me in India from her home in Dubai I realised just how much I missed my family. I want to see them more and now, thanks to my time in India, I am ready to find a new love. I hadn't been on a date since Jon died so I was shocked to be asked out by a gentleman at a drinks party in Kerala. Usually I'm the one asking a guy out, so when he just came out with it at first I thought it was a joke, I thought that the crew had put him up to it! He was very upfront, no nonsense. It's been so long since anyone has said things like that to me, it was really lovely. This video can not be played Watch Sheila's date Since then I have been on another date in England. I think once you open up inside, your aura looks different to other people, so it may be that I was blocking myself off before. I have been threatening to move back to England for the past four years. Soon after Jon died, I realised I didn't suit living alone but I didn't do anything about it. I kept putting it off, procrastinating. Probably because I wanted to stay here in Majorca in memory of the life I had built with him. I threw myself into work. But this year, because of my trip to India, I am putting my house on the market so that I can move back to England in the spring. My two daughters grew up in Berkshire and I love it there. I'm really looking forward to being near my friends and family again. Sheila's home in Majorca In India, families are a close-knit unit, they do not disown their elders as we do in Western culture. They take responsibility and take care of one another. India has also helped me to become more understanding and patient with my mother, who turns 95 this year. It calmed me down too. I've always been hyperactive and my work requires constant energy and enthusiasm - live now, sleep later. Being in a more spiritual place, where I had to give up control to others, helped my mind to open and to realise that the small things don't matter so much. I found that when I was rehearsing a panto in Ipswich everything was going awry, everything was late, it was a tech rehearsal, we opened the next day and everything was a mess. I just sat there and looked and said, ""Well OK they'll get it together. I know my lines."" And I just calmly went back to my dressing room.  Any time before India I would have thrown a fit and I'm known for it. The Marigold Hotel changed me and I've carried that lesson into my everyday life.

Branwen Jeffreys: Why education is May's vehicle for hope,"The Lib Dems want to stop primary school tests narrowing learning Is there such a thing as a ""curriculum for life"" ? That's what the Lib Dems want to offer for children in England. If you have a child at school you'll know how much what they learn is already changing. The end of primary school tests known as Sats have been made tougher, with more complex grammar and maths among the changes. And if your household is going through the agony of GCSE revision, you'll know this is the first year of the new English and maths exams which are also designed to be more challenging. There has been so much change that schools have been complaining they can barely keep up. The unglamorous, but important issue of what children learn at school rarely features in election campaigns. Yet subjects matter because it influences the choices your child can make about their future job, or what they want to study at college and university. So it's striking that the Lib Dems have chosen to make the subjects taught in schools, the curriculum, a large part of their education election offer. Their manifesto says this would mean a shorter list of core subjects all state funded schools would have to teach. But they also want learning about money, and mental health to be included alongside age appropriate sex and relationship lessons. It is only weeks since a change in the law to make sex and relationship education compulsory for all secondary schools in England, with primary schools teaching just about relationships. There is a promise too to protect creative subjects like music, art and drama amid concerns that tightening budgets and a focus on results are squeezing them out. Quite how they would be protected isn't clear, although the party is likely to argue that promising extra money will help. So should politicians be deciding what your kids learn at school? An interesting question as some recent Education Secretaries have had very definite views. The Lib Dems are making a bid to take the politics of changing governments out of these decisions. They want to set up what looks like a new quango - an Educational Standards Authority - which would bring in changes after consulting teachers. But in the end, when there are issues in schools, just like in hospitals, the buck stops with politicians. Voters tend to have little time for a senior politician trying to outsource the blame for any decisions. So, as the Lib Dem manifesto delicately puts it - there would have to be some way of retaining ""legitimate democratic accountability"".

Will the Budget help ailing grandparents?,"The chancellor has announced a Â£2bn rescue package for the social care sector in England. Philip Hammond says the extra money - to be phased in over three years - will help support a system that is ""clearly under pressure"". It comes after months of warnings that services provided by councils for the elderly are under threat because of a lack of funding. The numbers getting help in care homes and in their own homes for daily tasks such as washing and dressing have been falling in recent years. This trend has been blamed for contributing to the growing pressures being seen in the NHS, particularly the rise in visits to A&E. Social care chiefs have said they will need to spend nearly Â£20bn on services this year. But even when you take into account the extra money being raised from council tax increases and NHS money that is being transferred across, (both previous policy announcements to help out the sector) councils are still nearly Â£1bn short of what they need. By 2020 that funding gap is predicted to grow to Â£2.6bn. The money announced in the Budget will go some way to plugging that gap, but clearly not all the way. It is expected to be phased in - with Â£1bn coming next year and the remaining Â£1bn spread out over the subsequent two. This will go into a pot shared across both services for the elderly, and those provided to younger adults with disabilities. Charities have called it a ""sticking plaster"" to the wider problems facing the sector. Although, to be fair to the chancellor, he said the extra money would be followed by a green paper later in the year to overhaul the entire system, which has remained largely unchanged since it was created along with the NHS, after the Second World War. About 500,000 people in England pay the full cost of their care in England. This can prove very expensive. One in 10 people face costs of over Â£100,000 once they pass the age of 65. And there is growing evidence these self-funders are helping to prop up the council-funded side of the market. Analysts LaingBuisson have calculated that the fees councils pay care home firms are Â£100 a week below the actual cost of providing the care. Its researchers say this shortfall has effectively created a ""hidden care tax"" with self-funders now paying more than 25% extra for the same care. To limit these costs the coalition government announced in 2013 it would be introducing a cap on the cost of care so no-one paid more than Â£72,000 over their lifetime. This was meant to be introduced in 2016, but that was delayed until 2020. The green paper that was announced in the Budget will set out how - indeed if - that policy will be incorporated into any future changes. But the extra money will do nothing to help these people. How the care system works across the UK The alternative options 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care More than 4m people over the age of 65 have care needs, but only about 1.35m of them get formal care - either by paying for it themselves or relying on council help. What happens to the rest? There are 1.5m people who are cared for by family and friends and another 1.2m who struggle by with little or no help. In theory councils could use the extra money to increase the number of people they help. But given there's already a shortfall in funding to maintain the status quo, it seems doubtful this will happen. Again, the promise of longer-term reform remains their best hope. They may also benefit from extra support announced in the Budget for the NHS. There is Â£100m extra to help A&Es ahead of next winter and Â£325m over the next three years to help with NHS reform by getting local plans off the ground to shift care out of hospitals and into community services. Eventually this should help boost services such as GPs and district nursing, which the frail elderly are heavy users of. However, given the health budget is currently nearly Â£120bn a year, the impact of this extra money will be limited.

Gordon Corera: CIA faces huge problem over malware claims,"The CIA has not said if the claims are true Already embroiled in a row with President Donald Trump amid his claims that spies are leaking secrets against him, now the CIA is facing its own damaging leaks. This time it's the American intelligence community's familiar foe - Wikileaks - with another cache ofwhat look like highly sensitive secret documents, this time about the CIA's technical capabilities. The National Security Agency faced its problems when Edward Snowden passed on documents to journalists - but this time it's the NSA's sister agency. While the NSA is the agency charged with collecting what is called signals intelligence and the CIA's job is to recruit human spies, the reality is that the technical and the human side of espionage have been drawing closer for years. The CIA created a Directorate of Digital Innovation whose director told methe priority was making sure the agency stayed on top of technology. While the NSA may sift global internet traffic looking for intelligence, the CIA prioritises close access against specific targets who it is interested in. And getting into someone's electronic devices can be vital if you are trying to target them - either to recruit them as an agent or for a drone strike against a suspected terrorist. This video can not be played Former CIA boss: latest leak on Wikileaks has 'made my country less safe' These latest leaks will be a huge problem for the CIA as the Snowden leaks were for the NSA (although there will be less surprise about these capabilities now since we learned so much from the Snowden files). There is the embarrassment factor - that an agency whose job is to steal other people's secrets has not been able to keep their own. This will be added to by the revelations that the US consulate in Frankfurt was used as a base for the technical operations which may cause problems in Germany where the Edward Snowden revelations caused intense domestic debate. Then there will be the fear of a loss of intelligence coverage by the CIA against their targets who may change their behaviour because they now know the spies can do. The CIA is alleged to have found a way to listen to conversations that took place close to Samsung TVs And then there will be the questions over whether the CIA's technical capabilities were too expansive and too secret. Because many of the initial documents point to capabilities targeting consumer devices, the hardest questions may revolve around what is known as the ""equities"" problem - when you find a vulnerability in a piece of technology, how do you balance the benefit of leaving that vulnerability in place so the intelligence agency can exploit it to collect intelligence with the benefit to the public of informing the manufacturer so they can close it and improve everyone's security? If an intelligence agency has found a vulnerability then other hackers might do as well. The NSA faced questions about whether it had found the right balance and now it may be the CIA's turn. There will be anger in the CIA and some of that will be directed at Wikileaks. Wikileaks has said the source of this latest cache of documents came from a former US government hacker or contractor. But it is an organisation that the US intelligence community has claimed may have been a route for information hacked from the Democrats by the Russians during last year's election to make it into the public domain. No doubt the CIA will be trying to establish the exact source of the latest leak and understand the timing - coming right in the middle of an intensifying row between American spies and their own president.

A bumpy 24 hours for Trump health bill,"Republicans in the House of Representatives unveiled their long-awaited draft healthcare bill on Monday night, amid hopes this was the first step on a road to keeping a key election promise. Replacing the Affordable Care Act became a rallying cry among conservatives for years and here was the first attempt by the party to fashion an alternative. But just 24 hours later and the mood in the party has changed, with the knives out for the American Health Care Act before it has even reached committee. It is still a ""work in progress"", say Republicans who are behind the bill, but what happened within a few hours on Tuesday means that work may be harder than anyone imagined. So what happened and when? All times eastern (-5 GMT) Monday evening -last rites for Obamacare? 18:05- Republican Party release their bill What's in the Republican bill? 19:50- House Speaker Paul Ryan says ""this unified Republican government will deliver relief and peace of mind to the millions of Americans suffering under Obamacare"". Health Secretary Tom Price says he ""welcomes action by the House to end this nightmare for the American people"". Paul Ryan's hopes for unity look dashed 19:50- It emerges that four Republican senators had released a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell before the bill was unveiled, expressing concerns that it would limit future federal funding for Medicaid, which covers people on low incomes. 01:13(Tuesday) - An influential group of US House Republicans said they had ""major concerns"" and called it ""Republican welfare entitlement"", according toa memo leaked to Bloomberg,external 10:26(Tuesday) - Heritage Action for America: ""That is bad politics and, more importantly, bad policy."" 07:13- An early morning tweet from the president shows he is fully endorsing the House bill, which he says is ""wonderful"". 13:55- Health Secretary Tom Price says the legislation is a ""work in progress"" that represents a step in the ""right direction"". 15:53- President Trump told Republican lawmakers at the White House: ""There's gonna be no slowing down. There's gonna be no waiting and no more excuses."" 16:42- House Speaker Paul Ryan says: ""Obamacare is collapsing... We are doing an act of mercy by repealing this law."" Is Obamacare more popular than ever? Republicans turn on their own health bill This video can not be played What's in the Republican healthcare bill? 14:36- Conservative website Breitbartpublishes a story headlined,external""Obamacare 2.0 guts enforcement, gives illegal aliens health care through identity fraud"" 15:08- Influential conservative writer Ann Coulter calls it a ""piece of crap"" 15:36- Senator Rand Paul says: ""We have to admit we are divided on replacement. We are united on repeal but we are divided on replacement."" Earlier, he said the bill was ""dead on arrival"". 15:37- Mike Lee, US Senator from Utah, says the bill was ""a step in the wrong direction. And as much as anything, it's a missed opportunity."" 17:40- President Trump warns House Republicans of ""bloodbath"" if they can't pass healthcare legislation, says CNN 19:14- He then cajoles Senator Rand Paul to end the dissent and rally behind the ""great"" health care bill. It seems like passing the recently unveiled Republican Obamacare replacement bill will be about as difficult as making a half-court basketball shot. From a moving car. While blindfolded. While Republicans know they have to do something on healthcare reform given seven years of promises, when the subject moves to what to do after repeal, party cohesion falls apart. Moderates hate the bill because of its coverage cuts. Conservatives hate the bill because it preserves parts of the existing system. The only real support the bill has is of the tepid variety. Donald Trump tweeted that the legislation is now open for ""review and negotiation"", but the various factions within the Republican congressional caucus will be pulling in opposite directions - and the end results could be a proposal that is left in tatters.

'Ominous signs Wenger is in last chapter',"This was Arsene Wenger's 201st game in charge of Arsenal in the Champions League Arsene Wenger stood in isolation and desolation in his technical area as the pain he suffers this time every year nagged away at him once more - but now it was accompanied by an inescapable feeling of finality. As his Arsenal side dissolved and werebrutally dispatched by Bayern Munich- once they awoke from 45 minutes of complacency - Wenger will have felt every goal, every added humiliation, like a blow to the solar plexus. Five second-half goals. Five more questions to ponder. A proud man, Wenger will have surveyed the thousands of empty seats that increased in number at Emirates Stadium with every Bayern strike on the way to a humiliating 10-2 aggregate loss and surely questioned what more he can do at Arsenal. The Gunners were out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage for the seventh successive season. However, few nights could have been more chastening than this one for the man who has known such glory, but who now may be contemplating the end of the road. Wenger 'revolted' by referee performance Football Daily podcast: 'Arsenal a team of spoiled brats' Reaction to Arsenal's 10-2 aggregate humiliation Bayern could face fine over paper roll  protest Once the German champions were prodded into life by a generous penalty award and a red card after Laurent Koscielny fouled Robert Lewandowski, they delivered a ruthless verdict on just how far Arsenal have been marginalised from the elite European group they once occupied with style and with regularity. It underscored a dramatic fall from grace. Wenger was not subjected to widespread rebellion or mutiny inside the stadium, but there were ominous signs that can often be used as indicators that a manager's future has reached its defining moment. A group of Arsenal fans gathered for a 'Wenger Out' protest outside the Emirates stadium prior to kick-off A group of Arsenal fans, not huge in number but noisy, led a protest march on Emirates Stadium from their old Highbury home, brandishing banners that read ""Enough Is Enough"", ""No New Contract"", ""All Good Things Come To An End"" - and what looked like a rather hastily assembled affair that read: ""Stubborn. Stale. Clueless."" They chanted ""Arsene Wenger - You're Killing Our Club"" - harsh and heartbreaking words aimed at a man who, whatever even his fiercest critic will say, loves Arsenal and has done so much to enrich them. It was strictly a minority. But an even more significant indicator may have been the large number of empty seats inside the Emirates. It was announced that 59,911 tickets had been sold - but it was fair to say 59,911 had not pitched up, many clearly deciding they had better things to do despite having shelled out hard-earned cash. Arsenal equipped themselves well for 45 minutes, but the whole night and performance had the stench of too little, too late - and there is no good news, no consolation, no hard luck story about successive 5-1 defeats in the Champions League. The manner in which Arsenal collapsed once Bayern equalised was an alarming barometer of fragile confidence, belief and morale. It was understandable heads would go down as hope was snuffed out, but the manner in which they were picked apart was horrendous. Players were stretched hopelessly out of position and Bayern almost scored at will. Sanchez waved to the Emirates crowd after being substituted in the 73rd minute Alexis Sanchez was even robbed by Arjen Robben, hardly a tackling heavyweight, on the edge of his own area for one goal in an incident that summed up the Chile forward's night after the controversy of his exclusion at Liverpool. Sanchez was a central figureamid stories of training ground unrestbut he was restored here as Arsenal went in search of a miracle. He was greeted warmly by Arsenal's fans when his name was announced, but he was not able to make a point to Wenger or anyone else on this night and his wave as he was substituted late on could even have been construed as the start of a long farewell between now and the end of the season. After taking his seat on the bench, Sanchez was pictured chuckling briefly, something that riled some supporters on social media, despite it being impossible to determine precisely what he had found humorous. The backdrop to this dead rubber - there was never any realistic chance of this Arsenal side in their current condition reviving it even when they took the lead on the night - was a cloud of uncertainty over the club that is becoming increasingly toxic. This video can not be played Wenger angry at 'scandalous' decisions There are no guarantees about the future of arguably the three highest-profile figures at Arsenal, a state of affairs creating a mood of chaos around Emirates Stadium. Wenger is giving no clues as to whether he will sign a two-year deal that is on the table, amid mounting criticism of his methods. Sanchez looks certain to depart in the summer as his relationship with the club fractures. And Mesut Ozil's stock has fallen as his own contract situation is shrouded in mystery. This would be a situation to prey on the nerves and frustrations of Arsenal's fans even before it is set alongside a team that look further away than ever from a Premier League title challenge and now suffering from one of their most humiliating, harrowing Champions League experiences. The double figures aggregate loss actually might have been worse and this latest last-16 exit is made even more painful by being cloaked in the feeling of an end of an era after a Champions League story that has increasingly become one of diminishing returns for Wenger and Arsenal. They were made to look light years away from Europe's elite by Bayern. Wenger may have cursed the luck of the draw once more - and even the officials - but there was no escaping a seventh straight exit at the last-16 stage. No escaping the facts The Gunners are the first side to lose five consecutive home knockout ties in Champions League history. Arsene Wenger's side suffered the joint second heaviest aggregate defeat in Champions League history (2-10), and the highest for an English team. This is the first time Arsenal have conceded five goals at home since November 1998 (against Chelsea in League Cup - a 5-0 loss). As Arsenal fans gathered on Holloway Road and around Emirates Stadium before kick-off the pervading emotion was gloom. There was no sense this Arsenal could frighten Bayern in the same way they frightened AC Milan here almost five years ago to the day, when they had the Italian giants rocking at 3-0 down after losing the first leg 4-0. And so it proved. Not this time. Wenger's Arsenal, in this Champions League context at least, now find even a gallant near-miss beyond them. If there is the growing sense that this is Wenger's final fling, there was also an ominous feeling of an extra layer of fear to add to the frustration of Arsenal's supporters. Is this finally the time they end up without Champions League football for the first time this century? Wenger's sense of pride would be damaged enough by an elimination as wounding as this, an exit that left no room for debate about Arsenal's reduced status. It might hurt even more if he had to start life outside the European footballing environment that has become his and Arsenal's natural home. The Gunners have always managed to find a place in the Premier League's top four but this now faces its most serious threat, with Chelsea the champions-elect and Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool (and arguably even Manchester United) all looking in better shape. Wenger, who wrote about ""our pride and our honour"" being at stake in his match notes, might have to swallow his own pride should Arsenal end up with only a Europa League place at the end of this season. There was no pride or honour to take away from this night. Would Wenger, at 67, have the desire to effectively start again and rebuild in Europe's second-tier tournament, or would that be a timely cue for him to step aside for a successor? Is Arsene Wenger finally ready to make up his mind? There is still time for Wenger to salvage a measure of success and respectability from Arsenal's season and either stay or go on a high of sorts. Arsenal will be overwhelming favourites to reach the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley with a last-eight tie against non-league Lincoln City awaiting them this weekend, while there is still the top-four place on offer. The FA Cup has been the only silverware sustaining Wenger and Arsenal in the barren years since the title triumph of ""The Invincibles"" in 2003-04. If - and it is still a big ""if"" - he wins it, it will allow Wenger, Arsenal and their supporters a celebration. But even that may not prove to be enough to soothe the atmosphere of unease in this part of north London. Arsenal's last-16 hoodoo Season Opponent Aggregate score 2010-11 Barcelona 3-4 2011-12 Milan 3-4 2012-13 Bayern Munich 3-3 (Bayern win on away goals) 2013-14 Bayern Munich 1-3 2014-15 Monaco 3-3 (Monaco win on away goals) 2015-16 Barcelona 1-5 2016-17 Bayern Munich 2-10 Chastening nights like these, when the cavernous gap between Arsenal and those they wish to challenge was cruelly exposed, may carry more weight when it comes to Wenger's verdict on his own future and that of the supporters on him. Wenger was spared at the final whistle, with only a few jeers to be heard because so many had left. It looked and felt like a lonely existence for Arsenal's manager. He simply shook his head, a mixture of disappointment at the result and what he later said he felt was an injustice at the hands of officials - which carried a note of desperation and straw-clutching when examined through the prism of both legs. ""Every Good Story Has An Ending"" read one large banner being paraded outside the stadium before kick-off. And as Wenger headed down the tunnel and Arsenal's fans headed out into the night, it was hard to escape the growing belief that this one is moving towards its final chapter.

Two women caught in the social care funding divide,"Ruth Angove (left) and Jane Patterson's mother (right) ""An Alice in Wonderland situation"" is how one woman has described her elderly mother's social care provision where she is given more money each month than she can spend. Another says her mother has not received a penny toward her support. Both women told the BBC that they think the chasm between their circumstances highlights the problems within the social care system which they hope will be addressed in the Budget. Judy Perkins, who lives in Richmond, Surrey, says her mother has accrued more than Â£10,000 in three years in money she has been given towards her care, but cannot spend. Her mother, Ruth Angove, 82, is disabled and has no income other than the state pension with an enhanced pension credit and attendance allowance. She lives alone in the home she owns, is bed-bound and has dementia. The local council provides her with five and a half hours of home care every day but assesses her contribution to the cost as only Â£170 a month which is about 6% of actual cost. It says that due to government regulations this is the maximum they can take and it then has to pay the rest itself. Ruth Angove (right) with her daughter Judy Perkins (centre) and her son-in-law Richard Perkins ""I'm very embarrassed about it,"" said Mrs Perkins. ""It's a real Alice in Wonderland situation."" ""While I may be glad my mother is financially more stable, as a taxpayer I find it ridiculous. I feel over-taxed all the time and then see money being thrown away."" Mrs Perkins said she understood that some people may need their attendance allowance for expenses like transport but said her mother could only use a limited amount. ""The consequence is that she has built up a surplus of more than Â£10,000,"" she explained. Following the Budget on Wednesday 8 March, she said giving local councils Â£2bn extra in the Budget for social care provision still did not address the need to change the regulations so that they could be more careful about how it is spend and ultimately make the system work for those who pay for the services as well as those who use them. Ruth is one of a dwindling group of people - those people whose needs are so great that they qualify for help from councils. The numbers getting support from local authorities have fallen by a quarter in five years as town hall budgets have been squeezed. But to get help you also need to be judged to have not enough money to pay for the cost of care yourself. If she had more savings she would be expected to contribute more and if she had over Â£23,250 she would have to pay the full cost of her care. Presumably as she accrues more money, the council will start increasing her contribution. There are about 850,000 older people in England that are in a similar position to Ruth - in that they get help from their local council. However, there are four times as many paying for care themselves, relying on family and friends or simply going without. 10 graphs that illustrate the social care problem How the care system works across the UK The alternative options You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating. average amount of care provided per week, by your council average paid per hour by your council, 2014-15 average paid per hour in your region if you pay for your own care, 2016 You live in a care home that provides round-the-clock support with everyday tasks.      TBCpay for their own care  You live in a care home which provides round-the-clock support for everyday tasks and nursing care. Depending on your medical needs, the NHS may contribute to your costs.      TBCpay for their own care    Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there.  Jane Patterson says her parents were hard-working honest people In Tyne and Wear, Jane Patterson said she has had to sell everything her mother owned to pay for her care needs. ""I have been forced to sell her house and get rid of her personal belongings as if she was dead,"" she said. Miss Patterson's mother is blind and had to move into a care home in 2014, two years after being diagnosed with dementia. She owned her home, had some savings and as well as her own pension had a small company pension from her late husband. As her mother's assets were worth in excess of Â£23,250, Miss Patterson said she had to sell her mother's house to meet the Â£3,500 per month care home fees. Miss Patterson said her mother is well-cared for by the staff at the home but has to pay for everything, from her own bedding to her toiletries, while government-funded residents are provided with everything they need. One care organisation, she said, had told her it relied on self-funding residents to support those under social services care. ""It is not just about money, it's about the moral and decent side of respecting hard-working honest people and not taking advantage,"" she said. ""If assistance, support and care cannot be free and equal across the board, it does not have to be so criminally expensive. ""It should be free all over United Kingdom not just free in Scotland,"" she added. Jane Patterson's mother went blind and was also diagnosed with dementia Miss Patterson said the additional money announced in the Budget would still not help those who pay for their own care. ""I do agree some contribution should be made by the individual if their circumstances allow. So a fair and consistent cap would be more palatable. All my parents did was work and save hard and a fair system would be all they ask,"" she said. ""We're all going to face the need for care when we're older and as a working woman I am happy to pay towards that from my salary, but there is absolutely no incentive to do the right thing in this country. ""This is just putting a sticking plaster on a broken system."" The so-called crisis in social care is not just about a squeeze on council budgets, it's also about the impact on individuals such as Jane's mother. Three quarters of people face paying for care once they pass the age of 65. For one in 10 the costs can exceed Â£100,000. But these costs are not just accrued because these people do not qualify for council help. There is increasing evidence to suggest those who pay for themselves are actually subsidising the council-funded care market. Self-funders routinely pay more for their care than the fees councils pay. Analysts Laing Buisson believe this is effectively a ""hidden care tax"".

Concern over fall of women in top jobs,"England Netball's non-executive directors are 90% women The number of women getting top jobs at UK sporting bodies is down by 6% since 2014, says a new study which calls the findings ""extremely concerning"". The Women in Sport survey found around half of the 68 Sport England and UK Sport-funded national governing bodies have fewer than 30% of non-executive director roles filled by women. Under government guidelines coming into effect on 1 April, those organisations must haveat least 30%women on their board, or risk losing funding. Nine of the 68 organisations have no women in senior leadership roles below chief executive level. The British Taekwondo Council, the sport's national governing body, has no woman in any leadership or board positions. Overall the number of women on the boards of governing bodies is 30% on average. Top female coach in men's football 'long way off' - Rachel Yankey column Lack of women at top of LTA 'wrong' - Judy Murray Quiz: The Simpsons & Twitter dates - International Women's Day quiz Of the 68 governing bodies, just under half (33) have less than 30% female non-executive directors For 2016 these included British Cycling, Rugby Football League, England and Wales Cricket Board, Rugby Football Union and the Football Association There has been a decrease in the number of women in senior leadership roles - the most senior paid roles, excluding the chief executive officer Nine of the 68 organisations had no female senior leaders below chief executive level 18% of chairs are female and 23% of chief executive officers are women At England Netball, 80% of senior leaders are female The report concluded: ""Women in Sport is also extremely concerned by the decrease in the number of women in senior leadership roles. While organisations should continue to tackle the diversity of their boards, they also need to broaden their focus, addressing diversity within their organisations more generally."" Speaking to BBC Sport, Ruth Holdaway, Women in Sport chief executive said: ""There is positivity in the fact that in the seven years we have been doing this audit, we have seen an increase in the number of women at every level of leadership in sport. ""But now we are seeing the figures plateau and for non-executive directors on boards, the figure has sat at around 30% for the last couple of years. ""That is an average across all of the governing bodies, that masks a disparity, some do better than that and some do worse than that. Half of the national bodies are hitting the 30% target, the other half have work to do."" The figures in the study are for 2016 and just 7% of the Football Association's non-executive directors are women - the third lowest in the study. However, the FA has since proposed reforms to appoint more women to its board. British Cycling, which in the study has 17% of females as non-executive directors, appointed Julie Harrington as its new chief executive on Monday. Holdaway said gender diversity is being held back by life president and honorary roles for men. ""The time is coming for those who are blocking progress to move, "" she said. Director of sport at funding body Sport England, Phil Smith, said organisations have to draw up an action plan of how they will reach the 30% target by 1 April, or face losing their funding. ""They have enough time to write an action plan, "" Smith told the BBC. ""Public investment in any sports organisations is dependent on organisations reach the standards of the code, anyone who is not able to reach them or have adequate plans to do so, won't be able to attract public investment."" England Hockey currently fail to meet the target, as three of their 12 members (25%) are women. But chief executive Sally Munday said she was confident they would be able to eventually meet the guidelines. ""We will look at how we can evolve to meet the guidelines,"" Munday told BBC Sport. ""We will not get to 1 April and ask a board member to leave. We have an outstanding board, it just so happens than more are men than women. Over time, as board members leave, we will look at recruiting people who still meet the skill set, but will enable us to meet the recommendations in the guidelines."" Katie Gornall, BBC Sport The new code of governance will come into effect on 1 April and then each sport will be given their own individual deadline to meet the requirements. Some governing bodies will find it easier to diversify than others. The FA's recent proposal to reserve three places for women on its board from 2018 still has to be approved by its 122 person council - an overwhelming male body historically resistant to reform. Those that don't meet the criteria risk losing millions of pounds of public investment. The Government is also prepared to withdraw essential support for bids to host major events. The consequences for failing to modernise are now more serious than ever.

Arsenal 1-5 Bayern Munich,"Arsenal's 10-2 aggregate defeat was the worst of any English side in Champions League history Ten-man Arsenal were knocked out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage for the seventh successive season following a second-half capitulation against Bayern Munich. A debated decision in the 53rd minute shattered any hopes of the Gunners becoming the first side in Champions League history to overturn a four-goal deficit, having also lost the first leg in Germany 5-1. They led through Theo Walcott's stunning 20th-minute goal, before Bayern were awarded a penalty that also resulted in the sending off of defender Laurent Koscielny. The France centre-back was initially shown a yellow card by referee Anastasios Sidiropoulos for his foul on Robert Lewandowski inside the area - but it was upgraded to a red once he decided Koscielny made no attempt to win the ball. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger looked perplexed by the sudden change of heart by the official. Lewandowski placed his spot-kick beyond the reach of David Ospina to give Bayern a 6-2 aggregate lead and effectively kill off the tie. The home side then folded as Bayern scored four goals in 17 minutes. Arjen Robben robbed Alexis Sanchez of the ball and beat Ospina, before Douglas Costa made it 3-1 with a stunning solo goal. Fellow midfielder Arturo Vidal grabbed a late double, first with an impudent chip before slotting in from Costa's square pass. Phil McNulty: 'Ominous signs Wenger is in final chapter' Wenger 'revolted' by ref in Bayern defeat Football Daily podcast: 'Arsenal a team of spoiled brats' Reaction to Arsenal's 10-2 aggregate humiliation Bayern could face fine over paper roll protest The 10-2 aggregate defeat is the worst suffered by an English side in the Champions League It was Arsenal's biggest home loss since November 1998 (5-0 against Chelsea in the League Cup) Only one Champions League tie has seen a greater margin of victory for a team - Bayern Munich v Sporting Lisbon (12-1, 2009) Arsenal also capitulated when Laurent Koscielny (centre) came off in the first leg with scores 1-1 If this was to be Wenger's final outing in the Champions League with Arsenal then what an embarrassing final act. Few expected the Gunners to perform a miracle, but they did at least expect to take the fight to the German giants. Aside from the goal, Walcott also went close when Manuel Neuer saved his effort and Olivier Giroud hit the base of the post with a header. Walcott was also denied a penalty after it appeared that Xabi Alonso had fouled him. But Bayern rarely looked stretched and bided their time before punishing an error-strewn second-half display by the home side. Arturo Vidal (right) celebrates Arjen Robben's second-half strike on another night when Bayern brushed aside Arsenal Some might debate whether Koscielny deserved a straight red but, under new laws regarding penalties, the referee was right to amend his initial decision to award the defender a yellow. The Gunners' similarly folded when the Frenchman came off injured in the first leg with the scores 1-1. Arsenal's initial target of scoring four goals would have still taken the contest into extra time. Any chance of that happening ended when Robben nipped in to take the ball away from the feet of Sanchez, who was inexplicably trying to play the ball on the edge of his own area. The team lost heart thereafter and allowed Costa to run 50 yards before the Brazilian cut inside and curled in a brilliant 20-yard strike. Vidal's double came late and in quick succession. First an error by Shkodran Mustafi was punished with a cheeky dink, before the Chile midfielder tapped in Costa's pass. The final whistle could not come soon enough for Wenger and his team.

A large gathering of fans made it known outside the ground that they did not want the Frenchman in charge of the club. Wenger has yet to decide whether to accept the contract extension or leave the club he has managed since 1996. This week'ssaga surrounding Sanchez,the protests and finally now this heavy defeat might have brought the 67-year-old closer to making up his mind. 'Shame Again' - The Express 'Wenger Out...' - i 'Wenger hits all-time low' - Times 'Wenger Out' - The Sun 'Laughing Stock' - Mirror Arturo Vidal, Arjen Robben and Robert Lewandowski were brilliant in attack but Vidal gets the nod - he had the most touches of either side - 100 - with a 90% passing accuracy.

CIA faces huge problem over malware claims,"The CIA has not said if the claims are true Already embroiled in a row with President Donald Trump amid his claims that spies are leaking secrets against him, now the CIA is facing its own damaging leaks. This time it's the American intelligence community's familiar foe - Wikileaks - with another cache ofwhat look like highly sensitive secret documents, this time about the CIA's technical capabilities. The National Security Agency faced its problems when Edward Snowden passed on documents to journalists - but this time it's the NSA's sister agency. While the NSA is the agency charged with collecting what is called signals intelligence and the CIA's job is to recruit human spies, the reality is that the technical and the human side of espionage have been drawing closer for years. The CIA created a Directorate of Digital Innovation whose director told methe priority was making sure the agency stayed on top of technology. While the NSA may sift global internet traffic looking for intelligence, the CIA prioritises close access against specific targets who it is interested in. And getting into someone's electronic devices can be vital if you are trying to target them - either to recruit them as an agent or for a drone strike against a suspected terrorist. This video can not be played Former CIA boss: latest leak on Wikileaks has 'made my country less safe' These latest leaks will be a huge problem for the CIA as the Snowden leaks were for the NSA (although there will be less surprise about these capabilities now since we learned so much from the Snowden files). There is the embarrassment factor - that an agency whose job is to steal other people's secrets has not been able to keep their own. This will be added to by the revelations that the US consulate in Frankfurt was used as a base for the technical operations which may cause problems in Germany where the Edward Snowden revelations caused intense domestic debate. Then there will be the fear of a loss of intelligence coverage by the CIA against their targets who may change their behaviour because they now know the spies can do. The CIA is alleged to have found a way to listen to conversations that took place close to Samsung TVs And then there will be the questions over whether the CIA's technical capabilities were too expansive and too secret. Because many of the initial documents point to capabilities targeting consumer devices, the hardest questions may revolve around what is known as the ""equities"" problem - when you find a vulnerability in a piece of technology, how do you balance the benefit of leaving that vulnerability in place so the intelligence agency can exploit it to collect intelligence with the benefit to the public of informing the manufacturer so they can close it and improve everyone's security? If an intelligence agency has found a vulnerability then other hackers might do as well. The NSA faced questions about whether it had found the right balance and now it may be the CIA's turn. There will be anger in the CIA and some of that will be directed at Wikileaks. Wikileaks has said the source of this latest cache of documents came from a former US government hacker or contractor. But it is an organisation that the US intelligence community has claimed may have been a route for information hacked from the Democrats by the Russians during last year's election to make it into the public domain. No doubt the CIA will be trying to establish the exact source of the latest leak and understand the timing - coming right in the middle of an intensifying row between American spies and their own president.

What will happen to UK trade post-Brexit?,"Theresa May has said the UK ""cannot possibly"" remain within the European single market With Theresa May's end of March deadline for triggering the UK's exit from the EU fast approaching, much remains undecided, not least what will happen to British trade. As an EU member, the UK and UK-based firms can sell their goods to EU customers without having to pay additional taxes. Likewise, British firms and consumers can import from the EU tariff-free. The prime minister has already ruled outcontinued membership of the EU's single market post-Brexit, with many assuming this means the UK will also leave the customs union. Essentially there are two options: a newly negotiated trade deal like the EU has with Canada or South Korea, which eliminate most tariffs and many other trade barriers. But the EU's record is one of slow progress in similar talks, and political tensions from the Brexit process could also be an obstacle an arrangement sometimes called World Trade Organization (WTO) terms The WTO is an international agency with 164 member countries and its purpose is to promote international commerce. All the leading world economies are members of the WTO, including the UK. European Union countries are also all members, but they act together in the WTO as the EU. The average EU tariff for agricultural produce is 10.9% One of the most important principles of the WTO is that you should not discriminate between other WTO members. The UK and the EU would both have to impose on one another's exports the same barriers they apply to goods from the other WTO member countries.  In fact, in the absence of a free trade agreement they would be obliged under WTO rules to do that. They include import tariffs, which are taxes applied only to imports. WTO members make commitments that they will not raise tariffs above a certain level. Those maximum levels, known as bound levels or bindings, vary from country to country and product to product. The tariffs they actually apply can be, and in many cases are, below those levels. But if you do go below bound levels, you have to do it for imports from all WTO members. For the EU the average maximum tariff is 4.8% for all goods. But there are some big variations.  It's generally higher for agricultural produce, 10.9% on average. For most industrial goods it's quite low, but for cars, the tariff is 10%. The EU has agreed to a cap on some of its farm subsidies Assuming the UK were trading with the EU under WTO terms, the figures are an indication of the levels of tariffs British exporters would face on their goods. It would make them less competitive in the EU market than they currently are with no tariffs at all. The UK's new schedule will have to have the consent of the other WTO members. It is administratively easier and less likely to be contested if we stick with the arrangement that we already have, as the UK's ambassador to the WTO,Julian Braithwaite. wrote in his blog,external: ""So to minimise any grounds for objection, we plan to replicate our existing trade regime as far as possible in our new schedules."" However, the UK would be free to apply lower tariffs. In some cases it is highly likely we would. For example, the EU imposes seasonal tariffs on orange imports when the Mediterranean producers have their harvest. Getting rid of that is an example of what one former trade official described to me as ""low hanging fruit"". Some economists, including Patrick Minford of Cardiff University and one of the leading members of Economists for Brexit (now renamed as Economists for Free Trade), favour a more comprehensive exercise in cutting tariffs and other barriers unilaterally. But these cuts would have to apply to goods coming from the EU as well. Don't be fooled, some aspects will be more complicated. For some farm produce, for example, the EU has quotas that can be imported at lower tariffs (called tariff rate quotas). We don't yet know how these will be divided between the UK and the remainder of the EU. There is also the question of what happens to that produce when it is traded between the UK and the EU. Currently it is tariff-free. Both will probably want a slice of the other's reduced tariff quota. That will mean either a bigger total quota or a reduced slice for some other country. The UK will have to decide if it wants to maintain EU rules in areas such as labelling In the WTO, the EU has agreed to a cap on some of its farm subsidies. We don't currently know what type of system the UK will adopt and potentially this an area of difficulty. The EU however is well below its subsidy cap, and that could make this area less contentious than it might have been. No. There are many other types of trade restrictions. These include rules on product specifications, labelling, testing, and requirements for authorisation from a national regulator to provide some types of services. The UK would have to decide whether or not to maintain EU rules in these areas. Currently a trade dispute would be a matter for the European Court of Justice. Theresa May has already said that its jurisdiction in the UK will end. If there is a trade agreement with the EU it would probably contain some arrangement for a tribunal to make rulings. If there is no such deal then any dispute would have to go to the WTO's dispute settlement system, which can establish panels to make rulings. Whatever happens, the UK and the EU will be subject to WTO rules.

Why high-flying Singapore is scrapping grades,"Singapore is top of education rankings - but now wants to focus on well-being Singapore is in top place in the international rankings for education. But it wants the next upgrade of its school system to focus on keeping students positive and resilient. Dr Lim Lai Cheng, former head of the prestigious Raffles Institution school in Singapore and director at the Singapore Management University, explains the push for character as well as qualifications. It was no accident that Singapore created one of the world's highest performing education systems in five decades. Reminiscent of the examinations for selecting mandarins in old China, the road to success in Singapore has always been focused on academic credentials, based on merit and allowing equal access for all. This centralised system helped Singapore to create social cohesion, a unity of purpose among its schools and an ethos of hard work that many nations envy. But the purpose of the education system has changed and Singapore in 2017 is no longer the fledgling state it was in 1965. Schools have become highly stratified and competitive. More advantaged families are better able to support their children with extra lessons outside of school, such as enrichment classes in mathematics, English, dance and music. Those who can't afford this have to depend on their children's own motivation and the resources of the school to catch up. Dr Lim Lai Cheng says the school system needs to encourage well-being This social divide continues to widen because the policies that had won the system its accolades - based on the principle of meritocracy - no longer support the social mobility they were meant to bring about. So work is in progress to tackle anything in the system that seems to be working against social cohesion. This time around, it will no longer be enough to develop a highly-skilled workforce to plug into the global economy.

The next update of the education system will have to ensure that Singapore can create a more equitable society, build a stronger social compact among its people while at the same time develop capabilities for the new digital economy. Government policies are moving away from parents and students' unhealthy obsession with grades and entry to top schools and want to put more emphasis on the importance of values. Schools have been encouraged, especially for the early elementary years, to scrap standardised examinations and focus on the development of the whole child. Singapore wants its school system to help with character as well as qualifications ""Character scorecards"" and ""reflection journals"" have become the staple in many primary schools, to allow parents to follow the social and developmental progress of their children. A number of schools have also adopted an approach centred on well-being, as promulgated by Dr Martin Seligman, director of the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. Dr Seligman's model advocates that academic success and well-being form a double helix, and that the best schooling must include educating children on values and character, as well as how to interact well with others, set goals for themselves and work towards achieving those goals. Positive education, a movement that is gaining momentum across the world, works to create a school culture that supports caring, trusting relationships. Singapore has built its modern economy on investments in education It is an approach that focuses on specific skills that assist students to build positive emotions, enhance personal resilience, promote mindfulness and encourage a healthy lifestyle. This approach has worked well with schools that are trying to implement the new syllabuses for character and citizenship education, launched in the last three years. An important segment of the new curriculum, at the primary level is family time, and how parents should play an important role in inculcating the right values in their children. At the secondary and high school levels, ""values in action"" programmes lie at the core of educating young Singaporeans to be empathetic, socially responsible and active citizens in their community. For example, students work on projects that serve the elderly, reach out to migrant workers and read to latch-key children in day-care centres. The emphasis is on character and resilience as well as exam results There have also been calls for more flexibility over admissions to local top schools and universities to encompass selection based on character traits such as drive, resilience and passion. To enhance equity, the education ministry has also attempted to spread resources more evenly across schools by rotating experienced principals to schools that need more attention and paying more attention to academically weaker students by strengthening vocational and skills training. All round, government leaders have expounded a wider definition of success beyond academic grades. The media and elite schools have been discouraged from showcasing top students and their academic achievements. There has also been a nationwide initiative called SkillsFuture which puts, in the first instance 500 Singapore dollars (Â£290) in the hands of every Singaporean from age 25 onwards, for them to pursue lifelong learning, build personal mastery and pursue their passion. An online databank with at least 10,000 courses that Singaporeans can sign up for, to broaden or deepen their skills or take on new hobbies, is easily accessible. School-based education and career guidance counsellors are also provided at the primary to tertiary levels, to nurture students' self-awareness, self-directedness and life skills. Drawn from people with industry experience, the counsellors help students to explore education and career options. They should be able to help students with information about the skills needed for the digital economy, so that students can go beyond what they learn for exams. This is a softer approach - emphasising values and character and trying to improve the link between school and work. It's the search for the next formula for education in Singapore.

The two faces of social care,"Ruth Angove (left) and Jane Patterson's mother (right) ""An Alice in Wonderland situation"" is how one woman has described her elderly mother's social care provision where she is given more money each month than she can spend. Another says her mother has not received a penny toward her support. Both women told the BBC that they think the chasm between their circumstances highlights the problems within the social care system which they hope will be addressed in the Budget. Judy Perkins, who lives in Richmond, Surrey, says her mother has accrued more than Â£10,000 in three years in money she has been given towards her care, but cannot spend. Her mother, Ruth Angove, 82, is disabled and has no income other than the state pension with an enhanced pension credit and attendance allowance. She lives alone in the home she owns, is bed-bound and has dementia. The local council provides her with five and a half hours of home care every day but assesses her contribution to the cost as only Â£170 a month which is about 6% of actual cost. It says that due to government regulations this is the maximum they can take and it then has to pay the rest itself. Ruth Angove (right) with her daughter Judy Perkins (centre) and her son-in-law Richard Perkins ""I'm very embarrassed about it,"" said Mrs Perkins. ""It's a real Alice in Wonderland situation."" ""While I may be glad my mother is financially more stable, as a taxpayer I find it ridiculous. I feel over-taxed all the time and then see money being thrown away."" Mrs Perkins said she understood that some people may need their attendance allowance for expenses like transport but said her mother could only use a limited amount. ""The consequence is that she has built up a surplus of more than Â£10,000,"" she explained. Following the Budget on Wednesday 8 March, she said giving local councils Â£2bn extra in the Budget for social care provision still did not address the need to change the regulations so that they could be more careful about how it is spend and ultimately make the system work for those who pay for the services as well as those who use them. Ruth is one of a dwindling group of people - those people whose needs are so great that they qualify for help from councils. The numbers getting support from local authorities have fallen by a quarter in five years as town hall budgets have been squeezed. But to get help you also need to be judged to have not enough money to pay for the cost of care yourself. If she had more savings she would be expected to contribute more and if she had over Â£23,250 she would have to pay the full cost of her care. Presumably as she accrues more money, the council will start increasing her contribution. There are about 850,000 older people in England that are in a similar position to Ruth - in that they get help from their local council. However, there are four times as many paying for care themselves, relying on family and friends or simply going without. 10 graphs that illustrate the social care problem How the care system works across the UK The alternative options You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating. average amount of care provided per week, by your council average paid per hour by your council, 2014-15 average paid per hour in your region if you pay for your own care, 2016 You live in a care home that provides round-the-clock support with everyday tasks.

TBCpay for their own care    Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there.  Jane Patterson says her parents were hard-working honest people In Tyne and Wear, Jane Patterson said she has had to sell everything her mother owned to pay for her care needs. ""I have been forced to sell her house and get rid of her personal belongings as if she was dead,"" she said. Miss Patterson's mother is blind and had to move into a care home in 2014, two years after being diagnosed with dementia. She owned her home, had some savings and as well as her own pension had a small company pension from her late husband. As her mother's assets were worth in excess of Â£23,250, Miss Patterson said she had to sell her mother's house to meet the Â£3,500 per month care home fees. Miss Patterson said her mother is well-cared for by the staff at the home but has to pay for everything, from her own bedding to her toiletries, while government-funded residents are provided with everything they need. One care organisation, she said, had told her it relied on self-funding residents to support those under social services care. ""It is not just about money, it's about the moral and decent side of respecting hard-working honest people and not taking advantage,"" she said. ""If assistance, support and care cannot be free and equal across the board, it does not have to be so criminally expensive. ""It should be free all over United Kingdom not just free in Scotland,"" she added. Jane Patterson's mother went blind and was also diagnosed with dementia Miss Patterson said the additional money announced in the Budget would still not help those who pay for their own care. ""I do agree some contribution should be made by the individual if their circumstances allow. So a fair and consistent cap would be more palatable. All my parents did was work and save hard and a fair system would be all they ask,"" she said. ""We're all going to face the need for care when we're older and as a working woman I am happy to pay towards that from my salary, but there is absolutely no incentive to do the right thing in this country. ""This is just putting a sticking plaster on a broken system."" The so-called crisis in social care is not just about a squeeze on council budgets, it's also about the impact on individuals such as Jane's mother. Three quarters of people face paying for care once they pass the age of 65. For one in 10 the costs can exceed Â£100,000. But these costs are not just accrued because these people do not qualify for council help. There is increasing evidence to suggest those who pay for themselves are actually subsidising the council-funded care market. Self-funders routinely pay more for their care than the fees councils pay. Analysts Laing Buisson believe this is effectively a ""hidden care tax"".
