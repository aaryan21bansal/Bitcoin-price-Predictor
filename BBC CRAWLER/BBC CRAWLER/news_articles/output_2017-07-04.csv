US: N Korea tested long-range missile,"This video can not be played ""One expert says the missile could reach Alaska"" The US has confirmed that North Korea tested a long-range missile which some experts believe could reach Alaska. Secretary of StateRex Tillerson called it,externala ""new escalation of the threat"" and warned that Washington ""will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea"". Pyongyang claimed on Tuesday to have successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). However, most experts believe that the North does not yet have long-range nuclear weapon capabilities. This video can not be played Missiles fired during US-South Korea drills serve as warning to North Korea In response the US and South Korea conducted a joint military exercise on Wednesday. A statement by the two countries' militaries warned that ""self-restraint, which is a choice, is all that separates armistice and war"" and that their drills showed ""we are able to change our choice"". The two Koreas are technically still at war as the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice. Is the new missile test a game-changer? Can the US defend itself against North Korea? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? What can the outside world do? Mr Tillerson said ""global action is required to stop a global threat"" and warned that any nation that provided economic or military benefits to the North, or failed to fully implement UN Security Council resolution, was ""aiding and abetting a dangerous regime"". The US and South Korea fired missiles into the Sea of Japan on Wednesday in response The US has asked for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the issue. A closed-door session of the 15-member body is expected later on Wednesday. A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead The minimum range is 5,500km (3,400 miles), although most fly about 10,000km or more Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs: the KN-08, with a range of 11,500km, and the KN-14, with a range of 10,000km, but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM. It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14 North Korea's missile programme State news agency KCNA quoted leader Kim Jong-un as saying the test was a ""gift"" to the Americans on their independence day. The report warned of the possibility of more tests, saying he ordered officials to ""frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees"". This video can not be played North Korean state TV announces ""successful"" missile test Pyongyang said earlier the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea. North Korea, it said, was now ""a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world"". The launch, the latest in a series of tests, was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council. Some experts believe that Tuesday's test proves that it has a missile that could travel across the globe and reach Alaska. Physicist David Wright said it couldreach a maximum range of about 6,700km,externalon a standard trajectory, while South Korea's defence ministry on Wednesday put the range between 7,000 and 8,000km. But whether that missile could deliver a warhead is still a question. Pyongyang claimed the rocket carried a ""heavy warhead"" and that it ""accurately hit the targeted waters without any structural breakdown"". But South Korea said there was no evidence proving the missile could withstand high temperatures and successfully re-enter the atmosphere,reported Yonhap news agency.,external Experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it onto a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target. They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets. Butothers believe that,externalat the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon that could strike the US within five to 10 years. How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? North Korean media released this image of Tuesday's missile launch By bringing Alaska within range, the new missile test is an unambiguous game-changer in both symbolical and practical terms. US territory (albeit separate from the contiguous continental US) is now finally within Pyongyang's cross-hairs. For the first time a US president has to accept that the North poses a ""real and present"" danger not merely to north-east Asia and America's key allies - but to the US proper. President Trump's weakness lies in having overplayed his hand too publicly and too loudly. Read more from Dr Nilsson-Wright. The South Korean parliament adopted a resolution on Wednesday condemning the missile launch, reported Yonhap. The resolution said ""the North Korean authorities themselves will have to bear the price for their provocative behaviour, and we gravely warn that it could result in the Kim Jong-un regime facing its collapse and extinction"". North Korean state TV said the launch was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un Japan on Tuesday said ""repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable"" and lodged a protest. Meanwhile China - which is Pyongyang's main economic ally - and Russia have called on North Korea to suspend its ballistic missile programme in exchange for a halt on the large-scale military exercises by the US and South Korea. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who met in Moscow on Tuesday, said ""the opposing sides should start negotiations"". Have missile tests paid off?

Scientists solve Roman concrete puzzle,"Scientists examined samples from this ancient Roman pier with very high-powered X-rays Researchers have unlocked the chemistry of Roman concrete which has resisted the elements for thousands of years. Ancient sea walls built by the Romans used a concrete made from lime and volcanic ash to bind with rocks. Now scientists have discovered that elements within the volcanic material reacted with sea water to strengthen the construction. They believe the discovery could lead to more environmentally friendly building materials. Unlike the modern concrete mixture which erodes over time, the Roman substance has long puzzled researchers. Rather than eroding, particularly in the presence of sea water, the material seems to gain strength from the exposure. In previous tests with samples from ancient Roman sea walls and harbours, researchers learned that the concrete contained a rare mineral called aluminium tobermorite. They believe that this strengthening substance crystallised in the lime as the Roman mixture generated heat when exposed to sea water. Researchers have now carried out a more detailed examination of the harbour samples using an electron microscope to map the distribution of elements. They also used two other techniques, X-ray micro-diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, to gain a deeper understanding of the chemistry at play. This new study says the scientists found significant amounts of tobermorite growing through the fabric of the concrete, with a related, porous mineral called phillipsite. The researchers say that the long-term exposure to sea water helped these crystals to keep on growing over time, reinforcing the concrete and preventing cracks from developing. ""Contrary to the principles of modern cement-based concrete,"" said lead author Marie Jackson from the University of Utah, US, ""the Romans created a rock-like concrete that thrives in open chemical exchange with seawater."" A close up view of the concrete from a scanning electron microscope showing the presence of the tobermorite which adds strength ""It's a very rare occurrence in the Earth."" The ancient mixture differs greatly from the current approach. Modern buildings are constructed with concrete based on Portland cement. This involves heating and crushing a mixture of several ingredients including limestone, sandstone, ash, chalk, iron and clay. The fine material is then mixed with ""aggregates"", such as rocks or sand, to build concrete structures. The process of making cement has a heavy environmental penalty, being responsible for around 5% of global emissions of CO2. So could the greater understanding of the ancient Roman mixture lead to greener building materials? Prof Jackson is testing new materials using sea water and volcanic rock from the western United States. Speaking to the BBCearlier this year, she argued that the plannedSwansea tidal lagoonshould be built using the ancient Roman knowledge of concrete. ""Their technique was based on building very massive structures that are really quite environmentally sustainable and very long-lasting,"" she said. ""I think Roman concrete or a type of it would be a very good choice [for Swansea]. That project is going to require 120 years of service life to amortise [pay back] the investment. ""We know that Portland cement concretes contain steel reinforcements. Those will surely corrode in at least half of that service lifetime."" There are a number of limiting factors that make the revival of the Roman approach very challenging. One is the lack of suitable volcanic rocks. The Romans, the scientists say, were fortunate that the right materials were on their doorstep. Another drawback is the lack of the precise mixture that the Romans followed. It might take years of experimenting to discover the full formula. The research has been published in the journalAmerican Mineralogist,external.

Green Day 'distraught' as show cancelled,"Promoters have blamed bad weather for the decision to cancel a concert by Green Day in Glasgow, only hours before it was due to begin. The American band had been set to perform in Bellahouston Park on Tuesday. However, promoters PCL said the show had been cancelled because ""adverse weather conditions"" meant it was ""no longer safe"" for the bands to perform. In astatement on their website,externalGreen Day said they were ""very distraught"". They said the stage was deemed ""unsafe for the fans and everyone involved"". The band added: ""We are very distraught about this as we are in Glasgow now and were very much looking forward to this show as one the highlights of our tour. ""We have been playing in extreme weather conditions throughout this European tour, and the last thing we want to do is see a show cancelled. ""We love our Scottish fans and we don't care if it's raining... sideways, although the safety of our fans and our crew is always our top priority. ""We love you Scotland, we love the city of Glasgow and it goes without saying that we will be back."" Signs have been put up at Bellahouston Park advising that the Green Day gig is cancelled Police Scotland said officers were at the park making sure ticket holders were able to get home safely In astrongly worded post on Instagram,external, the band's bassist Mike Dirnt posted a video of himself next to a Saltire. He said: ""We are devastated and it... sucks that the show today has been cancelled due to safety issues. ""I know today's show would have been insane! I'm at a loss for words and so disappointed right now, but please know we will be back ASAP! Rage & Love."" Bassist Mike Dirnt posted a video on Instagram of himself next to a Scottish flag Disappointed fans have also voiced their anger at the last-minute announcement. Charlotte Durcan, from Lincolnshire, said she and her family had travelled nearly four hours to attend the concert. ""We arrived safely, paid for parking, paid for our hotel, and at 13:45 received an e-mail to say that the concert has been cancelled,"" she said. ""We could have saved our money,"" she added. ""The hotel won't reimburse us as there is a 72-hour notice period. We will be staying there for one night only as we just came for the concert. We're not really sure how to pass the time now. ""It's my first time in Glasgow and it has ruined my Glasgow experience."" The promoters announced the cancellation of the gig just half an hour before the gates were due to open The last-minute decision to cancel has raised questions over how well prepared the organisers were for the concert. Many ticket holders took to social media to express their disappointment. One said she was ""absolutely devastated"" by the decision, after waiting seven years to see the band perform in Scotland. Others raised questions over the weather conditions, claiming that T in the Park and Glastonbury often go ahead in heavy rain. It also led to queries about how well prepared the organisers were for the sell-out concert. Glasgow City Council, which operates Bellahouston Park, said they did not tell the promoters to cancel the gig. They said the decision was taken by the promoters and the band's management, who informed the council of the move. The promotersannounced the cancellation on Twitter,externalshortly before 13:30. The gates were due to open at 14:00. They said fans would receive refunds. In a statement, they said: ""Adverse weather conditions overnight and throughout the morning, during the bands scheduled load in, led to issues on stage. ""A meeting between the on site health and safety, event management, the artists representatives and promoters concluded that it would be unsafe in the timescale to proceed with the event."" Police Scotland said they had officers at the park advising fans that the gig was cancelled and ensuring that they got home safely. Green Day were due to be supported by Rancid, Slaves and Skids. Slaves hastily arranged a replacement gig,announcing on Twitter,externalthat the ""good people of Glasgow still need a gig"". It quickly sold out.

SAS accused of killing unarmed Afghans,"One man says members of his family were killed in an SAS night raid The Royal Military Police is investigating an allegation that British special forces killed unarmed Afghan civilians, the BBC understands. The BBC has spoken to one man who says four members of his family were killed in a night raid involving the SAS in 2011. The Sunday Times has also reported other allegations of unlawful killing by British special forces. An investigation into British troops' conductin Afghanistan began in 2015. In 2016,the Ministry of Defence said about 600 complaintsagainst British forces in Afghanistan had been made, relating to a period between 2005 and 2013. The MoD says 90% of those have already been dismissed, with fewer than 10% still the subject of investigation by the Royal Military Police under Operation Northmoor. The man, who did not want to be named, told the BBC he was held, blindfolded, in a room overnight. ""Early morning, they came and opened my eyes and said to me that I should not go out until they left the area. When the helicopters left the area we came out of the room. ""As soon as I came out of the room I saw that they had shot my father, two brothers and cousin."" The BBC has been told the raid did involve special forces and is now being investigated. A former British Army intelligence officer, Chris Green, who served in Afghanistan, said he had been blocked when he tried to look into allegations of abuses by special forces officers. ""British forces, and the troops that I worked with, worked under very very strict rules of engagement and it seemed to me that special forces did not have to apply the same rules in quite the same way,"" he said. ""My overview of their accountability was - I didn't see any. ""When I sought information from them, this wall of secrecy was put in front of me and I could see no good reason why the information I was asking for was denied from me and nor could they give me a good reason for denying me that information."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the former director of public prosecutions, Lord Macdonald, are among those who have called for an independent inquiry into the claims. ""Our armed forces have a reputation for decency and bravery,"" said Mr Corbyn. ""If we do not act on such shocking allegations we risk undermining that reputation, our security at home and the safety of those serving in the armed forces abroad."" The former head of the army, General Lord Richard Dannatt, said people shouldn't jump to conclusions. ""No witch hunts, but no cover ups,"" he said. ""If there is evidence of wrongdoing, it should be investigated, but we should be very, very careful of throwing mud at our very special, special forces.""

Amputee teen racer back behind wheel,"Billy Monger has driven a racing car for the first time since his crash A teenage racing driver who had to have both legs amputated after a high speed crash has got back behind the wheel. Billy Monger, from Surrey,hit the back of a stationary carat Donington Park in April and lost both of his lower legs, days before he turned 18. Eleven weeks on, he has now returned to the cockpit of a racing car at Brands Hatch in Kent. The adapted Fun Cup endurance racer is designed to look like a VW Beetle and has steering wheel mounted controls. The Formula 4 racer returned to the track with the assistance of Team BRIT, which helps disabled drivers and injured servicemen to compete in motorsport. The teenager said he still wanted to perfect his technique He said: ""It's been really good just to get back behind the wheel. And he added: ""Team BRIT have got two steering wheels for me to try out today. ""I've decided which one I prefer, now it's just about perfecting the technique."" Dave Player, Team BRIT founder said the aim was to give the teenager his first time out on the track and to get his race licence back. Monger said his ambition now was to compete in the Le Mans 24 Hours with Frenchman Frederic Sausset, who lost both arms and legs through an illness. Billy was driving a specially-adapted car with similar power to a performance hatchback ""I'm not 100% committed to anything yet, we're just looking at different options to see what's best for me in the future,"" he said. ""There's a lot of work involved in what's going on with my own rehabilitation, but that's all going well, so hopefully we'll be back out on track soon."" Billy's car is specially adapted with steering wheel-mounted hand controls for the throttle, brakes and clutch The teenager thanked fans who had overwhelmed him with help: ""People keep saying I'm the inspiration but I think all these people coming together to support someone who has gone through an accident like this, they're the true inspiration.""

Student debt costs and public sector pay,"The spiralling costs of student debt is the main thrust of several of the day's front pages. The Guardian,externalsays students from the poorest 40% of families entering university in England for the first time this September will accrue an average debt of about Â£57,000, according to the Institute of Fiscal Studies. The economic think-tank says the end of maintenance grants in 2015 had disproportionately affected the poorest, while students from the wealthiest 30% of households would run up average borrowings of Â£43,000. Andthe Times,externalreports on how three-quarters of graduates will never repay their student loans. They are liable for repayments once they earn more than Â£21,000 but after 30 years, whatever debt is left is written off. Some 77% were not expected to repay their debt, including interest, the IFS said. A subject ""guaranteed to stir local emotions"" -as the Times puts it,external- is the prospect of building new by-passes. The paper reports that the government is about to spend Â£1bn a year combating congestion in towns and cities. Almost 4,000 miles of A-roads will be upgraded, and significant sums will be put into a fund to construct by-passes around built-up areas with the worst jams. The Telegraph,externalsays business groups and road safety campaigners have welcomed the news, but the Times thinks the scheme is bound to provoke opposition, not least from those experts who think building new roads simply creates more traffic. Interest in pay as an issue has been so strong it's surprising how little notice is taken of the offer to firefighters of a 2% rise. Butthe i newspaper,externalputs the story on its front page, saying the increase will add to the pressure on Theresa May coming from the police, teachers, the armed forces and civil servants. The Daily Mail,externalnotes that it's local authorities, not central government, which negotiates the salaries of firefighters. There's a sharply personal tone to the attack by theDaily Mirror,externalon former PM David Cameron for his comments about the need for pay restraint. Under the headline, ""Cam off it, Dave,"" the paper points out that nurses and teachers have seen their wages fall in real terms while he ""coins it round the world"", giving lectures for ""up to a Â£120,000 an hour"". The Guardian,externalsuggests Mr Cameron's motive may have been to have a go at Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.The Times,externalthinks it more likely he was trying to support the chancellor, and protect his own legacy. The Mail,,externalrather to its own surprise, finds itself praising Mr Cameron for his ""wise words"". It offers sympathy to state sector workers, but argues that ""a general spending splurge"" would increase debt and cost jobs and growth. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Tackling the shortage of homes in sought-after rural areas is, according to theTelegraph,external, a nettle the government is determined to grasp. The paper believes Communities Secretary Sajid Javid will launch ""a new assault on homeowners with a nimby attitude"", forcing them to accept that more homes must be built. He says there will have to be ""tough decisions"" because, as the Telegraph notes, ""it could prove controversial with grassroots Tory voters, many of whom live in affluent areas"". The Sun,externalcomments that rising prices have brought ""joy to homeowners"", but it feels that the government has to find speedy ways of helping people in their 20s to find homes. The Daily Express,externalhighlights the plight of patients who have to wait ""for crucial knee, hip and cataract operations"" on the NHS. It describes the long delays as a new crisis for the NHS, saying surgery is provided quickly in parts of the country, while in others some patients do not receive any treatment.

NHS 'rationing leaves patients in pain',"Vital NHS operations and treatments are being increasingly rationed in England, leaving patients in pain, doctors say. The treatments affected include hip and knee replacements and cataract surgery to help restore sight as well as drugs for conditions such as arthritis. Such care is normally given routinely, but the British Medical Journal has found evidence it is being cut back. The journal obtained data showing more doctors are having to resort to special appeals to get their patients treated. Local health bosses have blamed the tighter restrictions on a lack of funding. But medics and patients' groups said the restrictions being placed on non-emergency treatment were ""unfair"" and meant patients spent longer in pain or were going without treatment. Cataract surgery is one of the procedures that doctors are seeking special requests to carry out When care is not being funded on the NHS, doctors can use the the exceptional cases system to appeal to local health bosses to get the treatment for their patients. It is normally associated with new drugs not yet available on the NHS, to pay for expensive treatments in unusual circumstances or to get care that there are legitimate restrictions on, such as cosmetic surgery. But the BMJ has gathered evidence from clinical commissioning groups which shows the special requests are increasingly being used for vital non-emergency services. Responses from 169 of the 209 clinical commissioning groups, which control local budgets, showed: In 2013-14 there were just 49 requests made for hip and knee surgery, but by last year the figure had reached 899 Over the same period, the number of cataract appeals trebled to more than 1,000. Overall the number of requests being made through the special cases route rose by 47% to 73,900 Just over half of all requests were approved One patient who has been caught up in the squeeze is Helen Cole, from west London. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 11 years ago. She relies on a drug called rituximab, but it is not being routinely funded by her local health bosses so her doctor has to make a special request for it every six months. This has led to delays in her getting the drug and gaps in her treatment. Last time, she had to wait 10 weeks to get her next treatment. ""I had a lot of pain in my joints and really big problems with fatigue. It can be really challenging day to day."" She said she finds the whole process ""stressful"" and believes it ""makes no sense"". ""The whole point of treating a disease like rheumatoid arthritis is to try to keep it under control at all times,"" she added. Exceptional requests for funding can be made by doctors when they believe their patients should get treatment that is not normally funded locally. They make an appeal to a local panel who decide whether to allow the treatment. This is done when a treatment is either not funded or where the patient does not qualify because their condition is not considered severe enough. For example, for hip and knee replacements doctors use a scoring system to assess how much discomfort and lack of mobility a patient has. By increasing the bar at which a referral for an operation is made the NHS can help restrict the numbers getting treatment. Removal of skin tags Cosmetic surgery Varicose vein surgery Plastic surgery Fertility treatment Mental health care Cataract removal Carpal tunnel syndrome (nerve damage to wrist) Hip and knee surgery Breast surgery Doctors said the trend was a clear indicator that care was being rationed. For every case where an exceptional argument has been made, there will be plenty more where patients will have gone without care and their doctor has not appealed. But it should also be seen in the context of the large number of non-emergency treatments that do take place - more than 15 million a year. There are more than 15 million planned operations and treatments each year Julie Wood, chief executive of NHS Clinical Commissioners, which represents CCGs, said despite seeing more patients than ever, the NHS was still struggling to keep up with demand. ""Unfortunately, the NHS does not have unlimited resources and ensuring patients get high-quality care against a backdrop of spiralling demand and increasing financial pressures is one of the biggest issues CCGs face. ""As a result there are some tough choices that have to be made, which we appreciate can be difficult for some patients."" But Stephen Cannon, of the Royal College of Surgeons, said local health managers were ""unfairly and unnecessarily prolonging the time patients will spend in pain, possibly immobile and unable to carry out daily tasks or to work"".

Ed Sheeran quits Twitter over abuse,"The star was accused of using a backing track at Glastonbury Ed Sheeran says he's quit Twitter after receiving a stream of abuse. ""I've actually come off Twitter completely,""he told The Sun,external. ""I can't read it. ""I go on it and there's nothing but people saying mean things. One comment ruins your day. But that's why I've come off it."" The star, who has 19 million followers, says he'll keep the account open, but it will only share automatic updates from his Instagram page from now on. A quick scan of Twitter finds a number of negative - although not necessarily abusive - comments directed towards the 26-year-old. ""Irritating ginger busker"" is a particularly common insult; while the song Galway Girl has provoked a torrent of anger. ""Revolting, fudged cultural appropriation,""wrote David N,externalabout the jaunty jig, in which Sheeran describes falling for a girl who ""played the fiddle in an Irish band"". Another userdescribed it as,external""awful 'diddly-eye leprachaun'"" music, full of ""stereotypical nonsense"". Richard Roche hadsome helpful advice regarding the lyrics,external, which he described as: ""Full of geographical inaccuracies (there's no pub on Grafton St)."" Most recently, Sheeran had to defend himself against accusations of using a backing track during his headline set at Glastonbury. Ed Sheeran on BBC Music Ed Sheeran closes Glastonbury 2017 Ed Sheeran: 12 random questions Ed Sheeran says he's topped Thinking Out Loud The star uses a loop pedal during his performances, which allows him to record his vocal and guitar lines, creating a layered, looped accompaniment live, on the spot. ""Is it a backing track or invisible musicians?!? Who's playing when Ed Sheeran stops?!?""wrote one mystified fan,external. ""Couldn't he get real musicians? I like him but all a bit karaoke,""wrote another.,external In his last personally-authored tweet, the star sounded exasperated by the accusations. ""Never thought I'd have to explain it, but everything I do in my live show is live, it's a loop station, not a backing track. Please google,""he wrote,external. Other users took aim at Sheeran's televised Glastonbury show after he suffered guitar problems during the song Bloodstream. ""Ed Sheeran come to my house and I will show you how to tune a guitar you useless mess,""wrote one,external. Speaking to The Sun, Sheeran said he had ""been trying to work out why people dislike me so much"" but the simple answer is that he's the victim of his own success. His third album Ã· (Divide) is the year's biggest-seller, dominating the charts and radio around the world. In the UK, every song on the record made the top 20 of the singles chart, while the lead single, Shape Of You, spent 14 weeks at number one. That sort of ubiquity draws out the more mean-spirited and aggressive users of Twitter - which has gained a reputation for harbouring trolls. Stars including Miley Cyrus, Sue Perkins, Stephen Fry, Halsey and Avengers director Joss Whedon have all quit the site after suffering abuse. Others, including Selena Gomez and Tom Daley, have received death threats. (We saw no evidence of similar tweets to Sheeran, although it is possible such messages would have been deleted for violating Twitter's terms and conditions). Last year,Bloomberg reported,externalthat Disney chose not to pursue an acquisition of the social media network in part because it thought the bullying behaviour of some users might damage the film company's image. Twitter has since taken action to combat abuse - giving users better tools to mute or block trolls. Twitter quitters (L-R): Halsey, Sue Perkins and Miley Cyrus Based upon a trawl of Sheeran's account, mean tweets are vastly outweighed by positive ones. Every time he posts a photo or a comment, the majority of responses are variations of, ""I love you,external"", ""te amo,external"" and ""come to Portugal!,external"" And if Sheeran ventures back onto the site, he'll find heartwarming messages like this one from Castie Collins,who wrote,external: ""I'm learning guitar because of you."" ""Thank u @edsheeran for making great music so studying isn't always SO terrible,""said Emily Estopare,external. Hannah Robinsonadded,external: ""I'm sick and feel like crap but I turned on some Ed Sheeran songs and felt better."" And Karen Porter had kind words for Sheeran's Glastonbury slot: ""Could tell you were having the best time ever up on that stage,""she said,external. ""Amazing to see true talent and a genuine soul. Much love."" Even the star's least-liked song received some (faint) praise from Sadie Lyon,who wrote,external: ""My Uber driver knows the rap bit in Galway Girl.""

Cameron: Fiscal discipline not 'selfish',"The former PM says leaving debts to future generations is wrong David Cameron has said opponents of fiscal discipline are ""selfish"" not ""compassionate"", as the debate within the Tories over austerity continues. The ex-prime minister, who introduced the public sector pay cap, said those who believed in ""sound finances"" were wrongly being painted as ""uncaring"". ""The exact reverse is true,"" he said at an event in South Korea. ""Giving up sound finances isn't being generous."" Chancellor Philip Hammond has urged ministers to ""hold their nerve"". As a growing number of Tory MPs, as well as opposition parties and unions, call for the 1% cap on public sector pay increases to be reviewed, the chancellor has said the ""right balance"" must be struck in terms of fairness to workers and taxpayers. Kuenssberg: Will they or won't they? Ahmed: Hammondâs challenge Reality Check: Is public sector pay higher than private? Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson expressed his support for a rethink on Monday, while Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said he sympathises with the millions of NHS workers whose pay has been squeezed since 2010 - firstly through a two-year pay freeze and then through the cap, which was imposed in 2012. But Mr Cameron, who as prime minister of the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition oversaw six years of cuts to public spending, defended his government's record on cutting the multibillion pound annual deficit and suggested it would be a mistake to now loosen up efforts. Five million public sector workers have seen their pay capped since 2012 ""The opponents of so-called austerity couch their arguments in a way that make them sound generous and compassionate,"" said the former PM, who stood down as an MP last year, at a conference in Seoul. ""They seek to paint the supporters of sound finances as selfish, or uncaring. The exact reverse is true. ""Giving up on sound finances isn't being generous, it's being selfish: spending money today that you may need tomorrow."" Rises of 1% for dentists, nurses, doctors and the military have already been agreed for this year and No 10 said ministers would respond to pay review bodies next recommendations in due course. Nigel Lawson, a former chancellor to Margaret Thatcher, said it was Mr Hammond's job to keep control of public spending and urged ministers to formulate the policy behind closed doors. ""It's not easy but it is necessary,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""People understand we need to pay our way on the road to economic success."" Public sector morale at 'critical levels' Boris Johnson joins pay policy debate The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said increasing pay in line with inflation next year could cost about Â£5bn and to do so for the rest of the Parliament could ""easily cost twice that"". However, director Paul Johnson told the BBC that Mr Hammond had a range of options to ease the constraints on pay without breaching his immediate financial targets. ""If that were the government's biggest priority then it could probably afford to do it,"" he said. ""The country would hardly be bankrupt if the government were to borrow a few billion more than currently planned."" But he said it was not clear how much ""headroom"" Mr Hammond would have given uncertainty over the performance of the economy and other spending pressures. After the Tories' failure to win a majority, the chancellor has said it is up to his party to again make the case for a market-based economy, underpinned by sound public finances, and oppose those calling for a ""different path"". Labour said immediate action was needed from the government not ""just more empty words or infighting from members of the cabinet"". ""The fact that some of the pillars of our community and the public sector such as teachers, doctors and police officers are seeing their pay cut exposes the double standards of a government that likes to praise their work but will not actually truly reward it,"" said shadow chancellor John McDonnell.

"More than 5,000 new FGM cases in England","The NHS in England recorded 5,391 new cases of female genital mutilation (FGM) in the past year, data reveals. Almost half involved women and girls living in London,NHS Digital,externalfound. A third were women and girls born in Somalia, while 112 cases were UK-born nationals. The practice is illegal in the UK and it is compulsory for family doctors, hospitals and mental health trusts to report any new cases in their patients. FGM - intentionally altering or injuring the female external genitalia for non-medical reasons - carries a sentence of up to 14 years in jail. It is the second time that NHS Digital has released annual FGM figures for England. Most of the cases were spotted by midwives and doctors working in maternity and obstetric units. The majority had originally had FGM done to them abroad and as a young child. The NSPCC says more should be done to end the practice: ""FGM is child abuse. Despite being illegal for over 30 years, too many people are still being subjected to it and it is right that health services have started to properly record evidence of this horrendous practice. ""It takes courage to report concerns as many feel ashamed or worry they will betray friends and family. But we need to end the silence that surrounds FGM to better protect children."" The National FGM Centre, which is run by the children's charity Barnardo's and the Local Government Association (LGA), tries to prevent the practice, but its director Michelle Lee-Izu is warning it could be at risk of closure if government funding is withdrawn. Cllr Simon Blackburn, from the LGA, said the government ""must act now"" to secure the National FGM Centre's ""long-term future"" by providing guaranteed funding. He said: ""Social work provision to girls and families affected by FGM has been quickly and significantly improved through the intervention of Centre social workers, embedded in council safeguarding teams, and hundreds of referrals have been received in areas that previously only recorded a handful of cases each year. Mr Blackburn added that the government needed to back its commitment to ending FGM in the UK ""with the long-term funding required to make that vision a reality"". Anyone concerned about someone who has suffered, or is at risk of FGM, can contact the NSPCC FGM Helpline anonymously on 0800 028 3550 or visit nspcc.org.uk. Wendy Preston, from the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""Mandatory reporting and compulsory sex-and-relationships education are important weapons in the fight against FGM, and school nurses play a vital role in both educating children and young women, and spotting those who may be at risk. ""The government must act to attract and retain school nurses, to help address the problem at grassroots level, and maintain momentum in the fight to eradicate FGM."" A government spokesman said the start-up money for the centre came from the Â£200m Children's Social Care Innovation Programme, and was designed to lead to self-sustaining work, not ongoing core funding. But he added: ""Protecting women and girls from violence and supporting victims is a key priority for this government and a personal priority for the Minister for Women and Equalities, Justine Greening.""

"How I saved the NHS Â£22 million, says mum","David, now 17, had to wait almost four months for an ankle foot orthosis A wasted operation which left her son David unable to walk was what spurred on Rebecca Loo to make a difference to the NHS. ""I was livid. I was so consumed by anger. I thought either I have a nervous breakdown, or I do something,"" says Rebecca, from Staffordshire. She is only one of 300,000 people who got in touch with Healthwatch England, an independent health watchdog, to share their experiences of NHS treatment. Rebecca's disgust with the orthotics service which failed her son has led to a total redesign of how children access braces, boots and callipers to help their mobility. As a result of her hard work, children right across England are no longer facing the sort of delays which affected her son. Crucially, NHS England believes the changes have the potential to save hospitals up to Â£22 million. Because of muscle abnormalities resulting from cerebral palsy, which left his foot turned inwards, David had needed to wear special, supportive NHS boots to help him walk. But they were usually ill-fitting, and often so delayed that he had outgrown them by the time he got them - or only a few months later. David then endured blisters, chaffing and bleeding toes while new boots were made. In 2009, an orthopaedic surgeon recommended serial casting to set David's foot straight. David was left immobile and unable to go to school Immediately after surgery he should have been fitted with an ankle foot orthosis - a brace that keeps the ankle and foot straight - but it took 17 weeks to arrive and, within days of the operation, her son was immobile. The knock-on effect for nine-year-old David was huge, both in terms of his physical development and his emotional well-being. He missed school for four months because he couldn't access his classroom on the top floor. He was upset and in pain. ""We weren't just back at square one, we were worse than when we started,"" Rebecca told BBC News. David later had to undergo complex surgery that Rebecca believes would have been unnecessary if her local orthotics department had worked as it should have done. And it turned out Rebecca's experience was not unique. She spoke to many other parents who had endured similar experiences - but nothing had been done to improve the system. Together, they created a dossier of evidence cataloguing the woeful state of her local orthotics department. Rebecca Loo's son's wait meant surgery ultimately had to be done again ""Nobody cared who was in charge; nobody had looked at how the service was commissioned,"" explains Rebecca. ""The service was neglected and underfunded."" Healthwatch England has launched#ItStartsWithYou,externalto highlight the difference patient feedback can make. The campaign is encouraging members of the public to share their experiences of the NHS - good or bad - to help improve how things are done. Imelda Redmond, national director of Healthwatch England, said the NHS was ""increasingly keen to find out what people are feeding back"". ""It can help the whole health and care sector understand what it is getting right and where things need to improve. ""I urge everyone to speak up and help us make the changes we all want to see,"" she said. Rebecca's feedback ultimately changed the way services were commissioned - not only in Staffordshire but across England. And in 2014, those processes were rolled out nationally. ""To have not acted would have been to accept defeat,"" says Rebecca. ""I didn't want another family to go through what we did. ""Unless you listen to patients, you can't have a service that meets needs."" George Rook's input on dementia treatment has helped improve local health and social care services George Rook wanted to share his first-hand experience of being diagnosed with dementia, which has now led to the creation of two ""dementia cafes"" in Shropshire. After struggling with his own diagnosis, George, 63, has spent the past four years working with local doctors to help improve the way they identify and support people with early symptoms of the disease. Working with his local Healthwatch, George has helped local GP surgeries to become ""dementia friendly"" and set up a programme to recruit local dementia champions. He has also been instrumental in establishing the Butterfly Scheme, which sees medical staff pinning a butterfly to people's notes to enable others to quickly and discreetly see that they have dementia.

Can the US defend itself against North Korea?,"North Korean state TV released photos of the purported ICBM test launch Whatever the precise range and capability of North Korea's latest ballistic missile test, there is no doubt that it is making steady progress towards its goal of having a nuclear-capable missile, able to threaten the continental US. That term ""nuclear capable"" is important. Pyongyang must both miniaturise a nuclear warhead to fit on the head of a missile and be able to protect it against all the buffeting and forces as it re-enters the earth's atmosphere. We do not know precisely where the North Koreans stand in this aspect of their programme. But it is possible that North Korea will achieve its goal during the Trump presidency. This then throws a spotlight on the US ability to defend against such an attack. Huge quantities of money have been invested in ballistic missile defence. There is a global network of satellite sensors and relays able to spot and track a missile launch. Interceptor missiles are already in place. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? What can the outside world do? How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? North Korea's missile programme But critics believe that the US system is far from reliable. The Trump administration is reviewing the whole programme. New generations of interceptor missiles are coming on stream. But in the foreseeable future, only a handful will be available to deal with the potential North Korean threat. Israel's missile defence system has proved effective against the rockets it has faced We are a long way from the ""Star Wars"" dream of President Ronald Reagan, who hoped for the construction of a missile-proof shield over the US and its allies. In those days ballistic missile defences were seen by many as destabilising. That is why there was a Cold War treaty largely banning them. They would threaten the certainty of a retaliatory nuclear attack getting through, thus increasing the likelihood of a no-warning onslaught, in turn decreasing the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence. Missile defence viewed as part of the strategic equation between two nuclear-armed superpowers is one thing. Some argued that even a less-than-effective defensive system would alter an opponent's calculations. But very quickly the idea of a missile-proof screen - like a comic book Captain America's shield protecting the continental US - was seen as science fiction if not fantasy. It would be too expensive and the technology simply did not exist. Surface-to-air missiles have been deployed outside Japan's defence ministry Scroll forward a few decades and the threat that missile defence is now ranged against is very different. It is not - despite Russian protests -  aimed at weakening Russia's nuclear forces. It is designed to protect against a very specific threat - from Iran or North Korea's developing missile arsenals. Against this kind of threat, the requirement is not simply to alter an adversary's strategic calculations, but to stop each and every missile getting through. Technology has advanced dramatically with some of the most significant strides being made by Israel. Its interceptor systems and their associated radars - funded in large part by the US - have shown themselves spectacularly successful, even though against a full-scale onslaught even Israel's system would be sorely tested. The Thaad defence system will take out missiles considered a threat to South Korea In contrast the US's own defensive system, according to many critics, is not yet up to the job. Testing has provided mixed results. And there are frequent criticisms that even the most elaborate tests are not conducted in ways which fully resemble real-world conditions. Even US commanders accept that their defences are not fully missile-proof and that they might quickly be overwhelmed if a country possessed a sizeable arsenal of missiles. Whatever President Trump decides to do about North Korea and the growing reach of its missiles, time is running out. One option he may pursue is to step up the US's own defences, just as he has deployed interceptor missiles in South Korea to try to enhance its defences against missile attack.

US seeks urgent talks on N Korea,"This video can not be played ""One expert says the missile could reach Alaska"" The US has sought an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss North Korea's new missile provocation. A closed-door session of the 15-member council is expected on 5 July. The request came after North Korea said it had successfully tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile. US officials believe the claim is likely true, meaning the North may now be able to fire a missile to Alaska. Experts say it cannot accurately hit a target, however. China and Russia, which share a land border with North Korea, have called for a freeze on Kim Jong-un's nuclear programme. They urged the US and South Korea to suspend large-scale military exercises. The two countries also called on the US to avoid deploying the Thaad missile system - which aims to intercept attacks from Pyongyang - in South Korea. Chinese President Xi Jinping was in Moscow, where he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Can the US defend itself against North Korea? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? What can the outside world do? The announcement on North Korea state television said the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un. It said the projectile had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea. This video can not be played North Korean state TV announces ""successful"" missile test North Korea, it said, was now ""a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world"". The launch, the latest in a series of tests, was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council. But experts also believe that Pyongyang does not have the capacity to miniaturise a nuclear warhead that can fit onto such a missile. How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? The big question is what range it has, says the BBC's Steven Evans in Seoul. Could it hit the United States? David Wright, a physicist with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists,says that if the reports are correct, this missile could,external""reach a maximum range of roughly 6,700km on a standard trajectory"". That range would allow it to reach Alaska, but not the large islands of Hawaii or the other 48 US states, he says. It is not just a missile that North Korea would need, our correspondent adds. It must also have the ability to protect a warhead as it re-enters the atmosphere, and it is not clear if North Korea can do that. Unnamed US officials told media that they believed the test was of an ICBM, with one authority saying that the claim was being ""taken seriously"". National security, military and diplomatic officials were discussing what to do if it is determined for certain that the test was with an intercontinental ballistic missile,CNN reported.,external Once again North Korea has defied the odds and thumbed its nose at the world in a single missile launch. With the test of the Hwasong-14, it has shown that it can likely reach intercontinental ballistic missile ranges, including putting Alaska at risk. Kim Jong-un has long expressed his desire for such a test, and to have it on the 4 July holiday in the US is just the icing on his very large cake. North Korean state TV released photos of the purported ICBM test launch Despite this technical achievement, however, it is likely many outside North Korea will continue to be sceptical. They will ask for proof of working guidance, re-entry vehicle, and even a nuclear warhead. From a technical perspective, though, their engines have demonstrated ICBM ranges, and this would be the first of several paths North Korea has to an ICBM with even greater range. North Korea's missile programme A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead The minimum range is 5,500km (3,400 miles), although most fly about 10,000km or more Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs: the KN-08, with a range of 11,500km, and the KN-14, with a range of 10,000km, but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM. It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14 South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has called on the United Nations Security Council to take steps against North Korea. But a strong warning came from the country's Director of Operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Cho Han-Gya said ""Kim Jong Un's regime will face destruction"" if it ""ignores our military's warnings and continues provocations"". Japan said ""repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable"" and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country would ""unite strongly"" with the US and South Korea to put pressure on Pyongyang. US President Donald Trump also responded swiftly on Tuesday. On his Twitter account,externalhe made apparent reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying: ""Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?

Detainees 'benefit from Â£1-an-hour work',"This video can not be played Baroness Williams was answering a question in the Lords Detainees benefit from being able to work for Â£1-an-hour at immigration centres, a minister has insisted. Lib Dem Baroness Hamwee had asked if the Â£1 pay rate ""for people who have committed no crime"" was ""something that as a society we can be proud of"". Baroness Williams of Trafford told the Lords the work by inmates was voluntary and was a way to ""relieve boredom"". She said it helped meet ""recreational and intellectual"" needs - and was not a scheme designed to save money. Baroness Williams, who faced jeers as she answered questions in the House of Lords,  argued that any rights detainees had to work were curtailed, so their pay rights were ""not the same as people who are not subject to immigration detention"". Baroness Boothroyd was the House of Commons Speaker between 1992 and 2000 Labour frontbencher Lord Rosser argued that a Freedom of Information request in May 2014 suggested that hundreds of detainees had been paid Â£45,438 for 44,832 hours work. ""The saving of using detainees for Â£1 an hour, compared to paying employed staff on minimum wage, would be in the region of Â£300,000 a month. ""Who gets the benefit of this apparently considerable saving each month by using detainees at immigration centres on just Â£1 an hour to do necessary work, as opposed to using employed staff on the minimum wage? Is it the government or is the firm running the centre who reap treat financial benefit?"" Baroness Williams insisted the work at immigration removal centres was not about supplementing contractors, who she said were obliged to provide a minimum number of opportunities for detainees to participate voluntarily in paid activities. But after Lib Dem Lord Paddick received a similar reply, former Commons Speaker Lady Boothroyd pressed the minister: ""The question that's being asked is who benefits? That was the original question and that's the question we're all waiting to hear the answer."" Lady Williams replied: ""Who benefits is the detainee."" She said that ""this money is not wages as the ordinary working population would see it"", adding that the rate is ""being reviewed"" and a report is expected at the end of the year.

"I'm a creep, says resigning tech boss","Dave McClure co-founded investment firm 500 Startups The founder of Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist firm 500 Startups has resigned following sexual harassment claims by several women. Dave McClure announced his resignation in a blog entitled: ""I'm a creep. I'm sorry."" Entrepreneur Sarah Kunst had claimedin the New York Times,externalthat Mr McClure sent inappropriate messages after discussing a potential job offer with her. Mr McClure apologised directly to her for his behaviour in his post. He also admitted that he had behaved inappropriately towards other women. ""I made advances towards multiple women in work-related situations, where it was clearly inappropriate,""wrote Mr McClure,external. ""I put people in compromising and inappropriate situations, and I selfishly took advantage of those situations where I should have known better. My behaviour was inexcusable and wrong."" Sarah Kunst claimed Dave McClure said in a message he didn't know whether to ""hire her or hit on her"" according to the New York Times After the article, tech entrepreneur Cheryl Yeoh alsopublished claims of an assault in her apartment,externaland claimed there were ""dozens"" of women who had been sexually harassed by him. She said she had hosted Mr McClure and some other investors at her home to brainstorm new ideas in 2014. He was the last to leave. ""He pushed himself on to me to the point where I was backed into a corner, made contact to kiss me, and said something along the lines of, 'Just one night, please just this one time,'"" she wrote. Ms Yeoh said she had already told Mr McClure that she had a boyfriend, and that he knew him. ""The fact that I had to say no multiple times, and that he had pushed himself on to me and kissed me without my consent was way more than crossing the line of inappropriateness,"" she wrote. Cheryl Yeoh gave a Ted talk in 2013 In his blog Mr McClure apologised directly to Sarah Kunst and ""the women I have hurt or offended"" but did not mention Ms Yeoh by name. He has not commented on her claims. A plea for 'decency' in shaken Silicon Valley Uber: The scandals that drove Kalanick out TechCrunch reported thata female partner in the firm had also resigned,external, criticising 500 Startup's leadership for its ""lack of transparency"" regarding Dave McClure. Co-founder Christine Tsai has now taken on the role of chief executive. ""As much as we want to be part of the solution, we clearly have also been part of the problem,""she wrote.,external ""Undoubtedly there are ways I could have done more or acted sooner."" Dave McClure is undergoing counselling ""to work on changing his perspectives"", she added. Silicon Valley has been rocked by sexism scandals in recent months. Several senior executives at Uber, including founder Travis Kalanick, resigned after a damning report into the organisational culture within the firm which included sexual discrimination. Last month, Binary Capital co-founders Justin Caldbeck and Jonathan Teo both resigned from the tech investment firm following accusations of harassment carried out by Mr Caldbeck. Ina statement to The Information,external(which has a paywall) Mr Caldbeck said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the allegations. ""There's no denying this is an issue in the venture community, and I hate that my behaviour has contributed to it,"" he said. At last week's Female Founders conference, attendees said they were pleased to see action was being taken. ""People are being held accountable - they're not sweeping it under the carpet,"" Jessica Livingston, co-creator of start-up investment programme Y Combinator,told the BBC.

US seeks urgent UN session on N Korea,"This video can not be played ""One expert says the missile could reach Alaska"" The US has sought an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss North Korea's new missile provocation. A closed-door session of the 15-member council is expected on 5 July. The request came after North Korea said it had successfully tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile. US officials believe the claim is likely true, meaning the North may now be able to fire a missile to Alaska. Experts say it cannot accurately hit a target, however. China and Russia, which share a land border with North Korea, have called for a freeze on Kim Jong-un's nuclear programme. They urged the US and South Korea to suspend large-scale military exercises. The two countries also called on the US to avoid deploying the Thaad missile system - which aims to intercept attacks from Pyongyang - in South Korea. Chinese President Xi Jinping was in Moscow, where he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Can the US defend itself against North Korea? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? What can the outside world do? The announcement on North Korea state television said the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un. It said the projectile had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea. This video can not be played North Korean state TV announces ""successful"" missile test North Korea, it said, was now ""a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world"". The launch, the latest in a series of tests, was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council. But experts also believe that Pyongyang does not have the capacity to miniaturise a nuclear warhead that can fit onto such a missile. How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? The big question is what range it has, says the BBC's Steven Evans in Seoul. Could it hit the United States? David Wright, a physicist with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists,says that if the reports are correct, this missile could,external""reach a maximum range of roughly 6,700km on a standard trajectory"". That range would allow it to reach Alaska, but not the large islands of Hawaii or the other 48 US states, he says. It is not just a missile that North Korea would need, our correspondent adds. It must also have the ability to protect a warhead as it re-enters the atmosphere, and it is not clear if North Korea can do that. Unnamed US officials told media that they believed the test was of an ICBM, with one authority saying that the claim was being ""taken seriously"". National security, military and diplomatic officials were discussing what to do if it is determined for certain that the test was with an intercontinental ballistic missile,CNN reported.,external Once again North Korea has defied the odds and thumbed its nose at the world in a single missile launch. With the test of the Hwasong-14, it has shown that it can likely reach intercontinental ballistic missile ranges, including putting Alaska at risk. Kim Jong-un has long expressed his desire for such a test, and to have it on the 4 July holiday in the US is just the icing on his very large cake. North Korean state TV released photos of the purported ICBM test launch Despite this technical achievement, however, it is likely many outside North Korea will continue to be sceptical. They will ask for proof of working guidance, re-entry vehicle, and even a nuclear warhead. From a technical perspective, though, their engines have demonstrated ICBM ranges, and this would be the first of several paths North Korea has to an ICBM with even greater range. North Korea's missile programme A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead The minimum range is 5,500km (3,400 miles), although most fly about 10,000km or more Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs: the KN-08, with a range of 11,500km, and the KN-14, with a range of 10,000km, but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM. It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14 South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has called on the United Nations Security Council to take steps against North Korea.

Japan said ""repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable"" and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country would ""unite strongly"" with the US and South Korea to put pressure on Pyongyang.

Many Grenfell survivors still in hotels,"All Grenfell Tower fire survivors who want to be rehoused have been offered temporary accommodation, officials say, but only nine offers have been accepted and many are still in hotels. Theresa May promised housing would be offered to those in need by Wednesday. The Grenfell Response Team says 139 formal offers have now been made. But North Kensington Law Centre, which represents many victims, said some had been offered homes in other towers, other areas, or without enough rooms. The fire on 14 June killed at least 80 people, although police say the final toll will not be known for many months. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the prime minister said 158 familieswould be ""found a home nearby"",externalwithin three weeks, later saying they would be offered ""rehousing"" within three weeks. The Grenfell Response Team said that target had now been met. It said the remaining 19 families did not want to be contacted, or were out of the country.

Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? However, a spokesman for North Kensington Law Centre - which represents more than 100 Grenfell victims - said many of the offers had been unsuitable. Some of the firm's clients had been offered homes in other high-rise blocks, while some had gone to view a three-bedroom home only to discover it was a two-bedroom flat. Many had been offered a year-long tenancy and would need to be permanently rehomed afterwards. Many victims were ""concerned the decision they make now could affect their long-term tenancy"", he added. ""Doing that from a hotel room is difficult at the best of times, let alone when you are fairly traumatised."" He added: ""These people do have various complex issues. ""We are dealing with very traumatised people, we have a limited housing stock, we are working to a tight schedule and there is also a sense of scepticism among some residents."" Only three of the firm's clients had accepted accommodation offers, he added. This video can not be played Grenfell Tower survivor Antonio is living in a hotel and has turned down two flats. Connie Cullen, from the homelessness charity Shelter, said people had often been unsure whether to take up residency agreements. ""It is often very difficult for people to know what the offer they are being offered means. So how long they might be there, what terms they are on, what rent they are paying. ""We are keen to see people offered like-for-like tenancies, housing and rent, so people retain the same security of tenure that they had before."" Ms Cullen said the demand for social housing following the fire was ""unprecedented"" but had highlighted a general lack of affordable housing in the area. One tenant from the 10th floor of Grenfell Tower, who only gave his name as Antonio, is among those who has turned down the offer of temporary accommodation. ""We want to move to permanent accommodation so we can remake it and then we can call it home,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live.

David Wright, a physicist with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists,says that if the reports are correct, this missile could,external""reach a maximum range of roughly 6,700km on a standard trajectory"". That range would allow it to reach Alaska, but not the large islands of Hawaii or the other 48 US states, he says. It is not just a missile that North Korea would need, our correspondent adds. It must also have the ability to protect a warhead as it re-enters the atmosphere, and it is not clear if North Korea can do that. Unnamed US officials told media that they believed the test was of an ICBM, with one authority saying that the claim was being ""taken seriously"". National security, military and diplomatic officials were discussing what to do if it is determined for certain that the test was with an intercontinental ballistic missile,CNN reported.,external Once again North Korea has defied the odds and thumbed its nose at the world in a single missile launch. With the test of the Hwasong-14, it has shown that it can likely reach intercontinental ballistic missile ranges, including putting Alaska at risk. Kim Jong-un has long expressed his desire for such a test, and to have it on the 4 July holiday in the US is just the icing on his very large cake. North Korean state TV released photos of the purported ICBM test launch Despite this technical achievement, however, it is likely many outside North Korea will continue to be sceptical. They will ask for proof of working guidance, re-entry vehicle, and even a nuclear warhead. From a technical perspective, though, their engines have demonstrated ICBM ranges, and this would be the first of several paths North Korea has to an ICBM with even greater range. North Korea's missile programme A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead The minimum range is 5,500km (3,400 miles), although most fly about 10,000km or more Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs: the KN-08, with a range of 11,500km, and the KN-14, with a range of 10,000km, but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM. It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14 South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has called on the United Nations Security Council to take steps against North Korea. But a strong warning came from the country's Director of Operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Cho Han-Gya said ""Kim Jong Un's regime will face destruction"" if it ""ignores our military's warnings and continues provocations"". Japan said ""repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable"" and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country would ""unite strongly"" with the US and South Korea to put pressure on Pyongyang. US President Donald Trump also responded swiftly on Tuesday. On his Twitter account,externalhe made apparent reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying: ""Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? ""Hard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!"" North Korean state TV said the launch was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un President Trump has repeatedly called on China, Pyongyang's closest economic ally, to pressure North Korea to end its nuclear and missile programmes. On the prospect of North Korea being able to strike the US, he tweeted in January: ""It won't happen."" However experts say it might - within five years or less. Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the international community ""must redouble its efforts to impose a price on this regime, which strains every nerve and sinew to build nuclear weapons and launch illegal missiles, even as the people of North Korea endure starvation and poverty"".

Ashley Â£14m claim was 'drink banter',"Mike Ashley was at the High Court for the hearing Billionaire Mike Ashley has dismissed claims he owes a finance expert Â£14m and said their conversations were ""drink banter"", a court has heard. The Newcastle United owner is being sued by Jeffrey Blue at London's High Court. Mr Blue said he was promised Â£15m if he managed to increase Sports Direct's share price to Â£8, but that he only received Â£1m. But Mr Ashley said their meetings were drink-fuelled ""banter"". Mr Blue says Mr Ashley, who runs Sports Direct, did not stick to a commercial agreement. But in a written statement, the sportswear tycoon said: ""I can't believe that [Mr Blue] is now trying to take me for Â£14m off the back of some drink banter that he is seeking to engineer into something more."" Finance expert Jeffrey Blue claims he was promised Â£15m for pushing up the price of shares Mr Justice Leggatt has heard that the dispute between Mr Blue and Mr Ashley relates to a conversation in a London pub called the Horse & Groom in 2013. Mr Blue came under attack from Mr Ashley's lawyers as he gave evidence during the second day of the hearing. Mike Ashley 'vomited into fireplace at pub meeting' David Cavender QC, who leads Mr Ashley's legal team, accused Mr Blue of ""making up evidence"" and said the claim was an ""opportunistic try-on"". Mr Cavender also said Mr Ashley ""fairly"" said he could not recall details of conversations in the Horse & Groom, ""particularly in the light of the amount of drinking"". ""He does recall 'that there was a lot of banter and bravado'. ""He does not recall any discussion about whether Mr Blue would be paid a sum of money if the share price reached Â£8 a share.""

Plan to scrap free school lunches dropped,"Since September 2014 all infant pupils have been offered a free school meal Plans to axe free lunches for infant school children from better off families in England have been scrapped. Schools minister Nick Gibb said the government would ""retain the existing provision"", having listened ""very carefully"" to the views of parents. The Tory manifesto proposed restricting free lunches to infants from poorer homes - with free breakfasts for all primary school pupils funded instead. It was intended to save Â£650m a year - but was left out of the Queen's Speech. And Mr Gibb told MPs: ""We have listened very carefully to the views of the sector on the proposal to remove infant free school meals and we have decided that it is right to retain the existing provision."" The Tories have abandoned a host of proposals since failing to win a majority, including plans to means-test winter fuel payments, end the triple lock guarantee on pension increases and to hold a vote on foxhunting. Free school lunches for all infant children were introduced by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government in 2014. Plans to limit their availability again to low-income families had proved controversial, with some parents complaining the offer of a free breakfast was not directly comparable and was merely a cost-saving measure. Many schools were also unhappy about the move, arguing they had gone to great expense to adapt their facilities to provide hot lunches. Tories pledge school cash from cutting free infant meals,external Fox hunting vote shelved by government During the campaign, the Conservatives argued that free breakfasts would have equal, if not greater, nutritional benefit for pupils and could be delivered at the fraction of the cost of lunches. But challenged on the policy by shadow education secretary Angela Rayner in the Commons, Mr Gibb confirmed the government had changed its mind. ""Universal infant free school meals ensure children receive a nutritious meal during the day,"" he said. ""It saves hardworking families hundreds of pounds a year and it boosts educational achievement, especially among children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds."" Labour is pressing the government to clarify whether plans for free breakfasts have now been scrapped. During education questions, Mr Gibb also promised that no school would have its budget cut as a result of the national funding formula, which aims to make funding fair for schools. Axing free meals a disgrace, says Oliver Free lunch for all at infant schools Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Welcome to England's 'Little America',"Aspiring photographer Jolene Jeffers has swapped the ""dry heat"" of New Mexico for the more variable Suffolk climate With its picturesque villages and quiet country lanes, the county of Suffolk embodies a vision of a certain kind of Englishness. Yet nestled away in its north-western corner lies a pocket of pure Americana, where the cars are huge, you can pay for a haircut in dollars and the Stars and Stripes flutter proudly. The accent is unmistakably American. The man, elderly, slightly hunched but with a freshly cut short-back-and-sides, hauls himself out of the black leather barber's chair and places some money in Steve Snazell's palm. ""Until next time,"" he says, heading out of the door with a sense of purpose honed from years in the military. ""He's a regular,"" says Mr Snazell, a second generation barber whose shop sits directly opposite the wired fence of RAF Mildenhall. The American community was established here during World War Two and the years immediately afterwards when the US military coagulated into a crescent of RAF bases that stretch across southern England from Lakenheath in Suffolk to RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire. West Suffolk is home to both RAF Lakenheath and Mildenhall, with RAF Feltwell perched just over the Norfolk border to the north. In the past seven decades, tens of thousands of US military personnel, their spouses and their children have set up home in this Suffolk enclave for postings lasting between two and four years. The United States Air Force claimsRAF Lakenheath and Mildenhall are worth a combined Â£700m ($910m)to the local economy. The influence of the American dollar stretches far and wide - from the local property rental market to the pubs and restaurants, where US patrons are noted for eating out earlier than their British counterparts. About half of all Mr Snazell's customers are Americans - either those currently serving in the military, or retirees who have settled in the area. The cost of a haircut is Â£8 - though Mr Snazell is equally happy to take payment in dollars ($12). One of the current batch of Americans living in the area is Jolene Jeffers, an aspiring photographer currently working for a car rental company. She and husband Caleb, originally from Albuquerque, New Mexico, are almost three years into a four-year posting. He works on the Lockheed C-130 Hercules at RAF Mildenhall. ""It is a different experience but still a really cool one,"" she says of life in west Suffolk. ""Sometimes I just want to go to Walmart at 03:00 for ice cream and socks, and you can't do that here. ""I miss home but it's amazing to be so close to London and to Paris. ""It's very small compared to what I'm used to, but Suffolk is so cosy and the people are so nice."" British retiree Rosalind Hamill is working on a community garden project with the help of some American volunteers Such appreciation is reciprocated by retiree Rosalind Hamill, who is one of the thousands of British people to have made a living working on the bases. ""We've always worked together, the base and the local community,"" says Mrs Hamill, a West Row councillor who left school aged 15 to work at RAF Mildenhall. ""The young ones are so polite - it's all yes ma'am, no ma'am."" More updates from the county with BBC Local Live: Suffolk Photographs reveal quirky world of Country Folk Stunning pictures of summer solstice at Stonehenge The enduring appeal of the English seaside Another local who has taken the American community to his heart is Terence Grinling. He started on base as an electrical contractor before being made a permanent member of staff at RAF Mildenhall. ""I enjoyed every minute of it - so much so that when I reached retirement age I did an extra four years there."" As well as a living, the base gave him a son-in-law, Kenneth, from Ohio. ""He did not want to go back to the US and Hayley (Mr Grinling's daughter) did not want to leave,"" says the retiree. ""So they settled here and live with my grandson William in Red Lodge."" Terence Grinling spent years working for the US military. He is now father-in-law to an American serviceman Talk to people in this area of Suffolk and the conversation will at some stage invariably turn to cars. Huge American Chevrolets, Fords and Chryslers are commonplace. But driving left-handed cars along Suffolk's often narrow winding lanes can prove problematic. Terry James, who runs Mildenhall Car Sales, says many of the airmen pop into their showroom for advice about negotiating the county's roads. Terry James's office pays homage to all things American (and a London bus outside the Palace of Westminster) As well as selling cars - nearly all automatic - to the Americans, Mr James's staff prepare US cars for the roads in the UK andfor their MOTs,external. But many Americans have an ulterior motive for visiting Mr James's car showroom: his dog, a velvety grey three-year-old Weimaraner called Charlie. Most service personnel have to leave their pets at home and so for many Charlie has become a much-loved surrogate. Charlie, a Weimaraner, has become a surrogate pet for some people at the base Sylvia James says some service personnel come in simply to chat Terry's wife Sylvia says the airmen and their families feel a ""strong sense of belonging"" in their offices. ""Sometimes people just happen to come in here,"" she says. ""We listen to them, we're here for them, even if it's just for a chat. ""We push the boat out and make an effort. You have to remember nothing is familiar to them here - even mince pies at Christmas time. They didn't know what they were."" If you scratch beneath the surface, there is a sense of uncertainty about what the future holds for businesses reliant on the airbase. In 2015, theUSAF revealed it planned to pull out of RAF Mildenhall, RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth by 2020-23. That decision is nowreportedly being reviewed,external. ""If Mildenhall closes, we'd have to change our business model pretty sharpish,"" says Bill Flynn, the managing director of removals firm Safepac. Half of the company's business involves moving American ""members"" - the term given to service families - back and forth across ""the pond"". Each year they handle some 2,000 US house shipments. (If you have wondered how much the average family's possessions (excluding cars) weigh, Mr Flynn can tell you. It is about 4,000kg.) ""Service families are so used to moving, the old adage that moving house being the most stressful thing you do in your life doesn't apply to them"", Mr Flynn says. ""We do everything you'd expect in a normal house move - we pack and wrap household possessions into crates, 10 crates to a container. We organise shipping them to America, where they can then face a couple of thousand miles by road."" Businessman Bill Flynn is the son of a US serviceman who set up a removals firm in 1966 For those who do return to America, the pull of Suffolk can remain strong in the years after leaving. Retired USAF major Steve Balkan runs a pizzeria in Rothsay in Minnesota but 13 years ago he was stationed at RAF Mildenhall. ""This was by far the best assignment in my whole air force career,"" he said. ""We love the Brits, the sense of humour. And the countryside around here is so beautiful. ""I've always wanted to come back and show the kids where they came from."" Steve Balkan with children (l to r) Reygan, Jacob and Chase Opened in 1934,RAF Mildenhallwas made a joint operation USAF-RAF base in 1950. It was earmarked for closure in 2015 More than 4,000 US and UK nationals work at the base, with the USAF estimating it to be worth $331m (Â£219m) to the local economy in 2013-14 Nearby RAF Lakenheath is home to the USAF's 48th Fighter Wing. Control of the base transferred from the RAF to the USAF in 1948.

Reality Check: The Grenfell rehousing promise,"The claim:Every person made homeless by the Grenfell fire will receive an offer of accommodation by Wednesday, 5 July. Reality Check verdict:Council officials say offers of temporary accommodation have been made to 139 of 158 households and the remaining 19 households did not want any contact with the council at this time. But only nine of these offers have so far been accepted. Days after the tragedy, Theresa May said she had ""fixed a deadline of three weeks for everybody affected to be found a home nearby."" On 22nd June, she said, ""all those who have lost their homes have been offered emergency hotel accommodation; and all will be offered rehousing within 3 weeks."" Since then the Communities Secretary, Sajid Javid, has been referring to temporary homes. On Monday, Mr Javid said that theprime minister's promise,externalwould be honoured and that the 158 households who lost their homes would be offered ""temporary accommodation"" by Wednesday 5 July. At this stage, families are being offered temporary homes rather than hotel rooms to stay in, until a genuinely permanent home is found for them. The Grenfell Fire Response Team, made up of local and central government, the Red Cross, the Metropolitan Police and the London Fire Brigade, have now offered accommodation to 139 Grenfell households who lost their homes as a result of the fire. Nineteen households did not want to be contacted by the council at this time, family liaison officers told the response team. Some of them are currently out of the country. This means the team will have met the three-week target of making an offer of accommodation to those affected. However, only nine households have accepted the offer so far. At the moment, the majority of survivors are living in hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation. We do not yet know exactly why the other 130 households have not accepted the accommodation offered to them. But the leader of the Kensington and Chelsea Labour group, Robert Atkinson, said traumatised people were being pushed to make decisions too soon because of Theresa May's promise. He said some families currently staying in hotels and temporary housing were not accepting offers of intermediate accommodation because they did not want to keep moving and preferred to wait for a permanent offer. One tenant from the tenth floor of Grenfell Tower, who only gave his name as Antonio, is among those who turned down the offer of temporary accommodation. ""We want to move to a permanent accommodation so we can remake it and then we can call it home,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. A spokesperson for the response team said people were still considering the offers but may be hesitating for a number of reasons including distance to children's schools and suitability for elderly or disabled residents. Some survivors wanted to remain in the borough, others wanted to be placed as far away as possible, while others still, understandably traumatised, have been reportedly turning down offers of accommodation in tower blocks, or in sight of Grenfell Tower. The offered accommodation is either within the borough of Kensington and Chelsea or as close as possible within neighbouring boroughs, according to the response team. If an offer of accommodation is turned down, family liaison officers will work with residents to find a suitable alternative. At the moment, it appears this process will continue until survivors are provided with accommodation with which they are happy.

Larkin's life in poetry and pornography,"Larkin's ties and lawnmower are among the objects in the exhibition Unseen letters, an extensive collection of tea towels and a pair of knickers bearing the words ""do not spank"" are going on show in an exhibition of items belonging to poet Philip Larkin. Books, LPs and ties are among the other possessions that are being put on display at the University of Hull. Larkin worked in the university library for 30 years until his death in 1985. Curator Anna Farthing said: ""We've tried to piece together a life from objects rather than from words."" The possessions, most of which have never been seen in public before, show ""the complications and contradictions of his life, of his body, of his relationships, of his attitudes"", Farthing said. The exhibition, titled Larkin: New Eyes Each Year, opens on Wednesday and is the main celebration of the city's most famous cultural son to be staged during Hull's year as UK City of Culture. Revelations about Philip Larkin's private life have made him a divisive figure To some, Larkin was Britain's greatest 20th Century poet. But revelations about his unsavoury views towards race and women have tarnished his reputation for many. ""It's incredible that somebody who had such a contradictory and conflicted world and life managed to produce art that was so clean and clear. It's made me appreciate the artistic work even more,"" Farthing said. Many of the exhibits have come from the house where he lived before his death. He had a collection of Beatrix Potter ceramic figures And a figure of Hitler that he was given by his father There is his lawnmower, typewriter, stationery, camera, photographs and briefcase. There are 33 souvenir tea towels, some of which bear comic verses, and a ""tree"" made of 119 ties. ""They all represent different aspects of his personality,"" Farthing said. ""We presume the past is black and white, but these ties are full of pattern and colour."" There are also exhibits shedding light on his relationship with his mother, including a rare recording of the pair in conversation and examples of the letters that he wrote to her every day. And there are also items relating to his lovers, including Monica Jones's patterned pink dress and pink lipstick. The pants were found in his house after his death Different sides of his personality can be seen in his collection of ceramic Beatrix Potter characters, which go with his Beatrix Potter books; and a miniature Adolf Hitler figure, which was passed down from his father. And light is shed on more tawdry parts of his inner world. As well as the knickers, there are books with titles like The Rod and The Whip, rude doodles found drawn inside books, and pornography. ""We did find some stuff which is top shelf material, shall we say,"" Farthing says. ""So we've put it on the top shelf and just drawn attention to it with a fairly innocent pair of pink knickers.""

London's defiant market," This article was first published in July 2017 Fruit and veg salesman Paul Crane uses his distinctive Bermondsey rasp to tout his produce at Borough Market. “Strawberries, get 'em by the pound,” he bellows to the punters, trickling down Stoney Street, in London Bridge. The trader has been a staple in Borough for 18 years. On 3 June, he had packed up his stall - as usual - at the end of a busy Saturday. The market had been packed with foodies, locals and tourists. That evening, the nearby pubs and restaurants gradually filled with people enjoying the summer evening. But it all changed shortly after 10 o'clock, when a hired van sped across London Bridge driving into pedestrians. Out jumped three knife-wielding men wearing fake suicide vests - who proceeded to wreak more havoc in the historic market and surrounding streets. “My daughter called me [that night] and said there'd been an attack. Ten minutes later it [turned out] it was the market so I stayed up watching it on TV,” the 46-year-old Crane says. I was just worried that friends that were up here were injured or worse.” Borough Market was closed for about 10 days after the attack, and it's now back open and filled with the usual heady mix of colours, sounds, smells and tastes. But for the stallholders and their customers, is it business as usual? Over the two decades Paul Crane has been working there, Borough Market has been transformed into a place where culinary cultures collide. Fishmongers, butchers and greengrocers now sit alongside street food stalls. There's an enticing aroma in the air. As it approaches midday, business picks up at the Borough Wines stall - with customers tempted by the Prosecco and elderflower cocktails. Stall manager Ian Campbell, 46, says the attackers struck at one of the busiest times. “A lot of traders would hang about on Saturday, it's the last day of the week for a lot of them in the market,” he says. Everyone was touched or affected by it in some way.” He talked about how he knew a female manager from one of the restaurants close to the stall who had been stabbed. The attackers' rampage on London Bridge, left eight people dead and tens more were injured. Although hesitant, stall traders seem happy to talk about the effect of the attack on the market. But for businesses directly involved on the night, the emotions are too raw. The bars and restaurants that were open on the night of the attack politely refuse to talk. One restaurant manager says the staff are too upset. “Some of them were involved. It's too soon.” But inside the market, the pain and loss felt by many is not showing publicly. Punters continue to ogle croissants and Chelsea buns at a bakery stall. Eva Law returns to the market for the first time with her brother-in-law. The 35-year-old, who lives in Wapping, says: “We tried to come the week after and it was closed. I think it's great, the atmosphere feels exactly the same. “It's good to see the tourists have come back, I feel there's a similar amount of activity as before.” For others though, the atmosphere of the market - one of London's go-to tourist attractions - has changed. Alison Monroe, 25, has been working at Wyndham House Poultry for two years and says the market is far less busy than usual. She was drinking on Stoney Street before the attack happened. “If I had gone out for more drinks afterwards I probably would've been involved. “It's just because I'm not very organised and I had a holiday the next day so I had to quickly go home and pack. “Thank God for my poor organisation skills.” Hopefully people will think stuff them, we're going to stand all as one.” As the lunchtime rush continues traders are competing for customers. One man is thrusting forks of paella on passers-by, steam gently rises from the colourful rice. Idie Shashimal Idirisinghe smiles as he prepares salt beef sandwiches. The 39-year-old says: “We had a big problem here but everybody is smiling back, we've got a bit busier every week.” I'm always happy, I always have a smile on my face.” The smell of melted cheeses, cured meats and barbecued seafood becomes even more powerful as the rush continues. Jat Vithlani scoffs his fish and chips around the pillars of the market, looking on to Stoney Street. The 28-year-old, and 10 of his colleagues, make a weekly trip to the market from their offices in The Shard, which looms over the stalls. “I didn't think something like that would happen so local to where we work but it hasn't changed our mindset. “We haven't stopped coming here less frequently, it hasn't changed our daily routine going forward.” The defiant spirit of many Londoners can be seen throughout the market. Teresa Vanneck-Surplice chose to visit in the hope of using scenes from the market in a painting. As the 86-year-old eats an almond croissant, she describes how the market has changed since she visited 30 years ago. “There were no cakes, no young tourists, but with all the publicity I thought I'd come back.” When asked if she thought it was odd that the market could return to normality so quickly, she cackles: That's London darling, you're obviously not a Londoner to ask such a silly question.” By one o'clock the market is in full swing. Tourists can be seen scrolling through their Instagram picture filters, before sending an artistically-lit snap of a roast tomato focaccia. But for fishmonger Max Tucker, the market is still feeling the effects of the attack. “For me, there's [got to be] an energy in a market.” It's just starting to get the atmosphere back, it's sort of been a really dull place.” “We don't all love each other, but we are a whole when it comes to it. I think the day we reopened you got a sense of that.” Many traders are concerned about how quiet it is on Saturday. The tourist trap seems to be losing trade from out-of-towners, concerned about the recent events. Police officers can be seen patrolling the railway archways of the market, putting traders and punters at ease. Inspector Rob McElroy was on duty the day after the attack. He said that “stubbornness” got a lot of people through the most recent atrocities in London and Manchester. “Particularly within the Met, that Blitz spirit is still with us, nothing will stop us. “It's a world city, carry on as normal, ain't gonna get us down or stop us doing what we want to do.” Do whatever you want to do, they can't beat us, we'll carry on as normal.” Built with Shorthand"
Prepare yourself for a high-stakes Barclays battle,"John Varley is the first former bank chief executive to face criminal charges over conduct during the 2008 financial crisis The four defendants made their way through a thick press pack to take their seats - in the dock - at Westminster Magistrates court yesterday. It was a sight many thought they would never see. Senior bank executives inside a criminal court to face charges for their conduct during the great financial crisis. Former chief executive John Varley and bankers Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath sat, stony-faced, next to each other behind the glass panel as they gave their names, date of birth and addresses and listened as the charges against them were read by the clerk of the court. In 2008, at the height of the financial crisis - rather than taking a government bailout (and the strings attached to it) - Barclays managed to raise a total of Â£12bn from Middle East investors. This case centres around agreements struck to secure around half of that from Qatar state-owned entities. There are two offences alleged - the first is that Barclays failed to disclose Â£322m in fees that it paid to its new investors - all four are facing this charge of conspiracy to defraud by misrepresentation. The second is that Barclays lent the Qataris Â£2bn which helped to fund the Â£5.3bn investment in Barclays shares. John Varley, Roger Jenkins and Barclays PLC are facing this additional charge of unlawful financial assistance. All four men are expected to contest the charges. Barclays PLC has not indicated how it will plead. The possibility that the company may enter a different plea is important and ratchets up the stakes in this high profile case - and not just for the defendants. The four men could face jail terms of up to 10 years if found guilty. Barclays PLC, the holding company that owns Barclays Bank, could face hundreds of millions in fines for criminal behaviour and open itself to hundreds of millions more in civil suits. But for the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) this case coincides with a moment of existential anxiety. The Conservative manifesto contained plans to fold the SFO into the National Crime Agency and no-one in government seems clear whether the policy's omission from the Queen's Speech means it has had a reprieve or not. What is clear is that at the time he was deciding to bring these charges, the head of the SFO, David Green, would have assumed the government planned to call time on its 30-year existence. This could be the last hurrah of an organisation with a chequered history. If it is its goodbye, the SFO has picked a hell of swansong. It's the first time that any senior banking executives have faced criminal charges for their conduct in the great financial crisis nearly a decade ago. Some will say a case like this is scandalously overdue, but legal experts tell me that it also shows you just how difficult it is to bring a case like this and therefore just how high the risks are to the credibility of the SFO if it's unsuccessful. The biggest complication comes from charging the company - in this case Barclays PLC. Criminal proceedings against companies are rare. Not only because you have to prove that the knowledge of the offence went right to the very top - to the ""controlling minds"" of the company - but also, officials are reluctant to punish a company when doing so might result in damaging its prospects, the livelihoods of innocent workers and in the case of big companies, the economy itself. Public interest considerations like these are the reason the SFO dropped its long-running investigation into BAE Systems infamous Al-Yamamah contract to supply fighter jets to Saudi Arabia. Tens of thousands of UK jobs were at risk for two reasons. One, the investigation risked putting one of BAE's biggest customer's nose out of joint and second, criminal convictions for a company can debar it from bidding for lucrative contracts at home and abroad. This problem was one of the main reasons behind the adoption of a new mechanism called a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA). Under a DPA, the company admits wrongdoing, gets a whopping fine but is not criminally convicted - and so its business, the livelihoods of its workers and the wider economy are not damaged. Everyone is also spared a lengthy and costly trial that might end up without the SFO securing a conviction. The SFO has used DPAs to great effect with Rolls Royce (Â£671m fine) and Tesco (Â£129m). In fact, these successes led to many thinking the SFO had finally got its mojo back. Holding big companies to account without holding the economy to ransom. The SFO also reserves the right to feel the collars of the individuals involved at a later date. So why wasn't this lower risk approach used by the SFO in this case? Mr Green made it clear that DPAs are only for companies who fully co-operate with investigators. Barclays withheld tens of thousands of documents citing legal privilege - behaviour Mr Green described as leading the SFO ""a merry dance"". Barclays points out that it's unreasonable to punish the bank for exerting legal rights. Nevertheless, a DPA was never put on the table. The SFO has made a concession to the economic importance of Barclays to the UK. It has charged the holding company (Barclays PLC) rather than the operating company, Barclays Bank. This means the ability of this important transatlantic bank to operate in its key markets should not be affected - whatever the outcome. Many feel that the SFO, after years of mixed results, was just getting into its stride when plans for its demise were hatched and published in the Tory manifesto. Perhaps that contributed to the SFO's decision to go out in a blaze of glory of pressing for criminal convictions of both a bank and its senior management. Nearly a decade on from a financial crisis and this is the first time any former bank chief executive anywhere in the world has faced criminal charges for alleged conduct during the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. A society that paid the price of a long recession which scars the economy to this day feels short-changed by that and one insider close to the investigation described SFO chief Mr Green as being on ""a crusade"" to acknowledge that frustration. Whether there is any truth in that or not, one thing seems clear. Taking this route is a lot riskier for the SFO than offering a DPA. Philip Marshall QC told the BBC that it is very difficult to prove that executive actions were dishonest rather than mistaken and other legal sources have told me that this case could last two years or more. Also, what happens if the company pleads guilty while the human defendants plead not guilty? What kind of reporting restrictions might be necessary given a public company's duty to inform its shareholders of information that could materially affect the value of the company. This is complicated territory. Let's not forget one more thing. A LOT of bad stuff happened before, during and after the crisis. Reckless lending, irresponsible borrowing, lax regulation, market rigging, financially abusing customers - you can add your own items to this list. Former City Minister Lord (Paul) Myners has said that the Barclays top brass wanted nothing to do with government money - not least because of the intrusion that would mean into matters like pay (just ask bankers at RBS and Lloyds). Also markets lose their integrity and participants all lose if some break the law - as is alleged here. But how many people, I wonder, would put a bank - trying to raise money to prevent a taxpayer funded bailout - in the ninth circle of Hades. The SFO is taking a big risk it could have avoided by exacting a whopping fine through a DPA. The appearance of these executives inside a criminal court may slake the public's thirst for overdue personal accountability. So far, they have only spent an hour in court. The weeks, months and possibly years to come will determine if the SFO picked the right battle here.

Ascension: The increasingly unreachable island,"This video can not be played Caroline Yon says this runway is so old and fragile planes can't land Ascension Island, home to around 800 people, is even more cut off than it used to be after weekly flights linking the island to the UK were stopped - due to a dodgy runway and the wrong kind of RAF aircraft. The British overseas territory is the tip of an old volcano in the Atlantic Ocean, mid-way between Africa and Brazil. It's so remote, that when the Portuguese discovered it on Ascension Day in 1501, they didn't even bother colonising it. ""Half of the island looks like the surface of the moon, the other half looks like Mars, but in a good way,"" says Caroline Yon, station manager for the European Space Agency tracking station on Ascension. ""But I wouldn't want to put anyone off. We do have gorgeous white sandy beaches, and pristine clear blue seas absolutely jam-packed with marine life - it's a very unique place."" View from Green Mountain across volcanic cinder cones The island, which covers around 45 square miles just south of the equator, is formed by around 40 volcanic peaks. It is rough and rugged - barren in parts - but at its heart has a lush peak known as Green Mountain, home to rare bird colonies which are the result of a unique botanical experiment led by Charles Darwin. ""We have the second largest turtle colony in the Atlantic Ocean,"" says Johnny Hobson, the island's dentist who has lived on the island for 31 years. ""Outside our house at the moment there are baby turtles erupting on a beautiful golden beach,"" he says. ""Everyone's finding it hard to get to and from Ascension at the moment. ""Currently the only real way off for most of us is an eight or nine day journey by sea to Cape Town and to fly back to the UK that way - at a cost of Â£3000-4000 for the round trip and the ship, the RMS St Helena, only passes by every three weeks."" This video can not be played Residents Jacqui Ellick and Johnny Hobson say the island's economy could be potentially destroyed over the runway closure Johnny, who also owns a hotel and car hire business, tells me visitors to the island have increased steadily over the past few years. Some were going to St Helena, the nearest landmass some 700 km to the southeast, while others included deep sea fishermen, conservationists and people arriving to see the turtles. ""Last year we had five or six thousand visitor nights,"" he says. But with the end of the weekly flights all that has changed and businesses are quickly collapsing. The runway, designed as an emergency landing strip for the Space Shuttle, is maintained by the US military. It used to be one of the longest in the world but now badly needs maintenance, and while there's a plan to have the tarmac repaired by 2020, the Airbus A330 Voyager aircraft the RAF uses to land on the island is no longer suitable. The Ministry of Defence says it is committed to running an air bridge between the UK and the Falkland Islands, but not necessarily to Ascension. The plane was very convenient as it stopped off on the island to refuel, but now it lands on Cape Verde, and the residents have been left somewhat stranded. Ascension Island was the major staging post in the Falklands War in 1982 ""Well basically it was the hub, so all the flights came here before they went on to the Falklands - the planes, the ships came here,"" said Jacqui Ellick whose husband's job brought them to the island 22 years ago. She's an elected island councillor, volunteers for the local newspaper and manages the interns who come each year to monitor the turtles. ""There are other planes that can land here, just not the A330. At the moment the American planes still land here and the MoD have a C17 once a month for their own people, but for the rest of us there is no way off except for the ship."" ""It's such a big question. I don't think there's anyone in the foreign office or the government with the time and inclination to sit down and sort it out,"" says Caroline Yon. ""But it would be a shame if the island couldn't continue."" A UK government spokeswoman said: ""We know that the rerouting of the South Atlantic air bridge flights has caused difficulties for those on Ascension Island and we are working closely with relevant parties to find and agree alternative access arrangements as quickly as possible.""

Public sector morale at 'critical levels',"Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has said the1% pay cap on public sector workers will not be lifted. The announcement comes despite several cabinet ministers, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, havingcalled on Downing Street to rethink its position on the 1% cap on public sector pay. The limit on pay rises affects dentists, nurses, doctors, police and military, as well as those that work for local government bodies. The majority of public sector workers who contacted BBC News to voice their opinions wished to retain their anonymity, fearing that disclosure would hinder the relationship with their employers. Steve had been a police officer for over 20 years and commented that he and his colleagues are losing faith in the government. ""I can say on good authority that the lack of staff and low morale is at critical levels,"" he explains. ""More staff are off sick with stress and every day we just want to get through the shift. ""Pay and pensions have been decimated and people are looking to leave in their droves."" You may also like: 'I'm swapping nursing for botox' 'It's not like I'll be wearing make-up anytime soon' Camden flats: Evacuated family still 'has nowhere to go' The pay cap also affects local council staff like Adam, from Cambridgeshire, who works for a District Council. ""My pay has effectively stayed the same for over six years. ""I haven't worked for the public sector for that long so my pension is of limited benefit, but better than nothing. ""I will have to work till I'm at least 69-years-of-age to pay off my mortgage."" Another person frustrated with the pay cap is Bianca, a nurse working in the paediatric intensive care unit of a hospital. ""It's important to emphasise that I did not go into nursing for the money, but I did not go in to nursing to be unappreciated and underpaid either,"" she says. ""Giving up valuable time with my family and friends for Â£23,500 a year and experiencing what I can only describe as chronic fatigue, starts to seem like too big of a sacrifice. ""I have watched children die and I have held their parents' hands through it. I have held a child's airway open and given them breaths when they were suddenly unable to breathe themselves. ""The sacrifices that we as nurses make for minimal pay and appreciation are demoralising. It will pain me to leave but ultimately I believe it will be better for my better mental health. The limit on pay rises also affects prison officers such as Nick who has worked in the industry for over 27 years. ""My pay has been frozen since 2010 with the exception of a one-off consolidated payment of Â£300 in 2014! ""The Prison Service has once again submitted a recommendation of 1% to the Prison Service Pay Review Body for staff on the new 'Fair and Sustainable' conditions. ""I will not sign up to the recommendation as it would be a pay cut as well as reducing my pensionable pay.""

Boy's confinement breached human rights,"Feltham houses young male offenders aged between 15 and 18 A 16-year-old boy's human rights were breached by his being kept in solitary confinement for 23-and-a-half hours a day, a judge has ruled. The High Court said the boy, who is referred to as AB, was unlawfully denied access to education and the ability to mix with other inmates. But it rejected claims his treatment at Feltham Young Offenders Institution was ""inhuman and degrading"". The Ministry of Justice said it would ""carefully"" consider the findings. The MoJ was contesting the legal challenge by AB,who has ""significant"" mental health problems. He was detained in December and is due to be released in later this month. Feltham, in south-west London, provides specialist custodial places for boys aged 15-18. On Tuesday, the judge ruled that AB's Article 8 rights - the right to private and family life - were breached, but Mr Justice Ouseley rejected claims his treatment amounted to a breach of the human rights laws which prohibit torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Inside Feltham: 'I saw people's heads stamped on' The Howard League for Penal Reform, which took forward the case on AB's behalf, said the court had ""declared this boy's isolation for certain periods and the denial of adequate education unlawful because it was against prison rules"". But chief executive Frances Crook said the group would appeal against the ""disappointing"" part of the judgement. Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the 16-year-old's confinement was ""simply the wrong thing to do"". She said: ""To lock up a young child with special educational needs for over 23 hours a day, with little to no education or exercise, is an attack on their rights. ""Isolation of this kind has been widely criticised by experts in the field, both in the UK and internationally."" The MoJ, however, insisted that ""proportionate and justified segregation"" was essential to managing inmates if they pose a risk to staff and other prisoners, and it was pleased the judge had found in its favour on that point. The spokesperson added: ""The safety and welfare of young people held in custody is our highest priority."" The court was told by a QC for the Justice Secretary that the boy had a history of assaulting prison staff and making ""racist taunts"", and ""poses a very real risk to the good order or discipline"" at Feltham. During a recent inspection, separate to the case, Feltham was found to run an""ineffective"" regime for managing bad behaviour. The HM Inspectorate of Prisons said about 40% of boys were locked up during the school day while 30% were allowed out of their cells for only two hours each day. Nevertheless, inspectors praised staff for their ""impressive"" healthcare and mental health provisions.

Three hospitals fail fire safety checks,"Three hospitals in England have failed fire safety checks ordered in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire. Buildings at London's King's College Hospital, Sheffield's children's hospital and the North Middlesex Trust have been found to have combustible cladding. Those three trusts along with another 16 have also introduced 24-hour fire warden patrols to improve safety. Checks on cladding used at five sites have yet to be finished. Six questions for the investigation Where have cladding tests failed? Why do England's high-rises keep failing fire tests? Guide to what happened? Of the three that failed, one - the building at King's College - is an office block and does not house patients. The other two sites have failed on buildings that house patients, but do not keep them in overnight. Steps are under way at all three to improve safety. But a spokesman for NHS Improvement, which regulates hospitals, said there would be ""no disruption to patient services"" while changes were being made. The checks at hospitals were ordered following the Grenfell Tower fire The urgent checks were ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt following the Grenfell Tower fire. A total of 38 trusts were identified last week as being of highest risk as they were already known to have been struggling with basic fire standards or had high-rise buildings that had cladding. The review has now found the cladding at 11 sites passed the checks, while the other 19 sites which flagged up potential fire safety issues have been told they do not need to take further action. King's College Hospital has already removed the cladding from its office building as a ""precautionary measure"", while steps are being made at the other two sites to remove it. In Scotland, health boards have confirmed combustible cladding has not been used on any buildings. PM calls for tower cladding investigation Why do high-rises keep failing fire tests?

Reality Check: The Grenfell re-housing promise,"The claim:Every person made homeless by the Grenfell fire will receive an offer of accommodation by Wednesday, 5 July. Reality Check verdict:Council officials say offers of temporary accommodation have been made to 139 of 158 households and the remaining 19 households did not want any contact with the council at this time. But only nine of these offers have so far been accepted. Days after the tragedy, Theresa May said she had ""fixed a deadline of three weeks for everybody affected to be found a home nearby."" On 22nd June, she said, ""all those who have lost their homes have been offered emergency hotel accommodation; and all will be offered rehousing within 3 weeks."" Since then the Communities Secretary, Sajid Javid, has been referring to temporary homes. On Monday, Mr Javid said that theprime minister's promise,externalwould be honoured and that the 158 households who lost their homes would be offered ""temporary accommodation"" by Wednesday 5 July. At this stage, families are being offered temporary homes rather than hotel rooms to stay in, until a genuinely permanent home is found for them. The Grenfell Fire Response Team, made up of local and central government, the Red Cross, the Metropolitan Police and the London Fire Brigade, have now offered accommodation to 139 Grenfell households who lost their homes as a result of the fire. Nineteen households did not want to be contacted by the council at this time, family liaison officers told the response team. Some of them are currently out of the country. This means the team will have met the three-week target of making an offer of accommodation to those affected. However, only nine households have accepted the offer so far. At the moment, the majority of survivors are living in hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation. We do not yet know exactly why the other 130 households have not accepted the accommodation offered to them. But the leader of the Kensington and Chelsea Labour group, Robert Atkinson, said traumatised people were being pushed to make decisions too soon because of Theresa May's promise. He said some families currently staying in hotels and temporary housing were not accepting offers of intermediate accommodation because they did not want to keep moving and preferred to wait for a permanent offer. One tenant from the tenth floor of Grenfell Tower, who only gave his name as Antonio, is among those who turned down the offer of temporary accommodation. ""We want to move to a permanent accommodation so we can remake it and then we can call it home,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. A spokesperson for the response team said people were still considering the offers but may be hesitating for a number of reasons including distance to children's schools and suitability for elderly or disabled residents. Some survivors wanted to remain in the borough, others wanted to be placed as far away as possible, while others still, understandably traumatised, have been reportedly turning down offers of accommodation in tower blocks, or in sight of Grenfell Tower. The offered accommodation is either within the borough of Kensington and Chelsea or as close as possible within neighbouring boroughs, according to the response team. If an offer of accommodation is turned down, family liaison officers will work with residents to find a suitable alternative. At the moment, it appears this process will continue until survivors are provided with accommodation with which they are happy.

The 'Babypod' carrier that comes with an F1 pedigree,"This video can not be played The baby carrier made from Formula 1 technology Formula 1 technology has had an impact in many other sectors, from aeronautics to cycling, public transport to data analytics, but now Williams has come up with a hi-tech carrier for critically ill new-born babies. Every year the Williams Formula 1 team spends more than Â£100m ($130m; 114m euros) trying to make two cars go round a racing track as fast as possible. Ignore the adrenaline-fuelled appeal of wheel-to-wheel racing, and it might all seem rather pointless. Yet the technology developed in the white heat of competition can turn up in some surprising places. The materials and techniques used to build Williams' F1 cars, for example, are now being used to make an altogether different type of transport - for new-born babies. The Babypod 20, as it is known, is a sleek, lightweight box with a sliding transparent lid and a heavily padded interior. It is designed for transporting infants who are critically ill, whether by car, ambulance or helicopter. It looks pretty basic, but is the result of an intensive development process. The material used in the design is carbon fibre, the same remarkably strong material used in F1 cars. The ""Babypod"" is designed to be light, strong and easily accessible The pod is being built by Williams Advanced Engineering, a sister business to the Formula 1 team, based at the same UK site in Grove, Oxfordshire. The firm has been working on the new design alongside Advanced Healthcare Technology (AHT), a company that has been building transport systems for babies for a number of years. Carrying new-born babies from place to place is not easy. They need to be kept at a constant temperature and protected from vibration and noise, while being monitored closely by medical staff. In the past, incubators were used. But these are heavy, cumbersome devices, that require an external electricity supply and often dedicated vehicles to carry them as well. The Babypod was initially developed by AHT as a lightweight and more practical alternative. Williams was then called in to develop a new, more advanced design. The Williams Babypod 20 infant carrier (foreground) owes at lot to F1 car tech The result is a device that weighs just 9.1kg (20lb) - about the same as three bricks - takes up relatively little space, and that can withstand an impact of up to 20G (in case the ambulance carrying it is involved in an accident, for example). To begin with, it is being used by the Children's Acute Transport Service (CATS) of Great Ormond Street  Hospital in London, though the plan is to market it much more widely. CATS operational manager Eithne Polke says the service is delighted with the new pod, which costs Â£5,000 per unit. Fast and effective transportation can save lives in emergency situations, she says, and the pod ""allows for greater flexibility and manoeuvrability when moving critically ill infants "".

Much of what it does is still linked to the automotive sector. For example, it helped design a hybrid supercar for Jaguar, as well as an electric version of Aston Martin's Rapide sportscar - known as the RapidE. But it has also branched out into other areas - designing energy storage systems for solar power projects, for example. Tucked away in a corridor of the factory is what looks like a fairly normal supermarket fridge - except that the edge of each shelf, where you'd normally see a price tag, is a bit broader and curvier than normal. Williams spends more than Â£100m a year trying to make its cars as fast as possible It is, in fact, an aerofoil, designed to channel cold air down the front of the fridge, rather than allowing it to spill out into the supermarket aisle. This makes the fridge more efficient, cheaper to run, and keeps customers warmer. It may be a world away from Formula 1 - but it uses the same expertise in aerodynamics. According to Clare Williams, deputy principal of the F1 team, there's plenty of room for F1 know-how to be exploited in this way. ""Lightweight materials, composites, aerodynamicsâ¦ all of these technologies can be so easily applied to other industries, other sectors, other project and products,"" she says, ""in order invariably to make them better, but most importantly - sometimes safer. ""And that's the case with the Babypod."" Rival F1 team McLaren also has its own engineering and design spin-off - McLaren Applied Technologies - which has contributed its expertise to a diverse range of companies, from cycle-maker Specialized, to deep-sea drilling firm Ecofisk. Fundamentally though, these applied engineering businesses have one overriding purpose: to generate much-needed money for the F1 team. Williams teamed up with Jaguar to create the C-X75 hybrid supercar So far, Williams Advanced Engineering has been moderately successful. It contributed Â£37m to the group's revenues last year, out of a total of Â£167m. And profit - before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation - was Â£4.2m. In a sport which guzzles cash as fast as the cars involved use fuel, that may not seem like a great deal. But as Williams struggles to compete with much richer teams like Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull, it needs every penny. ""The F1 team is still at the heart of what we do"", says Ms Williams. ""Racing is in our DNA. But we have branched out and diversified - and having that revenue stream from Advanced Engineering will be, one day, hugely important for us."" And if the Babypod is a success, in future there may be a fair few people walking around who owe their lives to technology developed in Formula 1.

Can Mexico save its journalists?,"More than 100 journalists have been killed in Mexico since 2000, rights groups say One was killed while resting in a hammock at a carwash. A second was dragged from his car and shot dead near the newspaper he had co-founded. When another was killed in front of her son, the criminals left a note: ""For your long tongue"". Journalists are being murdered in Mexico and this is nothing new. This is one of the most dangerous countries for reporters, rights groups say, and more die here than in any other nation at peace. But even for a place so used to drugs-related violence and organised crime, the recent bloodshed has been shocking. Seven journalists have been killed in the country so far this year, most shot by gunmen in broad daylight. Yet virtually all cases of attacks on the press end up unsolved and, in many, corrupt officials are suspected of partnering with criminals. As the killings mount, is there anything that Mexico can do to save its journalists? Miroslava Breach used to say that corrupt politicians were more dangerous than drug traffickers. For almost 30 years, she investigated cases in which authorities and criminals appeared to work hand in hand in her native state of Chihuahua, in northern Mexico. Last year, Miros, as friends called her,reported,externalfor the national newspaper La Jornada on the alleged links between organised crime and candidates standing in the local elections in several towns in western Chihuahua - some located on lucrative drug-trafficking routes. For her enemies, she had crossed a line. Drug-related violence has claimed the lives of thousands of people in Mexico ""Sister, now I'm really scared,"" her sister Rosy recalled a tearful Breach saying, as threats had increased and regularly mentioned her children. Breach alerted the authorities but carried on, not knowing what else to do. ""She said that against a network of evil there was nothing that could be done,"" Rosy said. Then last March, as Breach left home in the morning to take her 14-year-old son to school,gunmen shot her eight times. They left a note, reportedly carrying the initials of one of the bandits she had denounced and a message: ""Por lengua larga,"" meaning for your long tongue. This video can not be played ""Journalists don't trust authorities"" Since 2000, at least 106 journalists have been killed across Mexico, according to rights group Article 19. Exact numbers are hard to come by as investigations often get nowhere and different studies apply different criteria in counting the dead. Last year alone, there were 11 deaths, the group said, a record. Up until now, most of those killed worked for small, poorly resourced local publications. So when Breach, a reporter for a national newspaper, was killed, it resonated throughout the country, her smiling photo becoming one of the many symbols of this tragedy. For Oscar MurguÃ­a, editor of Norte newspaper in the northern city of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, which published Breach's column, it was too much. His reaction wasto shut the paper,after 27 years. Its last headline was a single sentence: ""Â¡AdiÃ³s!"". ""It's a tragedy,"" Mr MurguÃ­a told the BBC. ""It's an attack on our society, not only on journalists... There's no respect for the work of journalists. I prefer to have a journalist without a job than without life."" Journalists hold placards demanding ""Justice"": activists say that impunity fuels the violence against the media in Mexico In 2010, pressure from campaigners led to the creation of a special office of the federal prosecutor for crimes against freedom of expression, known as the Feadle, which investigates attacks on journalists. But the authorities have often ruled that the victims themselves are not journalists or that the incidents have no connection to their work, according to critics. Like last month. When the charred remains of Salvador Adame, the head of a TV station in the western state of MichoacÃ¡n, were found, state prosecutors said that the case had to do with personal disputes, possibly a love affair, angering relatives and campaigners. The office rejected numerous requests for comment. Several Mexican cities are among the most violent in world, largely due to the drug war The deaths continued. Then, in 2012 the federal government set up a specific protection mechanism for journalists and human rights defenders under threat. More than 600 peoplehave been helped,externalby the programme, which can relocate professionals and their families, give them police protection and a panic button, which sends a distress signal to officials via cell phone networks. Welcomed at first, many now say that very little has really worked. The flaws were many,a report in 2015,externalsaid. They went from the unreliability of the emergency devices in areas where mobile coverage was poor, to complaints of calls to hotlines going unanswered. The government disputed this, saying in a statement to the BBC that ""achievements"" have translated into ""tangible benefits"" for those assisted. But last year, for the first time, a reporter under protection was killed - in front of his own house. Award-winning journalist Javier Valdez was Breach's colleague at La Jornada, as a correspondent in the western Sinaloa state, home to the powerful cartel once led by JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n. ""Let them kill us all, if that is the death sentence for reporting this hell,"" was Valdez's reaction to her murder. Violence in Sinaloa state spiked after the extradition of ""El Chapo"" His was another life devoted to exposing the workings of bandits. Three decades of reporting on crime and access to drug lords had made him a star reporter, beloved by colleagues, in Mexico and further afield, who admired his clarity and good humour. It was a work not without risks. The offices of RÃ­o Doce, the independent weekly newspaper he co-founded in the capital CuliacÃ¡n, were attacked in 2009 after it published a series on drug trafficking. ""They wanted to scare us, make us afraid so we would stop publishing,""Valdez told,externalthe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) in 2011, when he was given an International Press Freedom Award. Still, he vowed to carry on. ""To die,"" he said, ""would be to stop writing."" Javier Valdez - seen here in trademark Panama hat - was threatened for months Violence in Sinaloa spiked after El Chapo was extradited to the United States, in January. Valdez attributed this to a vacuum of power at the top of the group. In February, RÃ­o Doce publishedan interview,externalwith an envoy of ""El Licenciado"", who was seen as El Chapo's possible successor. Armed men bought every issue, activists said, and Valdez saw it as an attempt to intimidate him. (El Licenciado was arrested in May.) What came next were months of threats. Then in May, Valdez, wearing his trademark Panama hat, was dragged from his car by criminals at midday, on a busy street near the RÃ­o Doce offices.They shot 12 times,killing him on the spot. No other murdered journalist had as high profile as him. Many saw it as a message: if he can be killed, anyone can. ""Of course we knew the risks,"" said Ismael Bojorquez, a long-time friend who co-founded RÃ­o Doce with Valdez. ""[But] every time we felt under threat, we never thought of asking for the protection of the mechanism."" ""The [Feadle] doesn't have resources or teams to investigate. Our system of protection of journalists doesn't work... The government's policies to protect us are a failure."" The result is that journalism itself has become a victim. ""Investigative journalism in many places in Mexico is just impossible to be exercised,"" said Carlos Luria, CPJ's senior programme co-ordinator for the Americas. ""There are no guarantees, no condition, no protection, there is an absence of the state. This is decimating journalism in Mexico."" Most of the reporters killed covered crime and corruption for local publications in violent states In almost all cases, campaigners say, the criminals are never identified, found or tried. ""The level of impunity is 99.75%,"" said Ana Cristina Ruelas, Article 19's director for Mexico and Central America. Corruption is rife in Mexico, and rogue police and politicians were the suspects in more than half of the incidents against the media in the last six years, she said. And most cases were never looked into. ""The state doesn't investigate itself. There is a direct link between the level of impunity and corruption,"" Ms Ruelas said. ""This impunity allows the aggressors to continue attacking the press in broad daylight."" At the National Palace in May, reporters interrupted President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto's minute of silence in memory of the journalists killed, shouting: ""Justice, no more speeches"". Valdez's death added to the pressure on Mr Nieto to address the issue. He said he shared the ""indignation"" and vowed to ""combat the impunity"", making promises to boost the protection of journalists and the special prosecutor's office. Activists say 93% of all homicides in Mexico are unsolved But many hold little hope for real change. Blanche Petrich helped found La Jornada in 1984, and knew both Breach (""the number one"") and Valdez (""one of a kind""). With two of its main stars gone, the paper is now a newsroom in mourning. ""I don't have any hope,"" she said. ""It's a myth that the cartels are killing the journalists, it's the state. I don't have any trust in Mr Nieto. He's been very indifferent to the problem."" ""Nothing works if the assassins are free and those behind the killings are never brought to justice. With this reality, it's very difficult for any journalist to have any trust that those measures are not a simple formality."" ""No to silence"": journalists have held protests demanding the government to investigate the killings Distrust grew even further last month, afterthe New York Timesaccused the Mexican government of spying on several top journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders by hacking their phones with spyware meant to be used against criminals and terrorists - a claim the Mexican presidency denied. ""It's very hard to connect the words of the presidency with actions because until now we haven't found a clear reflection of these words in actions that provide results,"" said Ms Ruelas, from Article 19. Reporters, however, say the latest killings prove that their work is more urgent than ever: ""No to silence"". All pictures copyrighted.

N Korea hails 'long-range' missile test,"This video can not be played North Korean state TV announces ""successful"" missile test North Korea says it has successfully tested its first ""intercontinental ballistic missile"" (ICBM). A state television announcement said the missile, which landed in the Sea of Japan on Tuesday, could hit targets anywhere in the world. But the US and Russia said the missile had a medium range and presented no threat to either country. North Korea has increased the frequency of its missile tests, in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council. China and Russia  called on Pyongyang to freeze its missile and nuclear activities. The announcement on North Korea state television said the Hwasong-14 missile test was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un. It said the projectile had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? What can the outside world do? How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? North Korea, it said, was now ""a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world"". North Korean state TV released photos of the purported ICBM test launch It would enable the country to ""put an end to the US nuclear war threat and blackmail"" and defend the Korean peninsula, it said. While Pyongyang appears to have made progress, experts believe North Korea does not have the capability to accurately hit a target with an ICBM, or miniaturise a nuclear warhead that can fit onto such a missile. Other nuclear powers have also cast doubt on North Korea's assessment, with Russia saying the missile only reached an altitude of 535km and flew about 510km. A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead The minimum range is 5,500km (3,400 miles), although most fly about 10,000km or more Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs: the KN-08, with a range of 11,500km, and the KN-14, with a range of 10,000km, but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM. It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14 The big question is what range it has, says the BBC's Steven Evans in Seoul. Could it hit the United States? David Wright, a physicist with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists,says that if the reports are correct, this missile could,external""reach a maximum range of roughly 6,700km on a standard trajectory"". That range would allow it to reach Alaska, but not the large islands of Hawaii or the other 48 US states, he says. It is not just a missile that North Korea would need, our correspondent adds. It must also have the ability to protect a warhead as it re-enters the atmosphere, and it is not clear if North Korea can do that. Once again North Korea has defied the odds and thumbed its nose at the world in a single missile launch. With the test of the Hwasong-14, it has shown that it can likely reach intercontinental ballistic missile ranges including putting Alaska at risk. Kim Jong-un has long expressed his desire for such a test, and to have it on the 4 July holiday in the US is just the icing on his very large cake. Despite this technical achievement, however, it is likely many outside North Korea will continue to be sceptical of North Korea's missile. They will ask for proof of working guidance, re-entry vehicle, and even a nuclear warhead. From a technical perspective, though, their engines have demonstrated ICBM ranges, and this would be the first of several paths North Korea has to an ICBM with even greater range. North Korea's missile programme South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has called on the UN Security Council to take steps against North Korea. Japan described ""repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable"" and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country would ""unite strongly"" with the US and South Korea to put pressure on Pyongyang. Russia and China said the launch was ""unacceptable"". Chinese President Xi Jinping is in Moscow, where he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two leaders urged Pyongyang to suspend all its tests. They also asked the US and South Korea to not hold joint military exercises. US President Donald Trump also responded swiftly on Tuesday. On his Twitter account,externalhe made apparent reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying: ""Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?"" ""Hard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!"" North Korean state TV said the launch was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un President Trump has repeatedly called on China, Pyongyang's closest economic ally, to pressure North Korea to end its nuclear and missile programmes. On the prospect of North Korea being able to strike the US, he tweeted in January: ""It won't happen"". However experts say it might - within five years or less. Beijing called for ""restraint"" following the latest test on Tuesday. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China was opposed to North Korea going against clear UN Security Council resolutions on its missile launches. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK ""stood alongside the US and our allies to confront the threat North Korea poses to international security"".

Call for Grenfell inquiry chairman to quit,"This video can not be played Emma Dent Coad tells BBC's Today a ""technocrat"" is not what's needed The judge heading the Grenfell Tower inquiry should stand down because those affected need ""somebody we can trust"",  the local MP for Kensington has said. Labour's Emma Dent Coad said Sir Martin Moore-Bick was ""a technocrat"" who lacked ""credibility"" with victims. On Monday, lawyers representing some of the familiescalled for him to quit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Sir Martin should ""listen to residents"", but minister David Lidington said he had ""complete confidence"" in him. The Tory MP and Lord Chancellor said Sir Martin would lead the inquiry ""with impartiality and a determination to get to the truth and see justice done"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan warned the retired Court of Appeal judge must urgently improve relations with local residents. The fire on 14 June is thought to have killed at least 80 people, although police say the final toll will not be known until at least the end of the year. Meanwhile, official figures from the Grenfell Response Team show 139 offers of accommodation have been made to families left homeless, but just nine have been accepted. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the prime minister promised that 158 families would be offered a good quality temporary home within three weeks - a target the response team said has now been met. The remaining 19 families do not want to be contacted, or are out of the country, it added. This video can not be played Grenfell Tower survivor Antonio is living in a hotel and has turned down two flats. One tenant from the 10th floor of Grenfell Tower, who only gave his name as Antonio, is among those who turned down the offer of temporary accommodation.

Three hospitals fail fire safety checks Grenfell Tower inquiry 'will be broad' Will a public inquiry deliver answers? What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Speaking after his appointment as chairman of the inquiry, Sir Martin said heunderstood the ""desire of local people for justice""following the disaster, but warned he was ""doubtful"" the process would be as wide-ranging as some residents hoped. On Monday, however, a source told the BBC he was prepared to be ""open-minded"" in his ""very broad"" inquiry. Although the remit will be decided by the prime minister, the source said he would consider in detail whether the nature of the building regulations contributed to the fire. Despite that attempted reassurance, Ms Dent Coad said she had spoken to hundreds of people affected by the fire who were unhappy with his appointment. ""We need somebody who can do the detail but we need somebody who can actually understand human beings as well and what they've been through..."" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I don't think he should do it. I don't think there will be any credibility. ""Some people are saying they are not going to co-operate with it, so it's not going to work."" Her call for Sir Martin to stand down has been backed by shadow fire services minister Chris Williamson. ""I think it's important that we listen to the survivors... local people are saying they don't have faith in him,"" he told BBC Radio Derby. He said he agreed with shadow chancellor John McDonnell's comment that the victims were ""murdered by political decisions"". ""If you look at decisions taken over the last three or four decades, it's all about unbridled market economics - essentially deregulation - using public services as a cash-cow and cutting corners,"" he said. On Sunday, Labour MPDavid Lammy said a ""white, upper-middle class man"",externalwho had ""never"" visited a tower block housing estate should not have been appointed. Grenfell residents have also questioned whether Sir Martin's background in commercial law is appropriate. And they have been angered by his decision to allow Kensington and Chelsea Council - which was criticised for its slow and ineffective response to the disaster - to contribute to the inquiry. Elsewhere, Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy and Westminster coroner Fiona Wilcox - who will lead will the inquests of the victims of the fire - will hold a private meeting with relatives later. Sir Martin visited the scene of the tragedy last week and spoke to residents and the police Educated at Christ's College, Cambridge Specialised in commercial law, involving maritime and land transport disputes Spent more than 20 years as a judge of the Commercial Court and Court of Appeal Retired in 2016 In November 2014, he ruled Westminster City Council could rehouse a single mother-of-five more than 50 miles away, in Milton Keynes.

Juncker calls EU parliament 'ridiculous',"This video can not be played Juncker: I will never again attend a meeting of this kind European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has launched a bitter attack on members of the European Parliament for failing to show up. Standing up in almost empty chamber in Strasbourg, he denounced the body as ""ridiculous, totally ridiculous"". Estimating the number of MEPs present at about 30, he said it proved that the parliament was ""not serious"". Parliament President Antonio Tajani reacted furiously, accusing him of a lack of respect. ""You can criticise the Parliament, but it's not the Commission's job to control the parliament, it's the Parliament that has to control the Commission,"" he said. But the clash continued. Mr Juncker, who is in charge of the EU's executive body, angrily rebuked MEPs for failing to attend the session reviewing the six-month presidency of Malta, the bloc's smallest member state. It was one of the most acrimonious public rows between top EU officials in recent years. A Parliament spokesman said later that the two men had met and Mr Juncker had expressed regret for the words he had chosen. The vast majority of MEPs were absent from the morning debate Rows of empty seats - Adam Fleming in Strasbourg writes: It is rare for the head of one European institution to take such a public swipe at the legitimacy of another. I counted fewer than 100 people in the chamber this morning, and that included the officials accompanying Mr Juncker and the Maltese prime minister. ""People can't be bothered to turn up,"" a British MEP told me. ""Some have started their seven weeks of paid holiday already."" Others point out that much of the work in this place is done in low-profile committees, and that the building has become busier throughout the day. Nevertheless, parliamentary authorities will be unhappy they have been criticised so publicly by such a high profile figure as Mr Juncker. Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat looked on with a broad grin as the argument unfolded. The debate was due to focus primarily on the EU's struggle to relocate 160,000 refugees from Italy and Greece. ""There are only a few members in the plenary to control the commission.

English losing importance in EU - Juncker 'I don't own a smartphone' - EU's Juncker EU needs stronger defence arm - Juncker Ignoring a further objection by the Parliament president to his choice of language, Mr Juncker told the few MEPs in the chamber: ""I will never again attend a meeting of this kind."" Antonio Tajani (R) took over as president of the Parliament in January Mr Juncker complained that if Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel or French President Emmanuel Macron had been in the chamber, it would have been full.

Subway plans expansion in High Street war,"Subway's first new look store opened in Manchester in March Sandwich chain Subway is planning to open another 500 stores by 2020 as it seeks to cement its place as the UK's largest High Street fast food chain. That would bring its total to 3,000 across the UK and Ireland - almost double that of closest rival Greggs, which has 1,698 outlets. Subway said growing customer demand for its sandwiches had driven the decision. The firm is also in the process of overhauling its stores with a revamped menu and a new look for the shops. It said its expansion plans would create 5,000 new jobs. Subway's UK boss Peter Dowding also said it had taken steps to ensure staff were paid the minimum wage. Seven Subway franchisees were found by HMRC to be failing to pay staff the minimum wage, he said. Mr Dowding told the BBC: ""They are contracted to abide by the laws of the land, and if not, then there are things in their contract that we can implement, and we can take action."" Their franchises were not taken away from them, he added, declining to say what sanctions were imposed. A six-inch Subway sandwich is one of your five a day, according to its boss The firmovertook McDonald'sas the world's largest restaurant chain more than six years ago, but Mr Dowding said the fast food giant was not its only competitor. ""It's everyone. It's a very competitive world out there,"" he said. The US company is about to open its 2,500th store in the UK and Ireland Those outlets employ 18,500 people and have sales of Â£515m They are run by about 900 franchisees, which are often local businessmen and women The sandwich chain is known for its late opening hours. UK boss Peter Dowding said outlets must be open at least 98 hours a week The chain's main menu is still ""subs"" - long, US-style baguette-like sandwiches made with soft bread - but it also now offers salads. Mr Dowding said it was also looking at overhauling its breakfast and evening menus. ""We already have a breakfast menu, but it's a part of the day we need to work on,"" he said. The firm's UK boss said the chain's most popular sandwiches varied according to location, but were typically the Italian BMT sandwich containing salami, pepperoni and ham, the meatball marinara and the tuna sandwich. He said it was ""a misconception"" that fast food was unhealthy, noting that six of the nine sandwiches on its core menu contained under 400 calories. One of its six-inch subs provides customers with one of their five-a-day for fruit and vegetables, while its salads provide two, he said. Subway's distinctive smell comes from baking bread three times a day - Mr Dowding says All of Subway's stores are independently owned and operated as franchises of the US brand, with  three-fifths of its UK and Irish outlets located on traditional high streets. Mr Dowding said the firm had so far seen no impact from the UK's decision to leave the European Union. ""It's business as usual. Like any other business we're waiting to see what the government does and will tackle it from there,"" he said. Mr Dowding joined the firm just nine months ago, but said he'd eaten at the company for the past 20 years. ""When they offered me the job I almost bit their arm off. I'm delighted to be taking their evolution forward."" Subway, which was founded in the US just over 50 years ago, now has 44,000 stores in 112 countries.

Primary tests: Two-fifths fail to make grade,"This video can not be played Could you answer the questions in a Sats exam? Two-fifths (39%) of primary school pupils in England have failed to meet the expected standard in reading, writing and mathematics, figures show. The results are from national curriculum tests, often known as Sats, sat by 11-years-olds earlier this term. In total, 61% did reach the expected level in the ""three Rs"", an improvement onlast year's score of 53%. Ministers praised the hard work of schools, but head teachers said the results showed only a partial picture. The results show: 61% of pupils met the expected standard in reading, writing and mathematics, compared with 53% last year 71% of pupils met the expected standard in reading, compared with 66% last year 75% of pupils met the expected standard in mathematics, compared with 70% last year 77% of pupils met the expected standard in grammar, punctuation and spelling, compared with 73% last year 76% of pupils met the expected standard in writing, compared with 74% last year This year's cohort was the second to sit new tougher tests in line with a new national curriculum introduced in 2014. Last year, the percentage of primary school leavers making the grade fell to 53% from 80% in 2015. The results of the tests are used by the government to measure primary schools' success, in so-called league tables. School Standards Minister Nick Gibb told BBC News the new curriculum had ""significantly higher expectations of pupils than the previous one"". ""Schools and pupils have responded extremely well,"" he said. ""Today's results show sustained progress in reading, writing and maths and are a testament to the hard work of teachers and pupils across England. ""Thanks to their commitment and our new knowledge-rich curriculum, thousands more children will arrive at secondary school having mastered the fundamentals of reading, writing and maths, giving them the best start in life."" But the National Association of Head Teachers said the results should be taken ""with a pinch of salt"". General secretary Russell Hobby said: ""Sats data only gives parents part of the picture when judging a pupil's success or a school's effectiveness. ""League tables are the least helpful way of knowing if a school is the right place for your child. ""At the moment, parents and schools know that these results have to be taken with a pinch of salt."" He added that simply looking at data missed most of the real work being done to help youngsters achieve their full potential. Mr Hobby added: ""Schools do need to be held to account, but inspectors should look at more than just data. ""That way, when parents are reading Ofsted reports they can have more confidence that the report properly reflects how good the school actually is."" Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said the results showed children and teachers had ""worked extremely hard to get to grips with these new-look Sats"". ""But Sats continue to have a negative impact on children's education, and the exams are not fit for purpose,"" she said. ""Preparing for Sats takes up too much class time, with schools focusing on getting children through the tests."" Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said the results told 39% of 11-year-olds that they were not ready to begin secondary education. ""This demoralising situation says less about the efforts of teachers and pupils than about the deep flaws of our current system,"" he said. ""Designed to hold schools to account, it treats primary children as collateral damage."" Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said pupils and teachers should be congratulated for their achievements. ""That this has been achieved despite the confusion created by the chaotic introduction of the new assessment framework, which barely a year after introduction is already under review by government, is of great credit to the resilience of the teaching profession,"" he said.

BBC to be 'reinvented for new generation',"CBBC launched a new logo in 2016, with the help of popular character Hacker T Dog The BBC is to spend an extra Â£34m on children's content over the next three years. The investment comes as plans were announced to reinvent the corporation ""for a new generation"" and combat competition from media giants like Netflix and Amazon. Director general Tony Hall said it was ""the biggest investment in children's services in a generation"". The funding was unveiled as part of the BBC's firstAnnual Plan. Setting out the BBC's ambitions for the coming year, the extra money for children's content is going to be invested across the three years to 2019-20. Lord Hall said: ""Our ambition to reinvent the BBC for a new generation is our biggest priority for next year. Every part of the BBC will need to contribute to meeting this challenge."" The new investment, delivered following savings made across the BBC, will see the budget for children's programming reach Â£124.4m by 2019-20, up from the current figure of Â£110m. In the three years, Â£31.4m will be spent online on content that will include video, live online programme extensions, blogs, vlogs, podcasts, quizzes, guides, games and apps. The BBC's children's services are based in Salford Lord Hall said it was ""the biggest investment for a generation"" and will ""increasingly offer a personalised online offering for our younger viewers"". The BBC said it wants to respond to changes to the way children ""are watching and consuming programmes"", adding: ""Investment in British content - particularly for the young - is vital, unless we want more of our culture shaped and defined by the rise of West Coast American companies."" By David Sillito, media and arts correspondent Over the last six years, children's TV viewing has dropped by more than a quarter. Youngsters now spend more time online than they do in front of the television, around 15 hours a week. Even pre-schoolers spend more than eight hours a week online, according to Ofcom. Naturally then, the CBBC channel aimed at six to 12-year-olds has seen a drop in its audience, and increasingly children are choosing to use the BBC's iPlayer. Viewing habits are changing, but so too is the content they are watching. Shorter video clips, interactive content and games are all going to increase. The setting for all of this is a long-term decline in spending on British children's programmes by other broadcasters - ITV's programming went from 424 hours in 1998 to 64 in 2013 - and the dominance of US programming. This will only increase in an online world dominated by the tech giants. Children's culture is being shaped by firms based on the west coast of America. The annual plan also explains how the BBC is aiming to tackle such challenges as ""fake news"" with BBC News's Reality Check being expanded to fact-check social media claims, and work being done alongside Facebook to build trust. It also shows how the corporation will ""rise to the challenge of better reflecting and representing a changing UK"" and how it is focusing on personalisation. The BBC's creative plans for the next 12 months also include: A major season across TV, radio and online called Civilisations which will tell the story of art up to the present day A year-long season of science and technology programmes called Tomorrow's World Hull will continue to be showcased as UK City of Culture 2017 The annual plan is not the same as the BBC's annual report, which looks back over the previous year's performance and publishes details about the corporation's finances and spending. That report is expected later this month. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

'Hold nerve over public sector pay',"Five million public sector workers have seen their pay capped since 2012 Philip Hammond has insisted pay policy has not changed and the ""right balance"" must continue to be struck in terms of what is fair for workers and taxpayers. The chancellor, who is under pressure from colleagues to lift the 1% public pay cap, said he understood people were ""weary"" after seven years of austerity. But speaking in London, he rejected calls to ""take the foot off the pedal"". Government must ""hold its nerve"" in the face of calls for a ""different path"" of higher taxes and borrowing, he said. Mr Hammond is facing a growing chorus from within his own party for him to reconsider the 1% limit on increases in public sector salaries, which has been in place since 2012. Kuenssberg: Will they or won't they? Ahmed: Hammondâs challenge Reality Check: Is public sector pay higher than private? Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson expressed his support for a rethink on Monday, with sources suggesting he believed public sector workers could enjoy higher rewards in a ""responsible way"" that did not damage the public finances. Rises of 1% for dentists, nurses, doctors and the military have already been agreed for this year and No 10 said ministers would respond to pay review bodies in due course. Nigel Lawson, a former chancellor to Margaret Thatcher, said it was Mr Hammond's job to keep control of public spending to avoid ""economic disaster"". ""It's not easy but it is necessary,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""People understand we need to pay our way on the road to economic success."" Lord Lawson called on ministers to formulate the policy behind closed doors, adding: ""Stop having this debate in public, it's ludicrous"". Public sector morale at 'critical levels' Boris Johnson joins pay policy debate Speaking to business leaders at a CBI dinner, Mr Hammond acknowledged there was widespread frustration at the stagnation in real-terms pay growth at a time of rising inflation. Addressing the current debate over public sector pay, he said government policy had ""always been designed to strike the right balance of between being fair to our public servants and fair to those who pay for them"". ""That approach has not changed; and we continually assess that balance. But we do, of course, recognise that the British people are weary after seven years hard slog repairing the damage of the great recession. ""They have travelled a long wayâ¦ but still the sunlit uplands seem stubbornly to remain one further ridge away. ""And once again, some are questioning whether we should abandon the economic plan that has brought us so farâ¦ and take a different path."" After the Conservatives' failure to win an overall majority, he said it was up to his party to again make the case for a market-based economy, underpinned by sound public finances. Analysis BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Arguably the simpler part of the debate has been had - many public sector workers are feeling the pinch, and there is more and more pressure to remove the limit on pay rises. The more complicated bit, who or what would pay for the increase, is a conversation that's yet to happen. Whatever Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have said in the last 24 hours, don't expect anything to happen in a hurry. The first pay review body is not due to report for another few weeks. It seems unlikely that the government will announce any plan to either ditch the cap or promise to accept the decisions of the review bodies before then. It's not in either Theresa May or Philip Hammond's DNA to make quick decisions. Read more from Laura ""After seven long and tough years, the high-wage, high-growth economy for which we strive is tantalisingly close to being within our grasp,"" he added. ""It would be easy to take our foot off the pedal. But instead we must hold our nerve... and maintain our focus resolutely on the prizes that are so nearly within reach."" The country needed ""the right Brexit deal agreed in the months aheadâ¦ a steady determination to restore our public finances to balance by 2025â¦ and a relentless focus on transforming Britain's productivity performance"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there were intense discussions among ministers about the political wisdom of shifting position but while there was ""change in the air"" there was, as yet, no common position. Labour said immediate action was needed from the government not ""just more empty words or infighting from members of the Cabinet"". But former Conservative minister Sir Oliver Letwin warned that ""some modest tax rises"" would be necessary to fund any public sector pay rise. ""If you want to spend more, then you have to raise some more,"" he told BBC2's Daily Politics. He added that decisions like these need ""to be made as part of a package"".

Boy's confinement 'breached human rights',"Feltham houses young male offenders aged between 15 and 18 A 16-year-old boy's human rights were breached by his being kept in solitary confinement for 23-and-a-half hours a day, a judge has ruled. The High Court said the boy, who is referred to as AB, was unlawfully denied access to education and the ability to mix with other inmates. But it rejected claims his treatment at Feltham Young Offenders Institution was ""inhuman and degrading"". The Ministry of Justice said it would ""carefully"" consider the findings. The MoJ was contesting the legal challenge by AB,who has ""significant"" mental health problems. He was detained in December and is due to be released in later this month. Feltham, in south-west London, provides specialist custodial places for boys aged 15-18. On Tuesday, the judge ruled that AB's Article 8 rights - the right to private and family life - were breached, but Mr Justice Ouseley rejected claims his treatment amounted to a breach of the human rights laws which prohibit torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Inside Feltham: 'I saw people's heads stamped on' The Howard League for Penal Reform, which took forward the case on AB's behalf, said the court had ""declared this boy's isolation for certain periods and the denial of adequate education unlawful because it was against prison rules"". But chief executive Frances Crook said the group would appeal against the ""disappointing"" part of the judgement. Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the 16-year-old's confinement was ""simply the wrong thing to do"". She said: ""To lock up a young child with special educational needs for over 23 hours a day, with little to no education or exercise, is an attack on their rights. ""Isolation of this kind has been widely criticised by experts in the field, both in the UK and internationally."" The MoJ, however, insisted that ""proportionate and justified segregation"" was essential to managing inmates if they pose a risk to staff and other prisoners, and it was pleased the judge had found in its favour on that point. The spokesperson added: ""The safety and welfare of young people held in custody is our highest priority."" The court was told by a QC for the Justice Secretary that the boy had a history of assaulting prison staff and making ""racist taunts"", and ""poses a very real risk to the good order or discipline"" at Feltham. During a recent inspection, separate to the case, Feltham was found to run an""ineffective"" regime for managing bad behaviour. The HM Inspectorate of Prisons said about 40% of boys were locked up during the school day while 30% were allowed out of their cells for only two hours each day. Nevertheless, inspectors praised staff for their ""impressive"" healthcare and mental health provisions.

Sex abuse against cadets 'covered up',"Tony's parents were pressured not to approach the police by Sea Cadet officers BBC Panorama has uncovered evidence of repeated cover-ups of historical sex abuse in Britain's cadet forces. Victims have spoken for the first time of senior cadet leaders covering up complaints, and pressurising families against going to the police. Overseen by the Ministry of Defence, the cadets is one of the UK's largest youth bodies with 130,000 members. The MoD has paid more than Â£2m to cadet abuse victims, and says it has ""robust procedures in place to protect cadets"". According to Freedom of Information requests, in the last five years 363 sexual abuse allegations - both historical and current - have been made across the UK for the Army, Air and Sea Cadets. Cadet abuse 'hidden in full sight' Some 282 cases have been referred to the police and 99 volunteers have been dismissed. Panorama's seven-month investigation focused chiefly on uncovering a pattern of historical abuse - conducted by a number of different cadet leaders - in Glasgow, Birmingham and Hertfordshire. This video can not be played Martin: ""I'll never know who I should have been"" Martin was 12 when he was ""systematically abused and raped repeatedly over many years"" by his commanding officer Brian Leonard, at Tennal Grange cadet base in Birmingham. He told Panorama: ""You are trained to follow orders and you are trained to respect the officers and do as they tell you. ""That includes having to lie on the floor on a dirty blanket and just lie there and... take it like a man."" Panorama has spoken to 10 men who were abused by Leonard in the 1980s. Martin's Commanding Officer Brian Leonard (right) died in 1996, having never faced justice. Martin says: ""The thing was it was so blatantly obvious, it was almost as if it was hidden in full sight."" A girlfriend of one of the victims (who has chosen to remain anonymous) threatened to report Leonard to the police in 1987, but cadet officers pressured her to keep quiet. The sergeant said he would take a statement from her, but warned her not to approach the police. No investigation into Leonard was ever carried out. Leonard died in 1996, having never faced justice. Tony's attacker was not suspended, he was promoted and moved to another division Tony was 14 when he joined Cheshunt Sea Cadets, in Hertfordshire, in 1979. He said he woke to find his commanding officer Alan Waters at his bedside while he was on a weekend trip away. Tony told Panorama: ""I looked down and I was exposedâ¦ There was no doubt in my mind that he was touching me, no doubt in my mind whatsoever."" Terrified of returning, he told his parents - whose complaints were met with a home visit from two Sea Cadet officers, in full uniform. Tony's parents were dissuaded from approaching the police by the officers and in return for not taking matters further, they were promised that Waters would be moved from looking after children. Alan Waters held a title in a naval veterans' organisation until March this year But Panorama has discovered that he was not dismissed or even suspended - he was, in fact, promoted and moved to a division in North London where he was in charge of 10 Sea Cadet units. What's more, concerns by other members of the corps after this appointment were dismissed by the very top - the Captain of the Sea Cadets - who said the allegations were ""thoroughly investigated"" and ""not proved"". Waters was later convicted for separate child abuse offences in India in 2006 and placed on the Sex Offenders Register. Panorama has found out that despite this, until March 2017 he held a title in a naval veterans' organisation - as honorary secretary of HMS President Retired Officers Association. Joe was plied with alcohol and assaulted at his commanding officer's flat Joe joined the Glasgow Highlanders Army Cadets in 1988 when he was 11. His Commanding Officer, John Fitzpatrick, would invite cadets to his flat, ply them with alcohol and sit them in front of pornographic films before bedtime. Joe told Panorama: ""I mean real hardcore stuff that I've never seen since I was in that guy's companyâ¦ ""Images that have stuck in my mind to this day... if anybody had put images like that near my kids, I'd want to kill them."" On four occasions, Joe woke up to find Fitzpatrick sexually assaulting him. Fitzpatrick (left in the 1980s, right in 2016) was sentenced to two years in prison last year Panorama has discovered that before Joe was abused, another cadet instructor - Gordon - had received complaints that Fitzpatrick had sexually assaulted another boy. There were two young witnesses. Gordon went straight to the police, but instead of being congratulated his boss was furious. Gordon told Panorama the boy's parents defied pressure from senior cadet figures and told the police. The case went to trial - but Fitzpatrick was found ""not proven"".  He was welcomed back into the cadets - taking up the position of CO again. However, last year, Fitzpatrick was charged with lewd and libidinous behaviour against Joe and three other boys. This time the case was proven and he was sentenced to two years in prison. The Birmingham case was one of the first cadet cases taken on by David McClenaghan, a child abuse solicitor from law firm BBK. He told Panorama: ""I have absolutely no doubt that the abuse in the cadets will mirror the other scandals like the Jimmy Savile case, like the abuse in the scouts, like abuse in the Catholic church."" The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) says no sphere of society is immune. But Napac's chief executive Gabrielle Shaw said the figures obtained by Panorama indicated that people were now more confident about coming forward to report abuse. She added: ""The onus is now on institutions such as the armed forces to deal fully and promptly with reported allegations."" The MoD told Panorama that today all adults who work with children undergo mandatory security and background checks, rigorous disclosure procedures and regular safeguard training. A spokesman said: ""We encourage anyone who has been a victim or knows someone who has to report it to the police."" The Marine Society and Sea Cadets (MSSC) apologised unreservedly for any hurt  in regard to the case of Alan Waters and said what had happened was ""not reflective of our organisation today"".

Call for Grenfell inquiry chair to quit,"This video can not be played Emma Dent Coad tells BBC's Today a ""technocrat"" is not what's needed The judge heading the Grenfell Tower inquiry should stand down because those affected need ""somebody we can trust"",  the local MP for Kensington has said. Labour's Emma Dent Coad said Sir Martin Moore-Bick was ""a technocrat"" who lacked ""credibility"" with victims. On Monday, lawyers representing some of the familiescalled for him to quit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Sir Martin should ""listen to residents"", but minister David Lidington said he had ""complete confidence"" in him. The Tory MP and Lord Chancellor said Sir Martin would lead the inquiry ""with impartiality and a determination to get to the truth and see justice done"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan warned the retired Court of Appeal judge must urgently improve relations with local residents. The fire on 14 June is thought to have killed at least 80 people, although police say the final toll will not be known until at least the end of the year. Meanwhile, official figures from the Grenfell Response Team show 139 offers of accommodation have been made to families left homeless, but just nine have been accepted. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the prime minister promised that 158 families would be offered a good quality temporary home within three weeks - a target the response team said has now been met. The remaining 19 families do not want to be contacted, or are out of the country, it added. This video can not be played Grenfell Tower survivor Antonio is living in a hotel and has turned down two flats. One tenant from the 10th floor of Grenfell Tower, who only gave his name as Antonio, is among those who turned down the offer of temporary accommodation. ""We want to move to a permanent accommodation so we can remake it and then we can call it home,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. Three hospitals fail fire safety checks Grenfell Tower inquiry 'will be broad' Will a public inquiry deliver answers? What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Speaking after his appointment as chairman of the inquiry, Sir Martin said heunderstood the ""desire of local people for justice""following the disaster, but warned he was ""doubtful"" the process would be as wide-ranging as some residents hoped. On Monday, however, a source told the BBC he was prepared to be ""open-minded"" in his ""very broad"" inquiry. Although the remit will be decided by the prime minister, the source said he would consider in detail whether the nature of the building regulations contributed to the fire. Despite that attempted reassurance, Ms Dent Coad said she had spoken to hundreds of people affected by the fire who were unhappy with his appointment. ""We need somebody who can do the detail but we need somebody who can actually understand human beings as well and what they've been through..."" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I don't think he should do it. I don't think there will be any credibility. ""Some people are saying they are not going to co-operate with it, so it's not going to work."" Her call for Sir Martin to stand down has been backed by shadow fire services minister Chris Williamson. ""I think it's important that we listen to the survivors... local people are saying they don't have faith in him,"" he told BBC Radio Derby. He said he agreed with shadow chancellor John McDonnell's comment that the victims were ""murdered by political decisions"". ""If you look at decisions taken over the last three or four decades, it's all about unbridled market economics - essentially deregulation - using public services as a cash-cow and cutting corners,"" he said. On Sunday, Labour MPDavid Lammy said a ""white, upper-middle class man"",externalwho had ""never"" visited a tower block housing estate should not have been appointed. Grenfell residents have also questioned whether Sir Martin's background in commercial law is appropriate. And they have been angered by his decision to allow Kensington and Chelsea Council - which was criticised for its slow and ineffective response to the disaster - to contribute to the inquiry. Elsewhere, Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy and Westminster coroner Fiona Wilcox - who will lead will the inquests of the victims of the fire - will hold a private meeting with relatives later. Sir Martin visited the scene of the tragedy last week and spoke to residents and the police Educated at Christ's College, Cambridge Specialised in commercial law, involving maritime and land transport disputes Spent more than 20 years as a judge of the Commercial Court and Court of Appeal Retired in 2016 In November 2014, he ruled Westminster City Council could rehouse a single mother-of-five more than 50 miles away, in Milton Keynes.

Where is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?,"Baghdadi's 2014 appearance in Mosul was the last time he was seen in public Three years ago, video emerged of the leader of so-called Islamic State (IS), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, commanding allegiance in a sermon at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul. The Iraqi city had been freshly captured by the jihadist group and a ""caliphate"" declared. At the time, IS controlled a region the size of the United Kingdom - but since then a global war against the jihadists has sent them into retreat, and the whereabouts of Baghdadi - a man with a $25m US bounty on his head - are a mystery. On the third anniversary of Baghdadi's first - and last public - public appearance, ISno longer controls most of the land,externalit once held. Its leader has been conspicuously silent since addressing followers in arecorded audio messagelast November, after the battle to dislodge the group from Mosul began. Amid this silence, unconfirmed reports of Baghdadi's death have recently surfaced. Russia's deputy foreign ministersaid,externalit was ""highly likely"" Baghdadi was killed in a Russian air force strike on Raqqa on 28 May, and an Iranian officialasserted,externallast week that he was ""definitely dead"". However, both claims were questioned by American officials. Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? Can IS survive deaths of its leaders? IS: The full story The secret lives of young IS fighters In a video released from Raqqa a week after the Russian report surfaced, IS members referred to ""our sheikh"" without mentioning Baghdadi by name, leaving a question mark over his fate. After all, the Taliban and al-Qaeda hid the death of Taliban leader Mullah Omar for two years. For both his supporters and enemies, Baghdadi's absence at such a critical moment is perplexing. The answer to the question about Baghdadi's whereabouts might be related to his claim to legitimacy as caliph, or ""commander of the faithful"". According to a contentious religious rule, a candidate can (among other criteria) claim the title if he has ""ardh tamkeen"", or ""land to rule"". This video can not be played Blast in Iraq destroys Great Mosque of al-Nuri Today, the ardh tamkeen is shrinking. IS is all but a spent force in Mosul and is under immense pressure in Raqqa, its two de facto capitals in Iraq and Syria. (In recognition of the defining moment in Iraq, IS blew up the al-Nuri mosque two weeks ago before security forces could seize the site). Baghdadi might be in hiding in what could be described as IS's ""third capital"", namely the areas currently controlled by the group on the two sides of the Syrian and Iraqi borders. IS calls this area Wilayat al-Furat, or ""Euphrates Province"", which mainly comprises the Iraqi town of al-Qaim and the Syrian town of Albu Kamal. In 2014, the rise of IS began in Wilayat al-Furat and surrounding areas. According to the group's own accounts, in videos produced recently from Anbar province in Iraq, the militants used the region as a launchpad for its blitzkriegs in Iraq and Syria. Russia says Baghdadi might have been killed in an air strike on this building (right-hand image) The region also has relatively weakly armed militias and tribes, which could hold and secure the region if and when it is recaptured. Even in supposedly liberated areas like Rutba, a town to the south, IS has still managed to carry out frequent deadly hit-and-run attacks. No campaign has been launched yet to liberate these remote towns. Discussions as to whether the US or the Syrian government and its allies should lead the offensive on the Syrian side of the border are still being held in Washington. If the US conducts the campaign, questions remain as to whether rebel fighters or the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) should lead the fight. In Iraq, places like Tal Afar, west of Mosul, appear to be a current priority for the pro-government forces. Hisham al-Hashimi, an adviser to the Iraqi government and an expert on Iraqi jihadist groups, suggests that Wilayat al-Furat is where al-Baghdadi is likely to be hiding. The Iraqi government has carried out several air strikes in Albu Kamal over the past two years. Iyad al-Jamili, one of al-Baghdadi's closest aides has been spotted in the Syrian town, according to Mr Hashimi. A number of other close associates of the IS leader have also been seen in Albu Kamal and Mayadin, another key IS town in the Syrian province of Deir al-Zour, Mr Hashimi says. Wilayat al-Furat is the only remaining region where IS can claim ardh tamkeen. The campaign to clear the region might take many months to begin and much longer to conclude. Even after these areas are liberated, IS is likely to use the desert, river valleys and border zones as hideouts and to launch attacks on urban centres. Baghdadi, unlike other jihadist leaders, tends to speak or appear only when there is an extreme need for it - as seen with the announcement of the caliphate and the appeal to followers to stand and fight in Mosul. The higher up the IS chain of command, the more communication with superiors becomes restricted to a small number of trusted loyalists. Less than a handful people would therefore know Baghdadi's whereabouts. That makes it hard for the US, which has dedicated special forces constantly on the look-out for any traces of the world's most wanted man. The borderlands of Syria and Iraq provide Baghdadi with relatively secure and familiar terrain, in which he can hide and circumvent attempts to capture or kill him. They also provide him with the ability to continue to claim legitimacy as commander of the faithful.

How to create a 'safe space' for women,"Gurls Talk founder Adwoa Aboah Gurls Talk is an online community for young women to discuss things like mental health, sex, and social media. Its first real-life festival has taken place in London, with talks and workshops. ""I told other girls they could open up to me, so I'm not leaving,"" says founder and model Adwoa Aboah, who's had her ownstruggles with depression. ""The moment I opened my mouth I took on that responsibility."" ""A lot of the time people put up a front. Events like this allow people to break that down,"" says Ellie Hundreds of young women and men came along to the free event. ""I think it's important that girls can speak to each other about their problems because sexism is at all levels of society,"" says 18-year-old Clara. ""I'm in high school, and it's still very obvious that the guys get to talk more, and get to take more places than the girls."" Umi and Hodaya customised their Gurls Talk bags with embroidery Gurls Talk began as an Instagram account in 2015, encouraging women to share their stories. Since then it's grown into something bigger, with Adwoa giving talks in schools, and lots of women writing in for advice. ""These are my girls, these are my tribe. Having them all here was amazing,"" says Adwoa. She spent much of Saturday hugging the girls who went along, and even started a conga line with them at one point. Photographers took portraits of everyone to take home ""I think it's important for women to know that they're not alone,"" says Umi, who is 17. ""We're always stigmatised with words like 'bossy', or [people will say] 'That's not ladylike', or 'slut.'"" She feels teenagers are often not listened to. ""Young girls experience sexual harassment in ways that we don't talk about enough, or people don't take seriously. From age 13 onwards, I've been catcalled in the street. That's not OK."" Adwoa speaking at the event Adwoa was among the speakers at Saturday's event, alongside top modelHanne Gaby Odiele, feminist columnist Laurie Penny, doctors and relationship experts. ""Hearing someone that you put on a pedestal talk about their experiences in such a raw way is really nice. You realise that all the people you idolise are just people,"" says Lauren, 19. ""I was very worried that as a guy this wasnât a space for me, but itâs important that everyoneâs included in these discussions,"" says Matt Many girls at the event asked Adwoa about how to cope with the pressure they feel from social media to look a certain way. ""I completely understand because I was in that place of projecting this very fake image of who I was,"" Adwoa tells Newsbeat. ""Sometimes I feel like I'm adding to that worm hole of imagery that's so detrimental to how women look at themselves. ""The people at the top of the social media game don't always take on that responsibility. They show a life that's out of many people's reach."" Isra and Allya Seventeen-year old Isra tells Newsbeat she wants to see more diverse images of beauty promoted. ""When you look at television adverts, when you look at magazines, you see the models and they're all of one body type, one colour type, and it does get to you,"" she says. ""You're like, 'Why do they epitomise white European features so much? Am I not beautiful?' ""They're embracing diversity only through [skin] colour, not through facial features, body features. Diversity's so much more than colour."" ""Itâs a safe space for girls. For me that means all girls, regardless of colour, sexuality, style,"" says Lola, with her friend Lauren Adwoa is often credited with helping to increase diversity in modelling. She appeared on the March cover of American Vogue, alongside six models of differing skin tone and body shape, and in the new Gap advert, directed bynew Vogue editorEdward Enninful, with the slogan 'Unified in harmony'. ""Social media makes being a woman all the more complex,"" says Alexa, ""you start to seek validation through these negative ideals."" She says she hopes campaigns like these signify real change in the industry. ""I am only one type of girl as well. It shouldn't just be, 'OK we put Adwoa in so we've hit that quota.' It's not good enough.""

Love hotels make a comeback in Cuba,"Havana's Malecon seafront has always been a haven for couples The authorities in the Cuban capital, Havana, say they are restoring a network of hotels where rooms are rented by the hour to lovers. State-run ""posadas"", or love motels, disappeared during Cuba's economic crisis in the 1990s, when they became hurricane shelters. Private householders filled the gap in the market, but at exorbitant prices. Officials say the posadas will be cheaper and will help end the practice of love-making in Havana's open spaces. Private renters usually provide air-conditioning, a fridge and a comfortable bed and cost about $5 for three hours. But that is around a sixth of the average monthly Cuban salary (Â£22.90; $29.60) and unaffordable for most people. How Cuba's growing internet is fuelling new businesses Inside Cuba's new luxury mall State housing officials at the Provincial Housing Company of Havana say the new network of five posadas will be highly lucrative and will help people struggling with Havana's overcrowded and scarce housing. Many families in Havana have to share apartments. Divorced couples are often forced to remain together because of the housing shortage. The officials said they hoped the new chain would provide cheaper options for love-making in the city. Couples making love are a common sight in Havana's parks, on the beach and on the famed Malecon seafront. A commentator in theTrabajadores newspaper (in Spanish),externalrecalled that the first posadas opened at the end of the 19th Century in central Havana and that most Cubans had vivid memories, ""Of memorable kisses and of the porter calling to the lovers when their time had finished"".

N Korea fires missile into Japanese waters,"There have been 10 other detected missile launches by North Korea this year including this one in February North Korea has fired an intermediate range missile in the direction of Japan, US military officials said. The land-based missile was fired from near Panghyon airfield, and flew for 37 minutes before landing in the Sea of Japan, said the US Pacific Command. Japan has lodged a protest and PM Shinzo Abe said the launch ""clearly shows that the threat has grown"". Pyongyang has increased the frequency of its nuclear and missile tests in recent months, raising tensions. South Korea said Tuesday's projectile was launched at 09:40 local time (00:40 GMT) and flew about 930km (578 miles). The missile may have landed in waters claimed by Japan as its exclusive economic zone, according to Japanese officials. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? North Korea's missile programme How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? The US said it did not pose a threat to North America. Meanwhile Pyongyang is due to make an ""important announcement"" later on Tuesday, reported South Korea's Yonhap news agency. This is the 11th detected missile launch this year. North Korealast test-launched missiles in May. It fired projectiles on two separate occasions, both towards the Sea of Japan. While Pyongyang has appeared to have made progress, experts believe North Korea does not have the capability to accurately target a place with an intercontinental ballistic missile or miniaturise a nuclear warhead that can fit on such a missile. The big question is: What range does this missile have - could it hit the US? One expert already thinks that it might be able to reach Alaska but not the lower states. David Wright, a physicist with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said: ""If the reports are correct, that same missile could reach a maximum range of roughly 6,700km (4,160 miles) on a standard trajectory. ""That range would not be enough to reach the lower 48 states or the large islands of Hawaii, but would allow it to reach all of Alaska."" It's not just a missile that North Korea would need, but also the ability to protect a warhead from the intense heat and vibration as it re-enters the atmosphere, and it's not clear if North Korea can do that. On the prospect of North Korea being able to strike the US, President Donald Trump tweeted in January: ""It won't happen."" The truth is that it might - most experts think within five years, probably less. What would President Trump do then? Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Tuesday: ""North Korea's repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable."" Mr Abe said Japan would ""unite strongly"" with the US and South Korea to put pressure on Pyongyang. He added that he would call on Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin - who are meeting in Moscow - ""to play a more constructive role"". Japanese television networks heavily covered the missile launch on Tuesday US President Donald Trump also responded swiftly on Tuesday to the missile launch. On his Twitter account,externalhe made apparent reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying: ""Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?"" ""Hard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!"" Mr Trump had earlier called Mr Kim a""pretty smart cookie"". He has also repeatedly called on Mr Xi to pressure North Korea to end its nuclear and missile programmes. Beijing is Pyongyang's closest economic ally. The latest missile launch comes a day after Mr Trump spoke on the phone separately with Mr Xi and Mr Abe about North Korea. The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearised Korean Peninsula. In South Korea, recently-elected President Moon Jae-in has called for an emergency meeting of the country's security council. Mr Moon also met with US President Donald Trump last week, with the US leader warning Pyongyang of a""determined response"". The US recently started setting up its controversial Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system in South Korea, which is aimed at protecting against North Korean missiles. Neighbours such as China have objected to it as they believe it undermines their security and the regional balance. On Tuesday, Mr Xi and Mr Putin reiterated their opposition to Thaad, reported Chinese state news agency Xinhua. How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme?

Gene testing revolution for cancer care,"Cancer patients should be routinely offered DNA tests to help select the best treatments for them, according to England'schief medical officer,external. Prof Dame Sally Davies says in her annual report that the NHS must deliver her ""genomic dream"" within five years. Over 31,000 NHS patients, including some with cancer, have already had their entire genetic code sequenced. Dame Sally wants whole genome sequencing (WGS) to become as standard as blood tests and biopsies. Humans have about 20,000 genes - bits of DNA code or instructions that control how our bodies works. Tiny errors in this code can lead to cancer and other illnesses. Sometimes these mistakes are inherited from a parent, but most of the time they happen in previously healthy cells. WGS -  which costs about Â£700 - can reveal these errors by comparing tumour and normal DNA samples from the patient. This video can not be played Prof Dame Sally Davies says DNA testing should not be ruled out on the basis of cost Dame Sally says that in about two-thirds of cases, this information can then improve their diagnosis and care. Doctors can tailor treatments to the individual, picking the drugs mostly likely to be effective. And WGS can also show which patients are unlikely to benefit, so they can avoid having unnecessary drugs and unpleasant side-effects. Dame Sally wants DNA testing to become standard across cancer care, as well as some other areas of medicine, including rare diseases and infections. ""I want the NHS across the whole breadth to be offering genomic medicine - that means diagnosis of our genes - to patients where they can possibly benefit,"" her report says. People with rare diseases could benefit from having greater access to the technology, speeding up diagnosis. Doctors are already using genetic tests to identify and better treat different strains of the infectious disease tuberculosis. Dame Sally said patients could be assured that their genetic data would be stored securely and ""de-identified"" so that their privacy would be protected. Over 10 years ago, international scientists reached a breakthrough in DNA work - sequencing the entire genetic blueprint of man.  The Human Genome Project meant experts now had a catalogue of DNA code to explore and refer to. They began to understand which genes controlled which processes in the body and how these could go wrong. Doctors then started to ""read"" a patient's DNA to get a better idea of what might be causing their symptoms and how best to treat their illness. Genomic medicine - tailoring care based on an individual's unique genetic code - is now transforming the way people are cared for by the NHS. Genes can predict if a woman with breast cancer might respond to certain drugs, or whether radiotherapy is likely to shrink a tumour, for example. Currently, genetic testing of NHS patients in England is done at 25 regional laboratories, as well as some other small centres. Dame Sally wants to centralise the service and set up a national network to ensure equal access to the testing across the country. A new National Genomics Board would be set up, chaired by a minister, to oversee the expansion and development of genomic services. Dame Sally told BBC Breakfast that a lot of money was being spent because it was currently operating like a ""cottage industry"". By having centralised laboratories, more could be done with the money, including keeping up with the latest technology, she said. She said one hurdle could be doctors themselves, who ""don't like change"", and she urged cancer service patients to press their doctors to move from a local to a national service. She also said patients must understand they needed to allow use of their data, alongside other data, in order to get the best diagnosis, and therefore the best treatment. Phil Booth, from campaigning organisation, MedConfidential, said this move had ""huge potential"" for patients and the NHS, but there were ""great risks with large collections of sensitive data"". ""Every single use of patient data must be consensual, safe and transparent,"" he told BBC Radio Four's Today programme, and patients should be able to opt-out if they so wish.

Hammond: Pay policy has not changed,"Five million public sector workers have seen their pay capped since 2012 Philip Hammond has insisted pay policy has not changed and the ""right balance"" must continue to be struck in terms of what is fair for workers and taxpayers. The chancellor, who is under pressure from colleagues to lift the 1% public pay cap, said he understood people were ""weary"" after seven years of austerity. But speaking in London, he rejected calls to ""take the foot off the pedal"". Government must ""hold its nerve"" in the face of calls for a ""different path"" of higher taxes and borrowing, he said. Mr Hammond is facing a growing chorus from within his own party for him to reconsider the 1% limit on increases in public sector salaries, which has been in place since 2012. Kuenssberg: Will they or won't they? Ahmed: Hammondâs challenge Reality Check: Is public sector pay higher than private? Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson expressed his support for a rethink on Monday, with sources suggesting he believed public sector workers could enjoy higher rewards in a ""responsible way"" that did not damage the public finances. Rises of 1% for dentists, nurses, doctors and the military have already been agreed for this year and No 10 said ministers would respond to pay review bodies in due course. Nigel Lawson, a former chancellor to Margaret Thatcher, said it was Mr Hammond's job to keep control of public spending to avoid ""economic disaster"". ""It's not easy but it is necessary,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""People understand we need to pay our way on the road to economic success."" Lord Lawson called on ministers to formulate the policy behind closed doors, adding: ""Stop having this debate in public, it's ludicrous"". Public sector morale at 'critical levels' Boris Johnson joins pay policy debate Speaking to business leaders at a CBI dinner, Mr Hammond acknowledged there was widespread frustration at the stagnation in real-terms pay growth at a time of rising inflation. Addressing the current debate over public sector pay, he said government policy had ""always been designed to strike the right balance of between being fair to our public servants and fair to those who pay for them"". ""That approach has not changed; and we continually assess that balance. But we do, of course, recognise that the British people are weary after seven years hard slog repairing the damage of the great recession. ""They have travelled a long wayâ¦ but still the sunlit uplands seem stubbornly to remain one further ridge away. ""And once again, some are questioning whether we should abandon the economic plan that has brought us so farâ¦ and take a different path."" After the Conservatives' failure to win an overall majority, he said it was up to his party to again make the case for a market-based economy, underpinned by sound public finances. Analysis BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Arguably the simpler part of the debate has been had - many public sector workers are feeling the pinch, and there is more and more pressure to remove the limit on pay rises. The more complicated bit, who or what would pay for the increase, is a conversation that's yet to happen. Whatever Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have said in the last 24 hours, don't expect anything to happen in a hurry. The first pay review body is not due to report for another few weeks. It seems unlikely that the government will announce any plan to either ditch the cap or promise to accept the decisions of the review bodies before then. It's not in either Theresa May or Philip Hammond's DNA to make quick decisions. Read more from Laura ""After seven long and tough years, the high-wage, high-growth economy for which we strive is tantalisingly close to being within our grasp,"" he added. ""It would be easy to take our foot off the pedal. But instead we must hold our nerve... and maintain our focus resolutely on the prizes that are so nearly within reach."" The country needed ""the right Brexit deal agreed in the months aheadâ¦ a steady determination to restore our public finances to balance by 2025â¦ and a relentless focus on transforming Britain's productivity performance"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there were intense discussions among ministers about the political wisdom of shifting position but while there was ""change in the air"" there was, as yet, no common position. Labour said immediate action was needed from the government not ""just more empty words or infighting from members of the Cabinet"". But former Conservative minister Sir Oliver Letwin warned that ""some modest tax rises"" would be necessary to fund any public sector pay rise. ""If you want to spend more, then you have to raise some more,"" he told BBC2's Daily Politics. He added that decisions like these need ""to be made as part of a package"".

Dad remembers youngest Manchester victim,"This video can not be played 'She was a huge character' - Manchester attack father The youngest victim of the Manchester attack was ""everything you could wish for in a little girl"", her father said on what would have been her ninth birthday. Saffie Roussos was among 22 people killed in a bombing at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May. Her father Andrew, said Saffie was a ""huge character"" and was ""stunning"". Mr Roussos said he has not thought or asked questions about what happened because he ""can't get Saffie back"". Saffie Roussos was a pupil at Tarleton Primary School, in Lancashire In his first interview since the attack, Mr Roussos, from Lancashire, told the BBC: ""She was a joker. She was a huge character. ""She was just everything you could wish for in a little girl."" ""She loved dancing, music, gymnastics. If she wanted something, she would do it,"" he added. ""[She loved] fame, stardom. ""I knew that Saffie would love her pictures to be on, and to be spoken about on TV."" Saffie's brother Xander and father Andrew met Ariana Grande during her visit to meet those injured in the attack Saffie Roussos would have wanted her name and images to be remembered through the media, her father said Saffie had been at the concert with her mother Lisa and 26-year-old sister Ashlee Bromwich. Mrs Roussos has undergone multiple operations and was placed in an induced coma by doctors. When she awoke she knew her daughter had died, Mr Roussos explained. ""I was dreading it. She just looked at me and said 'she's gone isn't she?', and I said 'yeah'. She goes, 'I knew'."" Mrs Roussos is improving at a much quicker rate than doctors had expected and the rest of the family were ""all strong for each other"", he added. Saffie with her mother, Lisa Saffie's sister Ms Bromwich said: ""She was Ariana Grande-obsessed. ""She kept on going, 'come on Ashlee you promised me you'd get up and dance' - so we had a little dance. She was so happy, she was elated all night, grinning."" But everything changed at the end of the show when suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device in the foyer of the arena. ""I remember I was thrown to the ground and, my next instinct, I just sort of I rolled over and crawled because I couldn't walk,"" Ms Bromwich said. Mr Roussos said ""hell broke loose"" and he remembered arriving to discover Ms Bromwich being treated at the scene, while Saffie and his wife were missing. Sister Ashlee Bromwich said Saffie was ""obsessed"" with Ariana Grande ""We just walked round and all the police were there. It was chaos. ""You're panicking and worrying. You don't know what's going on,"" he said. Mr Roussos, with the help of a friend, eventually received confirmation from Salford Royal Hospital that they were caring for his wife. But he heard nothing of Saffie. ""As the hours went on, I thought the worst,"" he said. Saffie with her brother Xander, 11 His faint hope, he added, was ""that she was in one of the hotels"". He was later informed by a detective that Saffie had died. ""I couldn't take it in. I just sat there looking at him,"" he said. ""It's just your worst nightmare. I didn't know what to say, I didn't know what to think."" Andrew Roussos said when he was told of Saffie's death he ""couldn't take it in"" When asked about their thoughts on Abedi, Mr Roussos said: ""It doesn't matter what I think, It doesn't matter what I feel, how much anger I've got, it doesn't matter how much love I've got, it doesn't change a thing. ""It doesn't, so I haven't even thought about it because if I could think about it, analyse it, break it down, sort it out and get Saffie back I'll do it but I can't. ""I've not even asked questions, I don't even know what's happened, I'm not interested."" Ms Bromwich said she ""didn't want to know, I'm not interested"". Flowers and tributes flooded in for Saffie after the Manchester attack Saffie's brother Xander Roussos, 11, said it is ""quite hard to cope with"", adding there are ""times when you're sad and times when you're happy"". ""We do a little bit of laughing, a little bit of joking, a little bit of crying and cuddling, and that's how we get through the day,"" Mr Roussos said. Mr Roussos said he had met Ariana Grande before her One Love Manchester concert in June. ""I wanted to tell her what she meant to Saffie,"" he said. ""I wanted to tell her from a father's point of view that she's got nothing to be sorry for... It wasn't her fault."" ""All she could say to me was, 'I'm sorry', and I said, 'You've got nothing to be sorry for. You made Saffie so happy with what you do'. ""She thanked me,"" he said. ""She appreciated me telling her that."" Mr Roussos said he was thankful Saffie managed to enjoy the entire show before she died. ""I'm grateful she got to see all of it,"" he said.

Fox Sports abruptly fires top executive,"Fox's treatment of Jamie Horowitz (pictured) had been appalling, his lawyer said Fox Sports has sacked Jamie Horowitz, head of sports programming at the US company. It gave no reasons for the dismissal, but stressed on the importance of ""professional conduct"". Meanwhile, US media report that Mr Horowitz's departure comes amid claims of sexual harassment at Fox Sports. Mr Horowitz's lawyer said ""the way Jamie has been treated by Fox is appalling"" and that the executive had worked ""in an exemplary fashion"". In the memo to sent to employees, Fox Sports President Eric Shanks wrote that everyone should ""adhere to professional conduct at all times"". Mr Horowitz's lawyer Patricia Glaser said in response to his dismissal: ""At no point in his tenure was there any mention by his superiors or human resources of any misconduct, nor an inability to adhere to professional conduct. ""Jamie was hired by Fox to do a job, the job that until today he has performed in an exemplary fashion. Any slanderous accusations to the contrary will be vigorously defended."" However, Fox Sport's lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said that ""Mr Horowitz's termination was fully warranted and his lawyer's accusations are ill-informed and misguided"". Fox Sports is part of 21st Century Fox, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch. TheLos Angeles Times,externaland theNew York Times,externalreported that about a week ago Fox began an investigation into claims of sexual harassment at its sports division. The newspapers quoted a person briefed on the matter. Fox has not publicly commented on the media reports, which could not be independently verified.

Suicide attacks amid 'final' Mosul battle,"The Iraqi military says it has made some progress recapturing the Old City Fierce clashes and rising numbers of suicide attacks have been reported in Mosul as Iraqi troops try to recapture the city from Islamic State militants. The last IS-held quarter, known as the Old City, was rocked by air strikes and artillery salvos, with local commanders expecting to retake full control soon. However, they are facing more suicide attacks, including several from female bombers, in the battle's final phase. The major offensive against IS in Mosul was launched in October 2016. Thousands of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, are involved in the operation. The government announced the full ""liberation"" of eastern Mosul in January 2017. But the west of the city has presented a more difficult challenge, with its narrow, winding streets. Where is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? Battle for Mosul: The story so far Despair and death in the flight from Mosul ""The fighting is becoming harder every day because of the nature of the Old City,"" Lt Gen Abdulghani al-Assadi, a commander of Iraq's elite Counter-Terrorism Service, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. He added that the same conditions that were beneficial for IS fighters also helped to shield Iraqi troops from snipers. Civilians have been fleeing the Old City as the offensive continues Lt Gen Sami al-Aridhi, another CTS commander, told AFP: ""The enemy has been using suicide bombers, especially women, for the past three days in some of the neighbourhoods. Before that, they were using snipers and bombs more."" Some of the suicide bombers were reportedly teenage girls. There were two female suicide attacks on troops on Monday, while seven other women bearing explosives attempted to approach troops but were intercepted, AP news agency reported. To prevent such attacks, Iraqi commanders said they were now ordering women fleeing from the Old City to remove veils before approaching soldiers. Men were told to remove their shirts. The UN has said that IS may be holding more than 100,000 people in Mosul as human shields. WATCH: Mosul from above in 360 video The Iraqi army says it believes there are no more than 300 militants left in Mosul, compared with almost 6,000 at the start of the offensive in October. Brigadier General Yahya Rasool told state TV that ""victory is very near"", while another commander has estimated that ""the battle will end in five days to a week"".

N Korea fires ballistic missile into the sea,"There have been 10 other detected missile launches by North Korea this year including this one in February North Korea has fired an intermediate range missile in the direction of Japan, US military officials said. The land-based missile was fired from near Panghyon airfield, and flew for 37 minutes before landing in the Sea of Japan, said the US Pacific Command. Japan has lodged a protest and PM Shinzo Abe said the launch ""clearly shows that the threat has grown"". Pyongyang has increased the frequency of its nuclear and missile tests in recent months, raising tensions. South Korea said Tuesday's projectile was launched at 09:40 local time (00:40 GMT) and flew about 930km (578 miles). The missile may have landed in waters claimed by Japan as its exclusive economic zone, according to Japanese officials. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? North Korea's missile programme How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? The US said it did not pose a threat to North America. Meanwhile Pyongyang is due to make an ""important announcement"" later on Tuesday, reported South Korea's Yonhap news agency. This is the 11th detected missile launch this year. North Korealast test-launched missiles in May. It fired projectiles on two separate occasions, both towards the Sea of Japan. While Pyongyang has appeared to have made progress, experts believe North Korea does not have the capability to accurately target a place with an intercontinental ballistic missile or miniaturise a nuclear warhead that can fit on such a missile. The big question is: What range does this missile have - could it hit the US? One expert already thinks that it might be able to reach Alaska but not the lower states. David Wright, a physicist with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said: ""If the reports are correct, that same missile could reach a maximum range of roughly 6,700km (4,160 miles) on a standard trajectory. ""That range would not be enough to reach the lower 48 states or the large islands of Hawaii, but would allow it to reach all of Alaska."" It's not just a missile that North Korea would need, but also the ability to protect a warhead from the intense heat and vibration as it re-enters the atmosphere, and it's not clear if North Korea can do that. On the prospect of North Korea being able to strike the US, President Donald Trump tweeted in January: ""It won't happen."" The truth is that it might - most experts think within five years, probably less. What would President Trump do then? Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Tuesday: ""North Korea's repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable."" Mr Abe said Japan would ""unite strongly"" with the US and South Korea to put pressure on Pyongyang. He added that he would call on Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin - who are meeting in Moscow - ""to play a more constructive role"". Japanese television networks heavily covered the missile launch on Tuesday US President Donald Trump also responded swiftly on Tuesday to the missile launch. On his Twitter account,externalhe made apparent reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying: ""Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?"" ""Hard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!"" Mr Trump had earlier called Mr Kim a""pretty smart cookie"". He has also repeatedly called on Mr Xi to pressure North Korea to end its nuclear and missile programmes. Beijing is Pyongyang's closest economic ally. The latest missile launch comes a day after Mr Trump spoke on the phone separately with Mr Xi and Mr Abe about North Korea. The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearised Korean Peninsula. In South Korea, recently-elected President Moon Jae-in has called for an emergency meeting of the country's security council. Mr Moon also met with US President Donald Trump last week, with the US leader warning Pyongyang of a""determined response"". The US recently started setting up its controversial Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system in South Korea, which is aimed at protecting against North Korean missiles. Neighbours such as China have objected to it as they believe it undermines their security and the regional balance. On Tuesday, Mr Xi and Mr Putin reiterated their opposition to Thaad, reported Chinese state news agency Xinhua. How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme?

Levels of child vulnerability 'unknown',"Ministers do not know how many hundreds of thousands of children in England are living risky or vulnerable lives, says children's commissioner Anne Longfield. England's children's champion has tried to calculate the total in a report, in the absence of overall official data. She found some 670,000 children live in high risk family situations, thousands with parents in addiction treatment. Children's minister Robert Goodwill said support for vulnerable children was being given across government. But he acknowledged there was more to do. Ms Longfield highlighted that half a million children are so vulnerable that the state has to step in with support, and 46,000 are thought to be in gangs. Some 200,000 are judged by the local council to have experienced trauma or abuse and 119,000 children are homeless or living in insecure or unstable accommodation. Despite widespread concern, the most recent estimate of children suffering from mental health conditions - around 800,000 - is 13 years out of date. The children's commissioner is clear that despite its researchers' best efforts, the figures it has to draw from may contain lots of overlaps and double counting. It is the start of a longer piece of work to clarify the scale and nature of child vulnerability and to encourage the government to collect better data and define what counts as vulnerability. She is also clear that there will be many ""invisible"" children living in vulnerable situations who have not been reported to services and also because of gaps in data. Ms Longfield says: ""This report should be a wake-up call to the government and policy-makers, who have been in the dark about the level of child vulnerability for too long. ""It is shocking that half a million children need direct intervention or care from the state because they are living vulnerable lives. ""On top of that there are many hundreds of thousands of other children growing up in potentially high risk situations. ""Yet even more shocking is that this is only the tip of the iceberg. Ministers have a wealth of information about children's attainment ""The actual numbers are likely to be much higher. The truth is nobody knows the exact number of vulnerable children."" The report highlights the fact that there are many different indicators used in varied ways by government departments, agencies and others, causing confusion about the scale of the problems among children. She adds that behind the confusion are unidentified and invisible children, suffering a variety of risks and vulnerabilities. ""We can trace in minute detail the academic progress of a child from four to 18 and beyond, but when it comes to describing and assessing the scale of negative factors in a child's life which will hamper their progress, we are floundering,"" Ms Longfield says. Mr Goodwill said that every single child should have their voice heard and receive the care and support that they need to realise their potential. ""Across government, we are taking action to address this issue - whether through reforming children's social care, prioritising mental health, or better protecting victims of domestic violence and abuse. ""For some of the most vulnerable, our new What Works Centre for children's social care will ensure social workers across the country are able to learn from best practice in keeping children safe. ""We recognise the scale of this challenge - and, while the number of children in need has remained relatively stable since 2010, there is always more to do. ""We will look carefully at these exploratory statistics and I am looking forward to working with the children's commissioner as this important work continues.""
