Clashes erupt after disputed Belarus election,"This video can not be played People have been detained in cities across Belarus, according to media reports Protesters and riot police have clashed in Belarus's capital Minsk and other cities, after a state TV exit poll said long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko was re-elected in Sunday's election. Police used stun grenades, rubber bullets and water cannon. A human rights group said one protester was killed and about 120 arrested. Mr Lukashenko won 80% of the vote, according to a preliminary count. But the main opposition leader has refused to recognise the results. ""We have already won, because we have overcome our fear, our apathy and our indifference,"" Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said. The preliminary results give her 9.9% of the vote, but her campaign said she had been polling 70-80% in some areas. Ms Tikhanovskaya entered the election in place of her jailed husband and went on to lead large opposition rallies. Mr Lukashenko, 65, has been in power since 1994. How protests shook up Belarus presidential election Europe's longest serving ruler facing unfamiliar pressure The lead-up to Sunday's poll sawa crackdown on activists and journalistsamid the country's biggest opposition demonstrations in years. Demonstrators took to the streets in central Minsk as soon as voting ended and the exit polls were released late on Sunday. Many chanted ""Get out"" and other anti-government slogans. Riot police fired stun grenades, used batons, and made arrests as they dispersed the demonstrators. Protesters say President Lukashenko must step down A number of people were arrested on Sunday evening Early on Monday, Valentin Stefanovic from the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, told Reuters news agency that at least one person had died after being knocked over by a police van and dozens had been injured. He added that at least 120 people had been detained. However, the interior ministry denied that there had been any deaths. Similar protests took place in Brest, Gomel, Grodno and other cities. Sometimes referred to as Europe's last dictator, President Lukashenko was first elected in 1994. Mr Lukashenko cast his ballot at a polling station in Minsk In the last vote in 2015, he was declared winner with 83.5% of the vote. There were no serious challengers and election observers reported problems in the counting and tabulation of votes. This year's election is being held amid growing signs of frustration at his leadership. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has emerged as the wild card of the race The campaign saw the rise of Ms Tikhanovskaya, 37, a former teacher who became a stay-at-home mother until she was thrust into the political spotlight. The mother challenging an authoritarian president After her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote, she stepped in to take his place. In the lead-up to the election she told the BBC that people in Belarus did not believe the election would be run fairly. ""But I still believe that our president will understand that his time is over. People don't want him any more,"" she said. President Lukashenko has dismissed Ms Tikhanovskaya as a ""poor little girl"", manipulated by foreign ""puppet masters"". Tens of thousands defied an escalating crackdown on the opposition last month to attend a protest in Minsk, the largest such demonstration in a decade. Since the start of the election campaign in May, more than 2,000 people have been detained, according to Human Rights Centre Viasna. On the eve of the vote Ms Tikhanovskaya's team saidher campaign manager had been arrested and would not be released until Monday. And on Sunday, as people voted,internet service was ""significantly disrupted"", according to online monitor NetBlocks,external. Opposition supporters say this makes it harder for evidence of election fraud to be collected and shared. There were already concerns over a lack of scrutiny because observers were not invited to monitor the election and more than 40% of votes were cast ahead of election day. There were three other candidates: Anna Kanopatskaya, a former MPwho won a rare seat for the opposition in parliamentary elections in 2016 Sergei Cherechen, the leader of the Social Democrat party Andrei Dmitriyev, the co-chair of the Tell the Truth movement, a campaign group which has been raided by the authorities Two key opposition figures were barred from running and threw their weight behind Ms Tikhanovskaya's campaign. One of them, Valery Tsepkalo, fled Belarus ahead of the contest, fearing arrest. His wife Veronika stayed behind, becoming a key campaigner for Ms Tikhanovskaya. It emerged on Sunday that Ms Tsepkalo had also now left Belarus for Moscow, for ""safety"" reasons. Anger towards Mr Lukashenko's government has been in part fuelled by the response to coronavirus. The president has downplayed the outbreak, advising citizens to drink vodka and use saunas to fight the disease. Belarus, which has a population of 9.5 million, has reported nearly 70,000 cases and 600 deaths. Belarus in surprising presidential election battle.

Belarus leader set to claim another election win,"An exit poll, conducted by a pro-government organisation, has predicted a landslide victory for Mr Lukashenko The long-time leader of Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko, appears set to declare a landslide victory in an election that saw his toughest opposition challenge in years. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, entered in place of her jailed husband and went on to lead large opposition rallies. But a state TV exit poll showed Mr Lukashenko winning 79.7% of the vote. The opposition had said it expected the vote to be rigged. Protesters have already clashed with police. Squares and streets in the capital Minsk were earlier sealed off by police as Mr Lukashenko vowed that the situation would remain ""under control"". The lead-up to the election sawa crackdown on activists and journalistsamid the country's biggest opposition demonstrations in years. After voting on Sunday, Mr Lukashenko said he did not see Ms Tikhanovskaya as a threat, and denied imposing repressive measures on the opposition. ""They are not worth enough to carry out any repression against them,"" he said. How protests shook up Belarus presidential election Europe's longest serving ruler facing unfamiliar pressure Ms Tikhanovskaya was greeted by an excited crowd chanting her name when she cast her ballot in Minsk earlier on Sunday. Voting was extended at some polling stations due to long queues. There were long queues at polling stations throughout the day The exit poll reported on television, which was conducted by a pro-government organisation, showed Ms Tikhanovskaya receiving just 6.8% of the vote. In a news conference on Sunday evening, Ms Tikhanovskaya said she did not trust that Mr Lukashenko had really won the election. ""I believe my eyes, and I see that the majority is with us,"" she said. Protests erupted following the exit poll, with people detained in the capital and other cities across the country, according to media reports. Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said connectivity had been ""significantly disrupted"", with the situation worsening throughout the day and creating an ""information vacuum"". The head of the election commission, Lidia Yermoshina, urged Ms Tikhanovskaya to accept defeat calmly. The first official results are expected on Sunday night. The opposition said it would keep an alternative count. Sometimes referred to as Europe's last dictator, President Lukashenko, 65, was first elected in 1994.

When the virus came to our hospital,"As the Covid-19 pandemic loomed, the staff at one hospital in the English Midlands braced themselves. Quickly they found themselves at the centre of a coronavirus hotspot - and nothing turned out as they anticipated. Liz Rees sat down at her dining room table to take the call. It was a Sunday in early March and, from down the line, a voice was telling her about some test results that had just come back from the lab. This wasn't a normal diagnosis. Liz Rees Dudley, the town where Liz has worked for 20 years as a consultant microbiologist, had its first case of Covid-19. That, in itself, wasn't a surprise. She'd watched on TV as the virus had spread from Asia to continental Europe before reaching the south of England; it had already been detected in nearby Birmingham and Wolverhampton. ""There was an inevitability about it,"" she says. ""But the first one makes it real."" Liz was the doctor in charge of infection prevention and control at Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley. She'd spent her career anticipating what to do in the event of a pandemic. And she knew the town - a one-time industrial powerhouse, the capital of the Black Country - intimately. Her husband joked she was attached to an elastic band that wouldn't stretch more than 10 miles out of Quinton, the nearby Birmingham suburb where she was brought up. Still sitting in her dining room, Liz hastily convened an incident meeting over the phone with hospital staff. There was a list of things to check: That the patient was receiving the best possible care. That the staff on the ward were comfortable with what they were doing. Which infection precautions needed to be put in place. The mood was calm. Everyone had a plan to follow. But this was uncharted territory. ""I think we were aware that we would probably be getting more cases within days,"" says Liz. For some time now, a Yorkshireman named Paul Hudson had also been anticipating that the outbreak would reach Dudley - and thinking hard about how to respond. But the first case came as a shock: ""It wasn't from somewhere we expected."" Paul's job was divided in two. He spent half his time as consultant anaesthetist at the hospital, a role he'd occupied since 2009, and the other half as deputy medical director of the trust that runs it. Paul Hudson As the virus approached, he'd been closely involved in planning what to do - drawing up new guidelines; working out how to ""zone"" new arrivals at the front door into Covid and non-Covid streams; setting up a respiratory emergency department; and making sure there was enough stuff - oxygen, personal protective equipment, ventilators, drugs and people. ""We had, I think, quite a good plan in place,"" Paul says. It was just a question of waiting for patients with severe respiratory symptoms to start showing up at the door. But that wasn't what happened, at least not at first. ""All of a sudden, we had a patient - an in-patient - test positive,"" says Paul. This individual was being treated for something else entirely, having been admitted before they started showing symptoms. There were protocols in place for dealing with a situation like this to stop the virus spreading - but it was a difficult start all the same. ""I think that set the tone for a lot of the next few weeks and months,"" says Paul. ""That has been, I think, one of the themes of this illness - that it has been unpredictable."" Qadar Zada sat in his office at the hospital. He'd been born less than a mile away and never lived anywhere other than Dudley. And yet everything around felt new to him. In January 2020, Qadar had started as deputy head of operations at the trust. Part of his job involved making sure medical staff had all the support they need to do theirs. He'd spent his career working in NHS management and felt he had a good idea of what had to be done. There was a problem, though - most of his colleagues were strangers to him. Qadar Zada ""For me, I think the biggest challenge personally was that I didn't know people in the organisation,"" he says. The plan to give him a structured induction fell away. As the workload increased, no-one had time for a getting-to-know-you chat: ""So at the point that we were talking to people about planning things, I was having to introduce myself."" There was also the duty he, a local councillor, felt towards his community. ""I was worried, obviously, for those people in Dudley, family that I have in Dudley,"" he says. ""I was worried for colleagues in the trust as well. But I was also aware of everybody's responsibility, including my own."" On 8 March, the day Tesco beganrestricting salesdue to stockpiling and the UK Foreign Office advised againsttravelling to northern Italy, Dudley's first Covid-19 case was diagnosed. Three days later, the first fatality in the town attributed to the virus was reported in the local press. By 15 March the death toll stood at two, then rose to five by 18 March, then seven by the following day. On 20 March, Health Secretary Matt Hancocksaid,externalthe government was looking at why there was a ""hotspot"" across the West Midlands region. According to Liz, the patients who died in the early days of the outbreak in Dudley were already very ill with underlying conditions. Typically, these deaths came rapidly after diagnosis. ""By the time the result was back, possibly within 24 hours, they had died,"" she says. ""It was clear at that point that this can be a really difficult disease to deal with."" For everyone at the hospital, all this was new. ""People were learning what these patients look like when they came through the front door,"" says Liz. ""The severity of the illness, and the breadth of people it could affect, was a bit of an eye-opener."" On the top floor of the administration block, a large office suite normally used for hosting seminars had been transformed. There were information boards around the walls and blinking computer monitors. A screen was tuned to the BBC News channel around the clock. This was the trust's Covid incident room - a hub for all data coming in and going out of the trust. ""We were man-marking every single swab,"" says Qadar. The incident room received contact tracing information and produced situation reports throughout the day. There was also a PPE line for staff who needed personal protective equipment. As well as carrying out its own modelling of how the virus might spread in Dudley, the trust was receiving projections from Public Health England, the local authority and other NHS agencies. They warned how bad the impending peak could get. ""At one point, the worst-case scenario, we were trying to plan for receiving up to 20 critically ill patients an hour for a number of days,"" says Paul. Back then, the hospital had just nine ventilated beds and another eight that offered advanced respiratory support. ""That just doesn't work, do you know what I mean?"" On 23 March, the prime minister told the UK: ""You must stay at home."" Dudley joined the rest of the country in lockdown. At the same time, the surge in patient numbers everyone had been expecting was beginning. Typically, ""the people here are stoical and tend to present late - a salt-of-the-earth type thing"", says Liz - but that wasn't the case any more. Covid patients were starting to turn up at the doors in large numbers, and a significant proportion of them were incredibly sick. According to Paul, those that weren't already acutely unwell when they arrived would typically deteriorate rapidly within days. Between 23 and 25 March, the number of confirmed cases in the town jumped from 26 to 40. By 27 March, the number of Covid-related deaths stood at 17; four days later, that figure had nearly doubled to 30. Around this time, a workaround for the concerns about ventilator capacity presented itself. The trust had received guidance that a form of non-invasive ventilation called Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) could be useful for Covid patients - either as a bridge to the usual mechanical ventilation techniques or as an alternative to them. The Army had been drafted in to deliver essential supplies like PPE and oxygen to hospitals, and Paul recalls telling an officer - ""I kid you not, his name was Major Tom"" - that he worried the hospital was under-resourced when it came to CPAP machines. Soon afterwards a lorry turned up with 25 of them. ""And at that point, you could feel the mood around the place change a little bit,"" says Paul: it gave medical staff the confidence that they could take treatment decisions on the basis of patient need, not hospital capacity. Ten operating theatres and a recovery area were transformed into a massive critical care facility, and the respiratory and high-dependency wards had been converted into a Covid-only CPAP unit ward. It wasn't a moment too soon. The peak arrived in early April. The parts of the hospital reserved for routine treatment were eerily quiet. According to Paul, ""Our non-Covid work just fell off the edge of the cliff."" But in the Covid zones, the pace was becoming frenetic. By Sunday 5 April - the day the prime minister was admitted to hospital in London having already tested positive - the number of confirmed cases in the borough of Dudley had soared to 283. Three days later, it was announced that the number of hospital deaths stood at 106. Liz recalls a single day in early April during which 58 new positive test results from the hospital came through, and not feeling particularly surprised by the number. For most of that month, anaesthetic and critical care medics worked an intensive shift pattern - three long days, three days off, three nights, three more days off. Staff worked outside their comfort zones, carrying out tasks and working in departments that weren't part of their day jobs. Keeping rotas fully staffed became a huge challenge, not just for doctors and nurses but in every part of the hospital - at one point hundreds of employees were absent, either because they had fallen ill themselves or they were following advice to self-isolate. The pressure faced by these front-line workers was unprecedented, says Paul. ""Trying to shout through the mask at people you barely recognise because you can only see the strip of their eyes - while the patients were incredibly sick and prone to very acute deterioration,"" he says. ""You think you're making progress - and all of a sudden, they'd have these surges of deterioration where for the next four to six hours you're just trying to hold the tide back."" The prohibition on visiting made the task even harder, he adds: ""Not having the relatives there to communicate with properly, and having to do everything shouted through a mask down the phone - I think it made it very, very, very difficult for a lot of our staff."" ""All your decisions are a little bit more demanding,"" recalls Liz. ""Your life has become a very narrow spectrum because the world's shut down around you. So either you're at home, or you're at work, and when your work is like mine.... I got to the point where I stopped listening to the news because I'd been dealing with it all day."" To add to the breakdown in boundaries between her home and professional lives, Liz's daughter was working on a Covid ward in Sheffield as a junior doctor. ""It's been a family business,"" she adds dryly. The hospital never ran out of PPE - the trust, aided by the dedicated phone line in the incident room, did its job. But the local community played a crucial role, too, in preventing stocks from running out. ""At one point, volunteers were making visors because we couldn't get any,"" says Qadar. One consultant surgeon helped source acetate for the front of them with the help of his daughter, a teacher, who regularly ordered it for classroom supplies. ""At one point I was wearing a pair of goggles donated to us by the chemistry department at a local school,"" says Paul. ""One of my colleagues had a welder's mask, which looked really great - it was a kind of a mirrored black lens that was slightly less helpful when trying to look after people, because you couldn't see through it."" One evening, Paul turned up for a nightshift to discover there were no new Covid patients. Then the following night, there wasn't another patient either. And then a few days passed without any more. The hospital staff could start to believe that the peak had passed. Planning the recovery stage would be the next challenge. The non-emergency workload began to climb again, too. And everyone was well aware they needed to prepare for the possibility of subsequent spikes in infections. But as the regular Thursday night clapping ritual drew to an end, they were able to take satisfaction in what they had achieved. ""You can look back and actually see that while what was done was really, on reflection, quite amazing actually,"" says Liz. ""I think there's still a little bit of fear in the background about a second wave. But I think having done it once before, I think we know what we need to do.""

Labour MP says racism led to police car stop,"Dawn Butler said she was pulled over by police while travelling through Hackney A Labour MP has accused police of racially profiling her after she was stopped while travelling in a car in east London. Former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butlertweeted she had been pulled over in Hackney,externaland had recorded the stop. The MP for Brent Central said police had to ""stop associating being black and driving a nice car with crime"". The Met said the stop was a mistake caused by an officer incorrectly entering the car's registration number. She told the Press Association: ""It's obviously racial profiling. ""We know that the police is institutionally racist and what we have to do is weed that out. We have to stop seeing black with crime. We have to stop associating being black and driving a nice car with crime."" The BMW was being driven by a male friend, who is also black, and it was pulled over by two police cars, Ms Butler said. She said officers said the car was registered in North Yorkshire and took the car keys while checking the registration. They then admitted there had been a mistake, that it was registered to the driver, and apologised, she said. Her footage of the stop, which happened at about 12:00 BST on Sunday, showed an officer saying police were carrying out searches because of ""gang and knife crime"". She is heard in the video telling the officers: ""It is really quite irritating. It's like you cannot drive around and enjoy a Sunday afternoon whilst black, because you're going to be stopped by police."" She goes on to say: ""If you are driving outside the area, I think that's a ridiculous reason to stop. ""If you are profiling people who are driving in a certain type of car, that's an inappropriate reason to stop, and if you are profiling people because of the colour of their skin, that's an inappropriate reason to stop."" One of the officers in the video tells her: ""I appreciate everything you say and I do apologise for wasting your time."" Ch Supt Roy Smithtweeted earlier,externalto say he had spoken to the MP who had ""given me a very balanced account of the incident"". The Met Police officer added the force ""are listening"" to concerns she had about the police stop and the officers involved, and she was ""quite entitled to raise them"". Last month the Met apologised after stopping and searching Team GB athletes Bianca Williams and Ricardo dos Santos In a statement the police force said: ""Prior to stopping the vehicle, an officer incorrectly entered the registration into a police computer which identified the car as registered to an address in Yorkshire. ""Upon stopping the vehicle and speaking with the driver, it quickly became apparent that the registration had been entered incorrectly and was registered to the driver in London. ""Once the mistake was realised the officer sought to explain this to the occupants; they were then allowed on their way. ""No searches were carried out on any individuals."" The force said ""one of the occupants"" had been contacted by a senior officer and they had discussed ""subsequent interaction as well as feedback regarding the stop"". It added: ""We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter further with the occupants if they wish to do so."" The statement did not explain why the registration was entered in the first place. In the video, one officer can be heard saying the initial search returned a car of the same make, model and colour but registered to North Yorkshire. Ms Butler questioned the officer, asking for the police to share the registration they initially searched for. ""It's exhausting doing things whilst black,"" she told PA. ""Because you're just doing every day things and you have to explain yourself away or justify the reason why you're driving through Hackney. It's exhausting and I'm tired of it."" This week Ms Butlerwas named by Vogue magazine,externalas one of the 25 most influential women for her support of Black Lives Matter protests. She has previously described how her backing of the anti-racism movement had led to threats on her office and staff, andlast month had to shut her headquarters for safety reasons.

"Fix contact tracing or shut pubs, mayor says","Andy Burnham attended a service for coronavirus victims in July Pubs may have to shut to allow schools to safely reopen if the NHS Test and Trace system is not ""fixed urgently"", the Greater Manchester mayor has said. Only 53% of people in contact with a coronavirus carrier have been traced in the area,according to data. Mayor Andy Burnham said: ""There is a growing amount of evidence that pubs are one of the main places where this virus spreads."" The BBC has asked the government for a response. Following a rise in infections,residents in parts of northern Englandincluding Greater Manchester have been banned from mixing with other households - apart from those in their support bubbles - in areas such as homes, pubs and private gardens. Pubs are allowed to remain open, however, with different support bubbles banned from mixing. Pubs reopened in England on 4 July Mr Burnham joined calls for the government to improve the contact-tracing system, saying its tracing rate in Greater Manchester was ""nowhere near good enough"". He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""You can't safely open schools with pubs open as well, with that level of performance."" Earlier this month, Prof Chris Bonell from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimatedonly half of contacts were being traced in England, adding the system was ""not achieving the levels we have modelled"". However Local Government Minister Simon Clarke said their figures were higher. On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a ""moral duty"" to get all children back into England's schools in September. Councils have called for funds for more local contact-tracing Mr Burnham said some councils had shut pubs recently after ""a substantial minority"" broke rules. He joined calls from other regions for ""more direct powers"" to close venues that were flouting regulations. The mayor said: ""This NHS test-and-trace system currently is not good enough to go into a winter with no treatment or vaccine, and the sad thing is it'll be our poorest communities that are most exposed. ""We have got August to fix this test-and-trace systemâ¦ and if we haven't then I think there is a real possibility that we will have to close the pubs."" He repeated callsfor government to listen more to regional authorities, urging ministers to give councils extra funds to do more contact tracing locally, including for ""people who can knock on doors and do a better job than this national call centre system"". Earlier this week, Blackburn's public health director said the national system was ""not fast enough"", and authorities in the town said they were ""already seeing benefits"" after launching a tracing system where council staff used local knowledge.

Labour MP blames racism for police car stop,"Dawn Butler said she was pulled over by police while travelling through Hackney A Labour MP has accused police of racially profiling her after she was stopped while travelling in a car in east London. Former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butlertweeted she had been pulled over in Hackney,externaland had recorded the stop. The MP for Brent Central said police had to ""stop associating being black and driving a nice car with crime"". The Met said the stop was a mistake caused by an officer incorrectly entering the car's registration number. She told the Press Association: ""It's obviously racial profiling. ""We know that the police is institutionally racist and what we have to do is weed that out. We have to stop seeing black with crime. We have to stop associating being black and driving a nice car with crime."" The BMW was being driven by a male friend, who is also black, and it was pulled over by two police cars, Ms Butler said. She said officers said the car was registered in North Yorkshire and took the car keys while checking the registration. They then admitted there had been a mistake, that it was registered to the driver, and apologised, she said. Her footage of the stop, which happened at about 12:00 BST on Sunday, showed an officer saying police were carrying out searches because of ""gang and knife crime"". She is heard in the video telling the officers: ""It is really quite irritating. It's like you cannot drive around and enjoy a Sunday afternoon whilst black, because you're going to be stopped by police."" She goes on to say: ""If you are driving outside the area, I think that's a ridiculous reason to stop. ""If you are profiling people who are driving in a certain type of car, that's an inappropriate reason to stop, and if you are profiling people because of the colour of their skin, that's an inappropriate reason to stop."" One of the officers in the video tells her: ""I appreciate everything you say and I do apologise for wasting your time."" Ch Supt Roy Smithtweeted earlier,externalto say he had spoken to the MP who had ""given me a very balanced account of the incident"". The Met Police officer added the force ""are listening"" to concerns she had about the police stop and the officers involved, and she was ""quite entitled to raise them"". Last month the Met apologised after stopping and searching Team GB athletes Bianca Williams and Ricardo dos Santos In a statement the police force said: ""Prior to stopping the vehicle, an officer incorrectly entered the registration into a police computer which identified the car as registered to an address in Yorkshire. ""Upon stopping the vehicle and speaking with the driver, it quickly became apparent that the registration had been entered incorrectly and was registered to the driver in London. ""Once the mistake was realised the officer sought to explain this to the occupants; they were then allowed on their way. ""No searches were carried out on any individuals."" The force said ""one of the occupants"" had been contacted by a senior officer and they had discussed ""subsequent interaction as well as feedback regarding the stop"". It added: ""We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter further with the occupants if they wish to do so."" The statement did not explain why the registration was entered in the first place. In the video, one officer can be heard saying the initial search returned a car of the same make, model and colour but registered to North Yorkshire. Ms Butler questioned the officer, asking for the police to share the registration they initially searched for. ""It's exhausting doing things whilst black,"" she told PA.

Veteran Belarus leader tested by political novice,"An exit poll, conducted by a pro-government organisation, has predicted a landslide victory for Mr Lukashenko The long-time leader of Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko, appears set to declare a landslide victory in an election that saw his toughest opposition challenge in years. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, entered in place of her jailed husband and went on to lead large opposition rallies. But a state TV exit poll showed Mr Lukashenko winning 79.7% of the vote. The opposition had said it expected the vote to be rigged. Protesters have already clashed with police. Squares and streets in the capital Minsk were earlier sealed off by police as Mr Lukashenko vowed that the situation would remain ""under control"". The lead-up to the election sawa crackdown on activists and journalistsamid the country's biggest opposition demonstrations in years. After voting on Sunday, Mr Lukashenko said he did not see Ms Tikhanovskaya as a threat, and denied imposing repressive measures on the opposition. ""They are not worth enough to carry out any repression against them,"" he said. How protests shook up Belarus presidential election Europe's longest serving ruler facing unfamiliar pressure Ms Tikhanovskaya was greeted by an excited crowd chanting her name when she cast her ballot in Minsk earlier on Sunday. Voting was extended at some polling stations due to long queues. There were long queues at polling stations throughout the day The exit poll reported on television, which was conducted by a pro-government organisation, showed Ms Tikhanovskaya receiving just 6.8% of the vote. In a news conference on Sunday evening, Ms Tikhanovskaya said she did not trust that Mr Lukashenko had really won the election. ""I believe my eyes, and I see that the majority is with us,"" she said. Protests erupted following the exit poll, with people detained in the capital and other cities across the country, according to media reports. Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said connectivity had been ""significantly disrupted"", with the situation worsening throughout the day and creating an ""information vacuum"". The head of the election commission, Lidia Yermoshina, urged Ms Tikhanovskaya to accept defeat calmly. The first official results are expected on Sunday night. The opposition said it would keep an alternative count. Sometimes referred to as Europe's last dictator, President Lukashenko, 65, was first elected in 1994. In the last vote in 2015, he was declared winner with 83.5% of the vote. There were no serious challengers and election observers reported problems in the counting and tabulation of votes. This year's election is being held amid growing signs of frustration at his leadership. The campaign saw the rise of Ms Tikhanovskaya, a former teacher who became a stay-at-home mother until she was thrust into the political spotlight. The mother challenging an authoritarian president After her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote, she stepped in to take his place. In the lead-up to the election she told the BBC that people in Belarus did not believe the election would be run fairly. ""But I still believe that our president will understand that his time is over. People don't want him anymore,"" she said. This video can not be played An unexpectedly lively election campaign has revived hope for change in Belarus President Lukashenko has dismissed Ms Tikhanovskaya as a ""poor little girl"", manipulated by foreign ""puppet masters"". Tens of thousands defied an escalating crackdown on the opposition last month to attend a protest in the capital Minsk, the largest such demonstration in a decade. Since the start of the election campaign in May, more than 2,000 people have been detained, according to Human Rights Centre Viasna. On the eve of the vote Ms Tikhanovskaya's team saidher campaign manager had been arrested and would not be released until Monday. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has emerged as the wild card of the race And on Sunday, as people voted,internet service was ""significantly disrupted"", according to online monitor NetBlocks.,externalOpposition supporters say this makes it harder for evidence of election fraud to be collected and shared. There were already concerns over a lack of scrutiny because observers were not invited to monitor the election and more than 40% of votes were cast ahead of election day. There are three other candidates: Anna Kanopatskaya, a former MPwho won a rare seat for the opposition in parliamentary elections in 2016 Sergei Cherechen, the leader of the Social Democrat party Andrei Dmitriyev, the co-chair of the Tell the Truth movement, a campaign group which has been raided by the authorities Two key opposition figures were barred from running and threw their weight behind Ms Tikhanovskaya's campaign. One of them, Valery Tsepkalo, fled Belarus ahead of the contest, fearing arrest. His wife Veronika stayed behind, becoming a key campaigner for Ms Tikhanovskaya. It emerged on Sunday that Ms Tsepkalo had also now left Belarus for Moscow, for ""safety"" reasons. This video can not be played Activists and journalists were rounded up and jailed in Belarus ahead of the election Anger towards Mr Lukashenko's government has been in part fuelled by the response to coronavirus. The president has downplayed the outbreak, advising citizens to drink vodka and use saunas to fight the disease.

'An afternoon tea turned into our surprise wedding',"The ceremony was the first wedding ever at the brewery When Amy Lawson and Darren Wood's wedding was postponed until next year due to the coronavirus pandemic they organised an afternoon tea to mark the original matrimonial date. But just days beforehand the groom's granddad died suddenly from a pulmonary embolism and they decided they did not want to wait any longer to tie the knot. However, they did not want to put pressure on their mothers to help arrange their big day at such short notice so they kept it a secret. The couple, who met at school in Penicuik in Midlothian but got together 10 years ago, said they had several sleepless nights agonising over whether their parents would be upset at the surprise on Saturday. Amy and Darren were worried about how their mothers would react to the surprise Darren, 33, who lives in London with Amy, said: ""We were very nervous for several nights in the lead up to it thinking about all the scenarios about what could happen. ""We have loving mothers but they are both crazy so we were very worried about how they would react."" The Thames Water contract manager added: ""We were heartbroken when we had to put our wedding back a year and then when my grandad died we thought why are we waiting any longer, we hadn't seen our families for six months, and who knows what would happen next year so lets get married now."" The pair had chosen an outdoor area at St Mary's Loch in the Scottish Borders, where Amy's grandmother's ashes are scattered, to have the family afternoon tea. However, when they did a recce they discovered it was overrun with people and motorbikes and so Amy's mother, Gillian Taylor, said they could hold the family ""picnic"" in her garden in Symington, unaware that was in Lanarkshire - three miles outside of the Scottish Borders where the couple had posted their wedding licence. The surprised guests were ""shocked but delighted"" Amy, a food and drinks sales rep, said they were in a panic about where they could hold the wedding as their humanist had to perform the ceremony in the Scottish Borders. They remembered they had bought some beer from a local brewer at Broughton Brewery and asked the owner if they could hold it there. She said: ""We were over the moon and relieved when he said yes and we couldn't believe we were actually going to be married after all. ""Then it hit us what a dangerous game we were playing with our mums. We became very worried especially when my mum phoned a few days beforehand and said how lucky it was that our wedding wasn't on Saturday because her roots were terrible as she hadn't been able to get an appointment at the hairdressers. ""Then my brother, Andrew, who is our best man, showed me the jeans and t-shirt with a tiger on the front that he was going to wear to our afternoon tea and I was mortified but couldn't say anything."" Amy said it was ""nerve wracking"" in moments before everyone could be told. ""When we explained what was happening to everyone there was just complete shock and lots of tears - but thankfully happy ones. ""While it wasn't what we originally planned, it turned out to be an amazing day from start to finish - and we couldn't have asked for any more as everyone was so relaxed as they didn't know what was happening."" Amy's mother Gillian Taylor, 55, from Symington, said: ""I woke up today thinking I was having an afternoon tea with family. ""I was completely shocked but so delighted. It was a perfect surprise."" Darren's mother, Susan Wood, 55, from Penicuik, said: ""We were shocked but it's turned into the perfect day."" There were 19 guests at their wedding at Broughton Brewery on Saturday. David McGowan, owner of Broughton Brewery, said despite only having a few days' notice he managed to personalise bottles of beer for the wedding party. He said: ""I was surprised and delighted when they called and honoured that someone would choose to share their important day with our brewery. ""We have never had a wedding here in the brewery. The brewery has a romantic history and this is a lovely romantic story, so it's great they have chosen to have their big day here."" The original wedding at the National Mining Museum Scotland in Dalkeith in Midlothian for 120 guests will be held now as a big party on 14 August 2021. Amy's dress is still stuck in Madrid where she bought it due to the lockdown so she will wear it at their event next year. Their honeymoon had been planned for South America but now they plan to go to the Lake District.

Pret a Manger to cut staff hours,"Sandwich chain Pret A Manger has confirmed that it has asked thousands of staff to work fewer hours, as part of a post-pandemic restructuring. Despite the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions, trading continues to be slow as many office workers are still at home. Staff in stores have been asked to work about 20% fewer hours than before. A Pret spokeswoman said: ""Our biggest priority is to do everything we can to save jobs.

The firm runs 550 outlets globally, employing 13,000 staff, including 8,000 people in the UK. A majority of Pret stores are now open for significantly fewer hours than they were prior to the pandemic. Trade across the country is understood to be down by 65% since the lockdown came into force in late March. In the City of London, business has fallen by 80%. In July, Pret announced that it would be closing 30 outlets and cutting about 1,000 jobs across its business as part of a post-pandemic restructuring. Pret said 339 of its 410 UK shops have so far reopened following the easing of lockdown restrictions. Consultations are currently ongoing between the firm and the affected employees working at the 30 shops that will not reopen. Pret is also in talks with landlordsabout reducing its rent bill. In May, it appointed advisory firms to help restructure the business, and in April it raised â¬100m (Â£90m) in emergency funding from its banks.

"Fix contact tracing or shut pubs, mayor saysGreater Manchester's mayor says the Covid test-and-trace system needs to be ""fixed urgently"".Manchester","Andy Burnham attended a service for coronavirus victims in July Pubs may have to shut to allow schools to safely reopen if the NHS Test and Trace system is not ""fixed urgently"", the Greater Manchester mayor has said. Only 53% of people in contact with a coronavirus carrier have been traced in the area,according to data. Mayor Andy Burnham said: ""There is a growing amount of evidence that pubs are one of the main places where this virus spreads."" The BBC has asked the government for a response. Following a rise in infections,residents in parts of northern Englandincluding Greater Manchester have been banned from mixing with other households - apart from those in their support bubbles - in areas such as homes, pubs and private gardens. Pubs are allowed to remain open, however, with different support bubbles banned from mixing. Pubs reopened in England on 4 July Mr Burnham joined calls for the government to improve the contact-tracing system, saying its tracing rate in Greater Manchester was ""nowhere near good enough"". He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""You can't safely open schools with pubs open as well, with that level of performance."" Earlier this month, Prof Chris Bonell from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimatedonly half of contacts were being traced in England, adding the system was ""not achieving the levels we have modelled"". However Local Government Minister Simon Clarke said their figures were higher. On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a ""moral duty"" to get all children back into England's schools in September. Councils have called for funds for more local contact-tracing Mr Burnham said some councils had shut pubs recently after ""a substantial minority"" broke rules. He joined calls from other regions for ""more direct powers"" to close venues that were flouting regulations. The mayor said: ""This NHS test-and-trace system currently is not good enough to go into a winter with no treatment or vaccine, and the sad thing is it'll be our poorest communities that are most exposed. ""We have got August to fix this test-and-trace systemâ¦ and if we haven't then I think there is a real possibility that we will have to close the pubs."" He repeated callsfor government to listen more to regional authorities, urging ministers to give councils extra funds to do more contact tracing locally, including for ""people who can knock on doors and do a better job than this national call centre system"". Earlier this week, Blackburn's public health director said the national system was ""not fast enough"", and authorities in the town said they were ""already seeing benefits"" after launching a tracing system where council staff used local knowledge.

Backpacker murder probe closed after 20 years,"Kirsty Jones was raped and strangled in Thailand in 2000 A 20-year investigation into the murder of backpacker Kirsty Jones has been closed. Ms Jones, 23, died in Thailand where the 20-year statute of limitations on the case ended on Sunday. No-one can now be prosecuted for the rape and strangulation of the young woman from Tredomen, near Brecon, Powys, at a guesthouse in August 2000. Speaking ahead of the 20th anniversary, her mother Sue Jones said it was ""a really sad time for us as a family"". ""We have worked hard over all of these years to keep the Thai authorities interested in Kirsty's case and to ensure that the investigation continued to try to identify the persons responsible for her murder,"" she said. Kirsty Jones murder: Mother speaks of her 'emptiness' 20 years on Return Thai murder victim's belongings, says MP She added that her ""bright, intelligent, independent"" daughter had the ""world at her feet"". ""Kirsty has gone from our lives, whilst her killer remains at large,"" she said. ""Had they been brought to justice the sadness and emptiness would remain the same but it may have brought us some closure. ""I hope we have done her proud in trying to get justice.""

Det Supt Phillips, of Dyfed Powys Police, said: ""No-one has ever been prosecuted for Kirsty's murder and the Thai Department of Specialist Investigations has now closed the case, meaning a permanent end to the investigation.

Parents' 'petrifying' choice on lockdown heart op,"This video can not be played Brayden was born with a congenital heart disease As though the prospect of undergoing open heart surgery was not daunting enough, seven-year-old Brayden had to do it during a global crisis. As the coronavirus pandemic took hold during lockdown, his parents watched his congenital heart disease worsen. They faced the terrifying choice between an operation to ultimately save his life and the risks of Covid-19. However, after eight hours of surgery, the little ""Rhondda heart warrior"" is home and looking forward to Disneyland. Born premature, weighing less than 5lbs (2.26kg), Brayden was diagnosed with pulmonary atresia, a condition which prevents the heart valve forming properly. He had surgery when just seven weeks old to fit an artificial artery but his parents, Emma and Craig Bull, always knew a second, larger operation would be needed. They just never imagined it would be during a pandemic. It was not until he was six that the signs began to show that his heart was deteriorating. The stent was old and the left ventricle was not growing properly, putting pressure on the right one. Doctors said Brayden would need a transplant this year. Then coronavirus struck. Brayden's condition worsened during lockdown Brayden was immediately shielded but his illness and other conditions meant he was at 'high risk'. ""What can you say? I just couldn't believe this was happening,"" said Emma, 37. ""So much was going through my head, seeing [the virus] get closer to home, looking at risks and possibilities. ""The thought of him having this surgery in this pandemic, with him being so vulnerable, was terrifying. I had this fear he was going to catch it. ""We were reassured they would try to fit Brayden in, in the safest way possible. But he would need a heart by-pass for several hours and what scared me was knowing nothing is totally safe. ""It felt like I was potentially putting his life at risk, but even when Brayden was shielding, he was deteriorating at home. ""He was very sleepy throughout the day and sometimes would go quite blue around the mouth. ""So I knew, if he stayed at home, he could die and there would be nothing I could do. That scared me even more. ""It was a horrible position to be in and we were petrified not knowing what to do for the best."" They opted for the surgery, but after travelling from their home in Tylorstown, Rhondda Cynon Taf, to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, the procedure was cancelled due to emergency admissions. Brayden was on a heart by-pass during the eight-hour operation They returned a week later to a hospital that was unlike any they were used to - and a changed city. ""The hospital looked scary,"" admitted Emma. ""The staff looked as if they had come from space with all their kit on and with all the security and restrictions, it just didn't feel right. It felt a bit like a prison."" What do the latest lockdown rules mean? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales NHS gets Â£800m to prepare for virus second wave To Emma and Craig, things did not feel much better outside. Just days earlier, astatue of a slave trader had been pulled downand thrown into the city's harbour during Black Lives Matter protests. ""We had to keep ourselves busy during surgery but walking the streets of Bristol at that time felt daunting. We just didn't know what to do with ourselves,"" she recalled. Brayden is hoping he can go to the park for the first time since February when shielding finishes With the hospital's family rooms taken and nearby hotels closed, Emma spent the week sleeping on different hospital beds as Brayden recovered. ""It was difficult because I had left the rest of my family at home and I was on my own. There was no-one there who could even give me a cuddle because it wasn't allowed,"" she said. However, not only was the operation a success but Brayden made a ""remarkable"" recovery and just five days later, he was home. He is getting stronger each day and having self-isolated since February, is making plans for whenshielding ends on 16 August. ""It's been tough on his brothers and sister because all they hear from me is, 'Don't touch Brayden', 'don't cough or sneeze over him', 'wash your hands', "" said Emma. Do people still have to shield? A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS: Your coronavirus stories ""I couldn't help wrap him up in cotton wool but I'm starting to ease off a little now because I know his heart is fixed. ""He has really missed his school friends, who sent a lovely video message with their teacher, and he wants to go to the park. But the first thing he said after the operation was to go to Disneyland."" ""He's always showing off his scar... he's quite proud of it,"" said Emma Family and friends hope to make that happen by fundraising with the help of the Heart Heroes charity. ""I think he's inspired a lot of people who have followed him through it all. That support has been amazing and has kept me going,"" said Emma. ""They've nicknamed him the Rhondda Heart Warrior and that's just what he is. ""You do feel guilt, that this little boy has been through so much throughout his life and then has this surgery during a pandemic. I can't describe how proud I am of him.""

Has pandemic made more want to be their own boss?,"Anne-Marie Harben at her new salon: ""It's exceeded expectations"" ""It's the best thing I've ever done"", says hairdresser, Anne-Marie Harben who set up her own business last month. You might be forgiven for thinking that the creation of new start-ups might have radically slowed down during the Covid-19 pandemic, but that's not necessarily the case. The number of new businesses registered in Wales from April to July was just 10.7% lower than the same period in 2019 - with the equivalent figures for the past two months actually higher. And with the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales saying it has seen an increase in inquiries from people looking to become self-employed, are more people mulling the possibility of becoming their own boss? It's certainly been the case for Anne-Marie, 48, who opened BooDops Hair Solutions in July in Porthcawl, Bridgend county. ""I had a phone call in June saying a business premises had come available and it was an old barbers shop. So I decided to go for it,"" she said. Redundancies up fivefold as coronavirus hits jobs Lack of furlough 'barrier' to local lockdown Holiday bookings boom as tourism reopens The street where shop owners just want to reopen Anne-Marie has been a hairdresser for 32 years but decided it was time to go into business for herself. ""I had four weeks to revamp the premises before we opened on 13 July. It's been crazy, I've been working 12 to 13 hours a day nearly everyday, It's been that busy,"" she said. ""Everything is by appointment and we adhere to social distancing with one in, one out of the salon, but it's exceeded expectations. I had more clients in the first week than I'd usually do in a month where I've worked previously. I just hope it continues."" As well as being a unisex hairdresser, the business also provides custom-made wigs and hair enhancers. ""After three decades in this industry this is the most valued I've felt,"" said Anne-Marie. ""I think people have realised how important hairdressers are to people's morale and confidence."" While Anne-Marie's new business is booming her biggest concern for the future is more uncertainty around the virus. ""I just hope to God we don't get a second wave and another lockdown and so do the clients. ""To close would be a massive loss for a business in its first few months of operating.  But I'm positive and I'm feeling it's the best thing I've done and I love meeting new people coming through the door of my salon."" Shayne Yates, 42, Ceredigion closed the restaurant he was running to take a different path Meanwhile Shayne Yates, 42, from Cardigan, Ceredigion, closed the restaurant which he was running with his family in the town when lockdown hit and which they are still waiting to reopen. He was also employed as head of business services at Antur Teifi. After leaving his role there, Shayne started his own company, All Business Solutions, during the pandemic. Shayne said he always had a passion for helping businesses and has had a busy two months reconnecting with old contacts after launched his own company on 4 May. ""There was a concern when Covid-19 unravelled, I had many of those deepest conversations with regards to direction, this also balanced with the restaurant being severely affected too,"" he said. ""However, doing what I do now is more like a calling, it's what I was made to do, after working across an industry non-stop for 25 years it becomes part of you. I've always been passionate to make a difference, to have a long-lasting effect on businesses I support and help to go forward."" Is this the end of office working? While there is great uncertainty for businesses coming out of lockdown and the future, Shayne said his business is now in a place to help other firms. ""Fear and trepidation has now become confidence which will shape around reality as we go forward,"" he said. Between April and July, 6,457 new companies were registered in Wales, versus 7,232 during the same period last year, according to data from Companies House. That is a year-on-year drop of 10.7%. However, the number of new businesses registered in June (1,781) and in July (1,933) were both up on the equivalent figures for 2019 - increases of 18.9% and 16.7% respectively. Despite much of the country's industry and services shutting down to prevent the spread of coronavirus during lockdown, FSB Wales said it had seen an increase in inquiries from people looking to become self-employed. Ben Francis, of the FSB, said: ""We know that businesses are started for a number of reasons; because of the opportunity to exploit an entrepreneurial spark, because of the ability to have more flexibility outside of traditional employment, and sometimes it's as a result of the economic landscape and its impact on jobs. ""We don't yet know what the impact of coronavirus will be on the economic landscape in the longer term, and, in turn, whether this will lead to people starting up on their own because of a lack of opportunities in the job market. ""What we do know, is that Wales is a nation of entrepreneurs who make a huge contribution to our economy, and that there must be significant support for self-employment from Welsh Government in order to help provide a bridge for those who might choose to move from employment to working for themselves.""

Kirsty Jones' mother on 'emptiness' 20 years on,"Kirsty Jones was backpacking in Thailand when she was killed in 2000 The mother of murdered Welsh backpacker Kirsty Jones has spoken of her ""emptiness"" as an international investigation into her death ends. Ms Jones was killed in Thailand where the 20-year statute of limitations on the case ends on 9 August. After that no-one can be prosecuted for Kirsty's rape and strangulation at a guesthouse in August 2000. Her mum, Sue Jones, said it was a ""sad time"" for the family as they remembered a woman with ""the world at her feet"". ""We have worked hard over all of these years to keep the Thai authorities interested in Kirsty's case and to ensure that the investigation continued to try to identify the persons responsible for her murder,"" she said. ""Kirsty was a bright, intelligent, independent young woman who had the world at her feet. ""Kirsty has gone from our lives, whilst her killer remains at large. ""Had they been brought to justice the sadness and emptiness would remain the same, but it may have brought us some closure."" Kirsty Jones: Days remain to find backpacker's killer Thai beach murders: Death sentence upheld by Supreme Court Thailand's disappeared Karen activist Billy and the burned village Ms Jones' mother said she hoped her daughter would be proud of the family's attempts to get justice. And she said she was ""confident"" the Thai investigation into the 23-year-old's death would have ended years ago were it not for the efforts of Dyfed-Powys Police. ""We are now in contact with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office so that we can finally get Kirsty's belongings back home with us,"" she said. Det Supt Gary Phillips said Dyfed-Powys Police had kept in regular contact with the Thai authorities. The force's officers had travelled to Thailand several times to work on the investigation, he said. Det Supt Phillips added that the Thai police had now closed the case and shared the family's ""deep disappointment"" no-one had been brought to justice. In May 2000, Kirsty Sara Jones left her home in Tredomen, near Brecon, Powys, for a solo backpacking holiday around the world. The 23-year-old visited Singapore and Malaysia before moving on to Chiang Mai, Thailand, in early August 2000. She checked into a guest house and went trekking in nearby mountains, sightseeing and meeting new people. During the early hours of 10 August, after enjoying an evening with friends, Kirsty was attacked and murdered in her room. Her body was found the next morning, triggering an investigation that would span 20 years and two continents. The case was closed in 2001 due to insufficient evidence, but Dyfed-Powys Police successfully lobbied to get it re-opened. Despite several arrests, no-one was ever charged with Kirsty's murder.

"When the virus came to our hospitalAs the Covid-19 pandemic loomed, the staff at one hospital braced themselves. Nothing would turn out as they expected.","As the Covid-19 pandemic loomed, the staff at one hospital in the English Midlands braced themselves. Quickly they found themselves at the centre of a coronavirus hotspot - and nothing turned out as they anticipated. Liz Rees sat down at her dining room table to take the call. It was a Sunday in early March and, from down the line, a voice was telling her about some test results that had just come back from the lab. This wasn't a normal diagnosis. Liz Rees Dudley, the town where Liz has worked for 20 years as a consultant microbiologist, had its first case of Covid-19. That, in itself, wasn't a surprise. She'd watched on TV as the virus had spread from Asia to continental Europe before reaching the south of England; it had already been detected in nearby Birmingham and Wolverhampton. ""There was an inevitability about it,"" she says. ""But the first one makes it real."" Liz was the doctor in charge of infection prevention and control at Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley. She'd spent her career anticipating what to do in the event of a pandemic. And she knew the town - a one-time industrial powerhouse, the capital of the Black Country - intimately. Her husband joked she was attached to an elastic band that wouldn't stretch more than 10 miles out of Quinton, the nearby Birmingham suburb where she was brought up. Still sitting in her dining room, Liz hastily convened an incident meeting over the phone with hospital staff. There was a list of things to check: That the patient was receiving the best possible care. That the staff on the ward were comfortable with what they were doing. Which infection precautions needed to be put in place. The mood was calm. Everyone had a plan to follow. But this was uncharted territory. ""I think we were aware that we would probably be getting more cases within days,"" says Liz. For some time now, a Yorkshireman named Paul Hudson had also been anticipating that the outbreak would reach Dudley - and thinking hard about how to respond. But the first case came as a shock: ""It wasn't from somewhere we expected."" Paul's job was divided in two. He spent half his time as consultant anaesthetist at the hospital, a role he'd occupied since 2009, and the other half as deputy medical director of the trust that runs it. Paul Hudson As the virus approached, he'd been closely involved in planning what to do - drawing up new guidelines; working out how to ""zone"" new arrivals at the front door into Covid and non-Covid streams; setting up a respiratory emergency department; and making sure there was enough stuff - oxygen, personal protective equipment, ventilators, drugs and people. ""We had, I think, quite a good plan in place,"" Paul says. It was just a question of waiting for patients with severe respiratory symptoms to start showing up at the door. But that wasn't what happened, at least not at first. ""All of a sudden, we had a patient - an in-patient - test positive,"" says Paul. This individual was being treated for something else entirely, having been admitted before they started showing symptoms. There were protocols in place for dealing with a situation like this to stop the virus spreading - but it was a difficult start all the same. ""I think that set the tone for a lot of the next few weeks and months,"" says Paul. ""That has been, I think, one of the themes of this illness - that it has been unpredictable."" Qadar Zada sat in his office at the hospital. He'd been born less than a mile away and never lived anywhere other than Dudley. And yet everything around felt new to him. In January 2020, Qadar had started as deputy head of operations at the trust. Part of his job involved making sure medical staff had all the support they need to do theirs. He'd spent his career working in NHS management and felt he had a good idea of what had to be done. There was a problem, though - most of his colleagues were strangers to him. Qadar Zada ""For me, I think the biggest challenge personally was that I didn't know people in the organisation,"" he says. The plan to give him a structured induction fell away. As the workload increased, no-one had time for a getting-to-know-you chat: ""So at the point that we were talking to people about planning things, I was having to introduce myself."" There was also the duty he, a local councillor, felt towards his community. ""I was worried, obviously, for those people in Dudley, family that I have in Dudley,"" he says. ""I was worried for colleagues in the trust as well. But I was also aware of everybody's responsibility, including my own."" On 8 March, the day Tesco beganrestricting salesdue to stockpiling and the UK Foreign Office advised againsttravelling to northern Italy, Dudley's first Covid-19 case was diagnosed. Three days later, the first fatality in the town attributed to the virus was reported in the local press. By 15 March the death toll stood at two, then rose to five by 18 March, then seven by the following day. On 20 March, Health Secretary Matt Hancocksaid,externalthe government was looking at why there was a ""hotspot"" across the West Midlands region. According to Liz, the patients who died in the early days of the outbreak in Dudley were already very ill with underlying conditions. Typically, these deaths came rapidly after diagnosis. ""By the time the result was back, possibly within 24 hours, they had died,"" she says. ""It was clear at that point that this can be a really difficult disease to deal with."" For everyone at the hospital, all this was new. ""People were learning what these patients look like when they came through the front door,"" says Liz. ""The severity of the illness, and the breadth of people it could affect, was a bit of an eye-opener."" On the top floor of the administration block, a large office suite normally used for hosting seminars had been transformed. There were information boards around the walls and blinking computer monitors. A screen was tuned to the BBC News channel around the clock. This was the trust's Covid incident room - a hub for all data coming in and going out of the trust. ""We were man-marking every single swab,"" says Qadar. The incident room received contact tracing information and produced situation reports throughout the day. There was also a PPE line for staff who needed personal protective equipment. As well as carrying out its own modelling of how the virus might spread in Dudley, the trust was receiving projections from Public Health England, the local authority and other NHS agencies. They warned how bad the impending peak could get. ""At one point, the worst-case scenario, we were trying to plan for receiving up to 20 critically ill patients an hour for a number of days,"" says Paul. Back then, the hospital had just nine ventilated beds and another eight that offered advanced respiratory support. ""That just doesn't work, do you know what I mean?"" On 23 March, the prime minister told the UK: ""You must stay at home."" Dudley joined the rest of the country in lockdown. At the same time, the surge in patient numbers everyone had been expecting was beginning. Typically, ""the people here are stoical and tend to present late - a salt-of-the-earth type thing"", says Liz - but that wasn't the case any more. Covid patients were starting to turn up at the doors in large numbers, and a significant proportion of them were incredibly sick. According to Paul, those that weren't already acutely unwell when they arrived would typically deteriorate rapidly within days. Between 23 and 25 March, the number of confirmed cases in the town jumped from 26 to 40. By 27 March, the number of Covid-related deaths stood at 17; four days later, that figure had nearly doubled to 30. Around this time, a workaround for the concerns about ventilator capacity presented itself. The trust had received guidance that a form of non-invasive ventilation called Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) could be useful for Covid patients - either as a bridge to the usual mechanical ventilation techniques or as an alternative to them. The Army had been drafted in to deliver essential supplies like PPE and oxygen to hospitals, and Paul recalls telling an officer - ""I kid you not, his name was Major Tom"" - that he worried the hospital was under-resourced when it came to CPAP machines. Soon afterwards a lorry turned up with 25 of them. ""And at that point, you could feel the mood around the place change a little bit,"" says Paul: it gave medical staff the confidence that they could take treatment decisions on the basis of patient need, not hospital capacity. Ten operating theatres and a recovery area were transformed into a massive critical care facility, and the respiratory and high-dependency wards had been converted into a Covid-only CPAP unit ward. It wasn't a moment too soon. The peak arrived in early April. The parts of the hospital reserved for routine treatment were eerily quiet. According to Paul, ""Our non-Covid work just fell off the edge of the cliff."" But in the Covid zones, the pace was becoming frenetic. By Sunday 5 April - the day the prime minister was admitted to hospital in London having already tested positive - the number of confirmed cases in the borough of Dudley had soared to 283. Three days later, it was announced that the number of hospital deaths stood at 106. Liz recalls a single day in early April during which 58 new positive test results from the hospital came through, and not feeling particularly surprised by the number. For most of that month, anaesthetic and critical care medics worked an intensive shift pattern - three long days, three days off, three nights, three more days off. Staff worked outside their comfort zones, carrying out tasks and working in departments that weren't part of their day jobs. Keeping rotas fully staffed became a huge challenge, not just for doctors and nurses but in every part of the hospital - at one point hundreds of employees were absent, either because they had fallen ill themselves or they were following advice to self-isolate. The pressure faced by these front-line workers was unprecedented, says Paul. ""Trying to shout through the mask at people you barely recognise because you can only see the strip of their eyes - while the patients were incredibly sick and prone to very acute deterioration,"" he says. ""You think you're making progress - and all of a sudden, they'd have these surges of deterioration where for the next four to six hours you're just trying to hold the tide back."" The prohibition on visiting made the task even harder, he adds: ""Not having the relatives there to communicate with properly, and having to do everything shouted through a mask down the phone - I think it made it very, very, very difficult for a lot of our staff."" ""All your decisions are a little bit more demanding,"" recalls Liz. ""Your life has become a very narrow spectrum because the world's shut down around you. So either you're at home, or you're at work, and when your work is like mine.... I got to the point where I stopped listening to the news because I'd been dealing with it all day."" To add to the breakdown in boundaries between her home and professional lives, Liz's daughter was working on a Covid ward in Sheffield as a junior doctor. ""It's been a family business,"" she adds dryly. The hospital never ran out of PPE - the trust, aided by the dedicated phone line in the incident room, did its job. But the local community played a crucial role, too, in preventing stocks from running out. ""At one point, volunteers were making visors because we couldn't get any,"" says Qadar. One consultant surgeon helped source acetate for the front of them with the help of his daughter, a teacher, who regularly ordered it for classroom supplies. ""At one point I was wearing a pair of goggles donated to us by the chemistry department at a local school,"" says Paul. ""One of my colleagues had a welder's mask, which looked really great - it was a kind of a mirrored black lens that was slightly less helpful when trying to look after people, because you couldn't see through it."" One evening, Paul turned up for a nightshift to discover there were no new Covid patients. Then the following night, there wasn't another patient either. And then a few days passed without any more. The hospital staff could start to believe that the peak had passed. Planning the recovery stage would be the next challenge. The non-emergency workload began to climb again, too. And everyone was well aware they needed to prepare for the possibility of subsequent spikes in infections. But as the regular Thursday night clapping ritual drew to an end, they were able to take satisfaction in what they had achieved. ""You can look back and actually see that while what was done was really, on reflection, quite amazing actually,"" says Liz. ""I think there's still a little bit of fear in the background about a second wave. But I think having done it once before, I think we know what we need to do.""

Trump signs virus aid order after talks collapse,"The president spoke to reporters on Saturday from his golf club in New Jersey US President Donald Trump has taken executive action to provide economic aid to millions of Americans hit by the pandemic, saying he was forced to do so after talks at Congress broke down. The directives include measures to support the unemployed, suspend payroll tax and extend student loans. Some of them are likely to face legal challenges given that Congress controls federal spending, not the president. Democratic rival Joe Biden said they were ""a series of half-baked measures"". It is not known whether the move will mean the end of talks between senior government officials and top Democrats for a stimulus package. Negotiations broke down on Friday after two weeks. Why US is expecting an 'avalanche' of evictions The millions of Americans 'hanging by a thread' Mr Trump said the measures would provide up to $400 (Â£306) per week in supplemental unemployment benefits to tens of millions of jobless Americans. This is less than the $600 people had been receiving until 31 July, when the benefit expired. The president also said states would cover 25% of the new payments - the previous benefit was fully funded by the federal government. He is seeking to divert money from a previously approved disaster aid to states. Mr Trump said it would be up to the states, which already face huge budget shortfalls due to the pandemic, to determine how much to be used from that fund to pay for the benefit. This means that the extra payment may end up amounting only to $300 a week. ""This is the money they need, this is the money they want, this gives them an incentive to go back to work,"" President Trump said of the lower payments during a news conference on Saturday from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. The measures also included a suspension of the collection of payroll taxes - which pay for Social Security and other federal programmes - through to the end of this year, a suspension of federal student loan payments, and efforts to minimise evictions but not a moratorium.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful elected Democrat, said they lowered the figure in talks to $2tn but Republicans had proposed a $1tn plan. Mrs Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer dismissed the president's actions as ""meagre"", saying they were ""unworkable, weak and narrow policy announcements"" in the face of the economic and health crises. Mr Biden, President Trump's rival in the November election, accused him of putting Social Security ""at grave risk"" by delaying the collection of payroll taxes, and called the measures ""another cynical ploy designed to deflect responsibility"".

Redundancies up fivefold as coronavirus hits jobs,"""It's been really upsetting and stressful,"" says Will Bird, an events producer who was recently made redundant. Mr Bird will need to move out of his apartment soon as he can no longer afford the rent without a job. The number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, figures obtained by the BBC show. A Freedom of Information request shows that in June 1,778 firms said were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In June 2019, only 345 firms had plans to cut 24,000 jobs. The cuts came as coronavirus wiped more than a quarter off UK economic output. The figures give an insight into the surge of redundancies announced since coronavirus blighted the UK. Airbus, Royal Mail, the airport services group Swissport, HSBC, Centrica and the Restaurant Group, owner of Frankie and Benny's, were among the businesses to announce redundancy plans in June. Firms planning to make 20 or more staff redundant have to notify the government by filing a form called an HR1 Advance Notice of Redundancy. The number of these forms filed with the Insolvency Service shows a steep rise in the number of firms planning to cut staff. Events producer William Bird has been made redundant after four years with his firm William Bird, 27, had been working as an assistant producer at an events agency in London that creates tailored experiences for big brands. He was furloughed in April, and then at the end of June, he was told that he was being made redundant, after four years with the firm. ""Unfortunately, right now members of the public do not feel safe to attend events... so at the end of June, I was told that my company had done everything to try to retain me, but due to the lack of work coming in, they didn't have the financial backing to keep me on,"" he told the BBC. Mr Bird said it had been a ""difficult year in general"", as his mother passed away from cancer a few weeks into lockdown. ""It's been really upsetting and stressful. I've gone from having a tragedy in the family, to looking for work, and at the end of August I'm going to have to move out from the flat I rent in London with my girlfriend because we can't afford it anymore,"" he said. He says he only received three weeks' of redundancy pay as he was on rolling contracts during his first year with the firm. And he is upset that his month of notice in July was paid at the 80% furlough rate, rather than the full salary listed in his contract. The only consolation to the situation, says Mr Bird, is that his firm didn't want to let him go: ""They told me that this wasn't performance-based at all, and that they were making difficult decisions for the future of the company, with the hope that after the industry recovered, they'd love to offer me my job back."" The figures from May and June show a substantial increase from the same months the previous year, and from March and April, when the coronavirus lockdown began. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: ""I would expect it to be bigger in July and bigger again in August, because there was a wave of firms that announced redundancies in the first week of July and the first week of August. ""I think it is inevitable now that redundancy numbers will be higher than they were at the peak of the last recession in 2008."" Companies including WH Smith, Dyson, Dixons Carphone, John Lewis, and Casual Dining Group have all announced redundancies recently, and there has beena surge in requests for redundancy advice,external. Adding up the total number of dismissals planned shows a similar picture of stricken employers cutting staff. Though the June figure excludes information from 79 firms, which was not available when the numbers were compiled, it shows a steep rise in the number of positions being considered for redundancy. The total number of employers making redundancies will be higher than these figures, as firms making fewer than 20 posts redundant at any one ""establishment"" do not have to notify government. However, employers often end up making fewer redundancies than the original number they notify to the government. The redundancy process takes time. It includes a consultation period of a minimum of 30 days for 20 staff and over, and 45 days for 100 or more staff. This helps to explain why official redundancy figures gathered by the Office for National Statistics do not yet show a significant rise. In Northern Ireland HR1 forms are filed with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and they are not included in these figures. In response to the BBC's findings the Department for Work and Pensions pointed to the measures it has introduced to try to support those looking for work. ""Across the country our Plan for Jobs will give business the confidence to recruit and retain workers... and - through the Kickstart scheme - create hundreds of thousands of new, subsidised jobs for young people,"" a spokesperson said.

What are my rights if I am made redundant?,"As the government's furlough scheme ends, some employers may decide they can't afford to keep paying all their staff. What are your rights if you're made redundant? When a business needs to reduce its workforce, it closes jobs, and the people doing those jobs are made redundant. It's not the same as getting the sack. If you are made redundant, you have a number of legal rights. You must be chosen fairly. Reasons not considered ""fair"" include: Your age, race, gender, sexual orientation or religious belief You are pregnant You have been a whistle-blower You are a member of a trade union You have asked for holiday or maternity leave If you are selected for any of these reasons, it could be classed asunfair dismissal,external. Employers may make selections based on length of service (last in, first out) or disciplinary records. Many firms ask for volunteers, and offer an enhanced redundancy payment. But employers don't have to select volunteers. Companies could make staff redundant while they were on furlough, as long as the employer wasn't still claiming government support for the role. But the same rules of fairness applied. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external What is changing after furlough? How many people could lose their jobs? No. The amount of notice you are given will depend on how long you have been employed: At least one week's notice if you have been employed between one month and two years One week's notice for each year if employed between two and 12 years 12 weeks' notice if employed for 12 years or more Anyone being made redundant is entitled to a consultation with their employer. If an employer is cutting 20 or more jobs at any one time, it must organise a collective consultation involving a union or employee representative. This must start at least 30 days before anyone's job ends. If 100 or more people are being made redundant, group meetings must start at least 45 days before anyone's job ends. Even if a company is insolvent and is shutting down, there is still a consultation process. If you've worked continuously for your employer for two years or more, you have the legal right to redundancy pay. There is a statutory minimum, but some employers are more generous. The amount depends on your age, length of continuous service, and current salary. You will get at least: Half a week's pay for each full year worked when you're under 22 A week's pay for each full year worked when you're between 22 and 41 One and a half week's pay for each full year worked when you're 41 or older An employer isn't obliged to pay you more than Â£16,320, or Â£16,980 in Northern Ireland.

Test and trace 'key' to return,"Current testing and contact tracing is inadequate to prevent a second wave of coronavirus after schools in the UK reopen, scientists have warned. Increased transmission would also result from parents not having to stay at home with their children, they say. Researchers said getting pupils back to school was important - but more work was needed to keep the virus in check. The head of the NHS test and trace scheme said it was ""already delivering"" and on the right track for future. Baroness Dido Harding said: ""I absolutely don't accept that this is failure, it's the opposite."" She said more testing is required but maintained the current level of contact tracing was ""well within the bounds"" of what the researchers ""are saying is necessary"". The UK government said plans were in place to ensure schools can reopen safely at the start of the school year. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate contact tracing systems. Asked about the estimate that only 50% of contacts are being traced in England, Simon Clarke, minister for regional growth, told the BBC government figures were higher. He said NHS test and trace is ""maturing all the time"" and getting children back to school in the autumn is a ""top priority"" that the government would not ""be willing to trade"". ""You're building an entirely new infrastructure which there's no precedent for,"" he said. ""But we're confident it is working, we're confident that it will continue to improve, and we're confident that it will allow schools to open safely in the autumn."" Dr David Nabarro, the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid-19, said the virus is ""capable of surging back really quickly"" and stressed the importance of being able to trace, test and isolate people. ""If we can do that, and do it well, then the surges are kept really small, they're dealt with quickly and life can go on,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He later said he thinks Britain ""will do really well"" because there is ""really good attention to where the virus is locally"" and a lot of ""public engagement in getting on top of it"". A government spokesman said local authorities will ""be able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases"". LOCKDOWN LIMIT:Can we lift lockdown any further? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Researchers from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used computer models to see how the virus might spread in the UK as pupils returned to the classroom and their parents were more able to go back to work or resume other activities. The study assumes childrenare less likely to catch- and therefore spread - coronavirus and that some parents would continue to work from home. As first reported in June, the combined effect on pupils and parents would be enough to cause a second wave if there was no effective test-and-trace programme. This would happen around December 2020 and would be twice as big as the first peak, unless the government took other actions such as reimposing lockdown. The study,now formally published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health,external, shows a second wave could be prevented if: both 75% of people with Covid symptoms were found and 68% of their contacts traced or both 87% of people with symptoms were found and 40% of their contacts traced However, the researchers said NHS test and trace in England was falling short. They estimate only half of contacts are being traced and while it is harder to know the percentage of people being tested, they say this also appears too low. ""It is not achieving the levels we have modelled. It doesn't look good enough to me,"" said Prof Chris Bonell, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, from UCL, added: ""With UK schools reopening fully in September, prevention of a second wave will require a major scale-up of testing to test 75% of symptomatic infections - combined with tracing of 68% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases."" How test-and-trace works: People with symptoms of cough, fever or loss of sense of smell or taste are tested If they are positive for coronavirus, they isolate for 10 days and their household does so for 14 days They have to inform the NHS of everyone they have come into close contact with These contacts must also spend 14 days in quarantine Postcode search: See case numbers in your area GCSE students allowed to drop poetry in 2021 exams Schools will be ready for September - minister Schools have been shut around the world as countries used lockdowns to control the spread of Covid-19. It is estimated1.6 billion children,externalhave been kept out of the classroom. In the UK, schools closed on 20 March, except to children of key workers or vulnerable children. On 1 June, they began a limited reopening for early years pupils, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Schools are due to restart for all children in Scotland on 11 August and across the UK in early September. But every step taken to open up society makes it easier for the coronavirus to spread. Cases arealready starting to riseand the idea of closing pubs in order to open schoolshas already been floated. The UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has said ""we are near the limit"" of what we can do without causing a resurgence. The individual nations of the UK have their own contact tracing systems. The government said NHS test and trace in England has reached 80% of those testing positive and traced over 75% of their contacts. The Welsh government said its advisory group recommended that schools open in September with all pupils present on site, and ""we should be aiming to trace an estimated 80% of contacts, at least 35% of which are to be traced within 24 hours"". Since 21 June, 90% of close contacts were reached by the service,according to Welsh government figures,external. A Scottish government spokesperson said guidance set out ""a number of specific risk-mitigation measures that will need to be introduced"" including an ""enhanced surveillance programme"". In Northern Ireland,the latest figures for the week to 29 July,externalshowed 98% of contacts were successfully reached by the country's contact tracing service.

Redundancies up fivefold as coronavirus hits jobsA Freedom of Information request shows a rapid rise in firms in June saying they were cutting staff.Business,"""It's been really upsetting and stressful,"" says Will Bird, an events producer who was recently made redundant. Mr Bird will need to move out of his apartment soon as he can no longer afford the rent without a job. The number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, figures obtained by the BBC show. A Freedom of Information request shows that in June 1,778 firms said were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In June 2019, only 345 firms had plans to cut 24,000 jobs. The cuts came as coronavirus wiped more than a quarter off UK economic output. The figures give an insight into the surge of redundancies announced since coronavirus blighted the UK. Airbus, Royal Mail, the airport services group Swissport, HSBC, Centrica and the Restaurant Group, owner of Frankie and Benny's, were among the businesses to announce redundancy plans in June. Firms planning to make 20 or more staff redundant have to notify the government by filing a form called an HR1 Advance Notice of Redundancy. The number of these forms filed with the Insolvency Service shows a steep rise in the number of firms planning to cut staff. Events producer William Bird has been made redundant after four years with his firm William Bird, 27, had been working as an assistant producer at an events agency in London that creates tailored experiences for big brands. He was furloughed in April, and then at the end of June, he was told that he was being made redundant, after four years with the firm. ""Unfortunately, right now members of the public do not feel safe to attend events... so at the end of June, I was told that my company had done everything to try to retain me, but due to the lack of work coming in, they didn't have the financial backing to keep me on,"" he told the BBC. Mr Bird said it had been a ""difficult year in general"", as his mother passed away from cancer a few weeks into lockdown. ""It's been really upsetting and stressful. I've gone from having a tragedy in the family, to looking for work, and at the end of August I'm going to have to move out from the flat I rent in London with my girlfriend because we can't afford it anymore,"" he said. He says he only received three weeks' of redundancy pay as he was on rolling contracts during his first year with the firm. And he is upset that his month of notice in July was paid at the 80% furlough rate, rather than the full salary listed in his contract. The only consolation to the situation, says Mr Bird, is that his firm didn't want to let him go: ""They told me that this wasn't performance-based at all, and that they were making difficult decisions for the future of the company, with the hope that after the industry recovered, they'd love to offer me my job back."" The figures from May and June show a substantial increase from the same months the previous year, and from March and April, when the coronavirus lockdown began. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: ""I would expect it to be bigger in July and bigger again in August, because there was a wave of firms that announced redundancies in the first week of July and the first week of August. ""I think it is inevitable now that redundancy numbers will be higher than they were at the peak of the last recession in 2008."" Companies including WH Smith, Dyson, Dixons Carphone, John Lewis, and Casual Dining Group have all announced redundancies recently, and there has beena surge in requests for redundancy advice,external. Adding up the total number of dismissals planned shows a similar picture of stricken employers cutting staff. Though the June figure excludes information from 79 firms, which was not available when the numbers were compiled, it shows a steep rise in the number of positions being considered for redundancy. The total number of employers making redundancies will be higher than these figures, as firms making fewer than 20 posts redundant at any one ""establishment"" do not have to notify government. However, employers often end up making fewer redundancies than the original number they notify to the government. The redundancy process takes time. It includes a consultation period of a minimum of 30 days for 20 staff and over, and 45 days for 100 or more staff. This helps to explain why official redundancy figures gathered by the Office for National Statistics do not yet show a significant rise. In Northern Ireland HR1 forms are filed with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and they are not included in these figures. In response to the BBC's findings the Department for Work and Pensions pointed to the measures it has introduced to try to support those looking for work. ""Across the country our Plan for Jobs will give business the confidence to recruit and retain workers... and - through the Kickstart scheme - create hundreds of thousands of new, subsidised jobs for young people,"" a spokesperson said.

Anything is possible for England - Root,"This video can not be played Highlights: England pull off incredible win against Pakistan Captain Joe Root says England's habit of pulling off unlikely victories gives them the belief they can win matches from almost any situation. The home side chased 277to win the first Test against Pakistanafter being 117-5 on a very difficult pitch. It follows remarkable wins in the World Cup final and the Headingley Ashes Test in the summer of 2019. ""Having those experiences in the bank gives you a huge amount of confidence that anything is possible,"" said Root. A memorable win but England will have questions over Buttler, Archer & Anderson - Agnew I owed England runs after wicketkeeping errors - Buttler Woakes and Buttler 'special' - Azhar England were carried to their three-wicket win by Chris Woakes, who ended 84 not out and shared a sixth-wicket partnership with Jos Buttler, whose contribution was 75. The situation the hosts found themselves in on Saturday was typical of a match where they were in trouble throughout. They gave up a first-innings deficit of 107 runs after wicketkeeper Buttler twice reprieved Shan Masood, who went on to make 156. In addition, captain Root made a number of tactical errors and England's top order slumped to 12-3. ""For three days we were behind Pakistan in this game,"" said Root. ""Obviously we don't want to start in that position and keep finding ourselves having to wrestle a way back into a match, but it's certainly great to have in the bank when things don't go your way initially."" England's fightback began on day three with some determined lower-order batting, followed by the bowlers tenaciously working through the Pakistan line-up in their second innings. Still, even on day four, England were in huge trouble after losing three wickets for 20 runs on a pitch that had a period of devilish difficulty. Root's edge was taken by a Naseem Shah delivery that bounced, Ben Stokes gloved a fizzing googly from Yasir Shah before Ollie Pope got an unplayable lifter from Shaheen Afridi. However, Buttler and Woakes counter-attacked and, even though Buttler fell with 21 still required, man-of-the-match Woakes steered England home. ""It's a monumental win,"" Root told Test Match Special. ""We managed to get across the line and that will give everyone a huge amount of confidence. ""Our biggest strength as a group is our character and never giving up. We always look at how we can find a way to get back into the game and today we did it brilliantly. ""We were up against it, but we found a way and that's a sign of a good team. We are very aware we're not the finished article but if we keep doing things, backing them up and learning from mistakes then we will get there eventually.""

Belarus polls open as Lukashenko faces challenge,"An exit poll, conducted by a pro-government organisation, has predicted a landslide victory for Mr Lukashenko The long-time leader of Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko, appears set to declare a landslide victory in an election that saw his toughest opposition challenge in years. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, entered in place of her jailed husband and went on to lead large opposition rallies. But a state TV exit poll showed Mr Lukashenko winning 79.7% of the vote. The opposition had said it expected the vote to be rigged. Protesters have already clashed with police. Squares and streets in the capital Minsk were earlier sealed off by police as Mr Lukashenko vowed that the situation would remain ""under control"". The lead-up to the election sawa crackdown on activists and journalistsamid the country's biggest opposition demonstrations in years. After voting on Sunday, Mr Lukashenko said he did not see Ms Tikhanovskaya as a threat, and denied imposing repressive measures on the opposition. ""They are not worth enough to carry out any repression against them,"" he said. How protests shook up Belarus presidential election Europe's longest serving ruler facing unfamiliar pressure Ms Tikhanovskaya was greeted by an excited crowd chanting her name when she cast her ballot in Minsk earlier on Sunday. Voting was extended at some polling stations due to long queues. There were long queues at polling stations throughout the day The exit poll reported on television, which was conducted by a pro-government organisation, showed Ms Tikhanovskaya receiving just 6.8% of the vote. In a news conference on Sunday evening, Ms Tikhanovskaya said she did not trust that Mr Lukashenko had really won the election. ""I believe my eyes, and I see that the majority is with us,"" she said. Protests erupted following the exit poll, with people detained in the capital and other cities across the country, according to media reports. Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said connectivity had been ""significantly disrupted"", with the situation worsening throughout the day and creating an ""information vacuum"". The head of the election commission, Lidia Yermoshina, urged Ms Tikhanovskaya to accept defeat calmly. The first official results are expected on Sunday night. The opposition said it would keep an alternative count. Sometimes referred to as Europe's last dictator, President Lukashenko, 65, was first elected in 1994. In the last vote in 2015, he was declared winner with 83.5% of the vote. There were no serious challengers and election observers reported problems in the counting and tabulation of votes. This year's election is being held amid growing signs of frustration at his leadership. The campaign saw the rise of Ms Tikhanovskaya, a former teacher who became a stay-at-home mother until she was thrust into the political spotlight. The mother challenging an authoritarian president After her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote, she stepped in to take his place. In the lead-up to the election she told the BBC that people in Belarus did not believe the election would be run fairly. ""But I still believe that our president will understand that his time is over. People don't want him anymore,"" she said. This video can not be played An unexpectedly lively election campaign has revived hope for change in Belarus President Lukashenko has dismissed Ms Tikhanovskaya as a ""poor little girl"", manipulated by foreign ""puppet masters"". Tens of thousands defied an escalating crackdown on the opposition last month to attend a protest in the capital Minsk, the largest such demonstration in a decade. Since the start of the election campaign in May, more than 2,000 people have been detained, according to Human Rights Centre Viasna. On the eve of the vote Ms Tikhanovskaya's team saidher campaign manager had been arrested and would not be released until Monday. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has emerged as the wild card of the race And on Sunday, as people voted,internet service was ""significantly disrupted"", according to online monitor NetBlocks.,externalOpposition supporters say this makes it harder for evidence of election fraud to be collected and shared. There were already concerns over a lack of scrutiny because observers were not invited to monitor the election and more than 40% of votes were cast ahead of election day. There are three other candidates: Anna Kanopatskaya, a former MPwho won a rare seat for the opposition in parliamentary elections in 2016 Sergei Cherechen, the leader of the Social Democrat party Andrei Dmitriyev, the co-chair of the Tell the Truth movement, a campaign group which has been raided by the authorities Two key opposition figures were barred from running and threw their weight behind Ms Tikhanovskaya's campaign. One of them, Valery Tsepkalo, fled Belarus ahead of the contest, fearing arrest. His wife Veronika stayed behind, becoming a key campaigner for Ms Tikhanovskaya. It emerged on Sunday that Ms Tsepkalo had also now left Belarus for Moscow, for ""safety"" reasons.

""But I still believe that our president will understand that his time is over. People don't want him anymore,"" she said. This video can not be played An unexpectedly lively election campaign has revived hope for change in Belarus President Lukashenko has dismissed Ms Tikhanovskaya as a ""poor little girl"", manipulated by foreign ""puppet masters"". Tens of thousands defied an escalating crackdown on the opposition last month to attend a protest in the capital Minsk, the largest such demonstration in a decade. Since the start of the election campaign in May, more than 2,000 people have been detained, according to Human Rights Centre Viasna. On the eve of the vote Ms Tikhanovskaya's team saidher campaign manager had been arrested and would not be released until Monday. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has emerged as the wild card of the race And on Sunday, as people voted,internet service was ""significantly disrupted"", according to online monitor NetBlocks.,externalOpposition supporters say this makes it harder for evidence of election fraud to be collected and shared. There were already concerns over a lack of scrutiny because observers were not invited to monitor the election and more than 40% of votes were cast ahead of election day. There are three other candidates: Anna Kanopatskaya, a former MPwho won a rare seat for the opposition in parliamentary elections in 2016 Sergei Cherechen, the leader of the Social Democrat party Andrei Dmitriyev, the co-chair of the Tell the Truth movement, a campaign group which has been raided by the authorities Two key opposition figures were barred from running and threw their weight behind Ms Tikhanovskaya's campaign. One of them, Valery Tsepkalo, fled Belarus ahead of the contest, fearing arrest. His wife Veronika stayed behind, becoming a key campaigner for Ms Tikhanovskaya. It emerged on Sunday that Ms Tsepkalo had also now left Belarus for Moscow, for ""safety"" reasons. This video can not be played Activists and journalists were rounded up and jailed in Belarus ahead of the election Anger towards Mr Lukashenko's government has been in part fuelled by the response to coronavirus. The president has downplayed the outbreak, advising citizens to drink vodka and use saunas to fight the disease.

Test and trace 'key' to school return,"Current testing and contact tracing is inadequate to prevent a second wave of coronavirus after schools in the UK reopen, scientists have warned. Increased transmission would also result from parents not having to stay at home with their children, they say. Researchers said getting pupils back to school was important - but more work was needed to keep the virus in check. The head of the NHS test and trace scheme said it was ""already delivering"" and on the right track for future. Baroness Dido Harding said: ""I absolutely don't accept that this is failure, it's the opposite."" She said more testing is required but maintained the current level of contact tracing was ""well within the bounds"" of what the researchers ""are saying is necessary"". The UK government said plans were in place to ensure schools can reopen safely at the start of the school year. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate contact tracing systems. Asked about the estimate that only 50% of contacts are being traced in England, Simon Clarke, minister for regional growth, told the BBC government figures were higher. He said NHS test and trace is ""maturing all the time"" and getting children back to school in the autumn is a ""top priority"" that the government would not ""be willing to trade"". ""You're building an entirely new infrastructure which there's no precedent for,"" he said. ""But we're confident it is working, we're confident that it will continue to improve, and we're confident that it will allow schools to open safely in the autumn."" Dr David Nabarro, the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid-19, said the virus is ""capable of surging back really quickly"" and stressed the importance of being able to trace, test and isolate people. ""If we can do that, and do it well, then the surges are kept really small, they're dealt with quickly and life can go on,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He later said he thinks Britain ""will do really well"" because there is ""really good attention to where the virus is locally"" and a lot of ""public engagement in getting on top of it"". A government spokesman said local authorities will ""be able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases"". LOCKDOWN LIMIT:Can we lift lockdown any further? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Researchers from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used computer models to see how the virus might spread in the UK as pupils returned to the classroom and their parents were more able to go back to work or resume other activities. The study assumes childrenare less likely to catch- and therefore spread - coronavirus and that some parents would continue to work from home. As first reported in June, the combined effect on pupils and parents would be enough to cause a second wave if there was no effective test-and-trace programme. This would happen around December 2020 and would be twice as big as the first peak, unless the government took other actions such as reimposing lockdown. The study,now formally published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health,external, shows a second wave could be prevented if: both 75% of people with Covid symptoms were found and 68% of their contacts traced or both 87% of people with symptoms were found and 40% of their contacts traced However, the researchers said NHS test and trace in England was falling short. They estimate only half of contacts are being traced and while it is harder to know the percentage of people being tested, they say this also appears too low. ""It is not achieving the levels we have modelled. It doesn't look good enough to me,"" said Prof Chris Bonell, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, from UCL, added: ""With UK schools reopening fully in September, prevention of a second wave will require a major scale-up of testing to test 75% of symptomatic infections - combined with tracing of 68% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases."" How test-and-trace works: People with symptoms of cough, fever or loss of sense of smell or taste are tested If they are positive for coronavirus, they isolate for 10 days and their household does so for 14 days They have to inform the NHS of everyone they have come into close contact with These contacts must also spend 14 days in quarantine Postcode search: See case numbers in your area GCSE students allowed to drop poetry in 2021 exams Schools will be ready for September - minister Schools have been shut around the world as countries used lockdowns to control the spread of Covid-19. It is estimated1.6 billion children,externalhave been kept out of the classroom. In the UK, schools closed on 20 March, except to children of key workers or vulnerable children. On 1 June, they began a limited reopening for early years pupils, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Schools are due to restart for all children in Scotland on 11 August and across the UK in early September. But every step taken to open up society makes it easier for the coronavirus to spread. Cases arealready starting to riseand the idea of closing pubs in order to open schoolshas already been floated. The UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has said ""we are near the limit"" of what we can do without causing a resurgence. The individual nations of the UK have their own contact tracing systems. The government said NHS test and trace in England has reached 80% of those testing positive and traced over 75% of their contacts. The Welsh government said its advisory group recommended that schools open in September with all pupils present on site, and ""we should be aiming to trace an estimated 80% of contacts, at least 35% of which are to be traced within 24 hours"". Since 21 June, 90% of close contacts were reached by the service,according to Welsh government figures,external. A Scottish government spokesperson said guidance set out ""a number of specific risk-mitigation measures that will need to be introduced"" including an ""enhanced surveillance programme"". In Northern Ireland,the latest figures for the week to 29 July,externalshowed 98% of contacts were successfully reached by the country's contact tracing service.

"Tate defends job cuts in gallery shops and cafes""Sadly at the moment the trading business is too big,"" Maria Balshaw told Desert Island Discs.Entertainment & Arts","There were protests about the redundancy plans when Tate Modern reopened on 27 July The head of the Tate art galleries has defended plans to cut around 200 jobs in their shops and cafes as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. ""Sadly at the moment the trading business is too big,"" Maria Balshaw told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. Host Lauren Laverne asked her about the ""question mark over 200 jobs at Tate Enterprises"", given ""no redundancies have been announced at the galleries"". Balshaw said the company had delayed the job losses ""for as long as we can"". But fewer staff will be needed in the commercial arm because visitor numbers are expected to stay at around 50% for ""quite a long time"", she said. Maria Balshaw runs Tate galleries in London, Liverpool and St Ives She told the programme: ""We are consulting with staff about redundancies. But we have used as much of our own reserves as we can to preserve the jobs throughout this period. ""So staff were kept on 100% pay all the way through lockdown, and we've delayed this period of consultation for as long as we can. ""We don't want to lose any staff, but we know we have to, otherwise the business won't be able to trade."" There were protests outside Tate Modern when it, and the other Tate galleries, reopened on 27 July, having been closed due to coronavirus since 17 March. Tate defends job ad for Â£40k 'head of coffee' Tate Modern becomes top UK attraction Tate art galleries shun more Sackler money Balshaw also oversees Tate Britain, Tate Liverpool and Tate St Ives. Tate Enterprises Ltd is the commercial subsidiary, which operates retail, publishing and catering within the galleries. A number of MPs have raised concerns about the cuts,external, saying those affected were ""low paid with a significant number at risk coming from the BAME community"". On Desert Island Discs, Laverne said the union representing those affected wants Tate to intervene. Balshaw replied: ""We have intervened. We're almost unique in that we run all our own shops and cafes, and that means that everything that people experience at Tate reflects our values. ""But that means, when we are facing 50% fewer visitors coming to our galleries for probably quite a long time, that sadly at the moment the trading business is too big, because we won't be able to open all the cafes and the shops in the same way."" She pledged that ""as visitors do return and as we get properly post-Covid, they [the affected workers] will be given the first option to come back and work for us because we recognise the hard work that they do and how valuable they are to us"".
