UK to send 440 more troops to Afghanistan,"The UK is to send 440 more troops to serve in non-combat roles in Afghanistan, the prime minister will announce at the Brussels Nato summit. The commitment to Nato's mission in Afghanistan will take the total number of UK troops in the country to 1,090. Around half of the troops will deploy from the Welsh Guards in August and the remainder will follow by February 2019. They will help ""bring the stability and security that the Afghan people deserve,"" Theresa May said. At the height of the war, Nato hadmore than 130,000 troops,externalfrom 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had9,500 personnel,externaland 137 bases in Helmand province alone. As of last month, the number of Nato personnel stood at 16,000 from 39 countries, operating mainly from Kabul and focusing on training and assisting the army and police. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - whowrote to Mrs May recommending more troops- said ""whenever the call comes, the UK is always one of the first to step up and support our friends and allies across the globe"". EU's Tusk warns president to appreciate allies What does the US contribute to Nato? Afghanistan profile: Timeline The country where the British are blamed for everything Nato asked Britainto deploy more troops a year ago. In September of last year, theUS committed an extra 3,000 troopsto support Afghan forces. Ahead of the summit, which begins on Wednesday, US president Donald Trump,hit out at his Nato alliesfor failing to spend enough on defence. ""The US is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them,""Mr Trump tweeted,external. Analysis by BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale Sending another 440 British troops will make the UK the third biggest contributor to the Nato train, advise, and assist mission in Afghanistan. The extra troops will arrive later this summer and will reinforce the UK-led Kabul Security Force. It is not a return to a combat role. Its primary role is to transport international advisers safely around the capital - what British soldiers have dubbed ""Armoured Uber"". The US leader's main objection is that a number of member states have not increased their defence budgets to the target of 2% of economic output. But Mrs May said she expects ""to agree an ambitious package of measures to strengthen our deterrence and defence"" at the summit. ""And we will continue to make the case for all allies to follow the UK's example and meet the 2% pledge,"" she added. The last UK troops in combat roles left Afghanistan in 2014 after being involved in the conflict since 2001. The additional troops will add to Britain's existing contribution to the UK-led Kabul Security Force and mentor the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces in the country's capital. ""Lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan will help keep the streets of Britain safe and this uplift signals our unwavering commitment to realising that future,"" Mr Williamson said.

Emerging sex disease 'could be superbug',"A little known sexually transmitted infection could become the next superbug unless people become more vigilant, experts are warning. Mycoplasma genitalium(MG) often has no symptoms but can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can leave some women infertile. MG can be missed - and if it is not treated correctly, it can develop resistance to antibiotics. TheBritish Association of Sexual Health and HIV,externalis launching new advice. Its draft guidelines detail how best to spot and treat MG. Mycoplasma genitalium isa bacterium that can cause inflammation of the urethra in men, causing discharge from the penis and making it painful to urinate. In women, it can cause inflammation of the reproductive organs (womb and fallopian tubes) too, causing pain and possibly a fever and some bleeding. You can get it by having unprotected sex with someone who has it. Condoms can prevent this spread. It was first identified in the UK in the 1980s and is thought to affect 1-2% of the general population. MG does not always cause symptoms and will not always need treatment, but it can be missed or mistaken for a different sexually transmitted infection, such as Chlamydia. Man has 'world's worst' super-gonorrhoea Syphilis and gonorrhoea up by one-fifth 'World's worst' super-gonorrhoea man cured The BASHH says this is concerning. Tests for MG have recently been developed but are not available in all clinics yet although doctors can send samples to Public Health England's laboratory to get a diagnostic result. It can be treated with antibiotics - but the infection is developing resistance to some of these drugs. John - not his real name - contacted the BBC to tell of his experience of having the infection. ""I was diagnosed with MG last year after meeting my new partner. ""We both sensibly got tested and declared clean at the start of the relationship but GUM [genitourinary medicine] clinics don't test for MG, unless you have symptoms. ""So about a month into the relationship I developed the male symptoms - a sharp burning pain while urinating and a pus-like dishcharge from my urethra - but I had no idea what was wrong. ""After a few weeks I tested positive, while my partner was negative, which didn't make sense. She then got tested again and was positive. ""We were put on antibiotics for two weeks but had no sexual contact for five, to make sure we were clean. After further tests we both tested negative but I still had some small amount of leakage which I was told would go away. It eventually cleared. ""Then out of the blue I got a UTI and symptoms were exactly like MG. ""I am now certain it has returned and I am awaiting further test results. ""The GUM clinic refused to retest my partner as she hasn't shown any symptoms. ""I think clinics should test for MG as part of their sexual health screening process, as this would have been picked up at the start for me."" Eradication rates of MG following treatment with one family of antibiotics, called macrolides, are decreasing globally. Macrolide resistance in the UK is estimated at about 40%, say the guidelines. One particular macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin, still works in most cases however. Dr Peter Greenhouse, a sexual consultant in Bristol and BASHH member, urged people to take precautions. ""It's about time the public learned aboutMycoplasma genitalium,"" he said. ""It's yet another good reason to pack the condoms for the summer holidays - and actually use them."" Paddy Horner, who co-wrote the guidelines, said: ""These new guidelines have been developed, because we can't afford to continue with the approach we have followed for the past 15 years as this will undoubtedly lead to a public health emergency with the emergence of MG as a superbug. ""Our guidelines recommend that patients with symptoms are correctly diagnosed using an accurate MG test, treated correctly then followed up to make sure they are cured. ""Resources are urgently needed to ensure that diagnostic and antimicrobial resistance testing is available for women with the condition who are at high risk of infertility. MG - what to look out for ""We are asking the government directly to make this funding available to prevent a public health emergency waiting to happen and which is already spiralling out of control."" Public Health England says testing is available to diagnose MG and any signs of drug resistance, if necessary. Dr Helen Fifer, consultant microbiologist at Public Health England, welcomed the guidelines, adding: ""If you have symptoms of an STI, we recommend you get tested at your local sexual health clinic. ""Everyone can protect themselves from STIs by consistently and correctly using condoms with new and casual partners.""

BBC to unveil next star salaries list,"Gary Lineker is now top of the list, followed by Chris Evans and Graham Norton The top 12 earners on the BBC's latest list of star salaries are all men. Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has overtaken Chris Evans as the best-paid personon the list, earning between Â£1.75m-Â£1.76m in 2017-18. Evans, Graham Norton, Jeremy Vine and John Humphrys are among those to have seen their pay drop since last year. Claudia Winkleman is still the top woman, on Â£370,000-Â£379,999. Mary Berry and Newsnight's Emily Maitlis are among eight women to have joined the list. Winkleman was eighth last year but has now dropped to 13th as a result of a shake-up of the corporation's structure. Shows like Strictly Come Dancing, which are made by BBC Studios, are no longer included on the list because BBC Studios is now considered a commercial entity. The BBC said the published salaries do not yet fully reflect some pay rises and pay cuts, which will not filter through until next year's list. Last year, Sarah Montague and Emily Maitlis were revealed to earn less than male co-hosts This is the second year that the BBC has published the salaries of its best-paid presenters, although actors, comedians and some hosts have been removed this time as a result of the BBC Studios change. Last year, the top seven were all men and the list sparked an outcry about gender inequality, with some men shown to have been paid more than female co-hosts. There were also complaints about a lack of ethnic diversity. This year, the figures at the top of the list are all white again, although the BBC said the overall number of BAME stars on the list is rising. BBC star salaries: See who earned what BBC cuts gender pay gap to 7.6% Six male BBC presenters agree pay cut Amol Rajan on BBC Studios going commercial This year's list includes on-air presenters who earned more than Â£150,000 in the financial year 2017/18 from news, sport and radio as well as some TV entertainment shows. Director general Tony Hall said the BBC was ""making progress"" and that he wants a 50/50 split on the list as a whole, but that ""these things take time"". The BBC has pledged to close the gap by 2020. But Woman's Hour presenter Jane Garvey, who is one of the eight women to join the list, told Radio 4's PM programme the pace of change was ""absolutely glacial"". She said: ""There needs to be a proper conversation about why in 2018 we are still fighting the same old battle on equal pay and why the work of women just isn't valued in the same way as the work of men."" Radio 2 said Steve Wright's pay cut will be reflected next year The other new entries include Europe editor Katya Adler and Radio 4 presenter Sarah Montague, with Maitlis earning between Â£220,000-Â£229,999 to make her the highest new name. Four men have also joined, including BBC media editor Amol Rajan on Â£200,000-Â£209,999, which also covers other radio presenting work. Of the 12 people who have moved down the salary bands because their pay has dropped since the previous list, eight are men. But four of the five to have moved up the pay bands are also men. Those moving into a higher salary bracket include Radio 2's Steve Wright and Ken Bruce; Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw; and Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen. The only woman to move up a pay band is Sophie Raworth. BBC Radio 2 said: ""Steve has just signed a fresh two year contract with Radio 2 which will show a considerable pay reduction - the BBC annual report is a year behind for him as his old contract had yet to expire."" Some names have dropped down or been removed from the list since last year because they work for BBC Studios, which has been classed as a commercial entity since April 2017. As part of its latest disclosures, the corporation also published figures for 2018-19 to show it is on the way to rectifying the gender imbalance. Excluding BBC Studios, 59% of on-air figures earning more than Â£150,000 in the current financial year are men, it said. That compares with 76% in 2016-17. Claudia Winkleman is still the best-paid woman on the list Lord Hall said: ""I've made it absolutely clear that's not good enough and I want to get to 50/50, and that will mean changes in the range of what people are paid right across [the organisation]."" He added: ""We are making progress and you must understand that. We're trying to get a balanced range of men and women and their pay right across the organisation. Read the BBC annual report in full,external ""I am concentrating on what is a huge change, which is going from 25% of women to 40% of women being in the top, over Â£150,000 pay... These things take time."" The salary details were published in the BBC's latest annual report, and come a week afterthe corporation saidits overall median gender pay gap had reduced from 9.3% to 7.6%. And it comes two weeks after former China editorCarrie Gracie received an apologyand back pay from the BBC after discovering on last year's list that she had been paid less than her male counterparts. In last year's report, Claudia Winkleman was the best-paid woman, earning between Â£450,000-Â£499,999. This year, she is still the top earning female star, but has slid down the rankings with earnings between Â£370,000-Â£379,999. That means the top of this year's list appears more male-dominated than last time. Winkleman's Strictly co-host Tess Daly has dropped off the list all together, as have The One Show's Matt Baker and Casualty's Derek Thompson, among others. That's because most entertainment, factual and drama programmes are made by BBC Studios which, as a commercial entity, no longer has to declare the salaries it pays its staff because it is competing with other production companies. BBC Studios chief creative officer Mark Linsey said: ""We are at a significant disadvantage if we don't have a level playing field. It's a bunfight out there for talent."" So Claudia's actual earnings will exceed the amount given in this year's annual report. The same can be said for the likes of Graham Norton, Mary Berry and Fiona Bruce, who also make shows for BBC Studios. This year's list doesn't fully reflect the pay cuts for some male presenters - and pay rises for some women. In a number of cases, these will be enacted over several years. For example, John Humphrys has seen his published salary drop from Â£600,000-Â£649,999 to Â£400,000-Â£409,999. But in 2018-19 - which will be shown on next year's list - his pay for the Today programme will be in the Â£250,000-Â£299,999 bracket. Similarly, Nicky Campbell and Huw Edwards have also taken pay cuts, which have started to filter through to the list - but are being staggered over a number of years. Meanwhile, the BBC annual report also revealed that the corporation received 48 complaints of sexual harassment and assault in 2017/18. Nine resulted in formal cases or disciplinary action, the BBC said. The remaining 39 did not for a variety of reasons - including the complaint being withdrawn or the individual being complained about no longer working for the BBC.

Man exposed to nerve agent now conscious,"A man who was exposed to the nerve agent Novichok has regained consciousness after a ""small but significant improvement"", Salisbury District Hospital has said. Charlie Rowley, who has been in hospital since falling ill in Amesbury on 30 June, is in a critical but stable condition. But the 45-year-old ""is still very unwell"", a statement said. Dawn Sturgess, 44, who was also exposed to the nerve agent, died on Sunday. Her familyhave described her as ""a gentle soul who was generous to a fault"". Police are investigating a possible link to the case of Russians Sergei and Yulia Skripal - who were poisoned with the same substance in nearby Salisbury. The UK government has blamed Russia for the incident, but the country's authorities deny any involvement. Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said people in the Amesbury and Salisbury areashould not ""pick up any foreign object which could contain liquid or gel, in the interests of their own safety"".,external Murder inquiry after Novichok woman dies Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said: ""[Charlie Rowley] is in a critical but stable condition, and is now conscious. ""While this is welcome news, clearly we are not out of the woods yet. ""Charlie is still very unwell and will continue to require specialist, round-the-clock care here at Salisbury District Hospital."" Dawn Sturgess died on Sunday after being taken ill on 30 June Ms Sturgess lived in Salisbury, and the couple had been in the city before going to Mr Rowley's flat in nearby Amesbury on Friday 29 June. They both then fell ill on Saturday 30 June, and Ms Sturgess died eight days later. She had two sons, aged 19 and 23, and an 11-year-old daughter. Police seized a car in Swindon on Monday as part of their ongoing investigation into the poisoning. The BBC understands the white Audi belonged to a paramedic who had been with Ms Sturgess in an ambulance when she fell ill. Local residents said the paramedic had told them he got bodily fluids on him, but he had been checked over by doctors and given the ""all-clear"". His car was sealed and taken away on the back of a truck. The BBC understands the car belongs to a paramedic Residents also claimed he had told them both his car and his clothes were being taken to the government laboratory at Porton Down to be destroyed. Wiltshire Police said the public ""should not be alarmed by this,"" adding: ""Those involved have the training and expertise to safely remove the vehicle."" Police are continuing to hunt for a contaminated container which they believe was handled by the pair. The BBC understands Mr Rowley's flat is regarded as the key location in the search. A team wearing protective clothing is combing the small flat, working in 30-minute shifts because of the heat. Public Health England also offered advice for people who may have visited one of five areas identified by police. Those locations are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy, and the Baptist church in Amesbury, and John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Anyone who was there between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 on 30 June should continue to follow advice, including washing their clothes in a washing machine.

His mother Hannah Deacon said: ""Today, for the first time ever in this country we have brought back THC oil through the airport legally, which is amazing."" She was allowed through London City Airport with the oil from Amsterdam. Last month Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the governmentwould issue Ms Deacon a licencefor the banned substance in a move expected to pave the way for reforms on its medicinal use. She had urged the home secretary to intervene in her son's case after Billy Caldwell, 12, was granted alimited licence for the drugto be administered to him in hospital.

Joy and relief as Thai cave boys rescued,"Three Thai navy divers and a medic, who stayed with the group while the rescue took place, were the last to emerge Joy and relief have greeted the rescue of 12 boys and their football coach from flooded caves in northern Thailand after divers completed a daring operation to bring them out. Seventeen days after they got trapped underground, the last five members of the group emerged on Tuesday. Their plight and the complex three-day-long operation to free them gripped the world's attention. Celebrations have swept the South East Asian nation and further afield. Cave rescue as it happened Rescue story in pictures How risky was the rescue? Heroic diver gave his life to the rescue There were cheers around the Tham Luang cave system in the country's Chiang Rai province as a rescue operation involving dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers came to an end on Tuesday evening. At the house just below the mountains where the men who run the Wild Boars football team meet, there was laughter, shouts and cheers - and people shook hands in a very un-Thai way, says BBC Jonathan Head. In the nearby city of Chiang Rai, the news was greeted by the honking of car horns while people gathered outside the hospital - where all those rescued from the caves were taken for treatment - broke into applause. On social media, Thais showed their feelings about the rescuers by using hashtags including #Heroes and #Thankyou. Offers of hospitality for the boys, the coach and their rescuers have come in from international football clubs including Manchester United and Benfica. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded their way back out of Tham Luang. The story of the rescue - told for children Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team had entered the cave system during an excursion with their coach. The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June They were found by British divers last week, huddled in darkness on a ledge. Elation at the discovery of all 13 members of the group alive quickly turned to concern as it emerged just how difficult it would be to rescue boys who could not swim and had been weakened by their time underground. Football offers support to boys The heroes who saved the 'Wild Boars' Who are the Thai boys? The complex, three-day operation saw four boys emerge on Sunday, four on Monday, and the final four boys plus their coach on Tuesday. All were immediately taken to hospital, but they are said to be in reasonable condition given their ordeal. This video can not be played Rescue diver in Thai cave: ""I was very scared"" Confirming the completion of the rescue operation, theThai Navy Seals Facebook page,externalannounced: ""We are not sure if this is a miracle, science, or what. All the 13 Wild Boars are now out of the cave."" The first eight boys to be rescued - on Sunday and Monday - are still in hospital but said to be in good mental and physical health, and have now been joined by the four boys and the 25-year-old coach who were rescued on Tuesday. X-rays and blood tests have been ordered, and they will remain under observation in hospital for at least seven days. This video can not be played Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" Their parents have been allowed to see them through a glass window at the hospital, but they are being quarantined. Drinking contaminated water in the cave or being exposed to bird or bat droppings could lead to dangerous infections, experts say. The boys lost weight during their time in the caves and are keen to eat. They are said to have requested a favourite pork dish, bread and chocolate, but solid food will have to be reintroduced slowly to prevent any digestive upset. They will also need to wear sunglasses for a few days until their eyes readjust to the brighter light. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Offers of hospitality for the football team have come in from around the world: Global football body Fifa offered the 12 young footballers tickets for Sunday's World Cup final in Moscow, but they are too weak to travel. Portuguese club Benfica has invited the boys and their coach an all-expenses-paid week at its training academy. Manchester United - the English club several of the boys support - has offered them the chance to attend a game. England football players preparing for a World Cup semi-final with Croatia - including Manchester City defender Kyle Walker - are sending football kit to the boys after one of them was pictured wearing an England shirt inside the caves. A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - worked in the Tham Luang caves. They guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the cave system. Getting to and from the trapped group was an exhausting round trip, even for experienced divers. The process included a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy was accompanied by two divers, who also carried his air supply. The toughest part was about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which was so tight that the divers had to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - was turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys could rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They were then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. This video can not be played âYou never know when youâll need Englishâ The last of the rescue team - three Thai Navy Seals and a doctor - emerged from the cave complex some hours after the last member of the trapped group was released. Details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. CaptainDuganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-bornAdul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coachEkapol Chantawong,25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.

Facebook faces record UK fine for data misuse,"This video can not be played Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham says Facebook's fines will damage its reputation The UK's data protection watchdog intends to fine Facebook Â£500,000 for data breaches - the maximum allowed. The Information Commissioner's Office said Facebook had failed to ensure another company - Cambridge Analytica - had deleted users' data. The ICO will also bring a criminal action,externalagainst Cambridge Analytica's defunct parent company SCL Elections. And it has raised concerns about political parties buying personal information from ""data brokers"". Specifically it named one company used by the Labour Party, Emma's Diary, which gives medical advice and free baby-themed products to parents. Facebook said it would respond to the report ""soon"". The ICO also said another company - Aggregate IQ - which worked with the Vote Leave campaign in the run up to the EU Referendum, must stop processing UK citizens' data. The fine is modest compared with previous sanctions on Facebook. Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal Facebook reveals its data-sharing VIPs Cambridge Analytica boss spars with MPs In 2017 it was fined110m euros (Â£95m) by the European Commission, which in the same yearpunished Google for 2.42bn euros(Â£2.1bn). But information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said companies also worried about reputational damage. The impact of behavioural advertising, when it came to elections, was ""significant"" and called for a code of practice to ""fix the system"", she said. Such a code would ensure that ""elections are fair and people understand how they are being micro-targeted"". The action comes 16 months after the ICO began its probe into political campaigners' use of personal data followingconcerns raised by whistleblower Christopher Wylie, among others. The ICO found Facebook had breached its own rules and failed to make sure Cambridge Analytica had deleted this personal data. While Cambridge Analytica insisted it hadindeed wiped the data after Facebook's erasure request in December 2015,external, the ICO said it had seen evidence that copies of the data had been shared with others. ""This potentially brings into question the accuracy of the deletion certificates provided to Facebook,"" said an ICO spokesperson. The ICO has also written to the UK's 11 main political parties telling them to have their data protection practices inspected. It is concerned the parties may have bought lifestyle information about members of the public from data brokers, who might have not have obtained the necessary consent. Naming Emma's Diary, the ICO said it was concerned about how transparent the firm had been about its political activities. Emma's Diary requires users to download an app to get a free bundle of baby-themed goods It said that the Labour Party had confirmed using the firm, but did not provide other details except that it intended to take some form of regulatory action. The service's owner Lifecycle Marketing told the BBC it did not agree with the ICO's initial findings. ""For over 25 years we have operated with integrity and within the spirit of data regulation,"" said a spokeswoman. ""As the ICO investigation continues we will freely cooperate... and cannot comment further at this stage."" Looking wider, the ICO noted Facebook had been the biggest recipient of digital advertising by political parties and campaigns to date. Yet, it said, the US firm had neither done enough to explain to its members how they were being targeted as a consequence, nor given them enough control over how their sensitive personal data was used. As a result, it said, Facebook was guilty of a second breach of the Data Protection Act. Facebook has a chance to respond to the Commissioner's Notice of Intent, after which a final decision will be made. The tech firm's chief privacy officer issued a brief response. ""As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015,"" said Erin Egan. ""We have been working closely with the ICO in their investigation of Cambridge Analytica, just as we have with authorities in the US and other countries. We're reviewing the report and will respond to the ICO soon."" Cambridge Analytica, which claimed it could swing elections, and its parent SCL Elections, shut down in May. But the ICO said it was still taking legal steps to bring a criminal prosecution. The basis for this would be that SCL Elections had failed to properly respond to anearlier demand that it give a US academic a copy of any personal informationit held on him along with an explanation as to its source and usage. In March, Cambridge Analytica offices were searched by ICO officers Bearing in mind SCL Elections is now out of business, the ICO said it might consider taking action against the company's directors. The ICO said it had established that the Canadian data analytics firm AggregateIQ - AIQ - had access to UK voters' personal data provided by the Brexit referendum's Vote Leave campaign. It said it was now investigating whether this information had been transferred and accessed outside the UK and whether this amounted to a breach of the data protection act. The watchdog added that it continued to investigate to what degree AIQ and SCL Elections had shared UK personal data. And it said it had served an enforcement notice forbidding AIQ from continuing to make use of a list of UK citizens' email addresses and names that it still holds. Other action includes: an investigation into allegations that Arron Banks' Eldon Insurance Services illegally shared customer data with the Leave.EU group he co-founded, and used the business' call centre staff to make calls on behalf of the campaign - claims the firm has previously denied a probe into the collection and sharing of personal data by the official Remain campaign - Britain Stronger In Europe  - and a linked data broker an audit of the University of Cambridge's Psychometrics Centre. The department carries out its own research into social media profiles. The ICO said it had been told of an alleged security breach involving one of the centre's apps and had additional concerns about its data protection efforts a call for the government to introduce a code of practice limiting how personal information can be used by political campaigns before the next general election efforts to ensure ex-staff from SCL Elections and Cambridge Analytica do not illegally use materials obtained from the business before its collapse The ICO said it expects the next stage of its investigation to be complete by the end of October.

Jonathan HeadBBC South East Asia Correspondent Over the past week we have called
in to chat to Nopparat Kanthawong, the head coach of the Wild Boars football
team, and usually found him talking tensely on the phone to parents of the
boys. He went over and over the events of the day the boys went into the caves
with his assistant after football practice. He says he had no idea they were
going. Tonight there was an entirely
different atmosphere in the house, just below the mountains where the men who
run the Wild Boars meet. They laughed, shouted cheers and shook hands in a very
un-Thai way. And coach Nop was smiling for the first time, and almost
speechless. ""I donât know what to say â I just want to see them, and hug them,"" he told me. I was then able to show him a note from Manchester United to the rescued boys. It was an invitation to visit Old Trafford
next season, as most of the boys are passionate Man U fans. There was a little
disbelief, and then elation, even from coach Nop, who admits he is a Liverpool
fan who has failed to convert the rest of his team. ""Is this for real?"" they
asked. Getting them to UK from this
far-flung border town will be a challenge. Three of the boys and coach Ekapol,
who was with them in the caves, are not recognised as full Thai citizens, a
fairly common problem for communities along the Thai-Myanmar border. But they
just made an almost miraculous escape from a cave. They will probably make it to
Manchester Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The young footballers had been invited by Fifa to attend the World Cup Final in Moscow on Sunday. But their attendance was always a long shot, given the health risks they face after spending more than two weeks in a pitch-dark cave. Fifa has just told the BBC that the boys will not be making the match. Here's what they said: FIFA would like to express its great joy at the news of the rescue of the 12 young footballers and their coach. We would like to convey our profound gratitude to all persons involved in the rescue operation, which unfortunately took the life of one of the divers. Our thoughts are with his family. We have been informed by the Football Association of Thailand that due to medical reasons, the boys will not be in a position to travel to Moscow for the FIFA World Cup final. FIFA's priority remains the health of everyone involved in the operation and we will look into finding a new opportunity to invite the boys to a FIFA event to share with them a moment of communion and celebration. We can also confirm that a meeting with the Football Association of Thailand is scheduled to take place in Moscow around the FIFA World Cup final. The BBC's Nick Beake is at the hospital where the boys are being treated: This is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission
Accomplished. Families in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the
final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldnât believe
it, others claimed they never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles.
Scores of reporters rushed to their live positions to bring the news to
their audiences at home. Japanese and Brazilian networks were either side of
us. Up on the 8th floor, the doctors who declared this morning that the
first eight boys to be rescued are doing well will now be examining their remaining
teammates and their coach. Psychologists will be being assessing the impact a
fortnight trapped underground has had. The Wild Boars footballers went into the
Tham Luang cave as a team. They survived as a team. And tonight, at the end of
a remarkable 72-hour rescue, they are together as a team once again. An ambulance leaves the Tham Luang cave on Tuesday Petty Officer Saman Gunan, a former Thai navy diver in his late thirties, died on 6 July while helping to re-supply the cave with new air tanks.

Facebook reveals its data-share VIPs,"Facebook had been given until Friday evening to reply to US lawmakers' questions Facebook has revealed which businesses it gave special rights to access users' data after it had shut others out. It listed the companies as part ofa lengthy response to US politicians' questions about its practices,external, which it published at the end of last week. It said 61 companies had been given a temporary exemption to a block on apps accessing details about users' friends. And it identified a further 52 it had authorised to tap its data to ""recreate Facebook-like experiences"". The social network had faced criticism last month from some US lawmakers after it emerged several Chinese companies - including Huawei - had been included in the latter list, despite the fact that Facebook had not sought explicit consent from its users to do so. Mark Zuckerberg's company has been under pressure to disclose more details about its data-sharing habits in light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved a UK-based political consultancy obtaining personal details about Facebook users in breach of the platform's rules. Details of thelatest revelations were first published by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday,external. Facebook originally allowed third-party apps to access wide-ranging data about the friends of users who had signed up. But following a critical review of the practice by the Irish data protection commissioner,it announced that access would be blocked,externalfrom 30 April 2015. It has now disclosed that a San Francisco-based company specialising in software for visually impaired users - called Serotek - was given an extra eight months access. In addition, it said, 60 other companies had been given shorter extensions to the deadline. They included: the dating service Hinge Russian internet giant Mail.ru sportswear firm Nike car manufacturer Nissan casino-type game developer Playtika music streaming service Spotify courier company UPS As part of a separate scheme, Facebook allowed certain hardware and software companies to access its members' personal details in order to build their own ""versions of Facebook or Facebook features"". Some of these ""partnerships"" are still active despite claims that they might breach privacy commitmentsmade by Facebook to US watchdogs and the public. Companies on this list that had not previously been named but no longer have such extensive access include: Dell HTC Kodak LG O2 Orange Virgin Mobile Warner Bros In addition, Facebook said that it continued to provide access to its data to 14 companies. Among those that had not earlier been identified are: Alibaba Nokia Vodafone Yahoo Zing Mobile Facebook said its partnerships and engineering teams had reviewed and approved all the data-sharing agreements and had found no evidence of abuse. The technology company also provided an update on its efforts to identify other Cambridge-Analytica-like situations, in which data about its users had been obtained ""through improper means"". It said it had suspended about 200 apps to date, relating to five developers. However, it added that many of the apps involved had been described as ""tests"", and never released to the public. In addition, it said a further 14 apps linked to the Canadian data analytics company AggregateIQ (AIQ) had been suspended pending further investigations Cambridge Analytica boss spars with MPs Facebook shares data with Chinese firms Facebook protests new privacy breach claim MEPs frustrated by Zuckerberg questioning LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Rescue story in pictures,"The successful 17-day search and rescue operation has captivated the country The desperate effort to find and rescue a team of young footballers in Thailand from a flooded cave has gripped the world. After the last boys and their coach were rescued on Tuesday, we look back at how the story unfolded. On Saturday 23 June, 12 members of the Wild Boar soccer team, aged 11-16, entered the Tham Luang cave system in Thailand's Chiang Rai Province along with their 25-year-old football coach after a team practice. The cave system, which is 10km (6 miles) deep, is known locally for its deep recesses and narrow passages. The team has reportedly visited the cave before - but this time heavy rains cause flooding, impeding their exit. After the children fail to return home, they are reported missing and search efforts begin. Initial rescuers at the site reportedly find the team's bicycles, football boots and other belongings close to the cave's entrance. Media and volunteers start to gather at the site as heavy rain continues to complicate the search and rescue process. Who are the boys trapped in the cave? How the boys were saved The brits who helped find the boys By Sunday family members reach the cave, praying and holding vigils for the missing children. Three days in, divers from the Royal Thai Navy arrive to assist in local search efforts. Fresh hand and footprints are spotted inside the vast cave complex, raising hopes for the group's safety. Government officials visit the site, and Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon says the government is still optimistic the team can be found alive. Rescuers consider other routes in - teams of soldiers search for alternative entrance points and the authorities consider drilling into the mountain to get access. By Wednesday 27 June, diving and survival specialists from all around the world arrive in the country to help with search efforts. Relatives continue to hold vigils and pray at the site, as concern about the under-16 team's fate grows. Family members and officers are pictured fainting, and desperation deepens as weather conditions deteriorate. Thailand is now captivated by the desperate search, clinging to hope they can survive.Social media users share fan art in tribute to the missing 13, referring to them as ""the strangers we want to meet the most"". Pumps are brought in to try to help reduce the water levels in the cave, but continuing rain intermittently suspends efforts. Rescuers now believe and hope the team sought safety on a rock mound inside a cave chamber known as ""Patayya beach"". Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha visits relatives at the site and tries to offer comfort, telling them: ""They're athletes. They're strong."" The world's media has by now gathered at the site, with journalists staking out in the muddy conditions to hear the latest news. Over the weekend of 30 June, a break in rainy conditions allows divers to get further inside the cave than before. Supplies and air tanks are brought into the cave as the rescue teams advance. On Monday 2 July there is dramatic news - divers have found all of the boys and their coach safe nine days after they went missing. The team are found on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. A video is released of the moment they are discovered by British divers There are scenes of joy and relief at the site, as relatives and officials celebrate the news A video showing the boys in apparent good health is released by the Thai Navy seals, but officials stress that the rescue effort remains complex. Medical aid and food is brought in to the team, as rescuers consider the best way to get them out to safety. Millions of litres of water are being pumped out of the cave system, but with the rainy season in full flow, officials warn the boys may have to learn to dive to get free - or wait months until conditions approve. The buoyant mood at the site then sours dramatically at the end of the week after a diver working on the rescue dies. It emerges that Saman Gunan, 38, a former Thai navy diver volunteering in the cave, lost consciousness while delivering oxygen air tanks. Tributes pour in for the lost diver, as concern is raised about the difficult task ahead. The commander of Thailand's Navy Seals warns that oxygen levels are dropping, as notes written by the team and coach emerge and are released. In one, the youngsters urge relatives to not worry, saying they are strong In a race against the rain, officials designate a ""limited"" window during which they believe the team can be successfully evacuated out. With conditions optimum on Sunday 8 July, ""D-Day"" comes and intensive rescue operations begin. Ambulances are pictured leaving the site, as speculation grows about how the rescue went. It is eventually confirmed that four of the boys have been safely brought out. Officials say the operation is running ""smoothly"", but efforts pause overnight to replace air tanks and let divers rest. Ambulances leaving the site are monitored closely by the watching media The operation is very complex, and involves a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. At the end of Monday, it emerges that four more of the boys have been successfully freed. Those evacuated out are being cared for in local hospitals, gradually being weaned back onto solid foods Classmates are pictured celebrating the news of the ongoing rescues The story of Thailand's cave rescue The government strictly guards information about the rescue, including the names of those who have been saved. The boys are held in hospital for supervision. Access for visiting parents is said to be limited because of potential health risks. On Tuesday there are high hopes for a successful rescue of everyone, as a final push starts to free those still inside. Locals pictured waving at ambulances driving out of the nerve-wracked rescue site Efforts continue throughout Tuesday, untilit is finally confirmed by officials that all 13 have been rescued safely. Locals and rescuers at the site celebrate, as the last boys and their coach are transferred to hospital, 17 days after getting trapped underground.

PayPal: Your death has breached our rules,"This photo of Lindsay and Howard Durdle was taken last year PayPal wrote to a woman who had died of cancer saying her death had breached its rules and that it might take legal action as a consequence. The firm has since acknowledged that the letter was ""insensitive"", apologised to her widower, and begun an inquiry into how it came to be sent. The matter came to light after her bereaved husband contacted the BBC. He said he wanted to make other organisations aware how distressing automated messages could be. Lindsay Durdle died on 31 May aged 37. She had been first diagnosed with breast cancer about a year-and-a-half earlier. The disease had later spread to her lungs and brain. PayPal was informed of Mrs Durdle's death three weeks ago by her husband Howard Durdle. He provided the online payments service with copies of her death certificate, her will and his ID, as requested. PayPal had been informed of Lindsay Durdle's death He has now received a letter addressed in her name, sent to his home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire. It was headlined: ""Important: You should read this notice carefully."" It said that Mrs Durdle owed the company about Â£3,200 and went on to say: ""You are in breach of condition 15.4(c) of your agreement with PayPal Credit as we have received notice that you are deceased... this breach is not capable of remedy."" PayPal has told Mr Durdle that it is looking into this ""as a priority"", and has written off the debt in the meantime. ""We apologise to Mr Durdle for the distress this letter has caused,"" a spokesman added. ""We are urgently looking into this matter, and are in direct contact with Mr Durdle to support him."" PayPal sent this letter to Mrs Durdle Mr Durdle said a member of PayPal's staff had told him there were three possible explanations: a bug a bad letter template human error He added that he had been assured that whatever the cause, it would be addressed, although PayPal had told him it would not be able to share the information because it was an ""internal matter"". ""I'm in a reasonable place at the moment - I've got quite a level head on my shoulders - and am quite capable of dealing with paperwork like this,"" Mr Durdle said. ""But I'm a member of the charity Widowed and Young, and I've seen first-hand in there how a letter like this or something like it can completely derail somebody. ""If I'm going to make any fuss about this at all, it's to make sure that PayPal - or any other organisation that might do this kind of insensitive thing - recognises the damage they can cause the recently bereaved.""

"'Maybe, just maybe, this time it will be different'","This video can not be played World Cup 2018: England fans celebrate across the country Croatia v England Date:Wednesday, 11 July (19:00 BST).Venue:Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow Coverage:Listen on BBC Radio 5 live, with live text commentary online Football is sold to the world as fun. As colour, as sunshine, as joy. Football is sold as winning. Football is experienced as doubt. Football is watched feeling sick. It is wishing matches finished, wanting to walk out of a stadium even as you've been desperate to be there, being convinced that the most heartbreaking possible scenario is the most likely thing to pass. And usually it does. Football is about losing. Only one team can win a league. Thirty-two teams went to the World Cup; 31 will go home wondering what if. The idea England might be the exception both to that rule and to a torturous history of defeat, pain and regrets still feels extraordinary. It also feels dangerous, because while football is also about being powerless to prevent something awful happening to something that matters to you so much, it is equally about being convinced that even a thought or stray sentence could instantly summon disaster. Any neutral watching England 2-0 up against Sweden could tell they were not going to lose. Many England fans were convinced that remarking ""we're the better team here"" to the person next to them would be to guarantee an immediate Swedish goal. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Sweden 0-2 England highlights It is why being 1-0 down can often be more relaxing than being 1-0 up. What's the worst that can happen now the worst thing is already happening? And so you lie to yourself. We're just going to enjoy the occasion. It's only sport. I didn't expect us to win anyway. You tuck yourself behind established beliefs. England are an embarrassment at big tournaments. England don't win penalty shootouts. English footballers are spoiled, selfish and out of touch with those who help fund their crazy wages. Reality Check: Do England do better in red or white? Relive England's last World Cup semi-final Klinsmann's message to England Hope is a delusion. Dreaming is for night-time. Football is disappointment. You know all this is true. You also know what football can do for you. It makes you leap around and grab your friends around the neck and roar at each other's faces from inches away. It makes you jump on the back of strangers. It makes you feel the same way at exactly the same time as millions of people you will never meet. You stay with football because of the possibility of all this. You keep daydreaming because of the little part of you that doesn't consider this a dream at all. You tell other people not to look beyond the next game and then do exactly that. Because football can change. You miss a penalty and then the other team miss two. You go further into a tournament than you have in more than a quarter of a century and look up to see the big boys all gone. You listen to the players and read their social media and you find yourself seeing shared characteristics and people you like. And when football changes, we change with it. From shouting at defenders to get rid of it, to lump it long when the press comes on, to contentedly watching them keep hold and play it out. From worrying which unheralded opposition player will be the bogeyman this time to relishing the world waking up to Kieran Trippier and Harry Maguire. From avoiding deathless England friendlies and their endless substitutions and meaningless results to wishing the next game was here now and being able to name Gareth Southgate's first-choice team in a single breath. One of the few lasting bequests of London 2012, a sporting carnival where too many big races now have asterisks next to them, was that sense - for a nation that spends so much time reflexively looking backwards - of a vision of modern Britain that felt simultaneously new and familiar to every one of us. It was there in the stories of the three stars of Super Saturday: Jessica Ennis-Hill, a mixed-race girl from Sheffield; Greg Rutherford, a lad whose great-grandfather played football for England over a century ago; Mo Farah, a boy who arrived in west London aged eight from east Africa to make the capital his home. This is an England team that represents the England of 2018. The pale kid from Sunderland in goal, a midfielder from Milton Keynes with a Nigerian dad and English mum. Three big lads from south Yorkshire in defence, a striker born in Jamaica and raised in the scruffy part of west London. Another midfielder schooled in Lisbon, a superstar captain who learned on loan at Orient and Millwall. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Can England's Harry Kane win the Golden Boot? There is an unreality to it all. A frozen, sodden winter when the rain never stopped, a summer that started early and lit up everything for weeks. Sunlit mornings, evenings watching football with the windows and doors open and daylight in the sky until all the celebrating is done. A team beaten by a nation of 330,000 at their last big tournament, gone after the group stages at the previous World Cup, careering into the semi-finals and enjoying every moment of it. There are limitless reasons to fall out of love with football. The idiots you know even in the home end at your own club, the jingoism that snarls in the slipstream of national success. The price of shirts, the price of tickets, the booking fee for something bought in a microsecond from an automated page. The multiple satellite packages, the kick-offs before lunch and after Sunday tea-time, the money going to middlemen in a deal that didn't need them. Then you think of the adrenalised peaks and emotional releases of the past three weeks, the scenes in front of big screens around the country, the pleasure of seeing your happiness reflected in the faces and moods of people you have almost nothing else in common with. Only football can do this. England winning the rugby union World Cup brought enormous pleasure to vast numbers, the home Ashes triumph of 2005 giddy disbelief to those who had long grown used to Australian domination. Yet neither touched as many distant corners as this World Cup. The peak television audience for the deeds of Michael Vaughan's team was 8.4 million; 15 million saw Jonny Wilkinson drop his goal. Andy Murray's first Wimbledon victory brought in 17.3m, and that was a win for Great Britain. England's last-16 win over Colombia peaked at 23.6 million. Wednesday night's semi-final is likely to draw in yet more. And you don't want any of it to end. Football is going to revert to type for two of the teams still left in this World Cup. It will go back to being about regret and dejection and what might have been. For one team it will be something else. Colour, sunshine, joy. Maybe it will all end here. Maybe, this once, it will not.

England fans get player face tattoos,"If England lose, Mr Allen said he may get a ""red rubber stamp saying 'void'"" over Harry Kane's face As England fans await the team's semi-final World Cup game against Croatia, some fans have taken to wearing their support permanently on their bodies. Captain Harry Kane and defender Harry Maguire are the latest faces to be immortalised in ink. Teddy Allen of Staffordshire had a large picture of Kane and ""World Cup Winners 2018"" tattooed on his left thigh after England beat Sweden. ""It was an impulsive decision but I will stand by it,"" he said. Mr Allen, 30, of Biddulph, spent four hours in the chair for the tattoo. ""It started off as a joke to be honest but the idea grew on me and grew on me,"" he said. Mr Allen joked with his friend Bradley Fleming prior to the Sweden match that he should have the tattoo, saying he would wait until after the game to make the decision. Teddy Allen said his wife thought he was a ""bit daft"" for having the tattoo Mr Fleming, a tattooist based in Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, said: ""If England don't win, I suggested he have 'void' put over the 'winners' part, but Teddy said he'd have it over Kane's face. ""I think England will easily win against Croatia, I just hope they don't mess it up."" Mr Allen said he was confident England could prove him right and win and he would not ""live to regret it"". ""I might get a bit worried if we go behind a goal but I still think we will pull it back and we will win it,"" he said. Mr Allen said there had been a big reaction both ""good and bad"" from his family friends and work colleagues. ""The Mrs thinks I'm a bit daft,"" he added. When Sheffield-born Maguire headed the ball home, Matt put the deposit down and booked his appointment It comes as a Doncaster man had footballer Harry Maguire's face tattooed on his chest, after making a bet on social media. Matt Benton said on Twitter: ""If Harry Maguire scores against Sweden, [his] face is getting tattooed on my chest!"". So when Sheffield-born Maguire headed the ball home, Matt put the deposit down and booked his appointment. The ex-Sheffield United defender even replied to Matt, offering a signed England shirt and saying he ""must have a big chest"". Allow Twitter content?

Thai cave boys rescue ends in success,"The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June Divers in northern Thailand have rescued all 12 boys and their football coach from flooded caves, 17 days after they got trapped underground. Their plight and the massive, dangerous three-day-long operation to free them gripped the world's attention. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded their way back out. They were found by British divers last week, huddled in darkness on a ledge amid fears they could be forced to stay there for months until water receded. There were cheers as a daring rescue operation involving dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers came to an end on Tuesday evening. Cave rescue as it happened Rescue story in pictures Who are the Thai boys? Who are the Thailand cave rescue divers? In an indication of how dangerous the journey out was,a former Thai navy diver diedin the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen. This video can not be played Rescue diver in Thai cave: ""I was very scared"" Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team had entered the Tham Luang cave system in the province of Chiang Rai during an excursion with their coach. Confirming the completion of the rescue operation, theThai Navy Seals Facebook page,externalannounced: ""All 12 Wild Boars and coach have been extracted from the cave. All are safe."" And at the house just below the mountains where the men who run the Wild Boars meet, there was laughter, shouts and cheers - and people shook hands in a very un-Thai way, says the BBC Jonathan Head. By Nick Beake, at Chiang Rai hospital This is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission Accomplished. Families in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldn't believe it, others said they had never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles. Up on the eighth floor, doctors - who declared this morning that the first eight boys to be rescued are doing well - will now be examining their remaining team mates and their coach. Psychologists will be assessing the impact a fortnight trapped underground has had. The Wild Boars footballers went into the Tham Luang cave as a team. They survived as a team. And tonight, at the end of a remarkable 72-hour rescue, they are together as a team once again. The first eight boys to be rescued - on Sunday and Monday - are still in hospital but said to be in good mental and physical health. They have undergone X-rays and blood tests, and will remain under observation in hospital for at least seven days. This video can not be played Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" Their parents have been allowed to see them through a glass window at the hospital, but they are being quarantined. Drinking contaminated water in the cave or being exposed to bird or bat droppings in the cave could lead to dangerous infections, experts say. Football offers support to boys The boys lost weight during their time in the caves and are keen to eat. They are said to have requested a favourite pork dish, bread and chocolate, but solid food will have to be reintroduced slowly to prevent digestive upset. They will also need to wear sunglasses for a few days until their eyes readjust to the brighter light. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Offers of hospitality for the football team have come in from around the world: Global football body Fifa offered the 12 young footballers tickets for Sunday's World Cup final in Moscow, but they are too weak to travel. Portuguese club Benfica has invited the boys and their coach an all-expenses-paid week at its training academy. Manchester United - the English club several of the boys support - has offered them the chance to attend a game. England players including Manchester City defender Kyle Walker are sending football kit to the boys after one of them was pictured wearing an England shirt inside the caves. A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - worked in the Tham Luang caves. They guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the cave system. Getting to and from the trapped group was an exhausting round trip, even for experienced divers. The process included a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes. How risky was the rescue? Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy was accompanied by two divers, who also carried his air supply. The toughest part was about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which was so tight that the divers had to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - was turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys could rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They were then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. This video can not be played Wife and father remember 'hero' Thai diver: ""He loved helping others"" The last of the rescue team - three Thai Navy Seals and a doctor - emerged from the cave complex some hours after the last member of the trapped group was released. CaptainDuganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-bornAdul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coachEkapol Chantawong,25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.

The heroes who saved the 'Wild Boars',"Foreign divers, including Ivan Karadzic (2nd left) and Erik Brown (3rd right), were part of the extensive rescue operations The rescuers who worked to save the group trapped in a Thai cave were a mix of international divers collaborating with Thai navy Seals. The 12 boys and their football coach were first found by British diversbut the effort to get them out was a truly global operation. Several Thai navy divers took part in the rescue.One ex-navy diver, Saman Gunan, diedin the cave last Friday. Little information has been released about exactly who was involved and how, largely because most participants have been reluctant to talk. It is thought that dozens of divers - Thai and foreign - were part of the efforts. Here are just some of them: The last to leave the Tham Luang caves were three divers and a medic - all Thai Navy Seals Numerous Thai special forces were part of the rescue efforts. Most notable are a doctor - widely identified as Pak Loharnshoon - and three yet-to-be-named divers who volunteered to stay by the boys' side after they were found underground a week ago. Dr Pak is seen applying medicine to a boy's minor wounds in a video shared by the Thai navy Seals Facebook page last week. Four Thai Navy Seals personnel were the last to leave the cave on Tuesday evening. The Navy Seals unit was led by Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yuukongkaew. When divers were still trying to find the boys, he was the one updating reporters on the slow progress being made. Rear Adm Arphakorn was in charge of the Navy Seals during their risky operation Briton John Volanthen's voice was the first the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground. He and fellow British diver Mr Stanton were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper. The trio arrived in Thailand three days after the football team went missing. This video can not be played The moment divers discover the missing boys Mr Volanthen, an IT consultant, and Mr Stanton, a former firefighter, are part of the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team. They have participated in a number of cave diving rescue operations, including in Norway, France and Mexico. The cave divers who went back for their friends Dr Harris, from Adelaide in Australia, has decades of diving experience. He was the one who examined the boys in the cave and gave the green light so the rescue operation could go ahead. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Had the boys been too weak, a rescue attempt by diving out would have been too dangerous. According to media reports, Dr Harris has taken part in cave diving explorations in Australia, China, Christmas Island and New Zealand. A anaesthetist by training, he has also been specialising in expedition medicine and retrieval operations. In 2011, he recovered the body of his friend, experienced cave diver Agnes Milowka, who ran out of air during an extremely difficult expedition in South Australia. It is thought that his assistance in the Thai rescue was specifically requested by the British divers. The doctor who stayed with the boys Petty Officer Saman Gunan, 38, was a retired Thai navy diver who volunteered in the rescue efforts. He lost consciousness on his way out of the Tham Luang cave complex, where he had been delivering air tanks on 6 July. This video can not be played Wife and father remember 'hero' Thai diver: ""He loved helping others"" His dive partner tried to revive him but could not, and his body was brought out of the cave. His widow told the BBC: ""He's been praised as a hero because of who he was. He loved helping others, doing charity work and getting things done."" Rear Adm Arphakorn said he would not let PO Gunan's ""life be in vain."" ""We will not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste."" Belgian Ben Reymenants runs a dive shop in Phuket. He is thought to be part of the group that first found the boys on the Monday. Ben Reymenants with governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn and fellow diver Maksym Polejaka Claus Rasmussen is a Danish national who has been living for years in Thailand, working for several different dive schools. He is currently an instructor working with Ben Reymenants' company, Blue Label Diving. He has been diving across Asia and also worked in several other countries in South East Asia. A picture Mr Paasi posted on Facebook, showing Claus Rasmussen in the cave Finnish national Mikko Paasi is the founder of a diving centre on the small Thai island of Koh Tao, where he specialises in technical diving. That means he focuses on wreck and cave diving. On 2 July, the day the boys and their coach were found,Mikko's wife said on Facebook she bought her husband's flight to Chiang Rai,externalto join the rescue efforts on what was their eighth wedding anniversary. Mikko Paasi is one of several divers who worked to get the boys to safety Ivan Karadzic, a Dane, moved to Koh Tao a few years after Mr Paasi, and they now run the diving centre together. He told the BBC about his fear on seeing the first boy and a diver approach him from a distance - not knowing if it was a ""casualty or kid"" - and then his relief on realising the boy was safe. This video can not be played Rescue diver in Thai cave: ""I was very scared"" On Mr Gunan's death in the run up to the final rescue efforts, Mr Karadzic wrote on his Facebook wall: ""Rest in peace.

Why was Elon Musk at the Thai cave rescue?,"Elon Musk has tweeted that he visited the Thai rescue operation but did not share images of himself at the site Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk's attempt to help the Thai cave rescue mission has attracted both praise and criticism. The SpaceX and Tesla chief posted on social media that he had visited the operation's command centre, where he said he had left a mini-submarine that had been designed to carry a trapped football team to safety. The head of the rescue mission thanked Mr Musk for his offer. But he said the sub could not be used. ""The equipment they brought to help us is not practical with our mission,"" Narongsak Osotthanakorn explained. ""Even though their equipment is technologically sophisticated, it doesn't fit with our mission to go in the cave."" Thai Navy Seals subsequently announced that all 12 boys and their coach had been brought out safely. Mr Muskhas since tweeted an email from Richard Stanton,external- one of two British caving experts called in to front the rescue - which had urged the business leader to build the capsule as quickly as possible.

Mr Musk firstsuggested he could help save the trapped children,externaland their football coach on 4 July, in response to a Twitter user's suggestion that he might be able to assist the effort at the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai. Two days later Mr Musk confirmed,externalhe was sending engineers from SpaceX and his Boring Company - which specialises in drilling - to Thailand. He followed with several posts speculating about possible technical solutions to the problem. These includeda proposal for an air tube,externalthat could be inflated ""with air like a bouncy castle"", which he suggested could let the cut-off party walk to freedom. Mr Musk ultimately settled on turning part of one of SpaceX's Falcon rockets into a ""kid-size submarine"", and he posted videos of its tests online. Allow Twitter content?

Thousands watch RAF's centenary flypast,"This video can not be played A flypast of aircraft marks the centenary of the Royal Air Force Thousands of people have gathered outside Buckingham Palace to watch a flypast of aircraft to mark the centenary of the Royal Air Force. Almost 100 planes representing the RAF over the years flew over The Mall following a parade by personnel. The Queen and other members of the Royal Family saw the display - which included the new F-35 fighter and Spitfires - from the palace balcony. Earlier they marked the centenary at a special service in Westminster Abbey. The service began what the head of the RAF said would be a ""tremendous"" day of events to mark its 100 years. Three F-35 Lightning stealth fighters were involved in the flypast and 22 Typhoons spelt out 100 as they flew over the palace. The 24-year-old who guards Â£70m RAF jets Nine helicopters led the armada, while the Red Arrows brought up the rear. The aircraft assembled in holding patterns off the coast of East Anglia before merging near Ipswich and flying down the A12 corridor to London. Three of the RAF's new F-35 Lightning fighters flew over the capital The Red Arrows brought the flypast to a close Thousands of people gathered on The Mall Seven of the nine Tornados in the flypast - the aircraft is due to be retired from the RAF in 2019 The spectacle in the sky was met with applause from the crowds According to the Met Police, an estimated 65,000 to 70,000 people gathered on The Mall to watch the parade and flypast, with roads in central London being closed until 17:00 BST. Surrounded by other members of the Royal Family, the Queen presented a new Queen's Colour to the RAF in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace before moving to the balcony. In a brief speech, she congratulated the RAF for a ""remarkable contribution to defence"" over the last 100 years, saying ""tenacity, skill and gallantry"" had been its hallmarks. She added: ""I remember the Battle of Britain being fought over the skies above us and we shall never forget the courage and sacrifice of that time."" The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived together for the service earlier in the day The Queen called today ""a very special day"" and said the RAF's ""courage and sacrifice"" will never be forgotten The number ""100"" was spelt out in the sky by 22 Typhoon jets in their biggest ever formation The Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service merged to create the RAF on 1 April 1918 - the world's first independent air force. In his address at Westminster Abbey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, said the RAF had played a ""decisive factor in saving this country's independence, its democracy and its freedom; its hope of civilisation and its contribution to humanity for the future"". He added: ""It is also right to remember with sorrow and again profound thanksgiving the scores of thousands who have given their lives in service as part of the RAF."" The Queen,who did not attend Prince Louis' christening on Monday,was at the service along with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke of York, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Retired and serving members of the RAF were also there, along with the Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nick Carter, and politicians including Prime Minister Theresa May, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

Danone says new Aptamil milk is 'safe',"Rose Menzies' baby Harry did not like the new formula Danone, which makes Aptamil baby milk, says there are ""no safety issues"" with the new formulation of its product, despite concern from some customers. Parents have taken to social media to complain that the new formula is causing their infants to be sick. Danone UK admitted the new product doesn't dissolve as easily as the original. With hindsight it could have done more to make parents aware of alterations to mixing instructions, the firm said. Danone looking into Aptamil complaints Danone says it is listening to parents' concerns and will provide further information and support, but it defended the new formula which it says provides additional nutrients that support the good functioning of the gut. Parents told the BBCthat their babies experienced upset stomachs after they started using the new recipe Aptamil. They said the milk powder did not dissolve in the bottles, leaving clumps of residue. One mother, Rosie Menzies, told the BBC her son was sick after feeds and began to refuse bottles until she switched brands. This video can not be played 'New milk formula made my baby sick' Danone said babies sometimes take time to adapt to new foods, which could cause temporary changes to their digestive patterns, but that the product had passed extensive clinical trials and product testing. ""We have had good mixing results when the product is mixed in line with instructions,"" the firm said. The new formula needs to be shaken vigorously for at least ten seconds for the powder to dissolve properly, it said. ""We acknowledge that with hindsight we could have made the changes to the mixing instructions clearer and we will take action on this, particularly across our consumer and social media channels,"" the firm added. The new formula underwent a different manufacturing process in order to include different nutrients, the firm said. That process reduced its solubility. Aptamil has changed the recipes of three products: Aptamil First Infant Milk powder (stage 1), Aptamil Follow On Milk powder (stage 2) and Aptamil Growing Up Milk powders (stages 3 & 4). Danone has established a helpline for parents who are concerned. Parents in the UK are advised to call 0800 996 1000, pressing option 0 followed by option 1.

US cannot reunite dozens of child migrants,"A young migrant child waiting to be processed in Texas after the government's suspended zero-tolerance policy The Trump administration has said 27 young migrant children are ""not eligible for reunification"" with their parents, according to a court filing. Twelve other children's mothers or fathers have already been deported from the US, said the government. ""Legitimate logistical impediments"" are delaying reunions for many of the 102 children under five years old who were taken from parents, US officials say. Nearly 3,000 children were split from undocumented adults entering the US. As he boarded a plane to Europe on Tuesday, President Donald Trump was asked his solution to the child migrant situation. He said: ""Don't come to our country illegally. Come like other people do. Come legally."" His administration was bound by a court order to reunite children aged five and under by 10 July. This video can not be played 'It's been 50 days since I heard of my son' The Department of Justice (DoJ) and American Civil Liberties Union's (ACLU) joint status report on Tuesday detailed why the 27 children cannot yet be reunited with their families. The parents of 10 children were being still held in criminal custody after crossing the US border without papers, and have yet to be fully assessed, said the report. Eight other children's parents have a ""serious criminal history"" including narcotics, human smuggling, murder and robbery. Two other children cannot be reunited with parents because of a possible threat of child abuse. Five children had been separated from adults who were not their parents. Toddlers appearing in court cases alone DNA tests for separated migrant families Watch: Cost of migrant detention vs alternatives Another child's parent is being treated for a communicable illness. The location of another child's parent has been unknown for more than a year. Records show both parent and child might even be US citizens. Some 75 of the 102 separated children have been determined eligible to be reunited with their families, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). But as of Tuesday afternoon, the government said it had only reunited four of those children with their parents. It said it expected to reunite another 34 by the end of the day, in accordance with the deadline. This video can not be played Trump supporters talk family separations and border security But 12 children cannot be immediately reunited with their families because their parents have already been deported. For those children, the court filing says they ""may be reunified if their parents can be located and if those parents request reunification"". The ACLU said it accepted that those parents in criminal custody cannot be reunited with their children yet. But it said in many cases ""the government is not in compliance with the clear deadline ordered by the Court"". The ACLU said: ""For the [parents] who were deported without their children, [US government officials] have not even tried to contact them or facilitate their reunification by today."" The government will probably receive an updated order and deadline for reuniting these children. Trump administration attorneys have requested a ""flexible schedule"" for reuniting or removing children since ""pieces of this process are out of [the government's] hands"". The filing notes that the government agencies and ACLU are working together to locate parents in immigration detention facilities. US government officials recently told four immigrant mothers they must pay for DNA tests to be reunited with their children, an immigrant shelter in El Paso, Texas, where the women are staying,told the Daily Beast,external. This video can not be played Feeling what it's like to cross the US border At a hearing on Monday in San Diego, California, a federal judge agreed with the government that some cases ""will necessitate additional time"". The government is still mandated to reunite the remaining children aged five to 17 - numbering as many as 2,900 - with their parents by 26 July. Meanwhile, a court in Los Angeles has rejected the Trump administration's request to allow the long-term detention of illegal immigrant children. Under a 1997 agreement, child migrants can only be detained for 20 days. The federal judge said the administration's request to extend that limit was ""a cynical attempt"" to shift immigration policymaking to the courts. Another 10,000 or so migrant children currently in US custody entered the country without parents, undertaking the long and dangerous journey alone or with strangers.

What happened when England last got to a semi-final,"Did you hear? England are in the semi-final of the World Cup. The last time England were in this position was back in 1990, so this is the first semi-final many people have seen in their lifetimes. The vast majority of the current squad weren't even born at the time. There will be a lot of references to that tournament in the build up to Wednesday's game, including clips of a (now vintage) penalty shootout knockout, Gazza crying and John Barnes rapping. So here's a cheat sheet. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

The last time England were in the semis, no-one was chanting ""football's coming home"" in the streets. That's because the song wouldn't come out for another six years. The team's official World Cup song was New Order's World in Motion - one of the few football songs to stand the test of time. It's now most famous for one thing: England midfielder John Barnes wrote and performed his own rap in the song. This video can not be played World Cup moments: Gazza's tears at Italia '90 Germany was two countries the last time England played in a semi-final (and this Wednesday's opponents Croatia didn't even exist as a country). So it was West Germany who lined up against England on that night in Turin. The wizardry of England's brightest talent - 23-year-old Paul Gascoigne - had helped spur the team to the semi-finals, sparking Gazzamania around the country. But, with the match at 1-1 after 90 minutes, legs were tired and Gazza got booked for a late tackle in extra time - his second yellow of the tournament. His bottom lip started to wobble. If England were to make it to the final, he would be suspended. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

England didn't win the match (they lost on penalties, of course) and there were more tears from Gascoigne after the game too. Although he didn't know it at the time, that would be the last time he would play in a World Cup. Bobby Robson - who maybe didn't have the wisest words before a shootout After England's win against Sweden on Saturday, Match of the Day played a montage of clips from the West Germany game. Gary Lineker seemed to be ""doing a Gazza"" and had a tear in his eye after watching it. Robson - later Sir Bobby - was the hugely respected manager at the helm of that team, which featured Gary. ""I think I've got something in my eye"" - Gary Lineker after watching the montage from 1990 But the manager maybe didn't have the wisest words in the minutes leading up to the shootout. ""Bobby Robson walked over to us and said 'Don't let me down, there are 30 million people watching this back home', which is not really what you want to be reminded of,"" Gary Linekertold Newsbeat a few weeks ago. ""Peter Beardsley and myself burst out laughing, we thought it was hilarious. ""But it didn't work."" It was the closest the country had got since 1966. Robson had been told before the tournament that his contract wouldn't be renewed, making England's play-off for third place his last game after eight years in charge. This video can not be played England lose to Germany on penalties at Italia 90 Of course a penalty shootout was England's downfall. Lineker and Beardsley both scored, along with David Platt - but Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle missed and England were knocked out.

"Man exposed to nerve agent now consciousThe partner of a woman who died after being poisoned is in a stable condition but ""not out of the woods"".","A man who was exposed to the nerve agent Novichok has regained consciousness after a ""small but significant improvement"", Salisbury District Hospital has said. Charlie Rowley, who has been in hospital since falling ill in Amesbury on 30 June, is in a critical but stable condition. But the 45-year-old ""is still very unwell"", a statement said. Dawn Sturgess, 44, who was also exposed to the nerve agent, died on Sunday. Her familyhave described her as ""a gentle soul who was generous to a fault"". Police are investigating a possible link to the case of Russians Sergei and Yulia Skripal - who were poisoned with the same substance in nearby Salisbury. The UK government has blamed Russia for the incident, but the country's authorities deny any involvement. Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said people in the Amesbury and Salisbury areashould not ""pick up any foreign object which could contain liquid or gel, in the interests of their own safety"".,external Murder inquiry after Novichok woman dies Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said: ""[Charlie Rowley] is in a critical but stable condition, and is now conscious. ""While this is welcome news, clearly we are not out of the woods yet. ""Charlie is still very unwell and will continue to require specialist, round-the-clock care here at Salisbury District Hospital."" Dawn Sturgess died on Sunday after being taken ill on 30 June Ms Sturgess lived in Salisbury, and the couple had been in the city before going to Mr Rowley's flat in nearby Amesbury on Friday 29 June. They both then fell ill on Saturday 30 June, and Ms Sturgess died eight days later. She had two sons, aged 19 and 23, and an 11-year-old daughter. Police seized a car in Swindon on Monday as part of their ongoing investigation into the poisoning. The BBC understands the white Audi belonged to a paramedic who had been with Ms Sturgess in an ambulance when she fell ill. Local residents said the paramedic had told them he got bodily fluids on him, but he had been checked over by doctors and given the ""all-clear"". His car was sealed and taken away on the back of a truck. The BBC understands the car belongs to a paramedic Residents also claimed he had told them both his car and his clothes were being taken to the government laboratory at Porton Down to be destroyed. Wiltshire Police said the public ""should not be alarmed by this,"" adding: ""Those involved have the training and expertise to safely remove the vehicle."" Police are continuing to hunt for a contaminated container which they believe was handled by the pair. The BBC understands Mr Rowley's flat is regarded as the key location in the search. A team wearing protective clothing is combing the small flat, working in 30-minute shifts because of the heat. Public Health England also offered advice for people who may have visited one of five areas identified by police. Those locations are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy, and the Baptist church in Amesbury, and John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Anyone who was there between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 on 30 June should continue to follow advice, including washing their clothes in a washing machine.

Ronaldo to make ÃÂ£99m Juventus move,"This video can not be played Cristiano Ronaldo's goals during the 2018 World Cup Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo has joined Juventus, becoming one of the four most expensive players of all time. A deal worth 112m euros (Â£99.2m) has been reached between the two clubs that has seen the Portuguese sign a four-year deal with the Italian champions. Ronaldo, 33, won four Champions League titles in his nine years at Real. ""The time has come to open a new stage in my life, that's why I asked the club to accept transferring me,""he said.,external The top two world record transfer fees have been paid out by Paris St-Germain - the Â£200m they paid Barcelona forBrazil forward Neymar last August,and the fee of around Â£166m for France forward Kylian Mbappe in July after a successful season on loan with PSG. Barcelona also paidLiverpool Â£142m for Brazil midfielder Philippe Coutinhoin January. For Juventus, the fee they will pay for Ronaldo is set to eclipse the Â£75.3m they paid for forward Gonzalo Higuain from Napoli in July 2016. Juventus are set to play Real Madrid in a pre-season International Champions Cup tournament in the United States, with the match taking place at FedEx Field in Washington on Saturday, 4 August. These years in Real Madrid, and in this city of Madrid, have been possibly the happiest of my life. I only have feelings of enormous gratitude for this club, for its fans and for this city. I can only thank all of them for the love and affection I have received. However, I believe that the time has come to open a new stage in my life and that is why I have asked the club to accept transferring me. I feel that way and I ask everyone, and especially our fans, to please understand me. They have been absolutely wonderful for nine years. They have been nine unique years. It has been an emotional time for me, full of consideration but also hard because Real Madrid is of the highest demands, but I know very well that I will never forget that I have enjoyed football here in a unique way. I have had fabulous team-mates on the field and in the dressing room, I have felt the warmth of an incredible crowd and together we have won three Championships in a row and four Championships in five years. And with them also, on an individual level, I have the satisfaction of having won four Gold Balls and three Gold Boots. All during my time in this immense and extraordinary club. Ronaldo's lowest return in a season at Real Madrid was 33 goals in 2009-10 Real Madrid has conquered my heart, and that of my family, and that is why more than ever I want to say thank you: thanks to the club, the President, the directors, my colleagues, all the technical staff, doctors, physios and incredible workers that make everything work, that tirelessly pursue every minute detail. Thank you infinitely once more to our fans and thanks also to Spanish Football. During these nine exciting years I have played against great players. My respect and my recognition for all of them. I have reflected a lot and I know that the time has come for a new cycle. I'm leaving but this shirt, this badge and the Santiago Bernabeu will continue to always feel part of me wherever I am. Thanks to all and, of course, as I said that first time in our stadium nine years ago: Go Madrid! Ronaldo joined Real from Manchester United for Â£80m in July 2009 and scored a club-record 450 goals and won the Ballon D'Or - awarded to the world's best footballer - in 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017. He has helped them win the Champions League in four of the past five seasons, scoring in the 2014 and 2017 finals. ""For Real Madrid Cristiano Ronaldo will always be one of the great symbols,"" said a club statement. ""Real Madrid wants to express its gratitude to a player who has proved to be the best in the world and who has marked one of the brightest times in the history of our club and world football. ""Real Madrid will always be your home."" Despite their dominance in Europe's premier club competition, Real struggled domestically, finishing 17 points behind champions Barcelona last season. Real are keen on reshaping their team under new manager Julen Lopetegui and the 33-time La Liga winners have also been linked with a move for Paris St-Germain's 26-year-old Brazil forward Neymar. However, it would be a controversial move as Neymar spent four years at Real's fierce rivals Barcelona before joining PSG in his world record transfer of Â£200m last summer. Real have also been linked with a move for another PSG forward, Mbappe, the 19-year-old who has helped France reach the semi-finals of the World Cup. Italian football expert James Horncastle told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Real would be reluctant to lose Ronaldo without a replacement in hand. They have been linked with Neymar, who joined PSG for a world record fee last season, and their flirting with the Brazilian appears to have put Ronaldo's nose out of joint at Madrid. ""We don't know who is being lined up, be it Kylian Mbappe, Eden Hazard or Harry Kane."" James Horncastle, Italian football expert on BBC Radio 5 live Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in Real Madrid's 4-1 win over Juventus in the 2017 Champions League final in Cardiff Juventus were made aware a few weeks ago that Ronaldo might be available on favourable terms. Ronaldo had a buyout clause worth $1bn (Â£886m) and Juventus were told Real Madrid were willing to accept Â£100m and Juventus were willing to pursue that even though it would mean restructuring their wage system. We heard Juventus president, Andrea Agnelli, boarded a plane and then got a helicopter to see Ronaldo on holiday in Greece. They are calling it the deal of the century in Italy. Juventus have reached the Champions League final twice in the last four years and lost both. One of those defeats was to Ronaldo's Real Madrid. He scored in the final in Cardiff and he knocked them out in the quarters this year. They believe he is the difference and the player who could achieve the Champions League with Juventus for the first time in 23 years. Winning the trophy has been an obsession for them. This is much more than about football it's about them going to the next level as a business. When Deloitte ranked the 10 richest clubs in the world earlier this year, Juventus were only 10th. They believe by being able to leverage and monetising some of his followers on social media and his commercial deals, will help them close the gap financially on Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United. The Italians are confident there could be an announcement this evening, although the finer details of the deal would take a few more days. Juventus' share prices on the stock exchange sky-rocketed by 33%. 450 - Ronaldo's Real Madrid-record goal tally, in 438 games. 17 - his record goal tally for a Champions League season, in 2013-14. 105 - total Champions League goals for the club, which also included 16 in 2015-16 and 15 in the most recent campaign. 311 - goals in La Liga. 16 - major trophies with the club, including two La Ligas and four Champions Leagues, three Club World Cups and three European Super Cups. 44 - hat-tricks for Madrid including a club-record 34 in La Liga. 8 - the number of times he scored four or more goals in a Real match. That included five-goal league hauls against Granada in 2014-15 and Espanyol the following season. 61 - his most prolific season for Real came in 2014-15 with 61 goals in all competitions, including 48 in the league. 659 - career goals, including five for Sporting Lisbon, 118 for Manchester United, 451 for Real Madrid and 85 for Portugal.

Women guilty of emaciated teen's death,"Jordan Burling died at the home he shared with his mother and grandmother on 30 June 2016 The mother and grandmother of an emaciated man who was allowed to ""rot to death"" have been convicted of his manslaughter. Jordan Burling, 18, went into cardiac arrest in Leeds in 2016 and died weighing less than six stone (37kg). Mother Dawn Cranston and grandmother Denise were both convicted after a trial at Leeds Crown Court. Mr Burling's sister Abigail Burling, 25, was convicted of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult's death. The teenager left to waste away The jury cleared her of manslaughter, following more than two days of deliberations. On the day Mr Burling died, paramedics found him wearing a soiled nappy and lying in an unresponsive state on a makeshift inflatable bed in the living room of the house in Butterbowl Garth, Farnley. A subsequent police search of the property found the remains of a baby boy in a rucksack, hidden on the top shelf of a cupboard in Jordan's bedroom for 14 years. Dawn Cranston earlier admitted a count of endeavouring to conceal the birth of a child. Denise Cranston, 70, Abigail Burling, 25, and Dawn Cranston, 45, failed to alert a GP as Jordan's condition worsened At the time of Mr Burling's death, his appearance was likened to a victim of a World War Two concentration camp, with an NHS dietician telling the court he had the lowest body mass index she had ever seen. The Crown Prosecution Service described the case as ""one of the most shocking"" they had ever dealt with in the Yorkshire region. Mr Burling had lived with Ms Cranston, 45, Mrs Cranston, 70 and Jordan's uncle, with his sister living a short distance away in Cow Close Road. More on this story and others in West Yorkshire It was estimated he had been malnourished for at least six months before he died, having developed bed sores so deep they left bone exposed. Paramedic Bridget Shepherd, who treated Mr Burling, said he looked ""very, very pale and very emaciated"" when she first arrived on 30 June 2016, the day he died. A post-mortem examination found he died from acute bronchopneumonia, resulting from his malnutrition, his immobility and his infected sores. Mr Burling was confined to the living room of the house in the final months of his life In his early life, a primary school report stated there was a ""general neglect of Jordan's basic needs"", with the young boy lacking toilet training, having black teeth, and few language skills. Prosecutor Nicholas Lumley QC said ""education and social services played little part in his life"", particularly after his mother decided to home-school him from the age of 12. The trial heard from a neighbour, who said the family was considered ""strange and reclusive"" by locals. Emaciated teen's sister 'misled police' Starving teen's mum 'saw GP herself' Mother 'genuinely tried' to help son PC Ben McNamara, who arrived at the home shortly after Mr Burling's death, told the court the first thing Dawn Cranston asked him was how much the funeral would cost. ""I was surprised by everyone's lack of emotion. It is a strange thing to say after he had just died,"" he said. Mr Burling was home-schooled by his mother from the age of 12 after being bullied at school. His family claimed his weight fluctuated around Christmas 2015 but he started to look ""very thin"" the following April. Mr Lumley said Mr Burling's three relatives ""failed to seek medical assistance for him as he became immobile and helpless."" Leeds Crown Court heard Mr Burling was rarely seen outside of the house by neighbours In the final months of his life, he was confined to the living room with his family changing his adult nappy and washing him. During the trial, the jury heard the family home was targeted by youths throwing projectiles at windows regularly around 2006. It was around this time that Denise Cranston's husband Herbert committed suicide in a bedroom, the court heard. While giving evidence, Ms Cranston told the jury about an incident ""in 2002 or 2003"" when she had given birth alone in Jordan's bedroom while her family were all downstairs. She told jurors she was completely unaware she was pregnant until she started to feel something ""really heavy"" in her body, and had given birth within half an hour. The court heard ""she tried everything"" for up to an hour to save the baby's life including mouth-to-mouth resuscitation but there ""were no signs of life at all"". ""I just panicked, as nobody else knew that I was pregnant,"" she said. The court heard she hid the remains of the baby in a rucksack, which she then stored in the top of a wardrobe. The three women are due to be sentenced on Thursday.

Rescue story in picturesWhy was Elon Musk at the Thai cave rescue?,"The successful 17-day search and rescue operation has captivated the country The desperate effort to find and rescue a team of young footballers in Thailand from a flooded cave has gripped the world. After the last boys and their coach were rescued on Tuesday, we look back at how the story unfolded. On Saturday 23 June, 12 members of the Wild Boar soccer team, aged 11-16, entered the Tham Luang cave system in Thailand's Chiang Rai Province along with their 25-year-old football coach after a team practice. The cave system, which is 10km (6 miles) deep, is known locally for its deep recesses and narrow passages. The team has reportedly visited the cave before - but this time heavy rains cause flooding, impeding their exit. After the children fail to return home, they are reported missing and search efforts begin. Initial rescuers at the site reportedly find the team's bicycles, football boots and other belongings close to the cave's entrance. Media and volunteers start to gather at the site as heavy rain continues to complicate the search and rescue process. Who are the boys trapped in the cave? How the boys were saved The brits who helped find the boys By Sunday family members reach the cave, praying and holding vigils for the missing children. Three days in, divers from the Royal Thai Navy arrive to assist in local search efforts. Fresh hand and footprints are spotted inside the vast cave complex, raising hopes for the group's safety. Government officials visit the site, and Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon says the government is still optimistic the team can be found alive. Rescuers consider other routes in - teams of soldiers search for alternative entrance points and the authorities consider drilling into the mountain to get access. By Wednesday 27 June, diving and survival specialists from all around the world arrive in the country to help with search efforts. Relatives continue to hold vigils and pray at the site, as concern about the under-16 team's fate grows. Family members and officers are pictured fainting, and desperation deepens as weather conditions deteriorate. Thailand is now captivated by the desperate search, clinging to hope they can survive.Social media users share fan art in tribute to the missing 13, referring to them as ""the strangers we want to meet the most"". Pumps are brought in to try to help reduce the water levels in the cave, but continuing rain intermittently suspends efforts. Rescuers now believe and hope the team sought safety on a rock mound inside a cave chamber known as ""Patayya beach"". Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha visits relatives at the site and tries to offer comfort, telling them: ""They're athletes. They're strong."" The world's media has by now gathered at the site, with journalists staking out in the muddy conditions to hear the latest news. Over the weekend of 30 June, a break in rainy conditions allows divers to get further inside the cave than before. Supplies and air tanks are brought into the cave as the rescue teams advance. On Monday 2 July there is dramatic news - divers have found all of the boys and their coach safe nine days after they went missing. The team are found on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. A video is released of the moment they are discovered by British divers There are scenes of joy and relief at the site, as relatives and officials celebrate the news A video showing the boys in apparent good health is released by the Thai Navy seals, but officials stress that the rescue effort remains complex. Medical aid and food is brought in to the team, as rescuers consider the best way to get them out to safety. Millions of litres of water are being pumped out of the cave system, but with the rainy season in full flow, officials warn the boys may have to learn to dive to get free - or wait months until conditions approve. The buoyant mood at the site then sours dramatically at the end of the week after a diver working on the rescue dies. It emerges that Saman Gunan, 38, a former Thai navy diver volunteering in the cave, lost consciousness while delivering oxygen air tanks. Tributes pour in for the lost diver, as concern is raised about the difficult task ahead. The commander of Thailand's Navy Seals warns that oxygen levels are dropping, as notes written by the team and coach emerge and are released. In one, the youngsters urge relatives to not worry, saying they are strong In a race against the rain, officials designate a ""limited"" window during which they believe the team can be successfully evacuated out. With conditions optimum on Sunday 8 July, ""D-Day"" comes and intensive rescue operations begin. Ambulances are pictured leaving the site, as speculation grows about how the rescue went. It is eventually confirmed that four of the boys have been safely brought out. Officials say the operation is running ""smoothly"", but efforts pause overnight to replace air tanks and let divers rest. Ambulances leaving the site are monitored closely by the watching media The operation is very complex, and involves a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. At the end of Monday, it emerges that four more of the boys have been successfully freed. Those evacuated out are being cared for in local hospitals, gradually being weaned back onto solid foods Classmates are pictured celebrating the news of the ongoing rescues The story of Thailand's cave rescue The government strictly guards information about the rescue, including the names of those who have been saved. The boys are held in hospital for supervision. Access for visiting parents is said to be limited because of potential health risks. On Tuesday there are high hopes for a successful rescue of everyone, as a final push starts to free those still inside. Locals pictured waving at ambulances driving out of the nerve-wracked rescue site Efforts continue throughout Tuesday, untilit is finally confirmed by officials that all 13 have been rescued safely. Locals and rescuers at the site celebrate, as the last boys and their coach are transferred to hospital, 17 days after getting trapped underground.

As a Manchester United fan I cannot believe that he is joining Juventus.  Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo is set to join Juventus, becoming one of the four most expensive players of all time. A deal worth 112m euros (Â£99.2m) has been reached between the two clubs that will see the Portuguese sign a four-year deal with the Italian champions.

Ronaldo had a buyout clause worth $1bn (Â£886m) and Juventus were told Real Madrid were willing to accept Â£100m and Juventus were willing to pursue that even though it would mean restructuring their wage system. We heard yesterday Juventus president, Andrea Agnelli, boarded a plane and then got a helicopter to see Ronaldo on holiday in Greece, and it looks as though the deal is done. They are calling it the deal of the century in Italy. Juventus have reached the Champions League final twice in the last four years and lost both. One of those defeats was to Ronaldo's Real Madrid.

Trump told to appreciate allies on Nato trip,"This video can not be played In 2018, Donald Trump told Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg that Germany is ""totally controlled by Russia"" US President Donald Trump has clashed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over Russian influence and defence spending, ahead of a Nato summit. Mr Trump said Germany was ""totally controlled by Russia"" because of the high level of natural gas it imported, and this was a ""bad thing for Nato"". Mrs Merkel hit back, comparing German independence now with the time when she grew up in the former East Germany. She also defended her country's contribution to the Western alliance. The last summit both leaders attended ended in acrimony in a row over trade. Mr Trump later made more conciliatory remarks after he and Mrs Merkel had met on the sidelines of the summit in Brussels on Wednesday. The summit comes less than a week beforeMr Trump is due to hold his first summit with Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki, reviving concerns among US allies over his proximity to the Russian president. Reality Check: How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? Can Nato survive Donald Trump? What does the US contribute to Nato? President Trump shocked some by quipping that the Nato summit might prove harder than next Monday's summit with Mr Putin. He has said the US is being ""taken advantage of"" by other members of the Nato alliance, which was set up in 1949 to counter the Soviet Union, of which Russia is the main successor state. European Council President Donald Tusk accused him of criticising Europe ""almost daily"", tweeting: ""Dear America, appreciate your allies, after all you don't have that many."" Germany has the EU's biggest economy and has long been accused by US administrations of failing to contribute its fair share to Nato operations but Mr Trump's comments were particularly stinging. At a breakfast meeting in Brussels with Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg, the US leader said: ""Germany is totally controlled by Russia because they will be getting from 60% to 70% of their energy from Russia, and a new pipeline, and you tell me if that's appropriate because I think it's not and I think it's a very bad thing for Nato."" EU figures suggestRussia is responsible for between 50% and 75% of Germany's gas imports,external, butgas makes up less than 20% of Germany's energy mix for power production. Germany has given political support for a new Baltic Sea pipeline, Nord Stream 2, which will increase the flow of Russian gas to EU states. The project has been sharply criticised by Poland and others. The US president also accused Germany of only spending ""a little bit over 1%"" of its economic output on defence compared to the 4.2% spent by the US ""in actual numbers"". Germany spends 1.24% of GDP on defence and the US 3.5%,external, according to the latest Nato estimate. ""I want to say that I have experience of when a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union,"" she told reporters. ""I am very happy that today we are united in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of that we can say that we can make our independent policies and make independent decisions. ""That is very good, especially for people in eastern Germany."" Mrs Merkel (centre) led efforts to negotiate with Mr Trump over trade at last month's G7 summit in Canada What's happening in this G7 picture? US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU She added that Germany had put a huge proportion of its troops at Nato's disposal. ""We are still very heavily involved in Afghanistan and thus we also defend the interests of the United States of America... and Germany was pleased to do it and did it out of conviction,"" she said. At the G7 summit in Canada last month, the German chancellor led efforts to reach agreement with Mr Trump on trade butthe American leader rejected the G7 summit joint communique after he left. Mr Stoltenberg sought to play down Mr Trump's accusations, saying he expected Nato leaders would agree they were ""stronger together than apart"". He also tried to separate arguments about trade - not a primary Nato concern - from discussions about military matters. ""There are disagreements on trade. This is serious. My task is to try to minimise the negative impact on Nato,"" Mr Stoltenberg told a forum on the sidelines of the summit. Mr Trump told reporters that military spending and a planned gas pipeline from Russia to Germany had been discussed. ""We have a very, very good relationship with the chancellor. We have a tremendous relationship with Germany,"" he said. Mrs Merkel said she had discussed migration and trade with Mr Trump, and that she looked forward to further discussions as the US and Germany remained partners. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent In describing Germany as being ""totally controlled by Russia"" and linking this to what the US sees as Berlin's unsatisfactory defence budget, President Trump is underscoring two longstanding US concerns. US leaders have long warned of what they see as Europe's uncomfortable dependence upon Russian energy supplies. And they have also been arguing for more than a decade that the Europeans should spend more on defence. Mr Trump has given these twin themes a new and more abrasive tone. While he may well be overstating Germany's dependence upon Russian energy, even many European leaders are well aware of the potential influence that this could give Moscow. It's an area where short-term economic and longer-term security considerations are at variance. No wonder then that when the US sanctions Russia for its behaviour in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea it included steps to hamper anyone who helped build or support new Russian pipelines westwards. German troops in Lithuania this summer Mr Trump's main objection is that all but a handful of member states have still not increased their defence budgets to meet a goal of spending at least 2% of their annual economic output on defence by 2024.

Of Nato's 29 members, just five meet that target this year: the US, Greece, Estonia, the UK and Latvia. However, several, such as Poland and France, are close to the mark. Some in Nato fear Mr Trump's repeated blunt demands could harm morale, furthering the agenda of President Putin, whom they accuse of seeking to destabilise the West.

They believe by being able to leverage and monetising some of his followers on social media and his commercial deals, will help them close the gap financially on Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United. The Italians are confident there could be an announcement this evening, although the finer details of the deal would take a few more days. Juventus' share prices on the stock exchange sky-rocketed by 33%. 450 - Ronaldo's Real Madrid-record goal tally, in 438 games. 17 - his record goal tally for a Champions League season, in 2013-14. 105 - total Champions League goals for the club, which also included 16 in 2015-16 and 15 in the most recent campaign. 311 - goals in La Liga. 16 - major trophies with the club, including two La Ligas and four Champions Leagues, three Club World Cups and three European Super Cups. 44 - hat-tricks for Madrid including a club-record 34 in La Liga. 8 - the number of times he scored four or more goals in a Real match. That included five-goal league hauls against Granada in 2014-15 and Espanyol the following season. 61 - his most prolific season for Real came in 2014-15 with 61 goals in all competitions, including 48 in the league. 659 - career goals, including five for Sporting Lisbon, 118 for Manchester United, 451 for Real Madrid and 85 for Portugal.

Rising numbers pass primary Sats tests,"A higher proportion of primary school pupils in England have reached the expected standards in national curriculum tests, often known as Sats, in maths and English. In reading, 75% reached the expected standard, compared with 71% last year. In maths, 76% reached the expected standard, up from 75% last year. Julie McCulloch, of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the ""impressive results"" but criticised the pressure created by the tests. The results showed that 64% of pupils met the expected standard across all the tests in reading, writing and mathematics, up from 61% last year. In writing, 78% reached the expected level, up from 76%. And in grammar, punctuation and spelling, it was 78%, up from 77%. Ms McCulloch, policy director for the heads' union, said the continuing improvement showed the hard work of pupils and schools, following the introduction of ""harder tests"" in 2016. In the first year in which the tougher assessments were introduced only 53% made the grade, which has now risen in two years to 64%. But Ms McCulloch was concerned by reports of ""stress and anxiety"" for pupils taking the tests. The heads' union also warned against giving too much weight to a ""single set of results"". The ""expected level"" for maths and English is based on reaching a scaled score of 100. This year's average scaled score for reading was 105, slightly up from 104 last year. The average for maths remained the same at 104. School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said the results reflected rising standards in primary school. ""A good primary education lays the foundations for success at secondary school and beyond,"" he said. ""That's why we introduced a more rigorous, knowledge-rich primary school curriculum - with an emphasis on reading and fluency in arithmetic - to ensure every child is helped to reach their potential from the moment they start school."" But a campaign group of parents and teachers warned against too much testing in schools. ""At a time when their minds could have been stimulated and their knowledge expanded, their education has been sacrificed to a system which is in thrall to league tables,"" said Madeleine Holt, of the More Than A Score campaign.

Who are the boys?,"The 12 boys were all rescued and taken to hospital On 23 June, 12 boys and their football coach walked into a cave after football practice in northern Thailand. The boys, who are part of the Moo Pa - or Wild Boars - football team, became trapped when heavy rains flooded the Tham Luang cave and cut off their escape route. All 12 boys and their coach have been freed from the cave. Few details about the group have been released. Here is what we know about the boys and their coach: Chanin Vibulrungruang (Nickname: Titan), 11 The youngest in the team, who played as a forward. Titan started playing football at age seven before joining his school's sports club. He was later invited to join the Wild Boars football club. Panumas Sangdee (Nickname: Mig), 13 According to Nopparat Kantawong, the head coach of the football team, Mig is bigger than other kids his age, but he is agile. He is a defender for the Wild Boars. Duganpet Promtep (Nickname: Dom), 13 Striker, and captain of the Wild Boars, Dom has reportedly been scouted by several professional clubs in Thailand. He is said to be a motivator and respected by his team for his football skills. ""Players on the field need a captain like this because sometimes the coach can't get in to solve their problems,"" Nopparat told the BBC. How risky is the Thai boys rescue? The cave rescue as it happened The Brits who helped find the boys Adul Sam-on, 14 Adul was born in Myanmar's self-governing Wa State and left his family behind to get a better education in Thailand, according to reports. The left defender speaks Thai, Burmese, Chinese and English, and was the only one able to communicate with the British divers when the group was first discovered. Boys and parents send letters of love While trapped in the cave, the boys and their relatives exchanged letters, carried by the rescue divers. Adul told his parents he missed them and not to worry. ""Mum and Dad want to see your face,"" his parents wrote. ""Mum and Dad pray for you and your friends, so we can see each other soon."" Adul is also a talented volleyball player - and part of a local team that came second in all of northern Thailand two years in a row, local teacher Bunjob Chai-arm told the BBC. Somepong Jaiwong (Nickname: Pong), 13 ""Pong is a cheerful boy, he likes football, and every sport. He dreams of becoming a footballer for the Thai national team,"" his teacher Manutsanun Kuntun told AFP. The left winger wrote to his parents from inside the cave, saying: ""I love Dad and Mum. Don't worry about me, I'm safe."" His parents replied: ""Take good care of yourself and be strong - Dad, Mum and everyone are waiting for you."" Mongkol Booneiam (Nickname: Mark), 12 or 13 Mark has been described by his teacher as a ""very respectful"" boy. ""He's cheerful, energetic, very friendly, and likes football and volleyball,"" Bunjob Chai-arm told the BBC. Mark and his mother had moved to Thailand from Myanmar, he added. He plays in the same volleyball team as Adul. His father Thinnakorn Boonpiem told AFP that his son is a ""good boy"" who loves to study - almost as much as football. Nattawut Takamrong (Nickname: Tern), 14 In a letter to his parents, Tern told them not to worry about him. The defender wrote that he missed his parents and grandparents, but ""Tern can take care of myself"". ""Dad and mum are not angry at you and do not blame you,"" his parents replied, adding that they were waiting for him ""in front of the cave."" Peerapat Sompiangjai (Nickname: Night), 17 Night plays as right winger on the team. He went missing on his birthday and his parents say they are still waiting to hold his party. According to reports, the boys went into the cave to celebrate Night's birthday. They were said to have brought treats and snacks along with them. These supplies probably helped sustain the group in the many days spent trapped inside the cave. Sittthisak Sawanrak, who goes to the same cycling club as Night, describes him as ""a great lad who just loves to cycle and play football"". ""He's a quiet boy - doesn't talk much, but a very good, polite boy,"" he told the BBC. In a letter to his parents from the cave, Night wrote: ""Night loves everyone"" and drew several hearts. Ekarat Wongsukchan (Nickname: Bew), 14 Bew is the goalkeeper of the team. In a letter to his mother, Bew promised to help her sell things at her shop once he was rescued. Prajak Sutham (Nickname: Note), 15 Note has been described by family friends as a ""smart, quiet guy who loves sport and supports Chiang Rai United"". Family friend Ponrawee Tachavandee told the BBC he was ""shocked"" when he learned Note was trapped. ""I didn't expect he would go inside the cave."" Rinlinee Sombat, who works in the same garage as Note's father, describes him as  a kind boy who takes care of his two-year-old sister, and enjoys playing with her young son. ""He's a smart kid - when you teach him how to fix something in the garage, he'll learn how to do it after just one go,"" she told the BBC. Pipat Pho (Nickname: Nick), 15 In his letter, Nick told his parents he wants to go for Mookatha, or Thai barbeque, when he comes out of the cave. ""Nick loves Mum, Dad and siblings,"" he wrote, alongside a drawing of a heart. Pornchai Kamluang (Nickname: Tee), 16 Tee is a defender for the Wild Boars. ""Don't worry, I'm very happy"", said Tee in a letter to his parents. This video can not be played The mood was tense as people waited for news of the high-risk operation Assistant coach Ekapol Chantawong (Nickname: Ake), 25 Ake was reportedly born in Myanmar and lost his parents at a young age. Before becoming a football coach, he spent several years as a Buddhist monk, and learnt how to conserve energy by restricting movements and meditating. According to local news reports, he taught these techniques to the boys in the cave. In his letter, Ake apologised to the parents for taking the boys into the cave network, but several replied to say they did not blame him. ""I promise I will take care of the kids as best as I can,"" Ake wrote. The group of boys and their coach were found after nine days Some media reports suggest that when the group was found Ake was the weakest, having refused to eat any of the food they had brought with them, giving it instead to the boys. His note also included a message to both his aunt and grandmother, informing them that he was ""fine"". ""Do not worry too much about me. Take good care of your health,"" he wrote, adding: ""Please prepare vegetable juice and pork rind for me. I'll have them when I can get out. Thanks.""

"PayPal: Your death has breached our rulesPayments firm apologises after writing ""insensitive"" letter to cancer victim about her debt.Technology","This photo of Lindsay and Howard Durdle was taken last year PayPal wrote to a woman who had died of cancer saying her death had breached its rules and that it might take legal action as a consequence. The firm has since acknowledged that the letter was ""insensitive"", apologised to her widower, and begun an inquiry into how it came to be sent. The matter came to light after her bereaved husband contacted the BBC. He said he wanted to make other organisations aware how distressing automated messages could be. Lindsay Durdle died on 31 May aged 37. She had been first diagnosed with breast cancer about a year-and-a-half earlier. The disease had later spread to her lungs and brain. PayPal was informed of Mrs Durdle's death three weeks ago by her husband Howard Durdle. He provided the online payments service with copies of her death certificate, her will and his ID, as requested. PayPal had been informed of Lindsay Durdle's death He has now received a letter addressed in her name, sent to his home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire. It was headlined: ""Important: You should read this notice carefully."" It said that Mrs Durdle owed the company about Â£3,200 and went on to say: ""You are in breach of condition 15.4(c) of your agreement with PayPal Credit as we have received notice that you are deceased... this breach is not capable of remedy."" PayPal has told Mr Durdle that it is looking into this ""as a priority"", and has written off the debt in the meantime. ""We apologise to Mr Durdle for the distress this letter has caused,"" a spokesman added. ""We are urgently looking into this matter, and are in direct contact with Mr Durdle to support him."" PayPal sent this letter to Mrs Durdle Mr Durdle said a member of PayPal's staff had told him there were three possible explanations: a bug a bad letter template human error He added that he had been assured that whatever the cause, it would be addressed, although PayPal had told him it would not be able to share the information because it was an ""internal matter"". ""I'm in a reasonable place at the moment - I've got quite a level head on my shoulders - and am quite capable of dealing with paperwork like this,"" Mr Durdle said. ""But I'm a member of the charity Widowed and Young, and I've seen first-hand in there how a letter like this or something like it can completely derail somebody. ""If I'm going to make any fuss about this at all, it's to make sure that PayPal - or any other organisation that might do this kind of insensitive thing - recognises the damage they can cause the recently bereaved.""

Belgium-France: World Cup clash tests border loyalties,"Spirits are high ahead of Tuesday's semi-final but sometimes friendly rivalry can get out of hand For the two neighbours challenging for a place in the final of the World Cup, Tuesday's momentous match does more than cross borders. Sometimes the frontier between France to the south and Belgium to the north divides the towns themselves in half. Take the two sister towns of Comines, split in two by accident of history and by a river. Whether they supportLes Bleusor the Red Devils, the residents will apparently have to cheer their teams without the giant screen they have enjoyed during the rest of the competition, for security reasons. But the mood is still one of friendship, with flags of both nations appearing in the windows of cafes and houses. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The two nations are old footballing rivals, with 73 previous meetings since 1904, three of them in the World Cup. Belgium is a nation of three languages - French, Dutch and German - but Comines and Comines-Warneton are both French-speaking. So there should be no risk of misunderstandings there. Although sometimes you wonder. It may be a game of 90 minutes, but in French the word for 90 depends where you come from.Quatre-vingt-dixin France is widely termednonantein French-speaking areas of Belgium, as well as in Switzerland.

""This is an absolute must-win for francophone Belgians,"" Jean-Michel de Waele from UniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles told French newspaper JDD. Belgians, he believes, have an odd love-hate feeling of inferiority. ""The Dutch used to be our favourite historic enemy, then France became a footballing nation."" But what they really cannot bear is French condescension. Don't ever call them ""our Belgian friends"" and expect to get away with it. For most communities straddling the border, spirits are high ahead of Tuesday's semi-final in St Petersburg. Latest: France v Belgium Eight things to know about Wallonia How do Belgian footballers speak to each other? 'The team to beat' - are Belgium favourites? At another cafe in Comines, La Bascule, barman Bertrand Obert is happy to back both horses: ""What's good about this is that one team or the other will get into the final."" One French newspaper has billed the match as a duel between friends, summing it up as: ""Tintin v Asterix, Abd Al Malik against Stromae, wine versus beer."" And French sports newspaper L'Equipe channelled its inner HergÃ© with a front page imitation of the Tintin adventure Destination Moon, promising ""the derby of the century"". The mocked-up page shows French coach Didier Deschamps, striker Olivier Giroud and football federation chief NoÃ«l Le GraÃ«t heading in a car towards a rocket guarded by Belgian footballers Romelu Lukaku, Kevin De Bruyne and Thibaut Courtois.

The Belgian team is, of course, made up of Flemish and Walloon players, some of whom use English to communicate rather than their native Dutch or French. But then they also have players like Eden Hazard, who hails from the Belgian town of Braine-le Comte but moved to France aged 14 to play for Lille. Hazard is one of three footballing brothers, and there was delight on French social media when a picture was unearthed of the trio as children in France football strips. paying homage to World Cup-winning striker Zinedine Zidane. Thorgan Hazard, Eden's brother, is also in the Belgium team. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Justifying his childhood transgression, Eden Hazard said that they had grown up with the 1998 World Cup and at that time there were no Belgium shirts - it was all aboutLes Bleus. The French, on the other hand, have Benjamin Pavard, hero of the last-16 game against Argentina. He grew up in the French town of Jeumont, which nestles on the border with Belgium. Mayor Benjamin Saint-Huile sees the match as a real chance to offer a welcome hand across the border. ""I hope it'll be a great party and we'll mix with our neighbours, our friends, our Belgian brothers: it's an incredible opportunity to make our good-neighbourliness an everyday reality."" Thierry Henry's role in the Belgian coaching staff has upset some French commentators But there is a distinct frisson of rivalry. Belgium have ex-France World Cup winner Thierry Henry on the bench as assistant to coach Roberto MartÃ­nez. And there is clearly a sense of apprehension from his former 1998 team-mate, Didier Deschamps. ""It's a bit weird because he's French and he'll be on the opposite bench. I'm sure it'll be weird for him too. His playing experience will really help the Belgians,"" he said. The best attacker in French football history would be playing againstLes Bleus, complained Le Parisien website, while French TV journalist Gilles Verdez even said he should pull out of the match. France defender Lucas HernÃ¡ndez was more diplomatic: ""Of course he's working for the Belgians now, but I still reckon he'll be happy if we win - first and foremost, Henry's a Frenchman.""

"'Buy a trinket, condemn an elephant'","The open, legal sale of antique ivory in many European countries is covering up a trade in illegal and recently poached ivory, campaigners say. Researchers from environmental groupAvaaz,externalbought 100 ivory items and had them radiocarbon dated at Oxford University. Three quarters were modern ivory, being sold illegally as fake antiques. Ivory from an elephant killed by poachers as recently as 2010 was among the items passed off as being antique. ""It's sick,"" said Bert Wander from Avaaz, which organised the purchase of the items. ""I'm looking at the trinkets we bought on my desk, and to think that an elephant with all the things we are learning about them, about their cognition and their advanced societies, and to think that one of them has died for this bracelet I'm holding now, it makes you sick to your stomach."" The items were purchased from both antique dealers and private sellers in 10 countries across Europe. All the ivory pieces were advertised as originating from before 1947 or had no date information. The 1947 date is important because the EU classes ivory from before this date as antique and it can be traded without restriction. Fossil of 'first giant' discovered Krill companies cut Antarctic fishing Farage criticised over shark photo When the items were analysed by Oxford University's Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, more than 74% were found to be from after 1947. The tests are able to show when the ivory grew on a living elephant, not when the creature died. This means the ivory could have come from elephants killed decades after the date of the sample. Almost three quarters of the trinkets were illegal under EU rules The crude nature of many of the items is striking Of greater concern, though, was the fact that one in five were from elephants killed after the global ban on the ivory trade came into force in 1989. One piece purchased in Spain may have come from an elephant whose ivory was formed after 2010. All the pieces bought in Bulgaria, Italy and Spain were illegal, as were large majorities of the items in France, the Netherlands and Portugal. In the UK, one fifth of the pieces purchased by Avaaz were outside the law. ""These shocking results show that the supposed 'legal' ivory market is actually driving the mindless slaughter of elephants,"" said Catherine Bearder, a member of the European Parliament who authored that body's resolution in favour of a ban. ""It is time for all EU countries to introduce a full ivory ban with a limited number of exceptions for exceptional art works."" The EU says that last year it strengthened measures to fight poaching and end the trade in raw ivory. Tackling trafficking should be a priority for all enforcement agencies in member states, officials said. ""The Commission will continue to fight any kind of illegal trading, including the fraud of passing off recent ivory as antique,"" said EU spokesman Enrico Brivio. ""Addressing elephant poaching and ivory trafficking is a cornerstone of the EU action against wildlife trafficking and the EU has recently adopted numerous initiatives to this end."" European Union officials have claimed that there is no evidence that the legal ivory trade in the EU is helping to cover up a trade in illegal items - but this survey calls that into question. It will undoubtedly lead to calls for a complete ban. The EU legal market in ivory may consist mainly of small items, but they add up to several tonnes sold each year. Europe also remains a major exporter of legal, worked ivory to big Asian markets which is also encouraging poaching across Africa, according to experts. While the numbers of elephants being killed has dropped for the last five years, around 55 are still being killed every day. In many locations, the future of the elephant will not be sustainable if this keeps up. The EU has tried to curtail the trade in legal ivory being used as a cover for illegal sales by requiring all material acquired between 1947 and 1990 to be sold with a government issued certificate. But all a seller has to do is say that they believe the ivory comes from before 1947 and it's almost impossible to contradict them. Accurately determining the age of a piece of ivory is impossible without going to the expense of radiocarbon dating. Not many. Some of the leading markets have now banned any sales including Hong Kong, the world's biggest, which will phase out the legal trade over the next three years. China has also banned all trade except what it terms ""genuine antiques"". The US has effectively banned trade while the UK is in the process of adopting a near total ban on ivory sales, with exemptions for the trade in musical instruments and ivory sales to museums. One of the ivory trinkets purchased in Bulgaria The European Parliament has already called for a ban, and member states like the UK are leading the way with a comprehensive phase out of legal sales on the way to becoming law. The European Commission is currently reviewing whether or not EU restrictions on ivory go far enough. ""The EU consultation which closed in December 2017, collected almost 90,000 responses,"" said Eleonora Panella, from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw). ""We know that the vast majority was from people asking for stringent measures, this has for sure an impact of further decisions. We hope that a good decision will be taken soon, we were expecting something already this July, [it] now seems that it has been postponed. ""TheIllegal Wildlife Trade Conference,externalin London in October could be the perfect moment to show the leadership we are asking for."" If the sales of all ivory pieces is outlawed across the EU and the UK, many people will mixed feelings about the small tokens they're left with. ""We would support exemptions such as the ones proposed in the UK for family heirlooms and historical items,"" said Eleonora Panella. ""These should be allowed to be passed down to family members or donated to museums, but they cannot be bought, sold or traded for goods in kind."" People might also want to donate them to an elephant charity which could arrange for their destruction or use them in educational activities.

Tory vice chairs quit over Brexit,"This video can not be played Brexit: What just happened? Two vice-chairs of the Conservative Party are quitting their posts in protest at Theresa May's Chequers Brexit compromise plan. Maria Caulfield and Ben Bradley warned the PM her plan would not capitalise on the opportunities of Brexit. ""This policy will be bad for our country and bad for the party,"" Ms Caulfield said. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis have already quit over the proposals. Ahead of his first visit to the country as US President on Thursday, Donald Trump said the UK was ""somewhat in turmoil"" and it was ""up to the people"" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister. He also praised Mr Johnson, describing him as a ""good friend of mine"". Mrs May says theproposed new relationship,externalwith the EU will ""honour the result of the referendum"" and allow the UK to ""take back control of our borders, our law and our money"". Speaking at a press conference alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the prime minister said her plan would allow for a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"", protecting jobs and livelihoods. Trump talks of UK 'turmoil' ahead of trip Reaction to more Brexit resignations PM's new cabinet meets amid Brexit turmoil It would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to minimise friction for trade at borders. But some Tories are unhappy, saying it will leave the UK tied closely to EU rules and prevent it from striking its own trade deals in years to come. More details are expected on Thursday in a White Paper. Ms Caulfield, who was vice chairwoman for women, supported Leave in the EU referendum. Mr Bradley - who backed Remain - had a brief trying to appeal to young voters. The Conservatives have nine vice chairmen in total, appointed in January's reshuffle. In her resignation letter to Mrs May, Ms Caulfield - the MP for Lewes in Sussex - said the proposed new trading relationship with the EU did not ""fully embrace the opportunities that Brexit can provide"". Mr Bradley, who posted a positive message of support for Mrs May before Friday's Chequers meeting, said he could not now ""with any sincerity defend this course"" to voters in his Leave-backing constituency of Mansfield.

Amid continuing unrest on the Tory benches, Andrew Bridgen became the first Conservative MP to publicly confirm he had sent a letter calling for a vote of confidence in Mrs May. Under Conservative Party rules, it requires 15% of all Tory MPs - currently 48 - to write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee to trigger a vote of confidence in the leader.

Donald Trump had plenty to say ahead of his trip to Europe Ahead of his first visit to the country as US President, Donald Trump said the UK was ""somewhat in turmoil"" and ""it is up to the people"" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister. Mr Trump, who arrives in the UK on Thursday after attending the Nato summit in Brussels, told reporters before leaving Washington there were ""a lot of things going on"" in the UK at the moment. He said he got on well with Mrs May and had ""always liked"" Boris Johnson, who quit as foreign secretary on Monday, describing him as a ""friend of mine"". Mr Trump, who has called on other Nato members to pay more for their own defence, joked that his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday ""may be the easiest of all"". Mrs Merkel said she wanted the closest possible relationship with the UK after Brexit The prime minister has chaired the first meeting of her new-look cabinet, after the departures of Mr Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis The new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged all ministers to stand behind Mrs May in pursuit of an agreement with the EU based on the approach agreed at Chequers. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who has insisted any Brexit deal must guarantee there is no ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland, has suggested the Chequers agreement might represent a breakthrough. ""If the UK is able to relax some of its red lines, then the European Union should be flexible too,"" he told the Irish Parliament. ""I think perhaps we are now entering into that space."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking at a summit for the Western Balkans in London, said it was good that the UK had put proposals on the table and the EU would issue a ""common response"" in due course. ""We have made progress,"" she told reporters. And the EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said 80% of the detail of the UK's withdrawal had been settled and he was now prepared to start talking about a ""very ambitious"" trade agreement with the UK.

The 24-year-old guarding RAF jets,"Aged 16, Eve Babapo was a semi-professional boxer and MMA fighter and unsure what to do with his life. But on patrol on a boiling hot Romanian airfield, it's clear the 24-year-old from Liverpool knows he's now in exactly the right place. Eve, known as Baba to his friends, signed up as an RAF reservist - which means he uses his spare time to work and train alongside full-time troops. ""I'm the first of my family and friends to do it, they've seen a change in me."" Baba won the Royal Navy Northern Region vs RAF Scotland boxing competition in 2018 Baba's now a regiment gunner on deployment with the 135 Expeditionary Air Wing, and told Newsbeat about what life is like for him in the RAFon the 100th anniversary of its creation. The safety of the four RAF Typhoon jets stationed at Mihail KogÄlniceanu airbase in Romania is his responsibility. ""It means a lot of patrolling and making sure that there are only recognised staff around the aircraft,"" he explains. ""I'm also looking for debris, things that could damage them. If I find anything I report it."" The Typhoons are worth Â£70m each. They're the RAF's main defence against Russia, which is about 250 miles away across the Black Sea to the east of where Baba is stationed. Baba's job is to guard four RAF Typhoon jets The 135 Expeditionary Air Wing are involved in Operation Biloxi to help the Romanians and Americans stationed in Constanta protect European skies. It's all part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) - a military alliance between 29 countries. NATO claims the Russians fly into the airspace it patrols globally around 700 times a year. Signing up for the RAF wasn't easy for Baba though, partly, he says, because of its image. ""As a minority there was a big disconnect between the normal infantry and the people,"" he explains. ""So growing up my uncles and the family would be like, you know, being black, the Army's not a place for you. But I was like 'You can't say that about the Royal Air Force'."" About 8% of the armed forces are from black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) communities, while in the RAF it's just 2% - that's compared to 13% in the general UK population. The military generally wants to attract more BAME recruits, making it one of the main priorities for the future - and has set a target to reach a 10% intake by 2020. ""Growing up the older generation, the time was different for them and they probably think the armed forces is the same as it was when they were younger,"" Baba says. ""That's why I'm doing this to prove to people that things have changed and that everyone's more than welcome to join."" He's earned himself the nickname ""the recruiter"" because when he's back in Liverpool he's always trying to get his friends to join him and sign up. ""For me, I'm closing the gap between the RAF and my community. ""Where I live a lot of people know me and they're like 'Look at him, he's doing great, why don't you go and do what he's going?'"" As for boxing, Baba's still training hard and winning medals. He competed in the Lord Wakefield RAF Championships earlier this year which includes boxers from across all RAF stations over four days. Baba says he gets time to train while in the RAF ""I got to the final and I think I was only the first or maybe second reservist to do that,"" he says. When Baba returns to his squadron in the UK, he wants to sign up to the RAF full-time. ""It's changed my life for the better because growing up I wasn't the easiest child in the family,"" he laughs. ""Being here I've matured and I've done a lot of growing up just having the right people around me and the right support which has helped.""

Trump talks of UK 'turmoil' ahead of trip,"President Trump's visit comes at a difficult time for the prime minister The UK is in ""turmoil"" and ""it is up to the people"" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister, Donald Trump has said ahead of his first visit to the country as US President. Mr Trump told reporters before leaving Washington there were ""a lot of things going on"" in the UK at the moment. He said he got on well with Mrs May and had ""always liked"" Boris Johnson, who quit as foreign secretary on Monday. Mr Trump arrives on Thursday after attending the Nato summit. The US President is set to arrive in the UK on the same day as the government publishes its White Paper setting out in more detail Mrs May's controversial offer to the EU on future relations after Brexit. PM's new cabinet meets amid Brexit turmoil Live: Latest after Brexit resignations Who's who guide: Theresa May's cabinet Both Mr Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has also quit, have expressed fears it will tie the UK too closely to the EU and make it harder to do trade deals with countries like the US. The US president has previously expressed sympathy for Brexit and said he wanted to do a quick trade deal with the UK once it leaves the EU - which is due to take place on 29 March 2019. Asked about his forthcoming visit, Mr Trump referred to the turbulence of the past 48 hours, which has prompted speculation about Theresa May's future as leader. ""It is going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato,"" he told reporters on the lawn of the White House. ""We will work it out and all countries will be happy. ""So I have Nato, I have the UK - that's a situation with turmoil."" Mr Trump, who has called on other Nato members to pay more for their own defence, joked that his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday ""may be the easiest of all"". Asked about Mrs May's future, he said it was a matter for the British people. ""I get along with her very well. I have a very good relationship. That's certainly up to the people, not up to me."" Trump's plans for his UK visit revealed Trump told to appreciate European allies Trump visit to put 'pressure' on police As for Boris Johnson - seen by many as a potential future challenger to Mrs May - Mr Trump said he was a ""friend of mine"" and he hoped he might find time to speak to him during his visit. ""He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive. I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him."" The ex-foreign secretary, who warned in his resignation letter on Monday that the ""Brexit dream was dying"", has spoken of his ""increasing admiration"" for Mr Trump and speculated about what Brexit negotiations would be like if he was in charge. Asked about Mr Trump's comments, a No 10 spokesman said Theresa May was looking forward to his visit and was confident he would leave with a ""positive impression"". He said it benefited the UK that Mr Johnson got on well with the US President and the new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was looking forward to build his own links in Washington. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said there was an unwritten rule among world leaders that they don't comment on each other's internal politics - but Mr Trump does not follow such conventions. During his visit, Mr Trump will hold talks with Theresa May, who will also host a dinner for him at Blenheim Palace. He is also due to have tea with The Queen at Windsor Castle. New Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the UK will be a ""dependable ally"" Protests are expected against Mr Trump, whose policies - including a travel ban on a number of predominantly Muslim countries, the detention of child migrants on the US-Mexico border and the imposition of tariffs on EU steel and aluminium exports - have all been criticised by the UK. Mrs May has insisted the UK's strategic and historic links with the US mean hosting its US president is essential, although making clear where the UK disagrees with him. After being appointed foreign secretary on Monday, Jeremy Hunt said the UK would be a ""dependable ally, a country that stands up for the values that matter to the people of this country and will be a strong and confident voice in the world"". Mr Hunt urged all ministers to stand behind the prime minister in pursuit of an agreement with the EU based on the approach agreed at Chequers. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who has insisted any Brexit deal must guarantee there is no ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland, has suggested the Chequers agreement might represent a breakthrough. ""If the UK is able to relax some of its red lines, then the European Union should be flexible too,"" he told the Irish Parliament. ""I think perhaps we are now entering into that space."" And speaking on a trip to the United States, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said 80% of the withdrawal deal was agreed and he was now wanted to start negotiating a ""very ambitious"" free trade deal with the UK. The Nato summit in Brussels will be held against a backdrop of unprecedented recent tensions between Europe and the United States over trade and defence. Mr Trump has said the US is spending a disproportionate amount to ""protect"" Europe, amid reports that he might be considering reducing US troop numbers on the continent. The US President took to Twitter to berate European members of the transatlantic alliance, only a handful of which spend 2% of their GDP on defence in line with Nato targets. Allow Twitter content?

It's been a busy day, so here's a recap on the main developments.  Angela Merkel welcomes the UK's Chequers agreement, saying it is a ""good thing we have proposals on the table"". The German Chancellor says the remaining 27 EU members will agree a ""common response"" once it has seen the detail of the official UK position. But she says progress is being made and repeats her stance that her country wants as close links as possible with the UK after Brexit. Theresa May is asked about Donald Trump's claims that the UK is in turmoil, ahead of his visit on Thursday, and whether the US President is a real fan of Boris Johnson. The PM does not comment directly but says she is looking forward to Mr Trump's visit, saying there is ""much to discuss"". She says the special relationship with the US is the UK's deepest and longest security and defence alliance. The two leaders, she adds, will talking about how to use this to benefit the UK and US but also enhance the wider good.  But who do these shoes belong to? The answer: British Prime Minister Theresa May, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama and Montenegro's Prime Minister Dusko Markovic. Theresa May is now speaking at the conclusion of the Western Balkans summit in central London. She says claims that, as a result of Brexit, the UK will be ""retreating"" from its role as a guarantor of peace in the region and on the continent as a whole are completely wrong. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is now speaking. Brexit is almost certain to crop up during questions.  In his letter resigning as a Tory vice-chair, Remain voter Ben Bradley writes that he was persuaded to back the Brexit vision because of the ""immense opportunities that are available from global trade, and for the ability
for Britain to be an outward looking nation in control of our own destiny once
again"". But he complains: ""I fear that this agreement at Chequers damages those opportunities; that being tied to EU regulations, and the EU tying our hands when seeking to make new trade agreements, will be the worst of all worlds if we do not deliver Brexit in spirit as well as in name. ""Then we are handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10."" MPs have decisively rejected Liberal Democrat calls for a ""People's Vote"" on the final Brexit deal. A Commons motion put forward by Sir Vince Cable's party was defeated by 299 votes to 13 in Parliament. Aside from nine Lib Dem MPs, the other MPs to support it were Green Party leader Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's three MPs. Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein, a close friend of David Cameron, takes issue with some of the arguments made by Ben Bradley or Maria Caulfield in their resignation letters. In short, he seems to be saying the UK has a choice between the Chequers compromise or no deal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One of Maria Caulfield's main objections had been to the backstop agreement for Northern Ireland - that's the customs arrangement designed to avoid a ""hard border"" - which she felt was ""neither necessary or
constructive for the future prosperity of the UK"". ""The policy may assuage vested interests but the voters will find out and their
representatives will be found out,"" she wrote in her resignation letter as Conservative vice-chair. ""This policy will be bad for our country and
bad for the party. The direct consequences of that will be Prime Minister
Corbyn."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, speaking in New York, added that many models of co-operation with Brussels were available to the UK, including a ""Norway"" deal, ""Norway plus"" or an ""ambitious"" version of the Canada deal, and that each deal had ""its own balance of rights and negotiations"". However, he said the UK's current red lines meant they were ""closing the door"" to many different types of co-operation. Michel Barnier, who's leading Brexit negotiations on behalf of Brussels, has said there is accord on 80% of the UK withdrawal
agreement and that the European Union was ready to start working on an ""ambitious free trade arrangement"" with the UK. Speaking
in New York, Mr Barnier said that negotiators still needed to find a solution
to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. In
response to recent resignations in Westminster, Mr Barnier said he had a
""very cordial and frank relationship"" with David Davis and had met
""many people with different views"" during the course of the
negotiations. BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Ronaldo set to complete Juventus moveReal Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo is set to be confirmed as a Juventus player, possibly in a matter of hours.BBC SportComments","This video can not be played Cristiano Ronaldo's goals during the 2018 World Cup Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo has joined Juventus, becoming one of the four most expensive players of all time. A deal worth 112m euros (Â£99.2m) has been reached between the two clubs that has seen the Portuguese sign a four-year deal with the Italian champions. Ronaldo, 33, won four Champions League titles in his nine years at Real. ""The time has come to open a new stage in my life, that's why I asked the club to accept transferring me,""he said.,external The top two world record transfer fees have been paid out by Paris St-Germain - the Â£200m they paid Barcelona forBrazil forward Neymar last August,and the fee of around Â£166m for France forward Kylian Mbappe in July after a successful season on loan with PSG. Barcelona also paidLiverpool Â£142m for Brazil midfielder Philippe Coutinhoin January. For Juventus, the fee they will pay for Ronaldo is set to eclipse the Â£75.3m they paid for forward Gonzalo Higuain from Napoli in July 2016. Juventus are set to play Real Madrid in a pre-season International Champions Cup tournament in the United States, with the match taking place at FedEx Field in Washington on Saturday, 4 August. These years in Real Madrid, and in this city of Madrid, have been possibly the happiest of my life. I only have feelings of enormous gratitude for this club, for its fans and for this city. I can only thank all of them for the love and affection I have received. However, I believe that the time has come to open a new stage in my life and that is why I have asked the club to accept transferring me. I feel that way and I ask everyone, and especially our fans, to please understand me. They have been absolutely wonderful for nine years. They have been nine unique years. It has been an emotional time for me, full of consideration but also hard because Real Madrid is of the highest demands, but I know very well that I will never forget that I have enjoyed football here in a unique way. I have had fabulous team-mates on the field and in the dressing room, I have felt the warmth of an incredible crowd and together we have won three Championships in a row and four Championships in five years. And with them also, on an individual level, I have the satisfaction of having won four Gold Balls and three Gold Boots. All during my time in this immense and extraordinary club. Ronaldo's lowest return in a season at Real Madrid was 33 goals in 2009-10 Real Madrid has conquered my heart, and that of my family, and that is why more than ever I want to say thank you: thanks to the club, the President, the directors, my colleagues, all the technical staff, doctors, physios and incredible workers that make everything work, that tirelessly pursue every minute detail. Thank you infinitely once more to our fans and thanks also to Spanish Football. During these nine exciting years I have played against great players. My respect and my recognition for all of them. I have reflected a lot and I know that the time has come for a new cycle. I'm leaving but this shirt, this badge and the Santiago Bernabeu will continue to always feel part of me wherever I am. Thanks to all and, of course, as I said that first time in our stadium nine years ago: Go Madrid! Ronaldo joined Real from Manchester United for Â£80m in July 2009 and scored a club-record 450 goals and won the Ballon D'Or - awarded to the world's best footballer - in 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017. He has helped them win the Champions League in four of the past five seasons, scoring in the 2014 and 2017 finals. ""For Real Madrid Cristiano Ronaldo will always be one of the great symbols,"" said a club statement. ""Real Madrid wants to express its gratitude to a player who has proved to be the best in the world and who has marked one of the brightest times in the history of our club and world football. ""Real Madrid will always be your home."" Despite their dominance in Europe's premier club competition, Real struggled domestically, finishing 17 points behind champions Barcelona last season. Real are keen on reshaping their team under new manager Julen Lopetegui and the 33-time La Liga winners have also been linked with a move for Paris St-Germain's 26-year-old Brazil forward Neymar. However, it would be a controversial move as Neymar spent four years at Real's fierce rivals Barcelona before joining PSG in his world record transfer of Â£200m last summer. Real have also been linked with a move for another PSG forward, Mbappe, the 19-year-old who has helped France reach the semi-finals of the World Cup. Italian football expert James Horncastle told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Real would be reluctant to lose Ronaldo without a replacement in hand. They have been linked with Neymar, who joined PSG for a world record fee last season, and their flirting with the Brazilian appears to have put Ronaldo's nose out of joint at Madrid. ""We don't know who is being lined up, be it Kylian Mbappe, Eden Hazard or Harry Kane."" James Horncastle, Italian football expert on BBC Radio 5 live Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in Real Madrid's 4-1 win over Juventus in the 2017 Champions League final in Cardiff Juventus were made aware a few weeks ago that Ronaldo might be available on favourable terms. Ronaldo had a buyout clause worth $1bn (Â£886m) and Juventus were told Real Madrid were willing to accept Â£100m and Juventus were willing to pursue that even though it would mean restructuring their wage system. We heard Juventus president, Andrea Agnelli, boarded a plane and then got a helicopter to see Ronaldo on holiday in Greece. They are calling it the deal of the century in Italy. Juventus have reached the Champions League final twice in the last four years and lost both. One of those defeats was to Ronaldo's Real Madrid. He scored in the final in Cardiff and he knocked them out in the quarters this year. They believe he is the difference and the player who could achieve the Champions League with Juventus for the first time in 23 years. Winning the trophy has been an obsession for them. This is much more than about football it's about them going to the next level as a business. When Deloitte ranked the 10 richest clubs in the world earlier this year, Juventus were only 10th. They believe by being able to leverage and monetising some of his followers on social media and his commercial deals, will help them close the gap financially on Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United. The Italians are confident there could be an announcement this evening, although the finer details of the deal would take a few more days. Juventus' share prices on the stock exchange sky-rocketed by 33%. 450 - Ronaldo's Real Madrid-record goal tally, in 438 games. 17 - his record goal tally for a Champions League season, in 2013-14. 105 - total Champions League goals for the club, which also included 16 in 2015-16 and 15 in the most recent campaign. 311 - goals in La Liga. 16 - major trophies with the club, including two La Ligas and four Champions Leagues, three Club World Cups and three European Super Cups. 44 - hat-tricks for Madrid including a club-record 34 in La Liga. 8 - the number of times he scored four or more goals in a Real match. That included five-goal league hauls against Granada in 2014-15 and Espanyol the following season. 61 - his most prolific season for Real came in 2014-15 with 61 goals in all competitions, including 48 in the league. 659 - career goals, including five for Sporting Lisbon, 118 for Manchester United, 451 for Real Madrid and 85 for Portugal.

Ex-foreign secretary Lord Carrington dies,"Lord Carrington with then Prime Minister Thatcher in 1980 Former UK Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington, who was the last surviving member of Churchill's 1950s government, has died aged 99. The Conservative politician was also a former defence secretary. He resigned as foreign secretary in 1982 after the Falkland Islands were invaded by Argentine forces. Prime Minister Theresa May paid tribute to a ""statesman who was respected globally for his remarkable lifetime of public service"". Obituary: Lord Carrington The hereditary peer took his seat in the Lords in 1945 after serving in World War Two, where he gained a Military Cross, joining Churchill's government in 1951. He was agriculture minister under Churchill and later went on to become foreign secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government. After he resigned, taking responsibility for the failure to predict the Argentine invasion, Mrs Thatcher described his resignation as a ""devastating blow for Britain"". This video can not be played Lord Carrington on changes in political communication Lord Carrington was the last member of the House of Lords to hold one of the four great offices of state, and went on to become the longest-serving member of the Upper House, criticising its size in a BBC interview two years ago. Other roles he held during his career included secretary general of Nato, high commissioner to Australia, leader of the Lords and chairman of the Conservative Party. Lord Carrington as secretary general of Nato in 1984 ...and after being appointed high commissioner to Australia in 1956 And arriving for Margaret Thatcher's first cabinet meeting after her 1979 election victory Former Prime Minister David Cameron was among the politicians paying tribute, describing him as a ""lovely man and a great public servant"". Another ex-PM, Sir John Major, said he felt ""immensely privileged"" to have known Lord Carrington. ""He never fell beneath the dignity of his office, yet leavened public life with an irreverent wit that delighted all who worked with him,"" Sir John said. ""The country has lost one of its greatest post-war statesmen. I not only feel proud to have known him, I feel immensely privileged."" Mrs May added: ""There can be few people who have served our country for as long, and with such dedication, as Lord Carrington did - from his gallantry as a tank commander in the Second World War, for which he was awarded the Military Cross, to his service in government under two monarchs and six prime ministers, dating back to Winston Churchill."" Former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine said his late colleague and friend was a ""great patriot"" who represented the ""essence of One Nation Conservatism"". ""Frankly, he is one of the greats,"" he told the BBC. He paid tribute to his integrity in taking personal responsibility for the failure to anticipate the Falklands invasion. ""Peter Carrington carried the can and resigned. I think history will show it was not quite as simple as that. But this was a man who know what he believed to be right."" Members of the House of Lords - where he spent over 70 years - paid their own tributes as the day's sitting got under way. Lords Leader Baroness Evans said he his contribution to public life was ""unsurpassed in modern times"", and Labour's Baroness Smith said he had a ""truly remarkable life and career"". Crossbencher Lord Luce recalled his decision to resign over the Falklands invasion, adding that ""his only concern was to put his country before himself"".

Dozens of RAF aircraft rehearse,"Dozens of military aircraft have been taking part in final rehearsals ahead of a flypast over London Dozens of military aircraft have been taking part in final rehearsals ahead of a flypast over London to mark the RAF's centenary.

PM's new cabinet meets amid Brexit turmoil,"Theresa May tweeted a picture of the cabinet, saying it had been a ""productive"" meeting Theresa May's new-look cabinet has met for the first time after a string of resignations over her Brexit strategy left her government in crisis. Mrs May was forced to carry out a reshuffle of her top team after Boris Johnson and David Davis both quit. The prime minister has warned the Tory party it must unite or face the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn in power. Jeremy Hunt, who has replaced Mr Johnson as foreign secretary, said he would be ""four square"" behind her. After the cabinet meeting, Mrs May tweeted that she was ""looking ahead to a busy week"". US President Donald Trump, who arrives in the country for a visit on Thursday, said the UK was in ""turmoil"" and ""it is up to the people"" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister. Live updates: Brexit resignations reaction Laura Kuenssberg: Could it be opportunity for PM? Katya Adler: The view from Brussels on UK turmoil Trump talks of UK turmoil ahead of visit The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU after that. The delay has been partly blamed on deep disagreements within the Conservative Party over what shape Brexit should take. Essentially the arguments are about how much the UK should prioritise business interests by compromising on post-referendum promises to end free movement of people, remove the UK from the remit of the European Court of Justice, and also have an independent trade policy which allows the UK to set its own trade rules and strike its own trade deals. Last Friday at the prime minister's country retreat at Chequers Mrs May brokered a ""collective"" agreement on proposals for the future relationship between the EU and UK. However, Mr Johnson - whose departure on Monday followed that of Brexit Secretary David Davis and several junior figures - accused Mrs May of pursuing a ""semi-Brexit"". In his resignation letter, he said the Brexit ""dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"". This video can not be played David Davis explains why he resigned Mr Davis, who has been leading Brexit negotiations for the UK so far, said he did not agree with the prime minister's proposals, so was the wrong person to be going into negotiations with them. He said that the UK was ""giving away too much, too easily"" ahead of negotiations with the European Union. Several junior government figures also quit, including Brexit minister Steve Baker who told the BBC's Daily Politics they had been ""blindsided"" by the No 10 plan that emerged at Chequers. Asked on Tuesday morning whether he too had considered resigning, another prominent Brexiteer, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, replied ""absolutely not"" and declared himself ""100%"" behind Mrs May's Brexit plan. On Monday evening, the prime minister faced down backbench critics at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, amid rumours they were close to getting the 48 signatures needed to trigger a no-confidence vote that could spark a leadership election. She told her critics the alternative to the party coming together could be a left-wing Labour administration, with Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said that while Brexiteers were still unhappy with the Chequers plan, their focus was on getting that changed, not on ousting Mrs May. ""There is a genuine weariness and horror at the thought of more disruption, turmoil and a possible leadership contest,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Above all, I just don't think one should underestimate Mrs May's sheer durability - you look around her cabinet table and there are bodies littered all over the placeâ¦ and she is still there. ""Yes, her position is extraordinarily fragile and vulnerable, but it is far from game over."" Former Conservative leader Lord Howard called for a ""degree of humility all around"". He told the Today programme: ""I do think it would be extremely foolish and extremely ill-advised for anyone to send in letters to mount a motion of no confidence in the prime minister and I am delighted that good sense seems to be breaking out."" Under Conservative Party rules, a leadership contest is triggered either if the leader resigns or if 15% of all Tory MPs (currently 48) write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, triggering a vote of no confidence by MPs If Mrs May lost such a vote, a leadership election would be triggered and she would be unable to stand as a candidate But if she won, she would be immune from motions of confidence for a year To enter the contest, a candidate needs to be nominated by 15% of MPs MPs then vote in successive ballots - with the candidate with the lowest number of votes eliminated in each round - until two candidates remain Finally, Tory members vote for which candidate they want (unless there's just one, in which case they become leader) The UK's negotiations with the EU will now be fronted by Dominic Raab, a staunch Leave supporter who has been promoted from the job of housing minister. Mr Hunt, who has been health secretary for the past six years, was a Remain campaigner in the 2016 EU referendum. He has since said he is a convert to the Brexit cause. But his appointment means the four great offices of state - prime minister, chancellor, foreign secretary, and home secretary - are all held by ministers who voted to stay in the EU. Jeremy Hunt replaces Boris Johnson as foreign secretary Dominic Raab has been made Brexit secretary Boris Johnson's resignation letter and May's reply in full Who's who guide: Theresa May's cabinet In his first comments as foreign secretary, Mr Hunt said he would be standing ""four square"" behind the prime minister ""so that we can get through an agreement with the European Union based on what was agreed by the cabinet last week at Chequers"". Matt Hancock is the new health secretary, with Attorney General Jeremy Wright replacing him as the culture secretary, and backbencher Geoffrey Cox becoming the new attorney general. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson and Mr Davis had abandoned a ""sinking ship"", shattering the ""illusion of unity"" initially surrounding the Chequers plan. The UK and the EU have been negotiating Brexit terms for more than a year now and have been hoping to agree broad aims for their future relationship in October. The aim of the Chequers away day had been to agree the UK position - after two years of discussion - but the resignations have put a question mark over that. Allow Twitter content?

The uncertainty in the UK comes before the plan is officially put to the EU, who may well be unhappy with aspects of it they have previously referred to as ""cherry picking"". One other element of Friday's agreement worth noting is that it pledged to speed up preparations for the UK to be ready to leave the EU without a Brexit deal in March next year. Labour MP and Remainer Chuka Umunna told Today that all the drama of Monday needed to be put to one side, saying: ""This has gone from a soap opera to a comedy, and it would be funny were it not for the fact that the subject matter is going to have a fundamental impact on hundreds of thousands of people's jobs.""

Trump told to appreciate European allies,"This video can not be played In 2018, Donald Trump told Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg that Germany is ""totally controlled by Russia"" US President Donald Trump has clashed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over Russian influence and defence spending, ahead of a Nato summit. Mr Trump said Germany was ""totally controlled by Russia"" because of the high level of natural gas it imported, and this was a ""bad thing for Nato"". Mrs Merkel hit back, comparing German independence now with the time when she grew up in the former East Germany. She also defended her country's contribution to the Western alliance. The last summit both leaders attended ended in acrimony in a row over trade. Mr Trump later made more conciliatory remarks after he and Mrs Merkel had met on the sidelines of the summit in Brussels on Wednesday. The summit comes less than a week beforeMr Trump is due to hold his first summit with Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki, reviving concerns among US allies over his proximity to the Russian president. Reality Check: How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? Can Nato survive Donald Trump? What does the US contribute to Nato? President Trump shocked some by quipping that the Nato summit might prove harder than next Monday's summit with Mr Putin. He has said the US is being ""taken advantage of"" by other members of the Nato alliance, which was set up in 1949 to counter the Soviet Union, of which Russia is the main successor state. European Council President Donald Tusk accused him of criticising Europe ""almost daily"", tweeting: ""Dear America, appreciate your allies, after all you don't have that many."" Germany has the EU's biggest economy and has long been accused by US administrations of failing to contribute its fair share to Nato operations but Mr Trump's comments were particularly stinging. At a breakfast meeting in Brussels with Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg, the US leader said: ""Germany is totally controlled by Russia because they will be getting from 60% to 70% of their energy from Russia, and a new pipeline, and you tell me if that's appropriate because I think it's not and I think it's a very bad thing for Nato."" EU figures suggestRussia is responsible for between 50% and 75% of Germany's gas imports,external, butgas makes up less than 20% of Germany's energy mix for power production. Germany has given political support for a new Baltic Sea pipeline, Nord Stream 2, which will increase the flow of Russian gas to EU states. The project has been sharply criticised by Poland and others. The US president also accused Germany of only spending ""a little bit over 1%"" of its economic output on defence compared to the 4.2% spent by the US ""in actual numbers"". Germany spends 1.24% of GDP on defence and the US 3.5%,external, according to the latest Nato estimate. ""I want to say that I have experience of when a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union,"" she told reporters. ""I am very happy that today we are united in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of that we can say that we can make our independent policies and make independent decisions. ""That is very good, especially for people in eastern Germany."" Mrs Merkel (centre) led efforts to negotiate with Mr Trump over trade at last month's G7 summit in Canada What's happening in this G7 picture? US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU She added that Germany had put a huge proportion of its troops at Nato's disposal. ""We are still very heavily involved in Afghanistan and thus we also defend the interests of the United States of America... and Germany was pleased to do it and did it out of conviction,"" she said. At the G7 summit in Canada last month, the German chancellor led efforts to reach agreement with Mr Trump on trade butthe American leader rejected the G7 summit joint communique after he left. Mr Stoltenberg sought to play down Mr Trump's accusations, saying he expected Nato leaders would agree they were ""stronger together than apart"". He also tried to separate arguments about trade - not a primary Nato concern - from discussions about military matters. ""There are disagreements on trade. This is serious. My task is to try to minimise the negative impact on Nato,"" Mr Stoltenberg told a forum on the sidelines of the summit. Mr Trump told reporters that military spending and a planned gas pipeline from Russia to Germany had been discussed. ""We have a very, very good relationship with the chancellor. We have a tremendous relationship with Germany,"" he said. Mrs Merkel said she had discussed migration and trade with Mr Trump, and that she looked forward to further discussions as the US and Germany remained partners. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent In describing Germany as being ""totally controlled by Russia"" and linking this to what the US sees as Berlin's unsatisfactory defence budget, President Trump is underscoring two longstanding US concerns. US leaders have long warned of what they see as Europe's uncomfortable dependence upon Russian energy supplies. And they have also been arguing for more than a decade that the Europeans should spend more on defence. Mr Trump has given these twin themes a new and more abrasive tone. While he may well be overstating Germany's dependence upon Russian energy, even many European leaders are well aware of the potential influence that this could give Moscow. It's an area where short-term economic and longer-term security considerations are at variance. No wonder then that when the US sanctions Russia for its behaviour in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea it included steps to hamper anyone who helped build or support new Russian pipelines westwards. German troops in Lithuania this summer Mr Trump's main objection is that all but a handful of member states have still not increased their defence budgets to meet a goal of spending at least 2% of their annual economic output on defence by 2024.

Of Nato's 29 members, just five meet that target this year: the US, Greece, Estonia, the UK and Latvia. However, several, such as Poland and France, are close to the mark. Some in Nato fear Mr Trump's repeated blunt demands could harm morale, furthering the agenda of President Putin, whom they accuse of seeking to destabilise the West.

Who are the Thai boys who were trapped in a cave?,"The 12 boys were all rescued and taken to hospital On 23 June, 12 boys and their football coach walked into a cave after football practice in northern Thailand.

Trump talks of UK turmoil ahead of visit,"President Trump's visit comes at a difficult time for the prime minister The UK is in ""turmoil"" and ""it is up to the people"" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister, Donald Trump has said ahead of his first visit to the country as US President. Mr Trump told reporters before leaving Washington there were ""a lot of things going on"" in the UK at the moment. He said he got on well with Mrs May and had ""always liked"" Boris Johnson, who quit as foreign secretary on Monday. Mr Trump arrives on Thursday after attending the Nato summit. The US President is set to arrive in the UK on the same day as the government publishes its White Paper setting out in more detail Mrs May's controversial offer to the EU on future relations after Brexit. PM's new cabinet meets amid Brexit turmoil Live: Latest after Brexit resignations Who's who guide: Theresa May's cabinet Both Mr Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has also quit, have expressed fears it will tie the UK too closely to the EU and make it harder to do trade deals with countries like the US. The US president has previously expressed sympathy for Brexit and said he wanted to do a quick trade deal with the UK once it leaves the EU - which is due to take place on 29 March 2019. Asked about his forthcoming visit, Mr Trump referred to the turbulence of the past 48 hours, which has prompted speculation about Theresa May's future as leader. ""It is going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato,"" he told reporters on the lawn of the White House. ""We will work it out and all countries will be happy. ""So I have Nato, I have the UK - that's a situation with turmoil."" Mr Trump, who has called on other Nato members to pay more for their own defence, joked that his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday ""may be the easiest of all"". Asked about Mrs May's future, he said it was a matter for the British people. ""I get along with her very well. I have a very good relationship. That's certainly up to the people, not up to me."" Trump's plans for his UK visit revealed Trump told to appreciate European allies Trump visit to put 'pressure' on police As for Boris Johnson - seen by many as a potential future challenger to Mrs May - Mr Trump said he was a ""friend of mine"" and he hoped he might find time to speak to him during his visit. ""He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive. I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him."" The ex-foreign secretary, who warned in his resignation letter on Monday that the ""Brexit dream was dying"", has spoken of his ""increasing admiration"" for Mr Trump and speculated about what Brexit negotiations would be like if he was in charge. Asked about Mr Trump's comments, a No 10 spokesman said Theresa May was looking forward to his visit and was confident he would leave with a ""positive impression"". He said it benefited the UK that Mr Johnson got on well with the US President and the new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was looking forward to build his own links in Washington. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said there was an unwritten rule among world leaders that they don't comment on each other's internal politics - but Mr Trump does not follow such conventions. During his visit, Mr Trump will hold talks with Theresa May, who will also host a dinner for him at Blenheim Palace. He is also due to have tea with The Queen at Windsor Castle. New Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the UK will be a ""dependable ally"" Protests are expected against Mr Trump, whose policies - including a travel ban on a number of predominantly Muslim countries, the detention of child migrants on the US-Mexico border and the imposition of tariffs on EU steel and aluminium exports - have all been criticised by the UK. Mrs May has insisted the UK's strategic and historic links with the US mean hosting its US president is essential, although making clear where the UK disagrees with him. After being appointed foreign secretary on Monday, Jeremy Hunt said the UK would be a ""dependable ally, a country that stands up for the values that matter to the people of this country and will be a strong and confident voice in the world"". Mr Hunt urged all ministers to stand behind the prime minister in pursuit of an agreement with the EU based on the approach agreed at Chequers. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who has insisted any Brexit deal must guarantee there is no ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland, has suggested the Chequers agreement might represent a breakthrough. ""If the UK is able to relax some of its red lines, then the European Union should be flexible too,"" he told the Irish Parliament. ""I think perhaps we are now entering into that space."" And speaking on a trip to the United States, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said 80% of the withdrawal deal was agreed and he was now wanted to start negotiating a ""very ambitious"" free trade deal with the UK. The Nato summit in Brussels will be held against a backdrop of unprecedented recent tensions between Europe and the United States over trade and defence. Mr Trump has said the US is spending a disproportionate amount to ""protect"" Europe, amid reports that he might be considering reducing US troop numbers on the continent. The US President took to Twitter to berate European members of the transatlantic alliance, only a handful of which spend 2% of their GDP on defence in line with Nato targets. Allow Twitter content?

PM's new cabinet meets amid Brexit turmoilTheresa May warns her party it must unite after a string of resignations over Brexit forced a reshuffle.UK PoliticsComments,"Theresa May tweeted a picture of the cabinet, saying it had been a ""productive"" meeting Theresa May's new-look cabinet has met for the first time after a string of resignations over her Brexit strategy left her government in crisis. Mrs May was forced to carry out a reshuffle of her top team after Boris Johnson and David Davis both quit. The prime minister has warned the Tory party it must unite or face the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn in power. Jeremy Hunt, who has replaced Mr Johnson as foreign secretary, said he would be ""four square"" behind her. After the cabinet meeting, Mrs May tweeted that she was ""looking ahead to a busy week"". US President Donald Trump, who arrives in the country for a visit on Thursday, said the UK was in ""turmoil"" and ""it is up to the people"" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister. Live updates: Brexit resignations reaction Laura Kuenssberg: Could it be opportunity for PM? Katya Adler: The view from Brussels on UK turmoil Trump talks of UK turmoil ahead of visit The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU after that. The delay has been partly blamed on deep disagreements within the Conservative Party over what shape Brexit should take. Essentially the arguments are about how much the UK should prioritise business interests by compromising on post-referendum promises to end free movement of people, remove the UK from the remit of the European Court of Justice, and also have an independent trade policy which allows the UK to set its own trade rules and strike its own trade deals. Last Friday at the prime minister's country retreat at Chequers Mrs May brokered a ""collective"" agreement on proposals for the future relationship between the EU and UK. However, Mr Johnson - whose departure on Monday followed that of Brexit Secretary David Davis and several junior figures - accused Mrs May of pursuing a ""semi-Brexit"". In his resignation letter, he said the Brexit ""dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"". This video can not be played David Davis explains why he resigned Mr Davis, who has been leading Brexit negotiations for the UK so far, said he did not agree with the prime minister's proposals, so was the wrong person to be going into negotiations with them. He said that the UK was ""giving away too much, too easily"" ahead of negotiations with the European Union. Several junior government figures also quit, including Brexit minister Steve Baker who told the BBC's Daily Politics they had been ""blindsided"" by the No 10 plan that emerged at Chequers. Asked on Tuesday morning whether he too had considered resigning, another prominent Brexiteer, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, replied ""absolutely not"" and declared himself ""100%"" behind Mrs May's Brexit plan. On Monday evening, the prime minister faced down backbench critics at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, amid rumours they were close to getting the 48 signatures needed to trigger a no-confidence vote that could spark a leadership election. She told her critics the alternative to the party coming together could be a left-wing Labour administration, with Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said that while Brexiteers were still unhappy with the Chequers plan, their focus was on getting that changed, not on ousting Mrs May. ""There is a genuine weariness and horror at the thought of more disruption, turmoil and a possible leadership contest,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Above all, I just don't think one should underestimate Mrs May's sheer durability - you look around her cabinet table and there are bodies littered all over the placeâ¦ and she is still there. ""Yes, her position is extraordinarily fragile and vulnerable, but it is far from game over."" Former Conservative leader Lord Howard called for a ""degree of humility all around"". He told the Today programme: ""I do think it would be extremely foolish and extremely ill-advised for anyone to send in letters to mount a motion of no confidence in the prime minister and I am delighted that good sense seems to be breaking out."" Under Conservative Party rules, a leadership contest is triggered either if the leader resigns or if 15% of all Tory MPs (currently 48) write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, triggering a vote of no confidence by MPs If Mrs May lost such a vote, a leadership election would be triggered and she would be unable to stand as a candidate But if she won, she would be immune from motions of confidence for a year To enter the contest, a candidate needs to be nominated by 15% of MPs MPs then vote in successive ballots - with the candidate with the lowest number of votes eliminated in each round - until two candidates remain Finally, Tory members vote for which candidate they want (unless there's just one, in which case they become leader) The UK's negotiations with the EU will now be fronted by Dominic Raab, a staunch Leave supporter who has been promoted from the job of housing minister. Mr Hunt, who has been health secretary for the past six years, was a Remain campaigner in the 2016 EU referendum. He has since said he is a convert to the Brexit cause. But his appointment means the four great offices of state - prime minister, chancellor, foreign secretary, and home secretary - are all held by ministers who voted to stay in the EU. Jeremy Hunt replaces Boris Johnson as foreign secretary Dominic Raab has been made Brexit secretary Boris Johnson's resignation letter and May's reply in full Who's who guide: Theresa May's cabinet In his first comments as foreign secretary, Mr Hunt said he would be standing ""four square"" behind the prime minister ""so that we can get through an agreement with the European Union based on what was agreed by the cabinet last week at Chequers"". Matt Hancock is the new health secretary, with Attorney General Jeremy Wright replacing him as the culture secretary, and backbencher Geoffrey Cox becoming the new attorney general. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson and Mr Davis had abandoned a ""sinking ship"", shattering the ""illusion of unity"" initially surrounding the Chequers plan. The UK and the EU have been negotiating Brexit terms for more than a year now and have been hoping to agree broad aims for their future relationship in October. The aim of the Chequers away day had been to agree the UK position - after two years of discussion - but the resignations have put a question mark over that. Allow Twitter content?

The uncertainty in the UK comes before the plan is officially put to the EU, who may well be unhappy with aspects of it they have previously referred to as ""cherry picking"". One other element of Friday's agreement worth noting is that it pledged to speed up preparations for the UK to be ready to leave the EU without a Brexit deal in March next year. Labour MP and Remainer Chuka Umunna told Today that all the drama of Monday needed to be put to one side, saying: ""This has gone from a soap opera to a comedy, and it would be funny were it not for the fact that the subject matter is going to have a fundamental impact on hundreds of thousands of people's jobs.""

"Thai cave rescue ends with all 13 outDivers in Thailand rescue all 13 people trapped in a flooded cave, 17 days after they got trapped.Asia","The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June Divers in northern Thailand have rescued all 12 boys and their football coach from flooded caves, 17 days after they got trapped underground. Their plight and the massive, dangerous three-day-long operation to free them gripped the world's attention. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded their way back out. They were found by British divers last week, huddled in darkness on a ledge amid fears they could be forced to stay there for months until water receded. There were cheers as a daring rescue operation involving dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers came to an end on Tuesday evening. Cave rescue as it happened Rescue story in pictures Who are the Thai boys? Who are the Thailand cave rescue divers? In an indication of how dangerous the journey out was,a former Thai navy diver diedin the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen.

Confirming the completion of the rescue operation, theThai Navy Seals Facebook page,externalannounced: ""All 12 Wild Boars and coach have been extracted from the cave. All are safe."" And at the house just below the mountains where the men who run the Wild Boars meet, there was laughter, shouts and cheers - and people shook hands in a very un-Thai way, says the BBC Jonathan Head. By Nick Beake, at Chiang Rai hospital This is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission Accomplished. Families in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldn't believe it, others said they had never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles. Up on the eighth floor, doctors - who declared this morning that the first eight boys to be rescued are doing well - will now be examining their remaining team mates and their coach. Psychologists will be assessing the impact a fortnight trapped underground has had. The Wild Boars footballers went into the Tham Luang cave as a team. They survived as a team. And tonight, at the end of a remarkable 72-hour rescue, they are together as a team once again. The first eight boys to be rescued - on Sunday and Monday - are still in hospital but said to be in good mental and physical health. They have undergone X-rays and blood tests, and will remain under observation in hospital for at least seven days.

Drinking contaminated water in the cave or being exposed to bird or bat droppings in the cave could lead to dangerous infections, experts say. Football offers support to boys The boys lost weight during their time in the caves and are keen to eat. They are said to have requested a favourite pork dish, bread and chocolate, but solid food will have to be reintroduced slowly to prevent digestive upset. They will also need to wear sunglasses for a few days until their eyes readjust to the brighter light. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Offers of hospitality for the football team have come in from around the world: Global football body Fifa offered the 12 young footballers tickets for Sunday's World Cup final in Moscow, but they are too weak to travel. Portuguese club Benfica has invited the boys and their coach an all-expenses-paid week at its training academy. Manchester United - the English club several of the boys support - has offered them the chance to attend a game. England players including Manchester City defender Kyle Walker are sending football kit to the boys after one of them was pictured wearing an England shirt inside the caves. A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - worked in the Tham Luang caves. They guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the cave system. Getting to and from the trapped group was an exhausting round trip, even for experienced divers. The process included a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes. How risky was the rescue? Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy was accompanied by two divers, who also carried his air supply. The toughest part was about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which was so tight that the divers had to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - was turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys could rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They were then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. This video can not be played Wife and father remember 'hero' Thai diver: ""He loved helping others"" The last of the rescue team - three Thai Navy Seals and a doctor - emerged from the cave complex some hours after the last member of the trapped group was released. CaptainDuganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-bornAdul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal.

Who are the boys who were trapped?,"The 12 boys were all rescued and taken to hospital On 23 June, 12 boys and their football coach walked into a cave after football practice in northern Thailand. The boys, who are part of the Moo Pa - or Wild Boars - football team, became trapped when heavy rains flooded the Tham Luang cave and cut off their escape route. All 12 boys and their coach have been freed from the cave. Few details about the group have been released. Here is what we know about the boys and their coach: Chanin Vibulrungruang (Nickname: Titan), 11 The youngest in the team, who played as a forward. Titan started playing football at age seven before joining his school's sports club. He was later invited to join the Wild Boars football club. Panumas Sangdee (Nickname: Mig), 13 According to Nopparat Kantawong, the head coach of the football team, Mig is bigger than other kids his age, but he is agile. He is a defender for the Wild Boars. Duganpet Promtep (Nickname: Dom), 13 Striker, and captain of the Wild Boars, Dom has reportedly been scouted by several professional clubs in Thailand. He is said to be a motivator and respected by his team for his football skills. ""Players on the field need a captain like this because sometimes the coach can't get in to solve their problems,"" Nopparat told the BBC. How risky is the Thai boys rescue? The cave rescue as it happened The Brits who helped find the boys Adul Sam-on, 14 Adul was born in Myanmar's self-governing Wa State and left his family behind to get a better education in Thailand, according to reports. The left defender speaks Thai, Burmese, Chinese and English, and was the only one able to communicate with the British divers when the group was first discovered. Boys and parents send letters of love While trapped in the cave, the boys and their relatives exchanged letters, carried by the rescue divers. Adul told his parents he missed them and not to worry. ""Mum and Dad want to see your face,"" his parents wrote. ""Mum and Dad pray for you and your friends, so we can see each other soon."" Adul is also a talented volleyball player - and part of a local team that came second in all of northern Thailand two years in a row, local teacher Bunjob Chai-arm told the BBC. Somepong Jaiwong (Nickname: Pong), 13 ""Pong is a cheerful boy, he likes football, and every sport. He dreams of becoming a footballer for the Thai national team,"" his teacher Manutsanun Kuntun told AFP. The left winger wrote to his parents from inside the cave, saying: ""I love Dad and Mum. Don't worry about me, I'm safe."" His parents replied: ""Take good care of yourself and be strong - Dad, Mum and everyone are waiting for you."" Mongkol Booneiam (Nickname: Mark), 12 or 13 Mark has been described by his teacher as a ""very respectful"" boy. ""He's cheerful, energetic, very friendly, and likes football and volleyball,"" Bunjob Chai-arm told the BBC. Mark and his mother had moved to Thailand from Myanmar, he added. He plays in the same volleyball team as Adul. His father Thinnakorn Boonpiem told AFP that his son is a ""good boy"" who loves to study - almost as much as football. Nattawut Takamrong (Nickname: Tern), 14 In a letter to his parents, Tern told them not to worry about him. The defender wrote that he missed his parents and grandparents, but ""Tern can take care of myself"". ""Dad and mum are not angry at you and do not blame you,"" his parents replied, adding that they were waiting for him ""in front of the cave."" Peerapat Sompiangjai (Nickname: Night), 17 Night plays as right winger on the team. He went missing on his birthday and his parents say they are still waiting to hold his party. According to reports, the boys went into the cave to celebrate Night's birthday. They were said to have brought treats and snacks along with them. These supplies probably helped sustain the group in the many days spent trapped inside the cave. Sittthisak Sawanrak, who goes to the same cycling club as Night, describes him as ""a great lad who just loves to cycle and play football"". ""He's a quiet boy - doesn't talk much, but a very good, polite boy,"" he told the BBC. In a letter to his parents from the cave, Night wrote: ""Night loves everyone"" and drew several hearts. Ekarat Wongsukchan (Nickname: Bew), 14 Bew is the goalkeeper of the team. In a letter to his mother, Bew promised to help her sell things at her shop once he was rescued. Prajak Sutham (Nickname: Note), 15 Note has been described by family friends as a ""smart, quiet guy who loves sport and supports Chiang Rai United"". Family friend Ponrawee Tachavandee told the BBC he was ""shocked"" when he learned Note was trapped. ""I didn't expect he would go inside the cave."" Rinlinee Sombat, who works in the same garage as Note's father, describes him as  a kind boy who takes care of his two-year-old sister, and enjoys playing with her young son. ""He's a smart kid - when you teach him how to fix something in the garage, he'll learn how to do it after just one go,"" she told the BBC. Pipat Pho (Nickname: Nick), 15 In his letter, Nick told his parents he wants to go for Mookatha, or Thai barbeque, when he comes out of the cave. ""Nick loves Mum, Dad and siblings,"" he wrote, alongside a drawing of a heart. Pornchai Kamluang (Nickname: Tee), 16 Tee is a defender for the Wild Boars. ""Don't worry, I'm very happy"", said Tee in a letter to his parents. This video can not be played The mood was tense as people waited for news of the high-risk operation Assistant coach Ekapol Chantawong (Nickname: Ake), 25 Ake was reportedly born in Myanmar and lost his parents at a young age. Before becoming a football coach, he spent several years as a Buddhist monk, and learnt how to conserve energy by restricting movements and meditating. According to local news reports, he taught these techniques to the boys in the cave. In his letter, Ake apologised to the parents for taking the boys into the cave network, but several replied to say they did not blame him. ""I promise I will take care of the kids as best as I can,"" Ake wrote. The group of boys and their coach were found after nine days Some media reports suggest that when the group was found Ake was the weakest, having refused to eat any of the food they had brought with them, giving it instead to the boys. His note also included a message to both his aunt and grandmother, informing them that he was ""fine"". ""Do not worry too much about me. Take good care of your health,"" he wrote, adding: ""Please prepare vegetable juice and pork rind for me. I'll have them when I can get out. Thanks.""

Women guilty over emaciated teen death,"Jordan Burling died at the home he shared with his mother and grandmother on 30 June 2016 The mother and grandmother of an emaciated man who was allowed to ""rot to death"" have been convicted of his manslaughter. Jordan Burling, 18, went into cardiac arrest in Leeds in 2016 and died weighing less than six stone (37kg). Mother Dawn Cranston and grandmother Denise were both convicted after a trial at Leeds Crown Court. Mr Burling's sister Abigail Burling, 25, was convicted of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult's death. The teenager left to waste away The jury cleared her of manslaughter, following more than two days of deliberations. On the day Mr Burling died, paramedics found him wearing a soiled nappy and lying in an unresponsive state on a makeshift inflatable bed in the living room of the house in Butterbowl Garth, Farnley. A subsequent police search of the property found the remains of a baby boy in a rucksack, hidden on the top shelf of a cupboard in Jordan's bedroom for 14 years. Dawn Cranston earlier admitted a count of endeavouring to conceal the birth of a child. Denise Cranston, 70, Abigail Burling, 25, and Dawn Cranston, 45, failed to alert a GP as Jordan's condition worsened At the time of Mr Burling's death, his appearance was likened to a victim of a World War Two concentration camp, with an NHS dietician telling the court he had the lowest body mass index she had ever seen. The Crown Prosecution Service described the case as ""one of the most shocking"" they had ever dealt with in the Yorkshire region. Mr Burling had lived with Ms Cranston, 45, Mrs Cranston, 70 and Jordan's uncle, with his sister living a short distance away in Cow Close Road. More on this story and others in West Yorkshire It was estimated he had been malnourished for at least six months before he died, having developed bed sores so deep they left bone exposed. Paramedic Bridget Shepherd, who treated Mr Burling, said he looked ""very, very pale and very emaciated"" when she first arrived on 30 June 2016, the day he died. A post-mortem examination found he died from acute bronchopneumonia, resulting from his malnutrition, his immobility and his infected sores. Mr Burling was confined to the living room of the house in the final months of his life In his early life, a primary school report stated there was a ""general neglect of Jordan's basic needs"", with the young boy lacking toilet training, having black teeth, and few language skills. Prosecutor Nicholas Lumley QC said ""education and social services played little part in his life"", particularly after his mother decided to home-school him from the age of 12. The trial heard from a neighbour, who said the family was considered ""strange and reclusive"" by locals. Emaciated teen's sister 'misled police' Starving teen's mum 'saw GP herself' Mother 'genuinely tried' to help son PC Ben McNamara, who arrived at the home shortly after Mr Burling's death, told the court the first thing Dawn Cranston asked him was how much the funeral would cost. ""I was surprised by everyone's lack of emotion. It is a strange thing to say after he had just died,"" he said. Mr Burling was home-schooled by his mother from the age of 12 after being bullied at school. His family claimed his weight fluctuated around Christmas 2015 but he started to look ""very thin"" the following April. Mr Lumley said Mr Burling's three relatives ""failed to seek medical assistance for him as he became immobile and helpless."" Leeds Crown Court heard Mr Burling was rarely seen outside of the house by neighbours In the final months of his life, he was confined to the living room with his family changing his adult nappy and washing him. During the trial, the jury heard the family home was targeted by youths throwing projectiles at windows regularly around 2006. It was around this time that Denise Cranston's husband Herbert committed suicide in a bedroom, the court heard. While giving evidence, Ms Cranston told the jury about an incident ""in 2002 or 2003"" when she had given birth alone in Jordan's bedroom while her family were all downstairs. She told jurors she was completely unaware she was pregnant until she started to feel something ""really heavy"" in her body, and had given birth within half an hour. The court heard ""she tried everything"" for up to an hour to save the baby's life including mouth-to-mouth resuscitation but there ""were no signs of life at all"". ""I just panicked, as nobody else knew that I was pregnant,"" she said. The court heard she hid the remains of the baby in a rucksack, which she then stored in the top of a wardrobe. The three women are due to be sentenced on Thursday.

Thousands gather for RAF centenary flypast,"This video can not be played A flypast of aircraft marks the centenary of the Royal Air Force Thousands of people have gathered outside Buckingham Palace to watch a flypast of aircraft to mark the centenary of the Royal Air Force.

Poundworld cuts 242 jobs as 25 stores shut,"Poundworld, the struggling discount retailer, will close 25 stores, resulting in 242 job losses, administrators said. The stores named for closure will operate until 15 July, according to a memo sent to Poundworld staff. ""The administrators have been preparing contingency plans in the event that we are not able to deliver a sale of the business as a whole,"" the memo said. The retailer has 355 stores and employs 5,100 people across the UK. The administrators, Deloitte, have been trying to find a buyer for the troubled chain since it went into administration on 11 June. Two potential deals have failed, including one from the chain's founder Chris Edwards, who was offering to buy around half of the stores. However, Deloitte said it was continuing discussions with interested parties and the closure of 25 stores would ""not impact on the potential sale of the remaining business"". ""Whilst we remain hopeful that a sale for part of the business can still happen, it has not been possible to sell the business as a whole, resulting in today's announcement,"" said Clare Boardman, joint administrator in a statement. On Monday Mr Edwards ruled himself out of a rescue after his final offer was rejected. Poundworld was formerly founded in 2004, but it says it can trace its origins ""back to 1974 and a market stall in Wakefield, West Yorkshire"". In 2015 Mr Edwards sold the chain to US private equity firm, TPG Corporation, which also controls restaurant chain, Prezzo. The death of a Poundworld What's eating the pound shops? Six reasons behind the High Street crisis In June, Alteri investors, whose website says it specialises in ""challenging retail situations"", also pulled out of talks to buy the chain. Like many retailers, Poundworld has been hit by falling consumer confidence, rising overheads, the weaker pound and the growth of online shopping. In 2016-17 its losses grew to Â£17.1m, which commentators put down to a tough retail climate, and a High Street becoming crowded by rival discounters including Poundland and Poundstretcher. Like its rivals, Poundworld imports much of its stock from the Far East, and is having to pay more for it because of the fall in the value of the pound, adding more pressure to the business. Increasingly shoppers are ordering goods from overseas more cheaply via online marketplaces. The list of Poundworld shops set to close, the BBC understands, are as follows: Ashton Birmingham, the Fort Retail Park Blackburn Bradford Ivegate Express Brays Carmarthen Chester Crewe Denton DUAL Derby West Field Doncaster Dumfries Halifax Hyde Ipswich Liverpool Belle Vale Loughborough Manchester Arndale Express Middlebrook Newcastle Wallsend North Shields Nottingham Broadmarsh Stretford Sutton Coldfield Wakefield What's eating the pound shops?

Divers push to complete Thai cave rescue,"This video can not be played Rescue diver in Thai cave: ""I was very scared"" Nineteen divers have entered the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand on a gruelling, hazardous mission to rescue those people still trapped inside. They extracted a ninth boy on Tuesday, the Thai Navy said, with reports suggesting two more. If confirmed, one child and an adult remain to be rescued, bringing to a close an epic operation marred by one diver's death. Eight boys rescued earlier are said to be in good mental and physical health. The group, a football team, had got stuck deep inside on 23 June after heavy rains caused flooding. After they were found by divers last week, huddled in darkness on a ledge and cut off from the outside world for nine days, the race began to get them out before the weather deteriorated even further. The boys evacuated so far have undergone X-rays and blood tests. They will remain under observation in hospital for at least seven days. Latest on the cave rescue Who are the Thai boys trapped in a cave? How risky is the Thai boys rescue? A doctor and Thai Navy Seal divers have been looking after those still on the ledge, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave's mouth. It kicked off just after 10:00 local time (03:00 GMT) when the 19 divers made their way into the cave. Rain was falling but rescuers say the water level inside the cave is similar to that on Sunday, the first day of the operation, an official said. Thai Navy SEALs confirmed a ninth child had been brought out at 16:06,external. Helicopter and ambulance activity in the cave area, from which the media have been barred, suggests that at least two more members of the Wild Boars football team were rescued and were being ferried to hospital.

By Michelle Roberts, BBC News After the boys had spent so long in the cold and dark with poor ventilation and relatively little to eat and drink, there were concerns that they would be in a far worse state. Now that they are dry, warm and in safe care, full medical assessments can be done. None of the first eight has a fever - a sign of a possible infection - although two have needed antibiotic treatment for suspected lung infections. Doctors will be checking for any infections, such as ""caver's disease"", a lung disease caused by a fungus that grows in bat droppings. They will also make sure any cuts and scrapes that the boys have on their skin are clean and healing nicely. The boys remain in quarantine, meaning their parents will not be allowed any physical contact. This is partly to protect the boys from unnecessary infections until they regain their strength, as well as to prevent them passing on anything they might have picked up in the wet cave. They will need to build up their muscles and their immunity, as well as get used to living in the outside world again. For now, they wear shades to protect their eyes from the bright light. The first group of four boys was rescued on Sunday, followed by four more on Monday. The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June Some of the boys had low temperatures, with one showing a low heart rate when they were first taken to hospital, but they have now recovered. ""All eight are in good health, no fever... everyone is in a good mental state,"" Jesada Chokedamrongsuk, permanent secretary of the public health ministry, said at a news conference. The boys are currently being treated at the Chiang Rai Prachanukroh hospital Health officials say they were at first given instant food and energy gels but are now eating easy-to-digest food. They also say some of the boys have now seen their parents - but only through glass. Further test results are expected in a few days and if all signs of infection have cleared, families will be allowed to visit. However, they must don protective clothing and cannot go closer than 2m (6ft). However, Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, has been allowed to visit the boys. Allow Twitter content?

A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - have been working in the caves. They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system. Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers. The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. Wearing a full-face mask, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. The operation in pictures 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' Letters of love from trapped Thai boys The toughest part is about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through.

"Thai cave rescue ends with all 13 outDivers in Thailand rescue all 13 people trapped in a flooded cave, 17 days after they got trapped.AsiaRelated contentLiveAll boys rescued from Thai caveVideo'No kid has cave dived like this'How risky is the rescue?","The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June Divers in northern Thailand have rescued all 12 boys and their football coach from flooded caves, 17 days after they got trapped underground. Their plight and the massive, dangerous three-day-long operation to free them gripped the world's attention. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded their way back out. They were found by British divers last week, huddled in darkness on a ledge amid fears they could be forced to stay there for months until water receded. There were cheers as a daring rescue operation involving dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers came to an end on Tuesday evening. Cave rescue as it happened Rescue story in pictures Who are the Thai boys? Who are the Thailand cave rescue divers? In an indication of how dangerous the journey out was,a former Thai navy diver diedin the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen. This video can not be played Rescue diver in Thai cave: ""I was very scared"" Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team had entered the Tham Luang cave system in the province of Chiang Rai during an excursion with their coach. Confirming the completion of the rescue operation, theThai Navy Seals Facebook page,externalannounced: ""All 12 Wild Boars and coach have been extracted from the cave. All are safe."" And at the house just below the mountains where the men who run the Wild Boars meet, there was laughter, shouts and cheers - and people shook hands in a very un-Thai way, says the BBC Jonathan Head. By Nick Beake, at Chiang Rai hospital This is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission Accomplished. Families in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldn't believe it, others said they had never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles. Up on the eighth floor, doctors - who declared this morning that the first eight boys to be rescued are doing well - will now be examining their remaining team mates and their coach. Psychologists will be assessing the impact a fortnight trapped underground has had. The Wild Boars footballers went into the Tham Luang cave as a team. They survived as a team. And tonight, at the end of a remarkable 72-hour rescue, they are together as a team once again. The first eight boys to be rescued - on Sunday and Monday - are still in hospital but said to be in good mental and physical health. They have undergone X-rays and blood tests, and will remain under observation in hospital for at least seven days. This video can not be played Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" Their parents have been allowed to see them through a glass window at the hospital, but they are being quarantined. Drinking contaminated water in the cave or being exposed to bird or bat droppings in the cave could lead to dangerous infections, experts say. Football offers support to boys The boys lost weight during their time in the caves and are keen to eat. They are said to have requested a favourite pork dish, bread and chocolate, but solid food will have to be reintroduced slowly to prevent digestive upset. They will also need to wear sunglasses for a few days until their eyes readjust to the brighter light. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Offers of hospitality for the football team have come in from around the world: Global football body Fifa offered the 12 young footballers tickets for Sunday's World Cup final in Moscow, but they are too weak to travel. Portuguese club Benfica has invited the boys and their coach an all-expenses-paid week at its training academy. Manchester United - the English club several of the boys support - has offered them the chance to attend a game. England players including Manchester City defender Kyle Walker are sending football kit to the boys after one of them was pictured wearing an England shirt inside the caves. A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - worked in the Tham Luang caves.

The last ambulance has arrived at the hospital in Chiang Rai, the BBC's Howard Johnson says. It means the final four members of the team, plus the coach, now join the eight others who were rescued over the previous two days. The first eight have undergone X-rays and blood tests, and will remain under observation for at least seven days. They are said to be in good mental and physical health. Some of the boys have now seen their families, but only through a glass panel in the hospital as medical staff want to protect them from possible infections. Allow Twitter content?

Jonathan HeadBBC South East Asia Correspondent Over the past week we have called
in to chat to Nopparat Kanthawong, the head coach of the Wild Boars football
team, and usually found him talking tensely on the phone to parents of the
boys. He went over and over the events of the day the boys went into the caves
with his assistant after football practice. He says he had no idea they were
going. Tonight there was an entirely
different atmosphere in the house, just below the mountains where the men who
run the Wild Boars meet. They laughed, shouted cheers and shook hands in a very
un-Thai way. And coach Nop was smiling for the first time, and almost
speechless. ""I donât know what to say â I just want to see them, and hug them,"" he told me. I was then able to show him a note from Manchester United to the rescued boys. It was an invitation to visit Old Trafford
next season, as most of the boys are passionate Man U fans. There was a little
disbelief, and then elation, even from coach Nop, who admits he is a Liverpool
fan who has failed to convert the rest of his team. ""Is this for real?"" they
asked. Getting them to UK from this
far-flung border town will be a challenge. Three of the boys and coach Ekapol,
who was with them in the caves, are not recognised as full Thai citizens, a
fairly common problem for communities along the Thai-Myanmar border. But they
just made an almost miraculous escape from a cave. They will probably make it to

The young footballers had been invited by Fifa to attend the World Cup Final in Moscow on Sunday. But their attendance was always a long shot, given the health risks they face after spending more than two weeks in a pitch-dark cave. Fifa has just told the BBC that the boys will not be making the match. Here's what they said: FIFA would like to express its great joy at the news of the rescue of the 12 young footballers and their coach. We would like to convey our profound gratitude to all persons involved in the rescue operation, which unfortunately took the life of one of the divers. Our thoughts are with his family. We have been informed by the Football Association of Thailand that due to medical reasons, the boys will not be in a position to travel to Moscow for the FIFA World Cup final. FIFA's priority remains the health of everyone involved in the operation and we will look into finding a new opportunity to invite the boys to a FIFA event to share with them a moment of communion and celebration. We can also confirm that a meeting with the Football Association of Thailand is scheduled to take place in Moscow around the FIFA World Cup final. The BBC's Nick Beake is at the hospital where the boys are being treated: This is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission
Accomplished. Families in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the
final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldnât believe
it, others claimed they never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles.
Scores of reporters rushed to their live positions to bring the news to
their audiences at home. Japanese and Brazilian networks were either side of
us. Up on the 8th floor, the doctors who declared this morning that the
first eight boys to be rescued are doing well will now be examining their remaining
teammates and their coach. Psychologists will be being assessing the impact a
fortnight trapped underground has had. The Wild Boars footballers went into the
Tham Luang cave as a team. They survived as a team. And tonight, at the end of
a remarkable 72-hour rescue, they are together as a team once again. An ambulance leaves the Tham Luang cave on Tuesday Petty Officer Saman Gunan, a former Thai navy diver in his late thirties, died on 6 July while helping to re-supply the cave with new air tanks. He ran out oxygen and lost consciousness. BBC Thai spoke to his family after his death. ""I really loved him,"" his wife  Waleeporn Gunan  said.

"Trump names Kavanaugh for Supreme CourtThe nomination, if confirmed by Congress, could shape the US legal system for a generation.US & Canada","This video can not be played Trump nominates Kavanaugh as new Supreme Court justice US President Donald Trump has nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, setting the stage for a bruising confirmation battle. In a primetime announcement at the White House, Mr Trump praised his pick as a ""brilliant jurist"". The nominee, a District of Columbia appeals court judge, is a former adviser to ex-President George W Bush. The decision has far-reaching implications for America on everything from abortion to guns to immigration. This is Mr Trump's second Supreme Court appointment, potentially allowing him to shape the US for a generation. The president said: ""Judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials, unsurpassed qualifications and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law."" Judge Kavanaugh said he was ""humbled"" by the president's confidence in him The appointee would replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, who announced last month that he will retire soon. Meet the Supremes - the nine judges on US top court Why is the US Supreme Court so important? At Monday night's announcement, Mr Kavanaugh, 53, thanked President Trump and said he had ""witnessed firsthand your appreciation for the vital role of the American judiciary."" Pro-choice and anti-abortion protesters demonstrate in front of the US Supreme Court ahead of the announcement Mr Kavanaugh has served since 2006 on the influential US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and was formerly a White House aide under George W Bush. He previously worked for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Democratic former president Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Abortion Mr Kavanaugh has not expressed outright opposition to Roe v Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion nationwide, but he has given some indications of where he might stand. Last year, the DC Circuit Court ruled that an undocumented immigrant teenager in detention was entitled to seek an abortion. Mr Kavanaugh objected, saying that her right to have an abortion was ""based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong"". He did, however, write in his dissent to the ruling that the court must recognise Roe v Wade and another abortion rights case ""as precedents we must follow"". Executive power Mr Kavanaugh argued in 2009 article that presidents should be shielded from criminal investigations and civil lawsuits while in office. That could be a red flag to Democrats - indicating that if the special counsel investigation into Mr Trump's campaign ties to Russia finds its way to the Supreme Court, he would not support action against Mr Trump while the president before his term is up. Guns He is pro-second amendment. In 2011, he objected when the DC Circuit Court upheld a ban on most semi-automatic rifles in the district. He argued that, because most handguns are semi-automatic, and are protected by a previous Supreme Court ruling, semi-automatic rifles should benefit from the same protection. The environment The nomination is likely to concern environmentalists. Mr Kavanaugh has issued rulings and dissents against Obama-era environmental regulations, including efforts to curb air pollution from power plants and greenhouse gases. The US Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter on contentious laws and disputes between states and the federal government. It rules on such issues as abortion, the death penalty, voter rights, immigration policy, campaign finance and racial bias in policing. This video can not be played Explaining Roe v Wade and abortion in US Each of the nine justices holds a lifetime appointment. As Mr Kavanaugh is relatively young, he could serve for decades to come. His appointment will not change the ideological tilt of a court that already has a 5-4 conservative majority, but he could shift the bench further to the right. Justice Kennedy sometimes sided with the court's liberal members. But Mr Kavanaugh may not be so accommodating. Neil Gorsuch, 50, who was appointed by Mr Trump last year, is already one of the court's most conservative justices. Judge Kavanaugh was accompanied by his wife and two daughters Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The front-runner was a front-runner for a reason. Over the weekend, it looked as though Judge Kavanaugh's star may have been fading, that perhaps he had too-close ties to the Bush family for Mr Trump's liking. In the end, however, the safe pick won out. He is the kind of judge a President Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney would have picked - a man with an established legal pedigree and a reputation as a reliably conservative jurist. If the party sticks together, the president's choice will be sitting on the Supreme Court when its new term starts in October. President Trump campaigned with a promise to conservatives that he would fill the federal courts, from the top on down, with judges to their liking. It's a promise that has helped cement near-record levels of support for his presidency from Republican voters - and for good reason. Mr Trump is securing a conservative judiciary for a generation. The nominee must be confirmed by the Senate, which the Republicans narrowly control 51-49. A nominee needs a simple majority of 51 votes to be confirmed. With Senator John McCain battling cancer, Republicans can currently only muster 50 votes. Before a full vote in the chamber, the prospective justice will be grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee in hearings that can go on for days. The White House and Republicans want the nomination confirmed by November's mid-term elections. Conservative activists will begin running ads pressuring politically vulnerable Democratic senators to vote for confirmation. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia will be prime targets, as they face tough re-election campaigns in their conservative states this year. Meanwhile, liberal groups are calling on two moderate Republican senators - Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska - to reject the nominee. Ms Collins has said she will not vote for any candidate who threatens abortion rights.

The crowd walked from the Bogside to the Fountain and past the sheltered accommodation which was attacked during disturbances over the weekend Contractors also moved in to extend the height of a fence on the city's walls on Monday night. The bishops look on as the trouble continues in the Bogside. The Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Rev Ken Good, and the Bishop of Derry, Dr Donal McKeown, paid a joint visit to the Fountain and Bogside on Tuesday afternoon, to meet people who had been affected by the attacks over the past few days. As the bishops left St Columb's Wells, a van was abandoned at the foot of Lecky Road flyover and set on fire. The clergymen were in the midst of their visit, which included speaking with youth workers, residents near the peace wall, as-well-as senior citizens from Alexander House who have been caught up in the violence. ""The continuing attacks on the Fountainâindeed, attacks on people in any part of our communityâare an affront to our society and deserve our unqualified condemnation,"" Bishop McKeown and Bishop Good said in a joint statement. ""There is no justification for the stone-throwing and petrol bombing which has terrorised people living in the Fountain, terrified residents of Alexander House, and appalled the vast, vast majority of their fellow citizens. ""We are thankful that no one has been seriously injured or worse as a result of the recent attacks but recognise that we may not be so fortunate in future.""

The police are advising people to avoid the area while they deal with the hijacking.

""They are not only terrorising the people in this area but placing a strain on emergency services. ""This must stop now."" PSNI Chief Inspector Alan Hutton said two police officers were injured after being hit by bricks. ""We are disappointed that some people decided to continue the public disorder in the Bogside last night, despite the clear message from the community earlier,"" Mr Hutton added. ""I am very proud of how my colleagues stood in the face of danger, working to bring this situation under control. ""But I am saddened and angry that again we find ourselves subject to serious violence from the communities we serve. ""Let me be clear, we made three arrests last night and with a robust criminal justice strategy in place, there will be more."" Inspector Hutton said there are now a number of police officers who are no longer available to deliver their core policing duties. ""The huge impact on our city cannot be ignored. ""As we strive to promote our positive image, the negative effect of these violent pictures on jobs, tourism and investment cannot be underestimated. We do not want to take a backward step. ""I urge all those with influence to urgently use it to bring a resolution to the violence and work towards a longer term solution for the issues affecting this area.""

Novichok victim 'a gentle soul',"Dawn Sturgess died on Sunday after being taken ill on 30 June The family of a woman who died after being exposed to a nerve agent have described her as ""a gentle soul who was generous to a fault"". Dawn Sturgess, 44, and Charlie Rowley, 45, fell ill in Amesbury on 30 June after being exposed to Novichok. Ms Sturgess died on Sunday. Mr Rowley remains in a critical condition. Police are investigating a possible link to the case of Russians Sergei and Yulia Skripal - who were poisoned with the same substance in nearby Salisbury. The UK government has blamed Russia for the incident, but the country's authorities deny any involvement. Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said people in the Amesbury and Salisbury area should not ""pick up any foreign object which could contain liquid or gel, in the interests of their own safety"". Murder inquiry after Novichok woman dies Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Ms Sturgess lived in Salisbury, and the couple had been in the city before going to Mr Rowley's flat in nearby Amesbury on Friday 29 June. They both then fell ill on Saturday 30 June, and Ms Sturgess died eight days later. She had two sons, aged 19 and 23, and an 11-year-old daughter. Her family said her death had been ""devastating"" for them. In a statement, they added: ""She would do anything for anybody, and those who knew Dawn would know that she would gladly give her last penny to somebody in need. ""She had the biggest of hearts and she will be dreadfully missed by both her immediate and wider family."" The family also thanked all the staff at Salisbury District Hospital who treated her, and sent their ""thoughts and prayers"" to Mr Rowley and his family. Tributes have been left to Ms Sturgess near the police cordon that is still in place Police seized a car in Swindon on Monday as part of their ongoing investigation into the poisoning. The BBC understands the white Audi belonged to a paramedic who had been with Ms Sturgess in an ambulance when she fell ill. Local residents said the paramedic had told them he got bodily fluids on him, but he had been checked over by doctors and given the ""all-clear"". His car was sealed and taken away on the back of a truck. The BBC understands the car belongs to a paramedic Residents also claimed he had told them both his car and his clothes were being taken to the government laboratory at Porton Down to be destroyed. Wiltshire Police said the public ""should not be alarmed by this,"" adding: ""Those involved have the training and expertise to safely remove the vehicle."" Police are continuing to hunt for a contaminated container which they believe was handled by the pair. The BBC understands Mr Rowley's flat is regarded as the key location in the search. A team wearing protective clothing is combing the small flat, working in 30-minute shifts because of the heat. Public Health England also offered advice for people who may have visited one of five areas identified by police. Those locations are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy, and the Baptist church in Amesbury, and John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Anyone who was there between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 on 30 June should continue to follow advice, including washing their clothes in a washing machine.

Wedding and weather lift economy in May,"The UK's economy grew by 0.3% in May, helped by the royal wedding and warm weather, latest figures show. The latest assessment by the Office for National Statistics,externalmarks a change in the way the UK's GDP is calculated. From now on, the ONS will release a monthly indicator and a rolling three-month figure. Previously it only put out growth data every three months. In the three months to May, the economy grew by 0.2% compared with the previous three-month period. ""The first of our new rolling estimates of GDP shows a mixed picture of the UK economy with modest growth driven by the services sector, partly offset by falling construction and industrial output,"" said the ONS's head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith. ""Retailing, computer programming and legal services all performed strongly in the three months to May, while housebuilding and manufacturing both contracted. ""Services, in particular, grew robustly in May, with retailers enjoying a double boost from the warm weather and the royal wedding. Construction also saw a return to growth after a weak couple of months."" Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: ""The long awaited bounce-back from a weak first quarter has failed to materialise, with the rolling three-month growth rate unchanged into May. He added: ""The fact that first-half growth is set to be below trend hardly makes a compelling case for an August rate rise."" However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the upturn in May was ""just strong enough to tip the balance"" in favour of an August rate rise, ""provided the government doesn't implode before then"". Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor Getting a little better, pretty slowly. Today's economic growth figures for May reveal that the ""bounce-back"" from the weather-related misery of the first three months of the year is small, though not insignificant. The services sector - which accounts for 80% of our economy - is stronger. Construction activity was also up by 2.9% compared with the previous month - although we must always take care with monthly figures, which can tend to be volatile. This morning's retail sales figures from the British Retail Consortium also revealed a pick-up. We are all doing a bit more shopping. The royal wedding and sunny weather are doing their bit now, in the way the snow and frost depressed February and March. There is little in today's figures that will surprise the Bank of England, which is contemplating increasing interest rates next month. It predicted a ""bounce-back"" earlier in the year. And against a subdued background, there is evidence today that is happening. Other figures also released by the ONS showed: The country'stotal trade deficit,externalwidened by Â£5bn to Â£8.3bn in the three months to May, mainly because of falling goods exports and rising goods imports Services output,externalincreased by 0.4% in the three months to May compared with the previous three months Construction output,externalfell by 1.7% in the three months to May, but rose 2.9% in May compared with April Production fell,externalby 0.6% in the three months to May compared with the previous three months, because of a fall of 1.2% in manufacturing. Basically, in an effort to make them more reliable. Until now, the ONS used to release a preliminary estimate of GDP four times a year. But this early quarterly estimate was based on about 40% of the information necessary to produce a full estimate of GDP, so it was subject to change as more data came in. The new policy should mean that the figures do not need to be revised as much in subsequent months. The ONS's new monthly and rolling three-monthly estimates will be compiled with what it calls ""a significantly higher data content"". The office says it has spent money on upgrading its systems so that it can gather and analyse information in a more timely fashion. In particular, the service sector, which contributes 80% of the UK's GDP, will now be measured more speedily than before, it says. It will bring the UK more into line with other developed economies, which tend to produce more accurate initial quarterly estimates that don't need such big revisions. In fact, the ONS intends to leapfrog other countries, by making the UK the first big economy to produce a monthly figure. However, in the short term, it could be bad news for one of the ONS's biggest customers, the Bank of England. The Bank's interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee is due to meet on 2 August, amid speculation that it could raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.75%. Under the old timetable for release of GDP figures, MPC members would have been armed with a preliminary estimate of second-quarter growth. But now those figures will not be available until 10 August. The ONS says those figures will be more comprehensive and accurate because of the delay. But that is no help to Bank policymakers as they wrestle with their key economic decision.

Latest after Brexit resignations,"Tory vice-chairs Ben Bradley and Maria Caulfield resign They are latest to go because of cabinet's Brexit plan President Trump refers to UK 'turmoil' ahead of visit Earlier PM Theresa May chaired her new-look cabinet Jeremy Hunt succeeded Boris Johnson as foreign secretary Matt Hancock succeeded Hunt as health secretary Andy McFarlane and Gavin Stamp We are drawing the curtains on the live page. It's been a busy day, so here's a recap on the main developments.  Angela Merkel welcomes the UK's Chequers agreement, saying it is a ""good thing we have proposals on the table"". The German Chancellor says the remaining 27 EU members will agree a ""common response"" once it has seen the detail of the official UK position. But she says progress is being made and repeats her stance that her country wants as close links as possible with the UK after Brexit. Theresa May is asked about Donald Trump's claims that the UK is in turmoil, ahead of his visit on Thursday, and whether the US President is a real fan of Boris Johnson. The PM does not comment directly but says she is looking forward to Mr Trump's visit, saying there is ""much to discuss"". She says the special relationship with the US is the UK's deepest and longest security and defence alliance. The two leaders, she adds, will talking about how to use this to benefit the UK and US but also enhance the wider good.  But who do these shoes belong to? The answer: British Prime Minister Theresa May, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama and Montenegro's Prime Minister Dusko Markovic. Theresa May is now speaking at the conclusion of the Western Balkans summit in central London. She says claims that, as a result of Brexit, the UK will be ""retreating"" from its role as a guarantor of peace in the region and on the continent as a whole are completely wrong. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is now speaking. Brexit is almost certain to crop up during questions.  In his letter resigning as a Tory vice-chair, Remain voter Ben Bradley writes that he was persuaded to back the Brexit vision because of the ""immense opportunities that are available from global trade, and for the ability
for Britain to be an outward looking nation in control of our own destiny once
again"". But he complains: ""I fear that this agreement at Chequers damages those opportunities; that being tied to EU regulations, and the EU tying our hands when seeking to make new trade agreements, will be the worst of all worlds if we do not deliver Brexit in spirit as well as in name. ""Then we are handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10."" MPs have decisively rejected Liberal Democrat calls for a ""People's Vote"" on the final Brexit deal. A Commons motion put forward by Sir Vince Cable's party was defeated by 299 votes to 13 in Parliament. Aside from nine Lib Dem MPs, the other MPs to support it were Green Party leader Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's three MPs. Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein, a close friend of David Cameron, takes issue with some of the arguments made by Ben Bradley or Maria Caulfield in their resignation letters. In short, he seems to be saying the UK has a choice between the Chequers compromise or no deal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One of Maria Caulfield's main objections had been to the backstop agreement for Northern Ireland - that's the customs arrangement designed to avoid a ""hard border"" - which she felt was ""neither necessary or
constructive for the future prosperity of the UK"". ""The policy may assuage vested interests but the voters will find out and their
representatives will be found out,"" she wrote in her resignation letter as Conservative vice-chair. ""This policy will be bad for our country and
bad for the party. The direct consequences of that will be Prime Minister
Corbyn."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, speaking in New York, added that many models of co-operation with Brussels were available to the UK, including a ""Norway"" deal, ""Norway plus"" or an ""ambitious"" version of the Canada deal, and that each deal had ""its own balance of rights and negotiations"". However, he said the UK's current red lines meant they were ""closing the door"" to many different types of co-operation. Michel Barnier, who's leading Brexit negotiations on behalf of Brussels, has said there is accord on 80% of the UK withdrawal
agreement and that the European Union was ready to start working on an ""ambitious free trade arrangement"" with the UK. Speaking
in New York, Mr Barnier said that negotiators still needed to find a solution
to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. In
response to recent resignations in Westminster, Mr Barnier said he had a
""very cordial and frank relationship"" with David Davis and had met
""many people with different views"" during the course of the
negotiations. BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The first eight have undergone X-rays and blood tests, and will remain under observation for at least seven days. They are said to be in good mental and physical health.

Jonathan HeadBBC South East Asia Correspondent Over the past week we have called
in to chat to Nopparat Kanthawong, the head coach of the Wild Boars football
team, and usually found him talking tensely on the phone to parents of the
boys. He went over and over the events of the day the boys went into the caves
with his assistant after football practice. He says he had no idea they were
going. Tonight there was an entirely
different atmosphere in the house, just below the mountains where the men who
run the Wild Boars meet. They laughed, shouted cheers and shook hands in a very
un-Thai way. And coach Nop was smiling for the first time, and almost
speechless. ""I donât know what to say â I just want to see them, and hug them,"" he told me. I was then able to show him a note from Manchester United to the rescued boys. It was an invitation to visit Old Trafford
next season, as most of the boys are passionate Man U fans. There was a little
disbelief, and then elation, even from coach Nop, who admits he is a Liverpool
fan who has failed to convert the rest of his team. ""Is this for real?"" they
asked. Getting them to UK from this
far-flung border town will be a challenge. Three of the boys and coach Ekapol,
who was with them in the caves, are not recognised as full Thai citizens, a
fairly common problem for communities along the Thai-Myanmar border. But they
just made an almost miraculous escape from a cave. They will probably make it to
Manchester Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The young footballers had been invited by Fifa to attend the World Cup Final in Moscow on Sunday. But their attendance was always a long shot, given the health risks they face after spending more than two weeks in a pitch-dark cave. Fifa has just told the BBC that the boys will not be making the match. Here's what they said: FIFA would like to express its great joy at the news of the rescue of the 12 young footballers and their coach. We would like to convey our profound gratitude to all persons involved in the rescue operation, which unfortunately took the life of one of the divers. Our thoughts are with his family. We have been informed by the Football Association of Thailand that due to medical reasons, the boys will not be in a position to travel to Moscow for the FIFA World Cup final. FIFA's priority remains the health of everyone involved in the operation and we will look into finding a new opportunity to invite the boys to a FIFA event to share with them a moment of communion and celebration. We can also confirm that a meeting with the Football Association of Thailand is scheduled to take place in Moscow around the FIFA World Cup final. The BBC's Nick Beake is at the hospital where the boys are being treated: This is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission
Accomplished. Families in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the
final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldnât believe
it, others claimed they never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles.
Scores of reporters rushed to their live positions to bring the news to
their audiences at home. Japanese and Brazilian networks were either side of
us. Up on the 8th floor, the doctors who declared this morning that the
first eight boys to be rescued are doing well will now be examining their remaining
teammates and their coach. Psychologists will be being assessing the impact a
fortnight trapped underground has had. The Wild Boars footballers went into the
Tham Luang cave as a team. They survived as a team. And tonight, at the end of
a remarkable 72-hour rescue, they are together as a team once again. An ambulance leaves the Tham Luang cave on Tuesday Petty Officer Saman Gunan, a former Thai navy diver in his late thirties, died on 6 July while helping to re-supply the cave with new air tanks. He ran out oxygen and lost consciousness. BBC Thai spoke to his family after his death. ""I really loved him,"" his wife  Waleeporn Gunan  said.

PM's new cabinet meets amid Brexit turmoilTheresa May warns her party it must unite after a string of resignations over Brexit forced a reshuffle.,"Theresa May tweeted a picture of the cabinet, saying it had been a ""productive"" meeting Theresa May's new-look cabinet has met for the first time after a string of resignations over her Brexit strategy left her government in crisis. Mrs May was forced to carry out a reshuffle of her top team after Boris Johnson and David Davis both quit. The prime minister has warned the Tory party it must unite or face the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn in power. Jeremy Hunt, who has replaced Mr Johnson as foreign secretary, said he would be ""four square"" behind her. After the cabinet meeting, Mrs May tweeted that she was ""looking ahead to a busy week"". US President Donald Trump, who arrives in the country for a visit on Thursday, said the UK was in ""turmoil"" and ""it is up to the people"" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister. Live updates: Brexit resignations reaction Laura Kuenssberg: Could it be opportunity for PM? Katya Adler: The view from Brussels on UK turmoil Trump talks of UK turmoil ahead of visit The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU after that. The delay has been partly blamed on deep disagreements within the Conservative Party over what shape Brexit should take. Essentially the arguments are about how much the UK should prioritise business interests by compromising on post-referendum promises to end free movement of people, remove the UK from the remit of the European Court of Justice, and also have an independent trade policy which allows the UK to set its own trade rules and strike its own trade deals. Last Friday at the prime minister's country retreat at Chequers Mrs May brokered a ""collective"" agreement on proposals for the future relationship between the EU and UK. However, Mr Johnson - whose departure on Monday followed that of Brexit Secretary David Davis and several junior figures - accused Mrs May of pursuing a ""semi-Brexit"". In his resignation letter, he said the Brexit ""dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"". This video can not be played David Davis explains why he resigned Mr Davis, who has been leading Brexit negotiations for the UK so far, said he did not agree with the prime minister's proposals, so was the wrong person to be going into negotiations with them. He said that the UK was ""giving away too much, too easily"" ahead of negotiations with the European Union. Several junior government figures also quit, including Brexit minister Steve Baker who told the BBC's Daily Politics they had been ""blindsided"" by the No 10 plan that emerged at Chequers. Asked on Tuesday morning whether he too had considered resigning, another prominent Brexiteer, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, replied ""absolutely not"" and declared himself ""100%"" behind Mrs May's Brexit plan. On Monday evening, the prime minister faced down backbench critics at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, amid rumours they were close to getting the 48 signatures needed to trigger a no-confidence vote that could spark a leadership election. She told her critics the alternative to the party coming together could be a left-wing Labour administration, with Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said that while Brexiteers were still unhappy with the Chequers plan, their focus was on getting that changed, not on ousting Mrs May. ""There is a genuine weariness and horror at the thought of more disruption, turmoil and a possible leadership contest,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Above all, I just don't think one should underestimate Mrs May's sheer durability - you look around her cabinet table and there are bodies littered all over the placeâ¦ and she is still there. ""Yes, her position is extraordinarily fragile and vulnerable, but it is far from game over."" Former Conservative leader Lord Howard called for a ""degree of humility all around"". He told the Today programme: ""I do think it would be extremely foolish and extremely ill-advised for anyone to send in letters to mount a motion of no confidence in the prime minister and I am delighted that good sense seems to be breaking out."" Under Conservative Party rules, a leadership contest is triggered either if the leader resigns or if 15% of all Tory MPs (currently 48) write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, triggering a vote of no confidence by MPs If Mrs May lost such a vote, a leadership election would be triggered and she would be unable to stand as a candidate But if she won, she would be immune from motions of confidence for a year To enter the contest, a candidate needs to be nominated by 15% of MPs MPs then vote in successive ballots - with the candidate with the lowest number of votes eliminated in each round - until two candidates remain Finally, Tory members vote for which candidate they want (unless there's just one, in which case they become leader) The UK's negotiations with the EU will now be fronted by Dominic Raab, a staunch Leave supporter who has been promoted from the job of housing minister. Mr Hunt, who has been health secretary for the past six years, was a Remain campaigner in the 2016 EU referendum. He has since said he is a convert to the Brexit cause. But his appointment means the four great offices of state - prime minister, chancellor, foreign secretary, and home secretary - are all held by ministers who voted to stay in the EU. Jeremy Hunt replaces Boris Johnson as foreign secretary Dominic Raab has been made Brexit secretary Boris Johnson's resignation letter and May's reply in full Who's who guide: Theresa May's cabinet In his first comments as foreign secretary, Mr Hunt said he would be standing ""four square"" behind the prime minister ""so that we can get through an agreement with the European Union based on what was agreed by the cabinet last week at Chequers"". Matt Hancock is the new health secretary, with Attorney General Jeremy Wright replacing him as the culture secretary, and backbencher Geoffrey Cox becoming the new attorney general. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson and Mr Davis had abandoned a ""sinking ship"", shattering the ""illusion of unity"" initially surrounding the Chequers plan. The UK and the EU have been negotiating Brexit terms for more than a year now and have been hoping to agree broad aims for their future relationship in October. The aim of the Chequers away day had been to agree the UK position - after two years of discussion - but the resignations have put a question mark over that. Allow Twitter content?

The uncertainty in the UK comes before the plan is officially put to the EU, who may well be unhappy with aspects of it they have previously referred to as ""cherry picking"". One other element of Friday's agreement worth noting is that it pledged to speed up preparations for the UK to be ready to leave the EU without a Brexit deal in March next year. Labour MP and Remainer Chuka Umunna told Today that all the drama of Monday needed to be put to one side, saying: ""This has gone from a soap opera to a comedy, and it would be funny were it not for the fact that the subject matter is going to have a fundamental impact on hundreds of thousands of people's jobs.""

Trump names Kavanaugh for Supreme Court,"This video can not be played Trump nominates Kavanaugh as new Supreme Court justice US President Donald Trump has nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, setting the stage for a bruising confirmation battle. In a primetime announcement at the White House, Mr Trump praised his pick as a ""brilliant jurist"". The nominee, a District of Columbia appeals court judge, is a former adviser to ex-President George W Bush. The decision has far-reaching implications for America on everything from abortion to guns to immigration. This is Mr Trump's second Supreme Court appointment, potentially allowing him to shape the US for a generation. The president said: ""Judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials, unsurpassed qualifications and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law."" Judge Kavanaugh said he was ""humbled"" by the president's confidence in him The appointee would replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, who announced last month that he will retire soon. Meet the Supremes - the nine judges on US top court Why is the US Supreme Court so important? At Monday night's announcement, Mr Kavanaugh, 53, thanked President Trump and said he had ""witnessed firsthand your appreciation for the vital role of the American judiciary."" Pro-choice and anti-abortion protesters demonstrate in front of the US Supreme Court ahead of the announcement Mr Kavanaugh has served since 2006 on the influential US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and was formerly a White House aide under George W Bush. He previously worked for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Democratic former president Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Abortion Mr Kavanaugh has not expressed outright opposition to Roe v Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion nationwide, but he has given some indications of where he might stand. Last year, the DC Circuit Court ruled that an undocumented immigrant teenager in detention was entitled to seek an abortion. Mr Kavanaugh objected, saying that her right to have an abortion was ""based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong"". He did, however, write in his dissent to the ruling that the court must recognise Roe v Wade and another abortion rights case ""as precedents we must follow"". Executive power Mr Kavanaugh argued in 2009 article that presidents should be shielded from criminal investigations and civil lawsuits while in office. That could be a red flag to Democrats - indicating that if the special counsel investigation into Mr Trump's campaign ties to Russia finds its way to the Supreme Court, he would not support action against Mr Trump while the president before his term is up. Guns He is pro-second amendment. In 2011, he objected when the DC Circuit Court upheld a ban on most semi-automatic rifles in the district. He argued that, because most handguns are semi-automatic, and are protected by a previous Supreme Court ruling, semi-automatic rifles should benefit from the same protection. The environment The nomination is likely to concern environmentalists. Mr Kavanaugh has issued rulings and dissents against Obama-era environmental regulations, including efforts to curb air pollution from power plants and greenhouse gases. The US Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter on contentious laws and disputes between states and the federal government. It rules on such issues as abortion, the death penalty, voter rights, immigration policy, campaign finance and racial bias in policing. This video can not be played Explaining Roe v Wade and abortion in US Each of the nine justices holds a lifetime appointment. As Mr Kavanaugh is relatively young, he could serve for decades to come. His appointment will not change the ideological tilt of a court that already has a 5-4 conservative majority, but he could shift the bench further to the right. Justice Kennedy sometimes sided with the court's liberal members. But Mr Kavanaugh may not be so accommodating. Neil Gorsuch, 50, who was appointed by Mr Trump last year, is already one of the court's most conservative justices. Judge Kavanaugh was accompanied by his wife and two daughters Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The front-runner was a front-runner for a reason. Over the weekend, it looked as though Judge Kavanaugh's star may have been fading, that perhaps he had too-close ties to the Bush family for Mr Trump's liking. In the end, however, the safe pick won out. He is the kind of judge a President Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney would have picked - a man with an established legal pedigree and a reputation as a reliably conservative jurist. If the party sticks together, the president's choice will be sitting on the Supreme Court when its new term starts in October. President Trump campaigned with a promise to conservatives that he would fill the federal courts, from the top on down, with judges to their liking. It's a promise that has helped cement near-record levels of support for his presidency from Republican voters - and for good reason. Mr Trump is securing a conservative judiciary for a generation. The nominee must be confirmed by the Senate, which the Republicans narrowly control 51-49. A nominee needs a simple majority of 51 votes to be confirmed. With Senator John McCain battling cancer, Republicans can currently only muster 50 votes. Before a full vote in the chamber, the prospective justice will be grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee in hearings that can go on for days. The White House and Republicans want the nomination confirmed by November's mid-term elections. Conservative activists will begin running ads pressuring politically vulnerable Democratic senators to vote for confirmation. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia will be prime targets, as they face tough re-election campaigns in their conservative states this year. Meanwhile, liberal groups are calling on two moderate Republican senators - Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska - to reject the nominee. Ms Collins has said she will not vote for any candidate who threatens abortion rights.

Jason Tarry, currently the group's chief product officer, will become the chief executive of Tesco UK. All changes take effect on 16 July.

Rising numbers pass primary Sats,"A higher proportion of primary school pupils in England have reached the expected standards in national curriculum tests, often known as Sats, in maths and English. In reading, 75% reached the expected standard, compared with 71% last year. In maths, 76% reached the expected standard, up from 75% last year. Julie McCulloch, of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the ""impressive results"" but criticised the pressure created by the tests. The results showed that 64% of pupils met the expected standard across all the tests in reading, writing and mathematics, up from 61% last year. In writing, 78% reached the expected level, up from 76%. And in grammar, punctuation and spelling, it was 78%, up from 77%. Ms McCulloch, policy director for the heads' union, said the continuing improvement showed the hard work of pupils and schools, following the introduction of ""harder tests"" in 2016. In the first year in which the tougher assessments were introduced only 53% made the grade, which has now risen in two years to 64%. But Ms McCulloch was concerned by reports of ""stress and anxiety"" for pupils taking the tests. The heads' union also warned against giving too much weight to a ""single set of results"". The ""expected level"" for maths and English is based on reaching a scaled score of 100. This year's average scaled score for reading was 105, slightly up from 104 last year. The average for maths remained the same at 104. School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said the results reflected rising standards in primary school. ""A good primary education lays the foundations for success at secondary school and beyond,"" he said. ""That's why we introduced a more rigorous, knowledge-rich primary school curriculum - with an emphasis on reading and fluency in arithmetic - to ensure every child is helped to reach their potential from the moment they start school."" But a campaign group of parents and teachers warned against too much testing in schools. ""At a time when their minds could have been stimulated and their knowledge expanded, their education has been sacrificed to a system which is in thrall to league tables,"" said Madeleine Holt, of the More Than A Score campaign.

Immediate stop to NHS mesh operations,"The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and to support organs NHS England is putting an immediate curb on mesh operations after safety concerns. It has accepted the advice of a new review looking at harm reported by women who received the treatment for stress urinary incontinence. The review's chair, Baroness Julia Cumberlege, said she was ""appalled at the seriousness and scale of the tragic stories"" that her team had heard. Many women say the implants caused them agony by cutting into tissue. Some say they have been left with life-changing injuries. Claire Cooper, who had the implants, mistakenly had a hysterectomy after doctors were unable to diagnose what was causing her pain. She was left feeling suicidal and unable to have sex.

It is estimated that more than 100,000 UK women have had a mesh fitted. The net-like fabric can be attached into the wall of the vagina to act as a scaffold to support organs, such as the bladder, to keep them in the right place to help manage incontinence or another condition called prolapse. Most patients suffer no ill effects, NHS England says. England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, said mesh would remain a treatment of last resort for some: ""Carefully selected patients will continue to have access in discussion with their consultant."" Baroness Cumberlege said the independent review found no evidence on the benefits for treating urinary incontinence that would outweigh ""the severity of human suffering caused by mesh complications"". ""My team and I are in no doubt that this pause is necessary. We must stop exposing women to the risk of life-changing and life-threatening injuries. We must have measures in place to mitigate the risk, and those are sadly lacking at the moment. ""At this stage in our review we are not recommending a ban, but a halt to procedures."" The pause can be lifted if certain checks and measures are met by March 2019, says the review team. This includes keeping a register of every procedure and any complications. To date, it's still unclear how many women have been adversely affected by mesh. The government is carrying out an audit to try to find out. Thehealth watchdog NICEhas already recommended that vaginal mesh operations for treating organ prolapse should largely be stopped in England. The use of vaginal mesh to treat urinary incontinence was not mentioned in the draft NICE guidelines, however. A number of Scottish health boards have already stopped using mesh implants altogether, andin Walesthe procedures are seen as a 'last resort'.

Kuenssberg: Opportunity for PM?,"Boris Johnson leaving the foreign secretary's official residence at Carlton Gardens in central London Where was the joker, the great cajoler, the political entertainer? For Boris Johnson, there was nothing funny about David Davis' resignation forcing him into an agonising choice. Stay in his job as he had intended to do and ""polish the turd"" - as he apparently so delicately put it - from inside government and risk ferocious criticism from the Brexiteers he used to delight? Or walk away - into quite what it is not clear - when his political stock is at a low after his controversial time as foreign secretary. Brexit dream dying, Johnson tells May Boris Johnson's legacy as foreign secretary As it happened: Johnson and Davis resign From watching the images of him leave his official residence for the last time, where he'd been holed up all day, he wore it heavily. No bellowed ""hello"" for the patient snappers. Leaving alongside his wife Marina Wheeler he looked not just a bit dishevelled, which is not exactly unusual, but pretty battered by events. It is not clear at all from his friends what his plan is next, or if he even has one. This time he has resigned, but when weighing up his options might think of his own words when he was booted out by Michael Howard years ago - ""My friends, as I have discovered myself, there are no disasters, only opportunities. And, indeed, opportunities for fresh disasters."" More importantly, is the prime minister looking at opportunity, or disaster? Boris Johnson told the PM she was suffocating Brexit ""dream"" in his resignation letter There are two entirely plausible scenarios. First, talk to the inner core of Brexiteers and the departures reveal the hollow betrayal of the prime minster's EU policy. There is simply no way that her policy is allowed to stand. And if she doesn't junk it, well, they will simply force her to. If she resists, they'll take her out rather than follow along. One Brexiteer MP tonight told me they have the numbers to make life impossible. Don't focus just on the idea of a no confidence vote. As things stand she would probably win one of them. But if Brexiteers start voting against government measures in the Commons on a regular basis they can simply block everything the PM tries to do which could, in time, force her out. They still have the numbers to do it. Maybe. Hunt replaces Johnson amid Brexit turmoil At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Here's the second possible version of events. While Monday's fiasco certainly looks to the outside world that the Tories are losing the plot, Theresa May has ended the day with a cabinet that is more loyal to her. A Parliamentary party where the majority want her Brexit compromise to succeed. Two of the colleagues who required a lot of time and effort are out of her way, while other Breixteers bound into her project having not resigned today. And former Remain rebels who had been causing huge amounts of trouble are mollified because, finally, after months of their urging, she has picked a side, and it is theirs. So, she ends a brutal day having scraped some of the barnacles off the boat, more able to forge ahead. Hmmm. Crucial to both those scenarios is how the EU responds to her compromise. If the EU starts being more flexible, Theresa May could start to earn back some authority. If they reject her compromise quick smart, what is the point of her colleagues defending her if there is no strategy left to defend? And the next steps of the departing duo matter too. Become friendly critics or the voices for simmering anger that's all around? We don't know yet and their decisions will matter too. So, in a terrible act of fence sitting, I will gladly write that it is possible that the government moved a step closer to total and utter meltdown and another general election. But it is also feasible that the mainstream majority in the Tory Party just found a stronger stride. For Theresa May, another day in power awaits, but she is not in complete control.

Who's who: May's new cabinet,"Theresa May has reshuffled her cabinet following the resignations of Dominic Raab and Esther McVey. Here is a guide to her new top team. Despite speculation that he would be sacked after the June 2017 General Election, Philip Hammond has remained chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. Mr Hammond was a Remain supporter in the EU referendum and is seen as one of the leading cabinet voices for a softer version of Brexit than that advocated by Leave supporting colleagues. He is known by some around Westminster as ""box office Phil"" for his perceived dull delivery. After becoming an MP in 2010, Sajid Javid has risen swiftly through the ranks of the Conservative Party and government to become the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background. Landing the job followingAmber Rudd's resignation,the son of Pakistani immigrants left behind his role as communities secretary. Mr Javid, a former executive at Deutsche Bank, has also had brief stints as business secretary and culture secretary. He stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the 2016 leadership contest, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM. Jeremy Hunt became foreign secretary after Boris Johnson resigned over Brexit policy in July 2018.  It meant an end to his marathon stint as health secretary, a job he took in David Cameron's 2012 reshuffle, having previously served as culture secretary. He weathered a number of controversies including a 2015 battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes. He is thought to have resisted an attempt by Theresa May to move him to another job in her January 2018 reshuffle and succeeded in adding responsibility for social care - something previously overseen by local government - to his portfolio. A major promotion for Stephen Barclay, 46, who becomes the third Brexit secretary in six months. Mr Barclay, who was previously a junior minister in the health and social care department, replaces Dominic Raab, who resigned in protest at Theresa May's draft EU withdrawal bill. Despite being regarded as a rising star Mr Barclay, who has served as MP for North East Cambridgeshire since 2010, was reportedly not Mrs May's first choice for the role, with Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox also in the frame. And the job has essentially been downgraded to focus on domestic preparations for the UK's departure, with Theresa May personally assuming responsibility for the remaining negotiations with the EU. A close ally of Theresa May, the former chief whip ruffled a few Tory feathers when he was handed the role of defence secretary in November 2017, with some claiming he lacked the experience for such a vital role. He replaced Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned amid allegations over his past conduct. The appointment was Mr Williamson's first cabinet post. The MP for South Staffordshire was elected to parliament in 2010, and was previously an aide to David Cameron. One of the government's great survivors, Chris Grayling has been in the cabinet since 2012, when he was made Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, before going on to serve as Commons leader. A leading voice in the Leave campaign, he was made transport secretary by Theresa May in July 2016. He defied predictions he would be sacked or moved in Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle, after attracting criticism over rising rail fares, Southern Rail's disrupted services and rail franchising difficulties. The former BBC and Channel 4 TV producer has been MP for Epsom and Ewell, in Surrey, since 2001. A veteran right winger and ardent Brexiteer, Liam Fox was put in charge of the newly-created department for international trade by Theresa May after she became PM, with the job of forging post-Brexit trade deals with other nations. He was David Cameron's first defence secretary but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas. Mr Fox - who was a GP before entering politics - stood in the 2016 leadership race against Theresa May, but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs. Michael Gove's was a dramatic comeback in June 2017, when the prime minister brought him back into cabinet as environment secretary. That was just a year after his ministerial ambitions appeared to be over when he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle which followed Mrs May's arrival as prime minister. Before that stint as justice secretary he had previously served as David Cameron's education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. His longtime friendship with Mr Cameron ended as he became probably the then cabinet's biggest name to decide to campaign for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit and initially backing him, Mr Gove withdrew his support for Mr Johnson as Tory leader mid-contest, choosing instead to stand himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third. A former protege of Theresa May at the Home Office, Karen Bradley was handed the role of culture secretary in Mrs May's first cabinet. Her time in that job was dominated by her decision to refer Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox's takeover bid for Sky to the media and competition regulators, something that will be at the top of her successor's in-tray. She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010. She replaces James Brokenshire as Northern Ireland Secretary,who resigned for health reasons David Gauke became the sixth justice secretary in six years - and the first solicitor to take the role - in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. His appointment breaks a run of four consecutive non-legally qualified MPs to hold the position of the government's chief law officer. He was previously work and pensions secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury. The former City lawyer has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005. Matt Hancock was promoted to become health secretary in the wake of the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson over Brexit policy. After only a few months as culture secretary, he got the call to move up the rankings to health when Jeremy Hunt was promoted from health to foreign secretary. Mr Hancock, who was close to the former chancellor George Osborne during the David Cameron years, is a former Bank of England economist has been MP for West Suffolk since 2010. He is the first MP in modern times to win a horse race, having raced to victory at Newmarket in August 2012. And his later appearances as culture secretary included attempting to moonwalk and jumping off a wall while having a go at parkour. Greg Clark is another minister who has survived the transition from the Cameron to the May years. In his case he has been business secretary since July 2016, after a year or so looking after the local government brief. It had been widely speculated that he was to be moved in the January 2018 reshuffle to make way for Jeremy Hunt - but it did not happen after the health secretary successfully argued the case to stay put. The Middlesbrough-born former business consultant, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, started his political journey as president of the Liberal Democrat student branch at Magdalene College, Cambridge. James Brokenshire returned to the cabinet following the reshuffle prompted by Amber Rudd's resignation as home secretary. The former Northern Ireland secretaryhad stepped down in Januarydue to ill health after being diagnosed with the early stages of lung cancer - but was back in Parliament a month later after ""recovering strongly"" from lung surgery. The former lawyer is a close ally of Theresa May, having served under her for five years at the Home Office. Jeremy Wright was promoted from attorney general to be the new culture secretary after Matt Hancock's promotion to health secretary in July 2018. The moves were in Theresa May's reshuffle in the wake of David Davis and Boris Johnson's Brexit resignations. A barrister specialising in criminal law, Mr Wright became an MP in 2005, serving in the whips office for the Conservatives under David Cameron from 2007 to 2012 before becoming a justice minister in 2012 and becoming attorney general in 2014. Penny Mordaunt: New International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt replaced Priti Patel in this role in November 2016, after Ms Patel resigned in the wake of disclosures that she had held a series of unofficial meetings with senior Israeli figures. Ms Mordaunt was previously minister of state for disabled people at the Department of Work and Pensions. She was minister for the armed forces under David Cameron, and had been considered a contender to replace Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary. Penny Mordaunt, elected to parliament in 2010 as MP for Portsmouth North, is also known for her strong support of Brexit. Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016 - her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation, headed by controversial journalist Toby Young, which runs the free schools programme. One of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be elected to the Commons in the June 2017 snap election. Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post of Scottish Secretary when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015. In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet minister. Amber Rudd returned to cabinet in November to replace Esther McVey as work and pensions secretary. Mrs Rudd resigned as home secretary in April amid a row over targets to remove illegal immigrants. A strong ally of Theresa May, Amber Rudd is known for her pro-EU views and has a reputation as being tough and capable. She has served as MP for Hastings and Rye since 2010 and was promoted swiftly during David Cameron's time in office. However the 2017 election saw her majority reduced to just 346, diminishing her prospects as a possible future leader. Damian Hinds got an unexpected promotion when he was drafted in to replace Justine Greening,who refused a move to the Department for Work and Pensionsin Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. The former management consultant was a Remain supporter and previously served as employment minister in the DWP and before that a junior Treasury minister and government whip. He has been MP for East Hampshire since May 2010. Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remained in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. The former banker and Welsh assembly member was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport. He became an MP in 2010. Former Commons Leader David Lidington replaced Damian Green, who resigned in December 2017 after misconduct allegations. The Remain supporter did not take on Mr Green's First Secretary of State title but will still play part of that role, standing in for Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions and chairing key cabinet Brexit committees. He is a former justice secretary and Europe minister. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto. The new Conservative Party chairman takes the title of minister without portfolio, allowing him to take a seat in the cabinet. He replaced Sir Patrick McLoughlin, who stood down as Tory chairman. The former housing minister briefly served as immigration minister before taking on the job of rebuilding the Tories' campaigning strength for the next general election. A former barrister and leader of Brentwood council, in Essex, he has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010.

Adler: The view from Brussels,"Brussels was not worried about David Davis (far right) leaving; the possibility Olly Robbins (far left) might depart was far more concerning David Davis's resignation was met with a collective shrug of the shoulders in Brussels on Monday. ""How can we miss a man who was never here?"", one EU source commented to me. The Brexit secretary made one visit to Brussels in the last four months. A far more familiar face here is Olly Robbins, the prime minister's Europe adviser. The EU is reassured that he's staying in his post - for now. But the mood in Brussels - especially after hearing this afternoon that Boris Johnson too was gone - is far from blasÃ©. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said Europe was deeply troubled not by British cabinet resignations, but by Brexit itself. ""Politicians come and go,"" he said. ""But the problems they have created for the people remain. The mess caused by Brexit is the biggest problem in the history of EU-UK relations. And it is still very far from being solved."" A sense of unease hangs heavy. Is it really leaving? 'I don't think so,' says Davis Profile of the ex-foreign secretary Brexit: All you need to know ""Theresa May is respected in Europe,"" one contact told me. ""But so many times since this Brexit process began, we've had to ask ourselves: will she stay or will she go? And now here we are again."" Political uncertainty in Britain makes the possibility of a no-deal Brexit seem far more likely in the eyes of Brussels bureaucrats. Not because either side want it, but because time for EU-UK negotiations - as the European Commission never tires of repeating - is simply running out. Boris Johnson also stepped down, making the possibility of a no-deal Brexit seem a little closer And if the prime minister does indeed survive, what then? Most EU sources I spoke to believe she will. One compared the prime minister to Germany's Angela Merkel and said both women were consistently under-estimated. Listen to Theresa May's impassioned address to Parliament today - promising a return to UK sovereignty after Brexit, yet simultaneously keeping close ties to Europe (no country with an EU association agreement has so far avoided signing up to binding relations), with frictionless trade and a close customs relationship that is not a customs union (honest), while remaining free to strike the UK's own trade deals. The EU is holding fire for now on her plan. Brexit misconceptions - as seen from Brussels EU wonders if Theresa May has run out of 'Brexit fudge' Brexit: Why Brussels seems relaxed about the end game Leaders are mindful of not wanting to further weaken Theresa May at home by rushing forward with their manifold objections - but it's just a matter of time. The next Brexit negotiating round is pencilled in for a week today. Now, Downing Street believes that the hot water the prime minister is in today will shock EU leaders into realising they need to start compromising themselves - not just perpetually demanding capitulations on the UK's red lines. Privately, key EU figures admit there will be some give from Brussels - eventually. But how much? Certainly not what would be needed to make Theresa May's proposed third way for Brexit work as she currently presents it. Brussels is quietly confident Theresa May will survive this crisis ""On the one hand, it's true what Downing Street says,"" one EU source told me. ""The UK is bigger than Norway and strategically, politically and economically more important to us than Switzerland, yes. But EU countries benefit more from keeping their club - the single market and customs union - intact, than they would do by compromising everything just for the sake of better bilateral relations with the UK after Brexit. You can forget it."" The EU definitely expects more concessions from Theresa May in negotiations if she wants what she describes as a deep and special partnership post Brexit. But the bottom line in Brussels is: hard or soft, Brexit must be done in time. Whether Theresa May or another is at the helm in the UK, EU diplomats say they need a leader who has to power to make a deal in Brussels and see it through back home. Otherwise, they believe a disorderly no-deal Brexit beckons - with all the consequences they think that will have in the UK and across the EU.

Divers push to complete Thai cave rescueA ninth boy emerges as divers push to complete the rescue of a football team from a flooded cave.Asia,"This video can not be played Rescue diver in Thai cave: ""I was very scared"" Nineteen divers have entered the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand on a gruelling, hazardous mission to rescue those people still trapped inside. They extracted a ninth boy on Tuesday, the Thai Navy said, with reports suggesting two more. If confirmed, one child and an adult remain to be rescued, bringing to a close an epic operation marred by one diver's death. Eight boys rescued earlier are said to be in good mental and physical health. The group, a football team, had got stuck deep inside on 23 June after heavy rains caused flooding. After they were found by divers last week, huddled in darkness on a ledge and cut off from the outside world for nine days, the race began to get them out before the weather deteriorated even further. The boys evacuated so far have undergone X-rays and blood tests. They will remain under observation in hospital for at least seven days. Latest on the cave rescue Who are the Thai boys trapped in a cave? How risky is the Thai boys rescue? A doctor and Thai Navy Seal divers have been looking after those still on the ledge, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave's mouth. It kicked off just after 10:00 local time (03:00 GMT) when the 19 divers made their way into the cave. Rain was falling but rescuers say the water level inside the cave is similar to that on Sunday, the first day of the operation, an official said. Thai Navy SEALs confirmed a ninth child had been brought out at 16:06,external. Helicopter and ambulance activity in the cave area, from which the media have been barred, suggests that at least two more members of the Wild Boars football team were rescued and were being ferried to hospital.

By Michelle Roberts, BBC News After the boys had spent so long in the cold and dark with poor ventilation and relatively little to eat and drink, there were concerns that they would be in a far worse state. Now that they are dry, warm and in safe care, full medical assessments can be done. None of the first eight has a fever - a sign of a possible infection - although two have needed antibiotic treatment for suspected lung infections. Doctors will be checking for any infections, such as ""caver's disease"", a lung disease caused by a fungus that grows in bat droppings. They will also make sure any cuts and scrapes that the boys have on their skin are clean and healing nicely. The boys remain in quarantine, meaning their parents will not be allowed any physical contact. This is partly to protect the boys from unnecessary infections until they regain their strength, as well as to prevent them passing on anything they might have picked up in the wet cave. They will need to build up their muscles and their immunity, as well as get used to living in the outside world again. For now, they wear shades to protect their eyes from the bright light. The first group of four boys was rescued on Sunday, followed by four more on Monday. The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June Some of the boys had low temperatures, with one showing a low heart rate when they were first taken to hospital, but they have now recovered. ""All eight are in good health, no fever... everyone is in a good mental state,"" Jesada Chokedamrongsuk, permanent secretary of the public health ministry, said at a news conference. The boys are currently being treated at the Chiang Rai Prachanukroh hospital Health officials say they were at first given instant food and energy gels but are now eating easy-to-digest food. They also say some of the boys have now seen their parents - but only through glass. Further test results are expected in a few days and if all signs of infection have cleared, families will be allowed to visit. However, they must don protective clothing and cannot go closer than 2m (6ft). However, Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, has been allowed to visit the boys. Allow Twitter content?

A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - have been working in the caves. They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system. Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers. The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. Wearing a full-face mask, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. The operation in pictures 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' Letters of love from trapped Thai boys The toughest part is about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be,a former Thai navy diver diedin the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen. This video can not be played Wife and father remember 'hero' Thai diver: ""He loved helping others"" The rescue mission chief said the second day of the operation had gone more smoothly than the first, taking two hours less as the procedure became more refined. A massive pumping operation is said to have helped lower the water level inside the cave system, making the journey in and out easier than it was. Aged between about 11 and 17 became trapped during an excursion with their coach. This video can not be played Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" Some details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. Captain Duganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-bornAdul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coachEkapol Chantawong,25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.

Krill companies limit Antarctic fishing,"Krill live in all the world's oceans, but mostly in the Antarctic. There may be up to 500 million tonnes of krill out there The overwhelming majority of krill companies are to stop fishing in vast areas of the Antarctic Peninsula. Krill are important because they are at the base of the food chain: whales, penguins, seals and squid all eat the tiny, shrimp-like crustaceans. Other species, such as albatross and killer whales are indirectly dependent. The decision of the krill fishing companies comes ahead of a meeting of the Antarctic Ocean Commission (CCAMLR). The summit in October will decide whether to adopt an EU proposal to create the biggest ocean reserve on Earth. 'Buy a trinket, condemn an elephant' Fossil of 'first giant' discovered The 'monster' berg: What happened next? The Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary would protect 1.8 million square kilometres in and around the Weddell Sea. The decision to stop krill fishing off the peninsula follows pressure by campaign groups, including Greenpeace. An EU proposal to create a wildlife reserve 1.8m sq km, or 200 times the size of Yellowstone National Park, will be considered by the Antarctic Ocean Commission when it meets in October Companies have been harvesting krill on a large scale since the 1970s. The crustaceans are now fished mainly for fish-farm feed and to meet the growing demand for Omega-3 oils and other health supplements. The animals also help to offset the effects of climate change, removing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their consumption of carbon-rich algae near the surface. The companies that have made this commitment represent around 85% of the krill fishing industry in the Antarctic. They will also support the establishment of ""buffer zones"" around breeding colonies of penguins, along with the scientific and political process for the creation of a network of large-scale marine protected areas around Antarctica. Kristine Hartmann from Aker BioMarine, the largest krill-fishing company in Antarctic waters, said: ""We are positive that our commitment will help ensure krill as a sustainable and stable source of healthy omega-3s for the future... through our commitment we are showing that it is possible for no-fish zones and sustainable fisheries to co-exist."" Frida Bengtsson of Greenpeace's Protect the Antarctic campaign, commented: ""The momentum for protection of the Antarctic's waters and wildlife is snowballing. ""A huge movement of people globally has been joined by scientists, governments, celebrities and now even the companies fishing in the Antarctic. This is a bold and progressive move."" The krill-fishing companies are in favour of creating ""buffer zones"" around breeding colonies of penguins to protect wildlife She said the ""eyes of the world"" would be on those making the decision on the creation of the ocean sanctuary. The Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem, who recently travelled to the Antarctic with Greenpeace, said: ""Thank god there's some good news. This is amazing. What I hope that will happen is that it won't just end up like this; it will create an echo for the future."" Dr Phil Trathan OBE, from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), said that the UK had made an appeal to CCAMLR in 2016 for the organisation to ban krill fishing in coastal zones around the Antarctic Peninsula. He said: ""CCAMLR has yet to take such a step, so it is to be welcomed that the majority of krill companies have decided to take these voluntary steps."" Peter Andrews, head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, commented:  ""This will make a real difference to the protection of Antarctic waters and wildlife."" A spokesperson for WWF said: ""The accelerating impact of humanity on fragile ocean ecosystems, including from climate change, makes this commitment to Antarctic protection all the more timely."" According to the Pew Charitable Trusts it was, ""a truly visionary step that more commercial fishing interests in Antarctica and around the world should follow"". However, Dr Susanne Lockhart, Antarctic benthic specialist at the California Academy of Scientists, sounded a note of caution. She said the announcement was great news, ""but there are other industries in the region as well. We still have toothfish and icefish fisheries. To see them make the same policy would be important.""

Deprivation 'should count for university',"The university access watchdog says students' backgrounds should be taken into account when awarding places, to improve ""equality of opportunity"". A-level grades are a ""robust measure"" only if the applicants' ""context"" is also considered, Chris Millward says. Many universities give extra help to disadvantaged applicants - but a report warns of a lack of openness about how this operates. All Russell Group universities use some form of ""contextual admissions"". Top universities have faced accusations of being socially exclusive and recruiting too few applicants from ethnic minorities. But they also face scrutiny for being unfair to individual applicants who might lose out on places to disadvantaged candidates with worse results. A report from the Fair Education Alliance campaign group says there needs to be much more transparency about how universities use the background of applicants when making offers and awarding places. 'Ditch predicted grades' from university applications 'I want to be the first in my family to go to university' How diverse are universities? The campaign group, of more than 100 education and business organisations, says this can include taking into account family income, whether an applicant lives in a deprived area or if they attended a school with poor exam results or where few pupils go on to university. There might be extra consideration given to applications from disadvantaged pupils or they might be offered places on lower grades. But the report says there needs to be much more clarity about these decisions and how different forms of disadvantage are defined. Research for the report, carried out by the University of Exeter, shows the extent of the challenge - with figures showing how few places in 2016 were awarded to applicants from areas with few young people going to university. The University of Cambridge had only 3% of entrants from such ""low participation neighbourhoods"", the University of Bristol 3.7%, Oxford 4.6% and Exeter 5.3%. Mr Millward, the Office for Students' director of fair access and participation, said: ""We are a long way from equality of opportunity in relation to access to higher education."" Universities are in charge of their own admissions, so the fair access director can encourage but not instruct. But Mr Millward said: ""An ambitious approach to contextual admissions must be central to our strategy if we are going to make progress on access at the scale and pace necessary to meet the expectations of government, students and the wider public. ""A-level grades can only be considered to be a robust measure of potential if they are considered alongside the context in which they are achieved,"" he said. Sarah Stevens, of the Russell Group, said that all of its universities used ""contextual data"" in some form. ""Qualifications and predicted grades are a key indicator of academic ability - but universities take a range of other factors into account to understand the applicant's achievements in context,"" she said. ""This includes the school or college attended, where a student grew up, whether they are a care leaver, or whether they are the first in their family to enter higher education.""

Prisoners to get phones in their cells,"The government is announcing a Â£30m package to improve safety, security and decency in jails Thousands of prisoners will be able to make calls from their cells, as part of government plans to reduce violence and crime in prisons in England and Wales. The move is part of a Â£30m package of measures to be announced later today by Justice Secretary David Gauke. The scheme, already in place at 20 prisons, is to be extended to a further 20 over the next two years. Most prisoners currently queue for public phones which can be a trigger for violence, the government said. It can also fuel the demand for illicit mobile phones, the Ministry of Justice added. Less violence at 'phones in cell' jail Prisons 'awash' with smuggled phones Why do mobile phones still work in jail? Mr Gauke will make a speech announcing government plans to invest Â£7m to install in-cell phones, which will be subject to strict security measures. All calls, which will continue to be paid for by prisoners, will be recorded and they must be to phone numbers on an approved list. The proposal is based on Lord Farmer's report last year that found good family relationships are ""indispensable"" to the government's prison reform plans. Improving prisoners' ability to maintain ties with relatives after they are jailed is seen as a key factor in reducing the reoffending rates. HMP Altcourse in Liverpool, one of the prisons which already installs phones in cells, was praised earlier this year by the chief inspector of prisonsfor ""bucking the trend"" of rising violence. The government announcement was welcomed by John McLaughlin, director of the privately-run Oakwood in Wolverhampton, which also permits calls from some of its cells. He said: ""Anything that enhances the contact between a prisoner and his family or loved ones is vital. ""I've worked in prisons where telephony is available on the landings, there's a queuing system, people can't get the contact with their loved ones at the appropriate time of day."" Justice Secretary David Gauke will announce the plans in a speech later As part of the Â£30m package aimed at improving safety, security and decency in jails, ministers will also unveil a new intelligence system for assessing the risks posed by offenders behind bars. Every prisoner will be given a ""risk rating"" according to their chances of taking part in violence, escapes, disturbances and gang activity. The new digital tool - which compiles data from law enforcement databases and prison incident reports - is being extended across the prison service after a pilot in 16 jails. It has already identified 12 prolific criminals for transfer to more secure prisons. About 6,500 prisoners are estimated by authorities to have links to organised crime in England and Wales. Mr Gauke's announcement comes a day before the publication of the annual report by the chief inspector of prisons.

A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman confirmed her departure - ""for medical treatment, in accordance with her own will"" - but said it had nothing to do with this week's visit to Germany by China's Premier Li Keqiang. Photos later showed her smiling on arrival in Helsinki en route to the German capital. Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing Even under effective house arrest and in declining health, Liu Xia was a threat to the Chinese Communist Party. As the widow of a Nobel Peace Prize winner who'd died in Chinese custody, the authorities here feared that the poet would speak out. Liu Xia (right) with Liu Xiaobo in 2002 She had never been charged with a crime and yet had guards permanently posted right outside her door and also at the gates to her housing compound. They were there to stop her from leaving and to prevent journalists, diplomats and supporters from visiting. The Chinese government had always maintained that she was as free as any citizen here but - after eight years being denied permission to leave her house as she pleased - her physical and mental wellbeing were deteriorating. The fear was that she, like Liu Xiaobo, might die in captivity. Finally, in the days approaching the first anniversary of her husband's death, a sustained diplomatic effort, led mainly by Germany, has worked and she has realised her dream to get out. She took a Finnair flight from Beijing to Berlin at 11:00 local time (03:00 GMT) on Tuesday, a friend, Ye Du, told news agencies. While there was no immediate comment from its embassy, Germany had been urging China to allow Mrs Liu to leave. This video can not be played Liu Xiaobo: China's most influential dissident Western diplomats reportedly tried to visit Mrs Liu at her Beijing flat in May but were refused entry. News of her departure comes three days before the anniversary of her husband's death. In May,she told her friend Liao Yiwu by phone that it was ""easier to die than live"". ""I've got nothing to be afraid of,"" she was quoted as saying. ""If I can't leave, I'll die in my home. Xiaobo is gone, and there's nothing in the world for me now."" Liu Xia with a picture of her husband last year Mr Liao also uploaded a recording of a phone conversation he had had in April with Mrs Liu, where she can be heard crying and saying: ""I'm ready to die here."" Chinese authorities had maintained the dissident's widow was a free citizen but she had faced restrictions on her movements and had been kept under surveillance. Patrick Poon, China Researcher at the human rights groups Amnesty International, said it was ""wonderful news that Liu Xia is finally free and that her persecution and illegal detention at the hands of the Chinese authorities has come to an end"". He added: ""The Chinese authorities tried to silence her, but she stood tall for human rights."" Amnesty further called for an end to the harassment of Liu Xia's family who remained in China. ""It would be most callous of the Chinese authorities to use Liu Xia's relatives to put pressure on Liu Xia to prevent her from speaking out in future,"" its researcher added.

It's been a busy day, so here's a recap on the main developments.  Angela Merkel welcomes the UK's Chequers agreement, saying it is a ""good thing we have proposals on the table"". The German Chancellor says the remaining 27 EU members will agree a ""common response"" once it has seen the detail of the official UK position. But she says progress is being made and repeats her stance that her country wants as close links as possible with the UK after Brexit. Theresa May is asked about Donald Trump's claims that the UK is in turmoil, ahead of his visit on Thursday, and whether the US President is a real fan of Boris Johnson. The PM does not comment directly but says she is looking forward to Mr Trump's visit, saying there is ""much to discuss"". She says the special relationship with the US is the UK's deepest and longest security and defence alliance. The two leaders, she adds, will talking about how to use this to benefit the UK and US but also enhance the wider good.  But who do these shoes belong to? The answer: British Prime Minister Theresa May, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama and Montenegro's Prime Minister Dusko Markovic. Theresa May is now speaking at the conclusion of the Western Balkans summit in central London. She says claims that, as a result of Brexit, the UK will be ""retreating"" from its role as a guarantor of peace in the region and on the continent as a whole are completely wrong. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is now speaking. Brexit is almost certain to crop up during questions.  In his letter resigning as a Tory vice-chair, Remain voter Ben Bradley writes that he was persuaded to back the Brexit vision because of the ""immense opportunities that are available from global trade, and for the ability
for Britain to be an outward looking nation in control of our own destiny once
again"". But he complains: ""I fear that this agreement at Chequers damages those opportunities; that being tied to EU regulations, and the EU tying our hands when seeking to make new trade agreements, will be the worst of all worlds if we do not deliver Brexit in spirit as well as in name. ""Then we are handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10."" MPs have decisively rejected Liberal Democrat calls for a ""People's Vote"" on the final Brexit deal. A Commons motion put forward by Sir Vince Cable's party was defeated by 299 votes to 13 in Parliament. Aside from nine Lib Dem MPs, the other MPs to support it were Green Party leader Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's three MPs. Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein, a close friend of David Cameron, takes issue with some of the arguments made by Ben Bradley or Maria Caulfield in their resignation letters. In short, he seems to be saying the UK has a choice between the Chequers compromise or no deal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One of Maria Caulfield's main objections had been to the backstop agreement for Northern Ireland - that's the customs arrangement designed to avoid a ""hard border"" - which she felt was ""neither necessary or
constructive for the future prosperity of the UK"". ""The policy may assuage vested interests but the voters will find out and their
representatives will be found out,"" she wrote in her resignation letter as Conservative vice-chair. ""This policy will be bad for our country and
bad for the party. The direct consequences of that will be Prime Minister
Corbyn."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, speaking in New York, added that many models of co-operation with Brussels were available to the UK, including a ""Norway"" deal, ""Norway plus"" or an ""ambitious"" version of the Canada deal, and that each deal had ""its own balance of rights and negotiations"". However, he said the UK's current red lines meant they were ""closing the door"" to many different types of co-operation. Michel Barnier, who's leading Brexit negotiations on behalf of Brussels, has said there is accord on 80% of the UK withdrawal
agreement and that the European Union was ready to start working on an ""ambitious free trade arrangement"" with the UK. Speaking
in New York, Mr Barnier said that negotiators still needed to find a solution
to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. In
response to recent resignations in Westminster, Mr Barnier said he had a
""very cordial and frank relationship"" with David Davis and had met
""many people with different views"" during the course of the
negotiations. BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Grassroots club coach Ormond, 62,was jailed last weekafter being convicted of a string of sex abuse offences spanning 25 years. Mr Chilton said: ""To me he was God. Your trust is implicit in him."" Newcastle Crown Court heard he used his ""position of power"" to abuse 18 boys and young men between 1973 and 1998. He wasconvicted of 35 chargesof indecent assault and one of indecency. George Ormond was also jailed in 2002 for sex offences Ormond coached a grassroots football team, as well as becoming involved with youth teams at Newcastle United, volunteering as a kit man, bus driver and general helper. Mr Chilton said: ""He promised an awful lot, which I'm sure he does to everybody. He tries to build up young lads, get their confidence, but also builds up a level of trust."" He reported the abuse after seeing a former team mate speaking on BBC's Look North in 2016 following Ormond's earlier conviction. ""Before I knew it Derek Bell, who was a team mate of mine, was in front of me telling me about the abuse that he had experienced.

Damages for woman harassed for 12 years,"Paul Curran's campaign against Lindsey Goldrick Dean involved creating at least 10 websites about her, including offensive and private information A woman who was harassed for 12 years by a man she met through an online dating website is to receive damages. Paul Curran's campaign against Lindsey Goldrick Dean involved creating at least 10 websites about her containing offensive and private information. The High Court in London heard it had adversely affected her health, relationships and professional career. The court also heard Mr Curran had agreed to pay undisclosed damages to Ms Goldrick Dean and her legal costs. Ms Goldrick Dean, a former marketing consultant from Somerset, met Mr Curran, director of Curran Consulting Ltd, through a newspaper dating website in 2004. Counsel Gervase de Wilde told the court Mr Curran ""engaged in a course of conduct"" after their relationship ended in February 2005 which amounted to ""civil harassment"". Between March 2005 and August 2017 the company director created at least 10 websites, some of which were named after Ms Goldrick Dean. The sites' content caused Ms Goldrick Dean ""enormous anxiety, mental distress and embarrassment"", the court heard. In 2014, Mr Curran bought a Google banner advertisement which included a photo of Ms Goldrick Dean and a link to one of the websites. A year later, he created two Twitter accounts using her name which he used to post messages containing her photo and a website link. Mr de Wilde said the campaign - which included emails, telephone calls and posts sent to Ms Goldrick Dean, her family and friends - continued despite her complaining to police on several occasions. The police made plans to arrest Mr Curran but found that he was living outside the UK much of the time. In a statement Mr Curran, who was not in court, said he did not dispute ""the majority"" of allegations and apologised to Ms Goldrick Dean. After the hearing, Ms Goldrick Dean said she was ""so glad it's all over"".

Novichok pair had high dose - police,"This video can not be played Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu says police will do everything to bring those responsible to justice A woman who died after being exposed to the nerve agent Novichok in Wiltshire is believed to have had a ""high dose"" of the substance, police have said. Mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess, 44, died on Sunday evening after falling ill in Amesbury on 30 June. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, 45, who was also exposed to the nerve agent, remains critically ill in hospital. Police are continuing to hunt for a contaminated container which they believe was handled by the pair. The BBC understands Mr Rowley's flat in Amesbury is regarded as the key location in the search. A team wearing hazmat suits is combing the small flat, working in 30-minute shifts because of the heat. Wiltshire Police said on Monday night that a car had been moved from Swindon in relation to the investigation - but stressed that ""the public should not be alarmed"". Allow Twitter content?

A murder inquiry has been launched into Ms Sturgess's death and a post-mortem examination is due to take place. Home Secretary Sajid Javid chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra on Monday and later addressed MPs. He told them the death of Ms Sturgess ""strengthens our resolve to find out exactly what happened and who is behind it"". What are Novichok agents? Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Mr Javid said scientists had not yet been able to determine if the nerve agent in the latest poisoning was from the same batch as that used earlier this year in Salisbury. Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliafell ill after being poisoned with Novichok in Salisbury.Ms Skripal was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital in April, and her father in May. A police officer, Det Sgt Nick Bailey, wasalso left seriously illafter responding to the attack on the Skripals and spent nearly three weeks in hospital. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley touched an unknown contaminated item with their hands, police say Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head UK counter-terrorism policing which is leading the investigation, said he was ""unable to say"" if the incident in Amesbury is linked to the poisoning of the Skripals on 3 March - but it is their ""main line of inquiry"". Mr Basu said: ""In the four months since the Skripals and Nick Bailey were poisoned, no other people besides Dawn and Charlie have presented with symptoms, but their reaction was so severe it resulted in Dawn's death and Charlie being critically ill. This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse ""This means they must have got a high dose and our hypothesis is that they must have handled a container that we are now seeking."" It is understood the couple each had nerve agent on one of their hands. Ms Sturgess, from Durrington, was rushed to hospital on Saturday 30 June after becoming ill at a house in Muggleton Road in Amesbury. She has two sons, aged 19 and 23, and an 11-year-old daughter. Theresa May said she was ""appalled and shocked"" by her death. Speaking to MPs in the House of Commons, she also paid tribute to the ""dedication of the staff"" at Salisbury District Hospital and thanked them for their ""tireless work"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs: ""The simple reality is that Russia has committed an attack on British soil which has seen the death of a British citizen. ""That is something that I think the world will unite with us in actually condemning."" Tributes were left to Ms Sturgess, who has three children Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ""deeply concerned"" about the incident in Amesbury - but said accusations that it was involved are ""absurd"". The UK government previously blamed Russia for the poisoning of the Skripals in March and say the nerve agent used was a type developed by Russia. Russian authorities denied any involvement in the poisoning. Mr Basu said detectives will continue with their ""painstaking and meticulous work to gather all the available evidence"". ByGordon Corera, BBC security correspondent A hundred detectives are already working round the clock to try to establish how Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were contaminated by Novichok. Swabs taken from them in hospital revealed the highest level of contamination on their hands, leading to the theory they picked something up. It may well be that it was Dawn who came into first contact and Charlie received secondary contamination from her but that remains to be confirmed. The priority now is working out what that item was and where it is now. Read more here. Officers have found a red Ford Transit van which Mr Rowley travelled in with three other men before falling ill. The vehicle has been sent to the government's military research facility Porton Down. Three men who also travelled in the van have shown no sign of being exposed to Novichok. Meanwhile, the bus that Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley used the night before they collapsed has tested negative for Novichok. Public Health England said the risk to the general public ""remains low""but warned people,externalnot to pick up ""any strange items such as needles, syringes or unusual containers"". They have also offered advice for people who may have visited one of five areas identified by police. Those locations are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury, and John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Anyone who was there between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 on 30 Juneshould continue to follow advice,external, including washing their clothes in a washing machine, keeping other items double-bagged and securely fastened if they are dry-clean only. Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard said the news of Ms Sturgess's death would ""send a huge shockwave across our communities"" but stressed that ""the risk to the wider public remains low"". He praised residents for their ""continual strength and resilience"" during ""these challenging times"". Friday 29 June 12:20 - Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley are together at John Baker House, Salisbury. They leave to visit Salisbury and later go to Queen Elizabeth Gardens. They return to John Baker House at 16:20. 22:00 - The couple catch a bus to Amesbury. Police believe they then spend the night at Mr Rowley's home on Muggleton Road.

Krill companies cut Antarctic fishing,"Krill live in all the world's oceans, but mostly in the Antarctic. There may be up to 500 million tonnes of krill out there The overwhelming majority of krill companies are to stop fishing in vast areas of the Antarctic Peninsula. Krill are important because they are at the base of the food chain: whales, penguins, seals and squid all eat the tiny, shrimp-like crustaceans. Other species, such as albatross and killer whales are indirectly dependent. The decision of the krill fishing companies comes ahead of a meeting of the Antarctic Ocean Commission (CCAMLR). The summit in October will decide whether to adopt an EU proposal to create the biggest ocean reserve on Earth. 'Buy a trinket, condemn an elephant' Fossil of 'first giant' discovered The 'monster' berg: What happened next? The Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary would protect 1.8 million square kilometres in and around the Weddell Sea. The decision to stop krill fishing off the peninsula follows pressure by campaign groups, including Greenpeace. An EU proposal to create a wildlife reserve 1.8m sq km, or 200 times the size of Yellowstone National Park, will be considered by the Antarctic Ocean Commission when it meets in October Companies have been harvesting krill on a large scale since the 1970s. The crustaceans are now fished mainly for fish-farm feed and to meet the growing demand for Omega-3 oils and other health supplements. The animals also help to offset the effects of climate change, removing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their consumption of carbon-rich algae near the surface. The companies that have made this commitment represent around 85% of the krill fishing industry in the Antarctic. They will also support the establishment of ""buffer zones"" around breeding colonies of penguins, along with the scientific and political process for the creation of a network of large-scale marine protected areas around Antarctica. Kristine Hartmann from Aker BioMarine, the largest krill-fishing company in Antarctic waters, said: ""We are positive that our commitment will help ensure krill as a sustainable and stable source of healthy omega-3s for the future... through our commitment we are showing that it is possible for no-fish zones and sustainable fisheries to co-exist."" Frida Bengtsson of Greenpeace's Protect the Antarctic campaign, commented: ""The momentum for protection of the Antarctic's waters and wildlife is snowballing. ""A huge movement of people globally has been joined by scientists, governments, celebrities and now even the companies fishing in the Antarctic. This is a bold and progressive move."" The krill-fishing companies are in favour of creating ""buffer zones"" around breeding colonies of penguins to protect wildlife She said the ""eyes of the world"" would be on those making the decision on the creation of the ocean sanctuary. The Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem, who recently travelled to the Antarctic with Greenpeace, said: ""Thank god there's some good news. This is amazing. What I hope that will happen is that it won't just end up like this; it will create an echo for the future."" Dr Phil Trathan OBE, from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), said that the UK had made an appeal to CCAMLR in 2016 for the organisation to ban krill fishing in coastal zones around the Antarctic Peninsula. He said: ""CCAMLR has yet to take such a step, so it is to be welcomed that the majority of krill companies have decided to take these voluntary steps."" Peter Andrews, head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, commented:  ""This will make a real difference to the protection of Antarctic waters and wildlife."" A spokesperson for WWF said: ""The accelerating impact of humanity on fragile ocean ecosystems, including from climate change, makes this commitment to Antarctic protection all the more timely."" According to the Pew Charitable Trusts it was, ""a truly visionary step that more commercial fishing interests in Antarctica and around the world should follow"". However, Dr Susanne Lockhart, Antarctic benthic specialist at the California Academy of Scientists, sounded a note of caution. She said the announcement was great news, ""but there are other industries in the region as well. We still have toothfish and icefish fisheries. To see them make the same policy would be important.""

Deadline to reunite US migrants extended,"Migrant families in McAllen, Texas wait to be processed A US judge has given the Trump administration more time to reunite migrant children aged five or younger with their parents. The decision came after a government lawyer said more than half of the 102 young children may be back with parents by the original deadline of Tuesday. They are among more than 2,300 children separated from parents prosecuted for illegally crossing the border. The adults say they have fled poverty and gang violence in Central America. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that after viewing a list of the 102 children under the age of five in the government's care, ""it appears likely that less than half will be reunited"" by the 10 July deadline. However, during a hearing on Monday, Department of Justice lawyer Sarah Fabian said 54 of the children should be back with their parents by Tuesday. At the hearing in San Diego Judge Dana Sabraw agreed that some cases ""will necessitate additional time"" for reunification. Immigration authorities have offered little information about reunification or what comes next. Lawyers have described migrant toddlers clambering on court desks during hearings, forced to appear in court alone while their parents are detained. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Los Angeles has rejected the Trump administration's request to allow the long-term detention of illegal immigrant children. Under a 1997 agreement, child migrants can only be detained for 20 days. Judge Dolly Gee said the administration's request to extend that limit was "" a cynical attempt"" to shift immigration policymaking to the courts. Pamela Florian, a lawyer withThe Florence Project,external, an Arizona non-profit providing legal and social services to detained immigrant families, told the BBC the family separation policy led to ""a huge increase in the number of younger children"" coming through the system. ""Now we're seeing toddlers, we're seeing babies,"" she says. Last week, the government offered the following information: 16 children have not yet been matched to parents 19 parents have already been released into the US 46 parents are being held in custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Two parents have been judged unfit for release On Twitter, immigration lawyers have shared their experiences representing young children who cannot properly explain their situation, let alone navigate legal proceedings.

Fellow Florence Project attorney Maite Garcia currently represents four- and six-year-old siblings from Mexico whose mother is in custody, awaiting her asylum hearing. The six-year-old is blind, but has been working with Ms Garcia since her younger brother is nonverbal - ""in part because he's traumatised"", according to Ms Garcia. ""She's finally understanding after many, many meetings that she risks deportation and so now she's more frightened than ever of returning. ""She's been able to confide to me that she's fleeing violence in her home country and doesn't want to return because she's afraid of, as she puts it, 'bad things happening'"". Migrant families being moved to other immigration facilities in Texas Oregon lawyer Lisa LeSage from the nonprofit Immigration Counseling Service (ICS) firm says the children often do not even know what a lawyer is. ""Often times with the young children, they might be crawling around or playing with a pen,"" Ms LeSage told the BBC of her in-court experiences. ""Even a five year old who wasn't traumatised can't always tell you their address or what their parents look like or their last names. How do you expect a child to do all that?"" ICS currently has around five children they have confirmed were separated from their parents at the border, but the numbers keep changing. ""This is not something that the kids or their parents will ever get over,"" Ms LeSage says. ""I can say across the country, we know of cases where parents have already been deported."" ""It's a horrific situation right now, there's really no other word for it."" Much of the confusion around reunification stems from the fact that adults and children go through two separate immigration systems controlled by two different agencies. Adults must go through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) while children classified as unaccompanied minors are in the care of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). This video can not be played Cisary Reynaud has not spoken to his daughter since they were separated Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ), has volunteered with juvenile immigration cases in Los Angeles for years. She told the BBC the current migrant crisis has exacerbated the existing challenges of handling children's cases. ""It makes it even more difficult for the attorneys and for the court to ensure fundamental fairness because we need to ensure the proper adults are involved to fully protect the child's interests,"" she says. ""These are not unaccompanied children,"" Judge Tabaddor says. ""They are turned into an unaccompanied child when separated."" She added that now, many parents are ""agreeing to whatever the government is asking for, to get their children back"".

Press Secretary Sarah Sanders later echoed Mr Trump's comments. ""Just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean you aren't receiving due process,"" Ms Sanders said. Judge Tabaddor of the NAIJ said the organisation ""respectfully disagree[s]"". ""Due process and these situations require a person to present their case before an independent decision maker,"" she says. ""Once they're here and they express a fear of going back, they are entitled to come before an immigration judge."" An El Salvadorean migrant and his 10-year-old son were reunited last month after being separated while he was detained Ms Garcia called any rollback on due process protections ""a step in the wrong direction"". ""Reunification is absolutely important. We advocate for the release of these families together - not family detention,"" she says. ""However, all of that shouldn't be more important than returning them to their countries without due process and without access to counsel."" Since immigration cases are civil cases, legal counsel is not automatically provided. For migrants, finding legal representation can be next to impossible without help from non-profit organisations. A Honduran mother and her two-year-old daughter wait on the Mexico side of the border after being denied entry into the US Judge Tabaddor says if immigration cases for children are pushed through before reunification, parents could unintentionally lose legal rights to their child. ""If the child ends up having to go through official foster care guardianship through the special immigrant juvenile visa, one of the things that has to be demonstrated is abandonment, abuse or neglect. If the court finds that, then the parent-child relationship is severed, at least for immigration purposes."" But staff at the Florence Project told the BBC it's still too early to worry about court rulings. For now, ensuring migrant families have access to legal counsel and trauma care are the primary concerns.

Thanks to Ben Collins for his sterling effort in the earlier part of the day. But thankfully, we have some football today. France v Belgium in the first semi-final kicks off at 19:00 BST. Coverage on BBC One gets under way at 18:30 BST, while BBC Radio 5 live will be live from Saint Petersburg. And of course, Tom Rostance is in the chair with ourlive text coverage. #bbcfootball or text 81111 Ashwin Kumar:I wanted him at Manchester United. Ready made captain and tireless goal scorer. As a Manchester United fan I cannot believe that he is joining Juventus.  Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo is set to join Juventus, becoming one of the four most expensive players of all time. A deal worth 112m euros (Â£99.2m) has been reached between the two clubs that will see the Portuguese sign a four-year deal with the Italian champions. Ronaldo, 33, won four Champions League titles in his nine years at Real. ""The time has come to open a new stage in my life, that's why I asked the club to accept transferring me,"" he said. The top two world record transfer fees have been paid out by Paris St-Germain - the Â£200m they paid Barcelona for Brazil forward Neymar last August, and the fee of around Â£166m for France forward Kylian Mbappe in July after a successful season on loan with PSG. Barcelona also paid Liverpool Â£142m for Brazil midfielder Philippe Coutinho in January. For Juventus, the fee they will pay for Ronaldo is set to eclipse the Â£75.3m they paid for forward Gonzalo Higuain from Napoli in July 2016. Read the full storyhere. James HorncastleEuropean football writer Juventus were made aware a few weeks ago that Cristiano Ronaldo might be available on favourable terms. Ronaldo had a buyout clause worth $1bn (Â£886m) and Juventus were told Real Madrid were willing to accept Â£100m and Juventus were willing to pursue that even though it would mean restructuring their wage system. We heard yesterday Juventus president, Andrea Agnelli, boarded a plane and then got a helicopter to see Ronaldo on holiday in Greece, and it looks as though the deal is done. They are calling it the deal of the century in Italy. Juventus have reached the Champions League final twice in the last four years and lost both. One of those defeats was to Ronaldo's Real Madrid. He scored in the final in Cardiff and he knocked them out in the quarters this year. They believe he is the difference and the player who could achieve the Champions League with Juventus for the first time in 23 years. Winning the trophy has been an obsession for them. This is much more than about football it's about them going to the next level as a business. When Deloitte ranked the 10 richest clubs in the world earlier this year, Juventus were only 10th. They believe by being able to leverage and monetising some of his followers on social media and his commercial deals, will help them close the gap financially on Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United. The Italians are confident there could be an announcement this evening, although the finer details of the deal would take a few more days. Juventus' share prices on the stock exchange sky-rocketed by 33%. BBC Radio 5 live Italian football expert James Horncastle, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live:""Real would be reluctant to lose Cristiano Ronaldo without a replacement in hand. ""They have been linked with Neymar, who joined PSG for a world record fee last season, and their flirting with the Brazilian appears to have put Ronaldo's nose out of joint at Madrid. ""We don't know who is being lined up, be it Kylian Mbappe, Eden Hazard or Harry Kane."" Juventus say the deal for 33-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo is for four years. #bbcfootball or text 81111 Bezaleel AdewumiI cannot believe this. I'm still dumbfounded. Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus.

Despite their dominance in Europe's premier club competition, Real Madrid struggled domestically, finishing 17 points behind champions Barcelona last season. Real are keen on reshaping their team under new manager Julen Lopetegui and the 33-time La Liga winners have also been linked with a move for Paris St-Germain's 26-year-old Brazil forward Neymar. However, it would be a controversial move as Neymar spent four years at Real's fierce rivals Barcelona before joining Paris St-Germain in a world record transfer of Â£200m last summer. Real have also been linked with a move for another PSG forward, Kylian Mbappe, the 19-year-old who has helped France reach the semi-finals of the World Cup.

How Pickford became England's number one,"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Jordan Pickford makes three excellent saves to keep England's dream alive World Cup semi-final: Croatia v England Venue: Luzhniki Stadium, MoscowDate: Wednesday, 11 July (19:00 BST) Coverage: Full match commentary on BBC Radio 5 live, text commentary, report and highlights on BBC Sport app and online England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford's reputation and profile has soared at this World Cup. The 24-year-old followed up his penalty shootout heroics in the last-16 tie against Colombia with another stellar display on Saturday to help Gareth Southgate's side overcome Sweden and reach their first World Cup semi-final for 28 years. In the space of a year he has gone from Premier League relegation with home-town club Sunderland to the national team's undisputed number one. So how has the now Everton keeper emerged as a key component of an England side 90 minutes away from their first World Cup final since 1966? Pick your England XI to face Croatia Reaching last four 'an incredible feeling' - Southgate 'England in semi-finals - it's not meant to be this comfortable' It's emotional - pundits react Pickford, who had worked with Southgate at England Under-21 level, was pencilled in as his manager's number one long before this World Cup - but he has still played only 156 league games in his career. He came to prominence in June 2017 when Everton paid Sunderland Â£30m for him, happily meeting the Black Cats' asking price as a serious investment for the future. This video can not be played 'Semi-finals? I wasn't born in 1990, so I will take that' - Pickford But Pickford had proved willing to go out and learn his trade in the toughest surroundings before playing in the Premier League - an experience that moulded the confident, strong character we have witnessed in Russia. He had the rough edges knocked off him in non-league football with Darlington and Alfreton, where no allowances were made for youth, and he recalls: ""I learned quite a lot from getting battered by fully grown blokes. You got really battered going for crosses. ""You'd go to away grounds and hear everything shouted at you. I remember being at Southport going for a drink of water and one old bloke shouts 'hey you lad - your grandad is under that grass.' I just turned around, gave him the thumbs-up and said 'nae problem.'"" Pickford, who also had loan spells in the English Football League with Burton, Carlisle, Bradford and Preston, has had his size questioned - he is relatively short for a modern goalkeeper at 6ft 1in - but no-one can question his courage. And the agility and elasticity that have served England so well in Russia have made a nonsense of worries about his height. Pickford in Premier League action against future England team-mate Dele Alli while he was at Sunderland in 2016 When Pickford returned from his nomadic existence to his beloved Sunderland, he walked into a club in freefall from Premier League to League One - and even since his big-money move to Everton, he has not had it easy. He was Sunderland's stand-out performer when they were relegated from the top tier in 2016-17, making 135 saves from 185 shots on target with a save ratio of 72.97%. Season Team Saves Shots on target faced Goals conceded Save percentage 2017-18 Everton 121 178 58 67.42 2016-17 Sunderland 135 185 50 72.97 2015-16 Sunderland 11 17 6 64.71 The move to Everton under then manager Ronald Koeman was meant to be the start of a vastly more pressurised life - but with perhaps fewer saves to make - at elite level for Pickford. Everton, however, went into almost instant meltdown under the Dutchman before he was replaced by Sam Allardyce - but in a season of almost unrelenting misery, Pickford was head and shoulders above every other player. It was these performances that persuaded Southgate, a regular visitor to Everton games last season, to give him his debut in the friendly against Germany at Wembley in November 2017 before selecting him as his World Cup goalkeeper in Russia. Everton's end-of-season awards were a Pickford procession as he picked up Player Of The Season, Young Player Of The Season and Players' Player Of The Season. His signing was a rare success for Everton's sacked director of football Steve Walsh. Everton needed a goalkeeper and Pickford was Walsh's first and only pick - he pressed hard to sign him, he said, as he feared a club of the stature of Real Madrid might even be interested, and willing to pay twice what the Toffees did. The Â£30m fee is starting to look a bargain already. Season Team Games Minutes 2017-18 Everton 38 3420 2016-17 Sunderland 29 2610 2015-16 Preston North End 24 2101 2015-16 Sunderland 2 180 2014-15 Bradford City 33 2890 2013-14 Carlisle United 18 1620 2013-14 Burton Albion 12 1080 This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Sweden 0-2 England highlights Pickford, under England goalkeeping coach Martyn Margetson - who was also with him at Everton, before leaving this summer - is now the leader of what he calls ""the goalkeepers' union"" at their Zelenogorsk training base. He cuts an animated, hyped-up figure watched at close quarters in training, a blizzard of body movements and facial expressions, especially when he makes a rare mistake. By goalkeeping standards, he is a bundle of perpetual motion. One of Pickford's greatest strengths, according to those who know him, is an ability to put mistakes behind him - not that he takes them lightly. A moment of uncertainty in an otherwise magnificent display against Sweden led to Pickford inadvertently punching his knee rather than the floor, hence the bandage on his left hand as he showed off the man of the match award. He is a steely character, too, unaffected by criticism of his performance in England's loss to Belgium, when he was perhaps ring rusty after little action against Tunisia and Panama. He has been superb since, making a flying save from Colombia's Mateus Uribe in normal time then saving from Carlos Bacca as England won a penalty shootout - before the brilliance of his performance against Sweden in Samara. There is no question he had to prove his credentials as England's number one, not simply with his saves but by fulfilling a vital role in Southgate's plans via his work with the ball at his feet. Pickford's deeds in the past week have made him a prime contender for Fifa's World Cup team of the tournament and proved England have a goalkeeper who could serve them for the next decade.

Jason Tarry, currently the group's chief product officer, will become the chief executive of Tesco UK. All changes take effect on 16 July.

Three Lions on course for number one,"That's not the World Cup, it's a melon dipped in custard Three Lions looks set to go to number one after a massive spike in streams and downloads over the weekend. The song has taken a 30% lead over its nearest rival, George Ezra's Shotgun, the Official Charts Company said. Originally recorded for the Euro '96 tournament, Three Lions was written by The Lightning Seeds and comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel. Its famous ""football's coming home"" chant has been resurrected as England have progressed through the World Cup. The song re-entered the top 40 last Friday, but its popularity surged further afterEngland beat Swedenon Saturday to reach the semi-finals. In the 24 hours after that match, Three Lions topped the iTunes download chart and was streamed 701,000 times on Spotify alone. In total, it has accumulated 24,000 downloads and 2.6 million audio streams since last Friday. That combination is enough to put the song in pole position in the midweek chart update, with two other football anthems also on course to reappear in the top 40 - Fat Les's Vindaloo at 28 and New Order's World In Motion at 34. Bobby Moore with the Jules Rimet trophy in 1966 The lyric ""Jules Rimet still gleaming"" refers to the original World Cup trophy - named after the Fifa president who set up the tournament. England lifted the cup in 1966, but it was stolen from Brazil in 1983 and never recovered. The fans chanting at the start of Three Lions '96 are actually BrÃ¸ndby supporters. The Lightning Seeds' frontman Ian Broudie captured them on his cassette recorder when they played at Anfield in 1995. There are four versions of Three Lions, including a BBC-only edit that replaces commentary from rival broadcasters with clips from 5 Live. The one you're most likely to hear on radio today is Three Lions '98, which references England's current manager, Gareth Southgate. 'It's coming home': The song that defines England George Ezra even urged fans to ensure Three Lions ends his chart reign. ""Thanks to you lovely people, Shotgun has been number one for two weeks running,""he said,external. ""Of course that is amazing. But I think it's time we knock it off the number one spot with Three Lions."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It seems only right that we've rediscovered a love of Three Lions at the same moment we are all rallying behind the England team.

""When we wrote the song, the refrain 'football's coming home' referred both to the fact the tournament was being held in England, and to the more mystical idea that we might win. ""But now the song seems to mean only 'we might win', and as [last] week went on, and the jubilation rose, 'Yes, we are going to win'."" Three Lions' achievement is particularly notable because current chart rules penalise songs that are more than three years old. Whereas every 100 streams of George Ezra's Shotgun count as one ""sale"" in the official chart formula, the ratio for Three Lions is 200:1. If the streams are on an ad-funded service like YouTube or Spotify's free tier, the ratios are even more unfavourable - 600:1 for new songs vs 1,200:1 for older ones. The rule is partly designed to keep the charts moving, especially at Christmas, when festive songs can clutter up the top 40. It also inoculates the chart against campaigns like the oneto get Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead to number onewhen Margaret Thatcher died. By coincidence, this week's chart sees a similar attempt, with protestors hoping to get Green Day's American Idiot to number one to coincide with President Trump's visit to the UK. In the midweek chart update, the song appears at number 18, but is likely to fall by the time the final chart is revealed on BBC Radio 1 this Friday.

Novichok pair had high dose - policePolice describe the use of a nerve agent which killed a woman in England as barbaric.UK,"This video can not be played Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu says police will do everything to bring those responsible to justice A woman who died after being exposed to the nerve agent Novichok in Wiltshire is believed to have had a ""high dose"" of the substance, police have said. Mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess, 44, died on Sunday evening after falling ill in Amesbury on 30 June. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, 45, who was also exposed to the nerve agent, remains critically ill in hospital. Police are continuing to hunt for a contaminated container which they believe was handled by the pair. The BBC understands Mr Rowley's flat in Amesbury is regarded as the key location in the search. A team wearing hazmat suits is combing the small flat, working in 30-minute shifts because of the heat. Wiltshire Police said on Monday night that a car had been moved from Swindon in relation to the investigation - but stressed that ""the public should not be alarmed"". Allow Twitter content?

A murder inquiry has been launched into Ms Sturgess's death and a post-mortem examination is due to take place. Home Secretary Sajid Javid chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra on Monday and later addressed MPs. He told them the death of Ms Sturgess ""strengthens our resolve to find out exactly what happened and who is behind it"". What are Novichok agents? Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Mr Javid said scientists had not yet been able to determine if the nerve agent in the latest poisoning was from the same batch as that used earlier this year in Salisbury. Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliafell ill after being poisoned with Novichok in Salisbury.Ms Skripal was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital in April, and her father in May. A police officer, Det Sgt Nick Bailey, wasalso left seriously illafter responding to the attack on the Skripals and spent nearly three weeks in hospital. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley touched an unknown contaminated item with their hands, police say Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head UK counter-terrorism policing which is leading the investigation, said he was ""unable to say"" if the incident in Amesbury is linked to the poisoning of the Skripals on 3 March - but it is their ""main line of inquiry"". Mr Basu said: ""In the four months since the Skripals and Nick Bailey were poisoned, no other people besides Dawn and Charlie have presented with symptoms, but their reaction was so severe it resulted in Dawn's death and Charlie being critically ill. This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse ""This means they must have got a high dose and our hypothesis is that they must have handled a container that we are now seeking."" It is understood the couple each had nerve agent on one of their hands. Ms Sturgess, from Durrington, was rushed to hospital on Saturday 30 June after becoming ill at a house in Muggleton Road in Amesbury. She has two sons, aged 19 and 23, and an 11-year-old daughter. Theresa May said she was ""appalled and shocked"" by her death. Speaking to MPs in the House of Commons, she also paid tribute to the ""dedication of the staff"" at Salisbury District Hospital and thanked them for their ""tireless work"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs: ""The simple reality is that Russia has committed an attack on British soil which has seen the death of a British citizen. ""That is something that I think the world will unite with us in actually condemning."" Tributes were left to Ms Sturgess, who has three children Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ""deeply concerned"" about the incident in Amesbury - but said accusations that it was involved are ""absurd"". The UK government previously blamed Russia for the poisoning of the Skripals in March and say the nerve agent used was a type developed by Russia. Russian authorities denied any involvement in the poisoning. Mr Basu said detectives will continue with their ""painstaking and meticulous work to gather all the available evidence"". ByGordon Corera, BBC security correspondent A hundred detectives are already working round the clock to try to establish how Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were contaminated by Novichok. Swabs taken from them in hospital revealed the highest level of contamination on their hands, leading to the theory they picked something up. It may well be that it was Dawn who came into first contact and Charlie received secondary contamination from her but that remains to be confirmed. The priority now is working out what that item was and where it is now. Read more here. Officers have found a red Ford Transit van which Mr Rowley travelled in with three other men before falling ill. The vehicle has been sent to the government's military research facility Porton Down. Three men who also travelled in the van have shown no sign of being exposed to Novichok. Meanwhile, the bus that Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley used the night before they collapsed has tested negative for Novichok. Public Health England said the risk to the general public ""remains low""but warned people,externalnot to pick up ""any strange items such as needles, syringes or unusual containers"". They have also offered advice for people who may have visited one of five areas identified by police. Those locations are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury, and John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Anyone who was there between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 on 30 Juneshould continue to follow advice,external, including washing their clothes in a washing machine, keeping other items double-bagged and securely fastened if they are dry-clean only. Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard said the news of Ms Sturgess's death would ""send a huge shockwave across our communities"" but stressed that ""the risk to the wider public remains low"". He praised residents for their ""continual strength and resilience"" during ""these challenging times"". Friday 29 June 12:20 - Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley are together at John Baker House, Salisbury. They leave to visit Salisbury and later go to Queen Elizabeth Gardens. They return to John Baker House at 16:20. 22:00 - The couple catch a bus to Amesbury. Police believe they then spend the night at Mr Rowley's home on Muggleton Road.

Is it opportunity or disaster for the PM?,"Boris Johnson leaving the foreign secretary's official residence at Carlton Gardens in central London Where was the joker, the great cajoler, the political entertainer? For Boris Johnson, there was nothing funny about David Davis' resignation forcing him into an agonising choice. Stay in his job as he had intended to do and ""polish the turd"" - as he apparently so delicately put it - from inside government and risk ferocious criticism from the Brexiteers he used to delight? Or walk away - into quite what it is not clear - when his political stock is at a low after his controversial time as foreign secretary. Brexit dream dying, Johnson tells May Boris Johnson's legacy as foreign secretary As it happened: Johnson and Davis resign From watching the images of him leave his official residence for the last time, where he'd been holed up all day, he wore it heavily. No bellowed ""hello"" for the patient snappers. Leaving alongside his wife Marina Wheeler he looked not just a bit dishevelled, which is not exactly unusual, but pretty battered by events. It is not clear at all from his friends what his plan is next, or if he even has one. This time he has resigned, but when weighing up his options might think of his own words when he was booted out by Michael Howard years ago - ""My friends, as I have discovered myself, there are no disasters, only opportunities. And, indeed, opportunities for fresh disasters."" More importantly, is the prime minister looking at opportunity, or disaster? Boris Johnson told the PM she was suffocating Brexit ""dream"" in his resignation letter There are two entirely plausible scenarios. First, talk to the inner core of Brexiteers and the departures reveal the hollow betrayal of the prime minster's EU policy. There is simply no way that her policy is allowed to stand. And if she doesn't junk it, well, they will simply force her to. If she resists, they'll take her out rather than follow along. One Brexiteer MP tonight told me they have the numbers to make life impossible. Don't focus just on the idea of a no confidence vote. As things stand she would probably win one of them. But if Brexiteers start voting against government measures in the Commons on a regular basis they can simply block everything the PM tries to do which could, in time, force her out. They still have the numbers to do it. Maybe. Hunt replaces Johnson amid Brexit turmoil At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Here's the second possible version of events. While Monday's fiasco certainly looks to the outside world that the Tories are losing the plot, Theresa May has ended the day with a cabinet that is more loyal to her. A Parliamentary party where the majority want her Brexit compromise to succeed. Two of the colleagues who required a lot of time and effort are out of her way, while other Breixteers bound into her project having not resigned today. And former Remain rebels who had been causing huge amounts of trouble are mollified because, finally, after months of their urging, she has picked a side, and it is theirs. So, she ends a brutal day having scraped some of the barnacles off the boat, more able to forge ahead. Hmmm. Crucial to both those scenarios is how the EU responds to her compromise. If the EU starts being more flexible, Theresa May could start to earn back some authority. If they reject her compromise quick smart, what is the point of her colleagues defending her if there is no strategy left to defend? And the next steps of the departing duo matter too. Become friendly critics or the voices for simmering anger that's all around? We don't know yet and their decisions will matter too. So, in a terrible act of fence sitting, I will gladly write that it is possible that the government moved a step closer to total and utter meltdown and another general election. But it is also feasible that the mainstream majority in the Tory Party just found a stronger stride. For Theresa May, another day in power awaits, but she is not in complete control.

"Novichok pair had high dose - policePolice are hunting for the contaminated container handled by Dawn Sturgess, following her death.UK","This video can not be played Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu says police will do everything to bring those responsible to justice A woman who died after being exposed to the nerve agent Novichok in Wiltshire is believed to have had a ""high dose"" of the substance, police have said. Mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess, 44, died on Sunday evening after falling ill in Amesbury on 30 June. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, 45, who was also exposed to the nerve agent, remains critically ill in hospital. Police are continuing to hunt for a contaminated container which they believe was handled by the pair. The BBC understands Mr Rowley's flat in Amesbury is regarded as the key location in the search. A team wearing hazmat suits is combing the small flat, working in 30-minute shifts because of the heat. Wiltshire Police said on Monday night that a car had been moved from Swindon in relation to the investigation - but stressed that ""the public should not be alarmed"". Allow Twitter content?

A murder inquiry has been launched into Ms Sturgess's death and a post-mortem examination is due to take place. Home Secretary Sajid Javid chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra on Monday and later addressed MPs. He told them the death of Ms Sturgess ""strengthens our resolve to find out exactly what happened and who is behind it"". What are Novichok agents? Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Mr Javid said scientists had not yet been able to determine if the nerve agent in the latest poisoning was from the same batch as that used earlier this year in Salisbury. Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliafell ill after being poisoned with Novichok in Salisbury.Ms Skripal was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital in April, and her father in May. A police officer, Det Sgt Nick Bailey, wasalso left seriously illafter responding to the attack on the Skripals and spent nearly three weeks in hospital. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley touched an unknown contaminated item with their hands, police say Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head UK counter-terrorism policing which is leading the investigation, said he was ""unable to say"" if the incident in Amesbury is linked to the poisoning of the Skripals on 3 March - but it is their ""main line of inquiry"". Mr Basu said: ""In the four months since the Skripals and Nick Bailey were poisoned, no other people besides Dawn and Charlie have presented with symptoms, but their reaction was so severe it resulted in Dawn's death and Charlie being critically ill. This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse ""This means they must have got a high dose and our hypothesis is that they must have handled a container that we are now seeking."" It is understood the couple each had nerve agent on one of their hands. Ms Sturgess, from Durrington, was rushed to hospital on Saturday 30 June after becoming ill at a house in Muggleton Road in Amesbury. She has two sons, aged 19 and 23, and an 11-year-old daughter. Theresa May said she was ""appalled and shocked"" by her death. Speaking to MPs in the House of Commons, she also paid tribute to the ""dedication of the staff"" at Salisbury District Hospital and thanked them for their ""tireless work"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs: ""The simple reality is that Russia has committed an attack on British soil which has seen the death of a British citizen. ""That is something that I think the world will unite with us in actually condemning."" Tributes were left to Ms Sturgess, who has three children Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ""deeply concerned"" about the incident in Amesbury - but said accusations that it was involved are ""absurd"". The UK government previously blamed Russia for the poisoning of the Skripals in March and say the nerve agent used was a type developed by Russia. Russian authorities denied any involvement in the poisoning. Mr Basu said detectives will continue with their ""painstaking and meticulous work to gather all the available evidence"". ByGordon Corera, BBC security correspondent A hundred detectives are already working round the clock to try to establish how Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were contaminated by Novichok. Swabs taken from them in hospital revealed the highest level of contamination on their hands, leading to the theory they picked something up. It may well be that it was Dawn who came into first contact and Charlie received secondary contamination from her but that remains to be confirmed. The priority now is working out what that item was and where it is now. Read more here. Officers have found a red Ford Transit van which Mr Rowley travelled in with three other men before falling ill. The vehicle has been sent to the government's military research facility Porton Down. Three men who also travelled in the van have shown no sign of being exposed to Novichok. Meanwhile, the bus that Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley used the night before they collapsed has tested negative for Novichok. Public Health England said the risk to the general public ""remains low""but warned people,externalnot to pick up ""any strange items such as needles, syringes or unusual containers"". They have also offered advice for people who may have visited one of five areas identified by police. Those locations are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury, and John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Anyone who was there between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 on 30 Juneshould continue to follow advice,external, including washing their clothes in a washing machine, keeping other items double-bagged and securely fastened if they are dry-clean only. Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard said the news of Ms Sturgess's death would ""send a huge shockwave across our communities"" but stressed that ""the risk to the wider public remains low"". He praised residents for their ""continual strength and resilience"" during ""these challenging times"". Friday 29 June 12:20 - Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley are together at John Baker House, Salisbury. They leave to visit Salisbury and later go to Queen Elizabeth Gardens. They return to John Baker House at 16:20. 22:00 - The couple catch a bus to Amesbury. Police believe they then spend the night at Mr Rowley's home on Muggleton Road. Saturday 30 June 10:15 - The South Western Ambulance Service is called to Mr Rowley's address as Ms Sturgess has been taken ill. Mr Rowley is also present at the address as Ms Sturgess is taken to hospital. 12:00 - Mr Rowley visits the Boots pharmacy on Stonehenge Walk in Amesbury, returning to his house half an hour later. 1:45 - He goes to the Amesbury Baptist Church on Butterfield Drive, returning home at 15:00. 18:20 - Mr Rowley is taken ill.

"Trump names Kavanaugh for Supreme CourtMr Trump lauds his pick, a former adviser to President George W Bush, as a ""brilliant jurist"".US & Canada","This video can not be played Trump nominates Kavanaugh as new Supreme Court justice US President Donald Trump has nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, setting the stage for a bruising confirmation battle. In a primetime announcement at the White House, Mr Trump praised his pick as a ""brilliant jurist"". The nominee, a District of Columbia appeals court judge, is a former adviser to ex-President George W Bush. The decision has far-reaching implications for America on everything from abortion to guns to immigration. This is Mr Trump's second Supreme Court appointment, potentially allowing him to shape the US for a generation. The president said: ""Judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials, unsurpassed qualifications and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law."" Judge Kavanaugh said he was ""humbled"" by the president's confidence in him The appointee would replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, who announced last month that he will retire soon. Meet the Supremes - the nine judges on US top court Why is the US Supreme Court so important? At Monday night's announcement, Mr Kavanaugh, 53, thanked President Trump and said he had ""witnessed firsthand your appreciation for the vital role of the American judiciary."" Pro-choice and anti-abortion protesters demonstrate in front of the US Supreme Court ahead of the announcement Mr Kavanaugh has served since 2006 on the influential US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and was formerly a White House aide under George W Bush. He previously worked for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Democratic former president Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Abortion Mr Kavanaugh has not expressed outright opposition to Roe v Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion nationwide, but he has given some indications of where he might stand. Last year, the DC Circuit Court ruled that an undocumented immigrant teenager in detention was entitled to seek an abortion. Mr Kavanaugh objected, saying that her right to have an abortion was ""based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong"". He did, however, write in his dissent to the ruling that the court must recognise Roe v Wade and another abortion rights case ""as precedents we must follow"". Executive power Mr Kavanaugh argued in 2009 article that presidents should be shielded from criminal investigations and civil lawsuits while in office. That could be a red flag to Democrats - indicating that if the special counsel investigation into Mr Trump's campaign ties to Russia finds its way to the Supreme Court, he would not support action against Mr Trump while the president before his term is up. Guns He is pro-second amendment. In 2011, he objected when the DC Circuit Court upheld a ban on most semi-automatic rifles in the district. He argued that, because most handguns are semi-automatic, and are protected by a previous Supreme Court ruling, semi-automatic rifles should benefit from the same protection. The environment The nomination is likely to concern environmentalists. Mr Kavanaugh has issued rulings and dissents against Obama-era environmental regulations, including efforts to curb air pollution from power plants and greenhouse gases. The US Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter on contentious laws and disputes between states and the federal government. It rules on such issues as abortion, the death penalty, voter rights, immigration policy, campaign finance and racial bias in policing. This video can not be played Explaining Roe v Wade and abortion in US Each of the nine justices holds a lifetime appointment. As Mr Kavanaugh is relatively young, he could serve for decades to come. His appointment will not change the ideological tilt of a court that already has a 5-4 conservative majority, but he could shift the bench further to the right. Justice Kennedy sometimes sided with the court's liberal members. But Mr Kavanaugh may not be so accommodating. Neil Gorsuch, 50, who was appointed by Mr Trump last year, is already one of the court's most conservative justices. Judge Kavanaugh was accompanied by his wife and two daughters Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The front-runner was a front-runner for a reason. Over the weekend, it looked as though Judge Kavanaugh's star may have been fading, that perhaps he had too-close ties to the Bush family for Mr Trump's liking. In the end, however, the safe pick won out. He is the kind of judge a President Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney would have picked - a man with an established legal pedigree and a reputation as a reliably conservative jurist. If the party sticks together, the president's choice will be sitting on the Supreme Court when its new term starts in October. President Trump campaigned with a promise to conservatives that he would fill the federal courts, from the top on down, with judges to their liking. It's a promise that has helped cement near-record levels of support for his presidency from Republican voters - and for good reason. Mr Trump is securing a conservative judiciary for a generation. The nominee must be confirmed by the Senate, which the Republicans narrowly control 51-49. A nominee needs a simple majority of 51 votes to be confirmed. With Senator John McCain battling cancer, Republicans can currently only muster 50 votes. Before a full vote in the chamber, the prospective justice will be grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee in hearings that can go on for days. The White House and Republicans want the nomination confirmed by November's mid-term elections. Conservative activists will begin running ads pressuring politically vulnerable Democratic senators to vote for confirmation. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia will be prime targets, as they face tough re-election campaigns in their conservative states this year. Meanwhile, liberal groups are calling on two moderate Republican senators - Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska - to reject the nominee. Ms Collins has said she will not vote for any candidate who threatens abortion rights.

Deprivation 'should count for university'The university access watchdog says students' background should be a factor in awarding places.,"The university access watchdog says students' backgrounds should be taken into account when awarding places, to improve ""equality of opportunity"". A-level grades are a ""robust measure"" only if the applicants' ""context"" is also considered, Chris Millward says. Many universities give extra help to disadvantaged applicants - but a report warns of a lack of openness about how this operates. All Russell Group universities use some form of ""contextual admissions"". Top universities have faced accusations of being socially exclusive and recruiting too few applicants from ethnic minorities. But they also face scrutiny for being unfair to individual applicants who might lose out on places to disadvantaged candidates with worse results. A report from the Fair Education Alliance campaign group says there needs to be much more transparency about how universities use the background of applicants when making offers and awarding places. 'Ditch predicted grades' from university applications 'I want to be the first in my family to go to university' How diverse are universities? The campaign group, of more than 100 education and business organisations, says this can include taking into account family income, whether an applicant lives in a deprived area or if they attended a school with poor exam results or where few pupils go on to university. There might be extra consideration given to applications from disadvantaged pupils or they might be offered places on lower grades. But the report says there needs to be much more clarity about these decisions and how different forms of disadvantage are defined. Research for the report, carried out by the University of Exeter, shows the extent of the challenge - with figures showing how few places in 2016 were awarded to applicants from areas with few young people going to university. The University of Cambridge had only 3% of entrants from such ""low participation neighbourhoods"", the University of Bristol 3.7%, Oxford 4.6% and Exeter 5.3%. Mr Millward, the Office for Students' director of fair access and participation, said: ""We are a long way from equality of opportunity in relation to access to higher education."" Universities are in charge of their own admissions, so the fair access director can encourage but not instruct. But Mr Millward said: ""An ambitious approach to contextual admissions must be central to our strategy if we are going to make progress on access at the scale and pace necessary to meet the expectations of government, students and the wider public. ""A-level grades can only be considered to be a robust measure of potential if they are considered alongside the context in which they are achieved,"" he said. Sarah Stevens, of the Russell Group, said that all of its universities used ""contextual data"" in some form. ""Qualifications and predicted grades are a key indicator of academic ability - but universities take a range of other factors into account to understand the applicant's achievements in context,"" she said. ""This includes the school or college attended, where a student grew up, whether they are a care leaver, or whether they are the first in their family to enter higher education.""

Jonathan HeadBBC South East Asia Correspondent Over the past week we have called
in to chat to Nopparat Kanthawong, the head coach of the Wild Boars football
team, and usually found him talking tensely on the phone to parents of the
boys. He went over and over the events of the day the boys went into the caves
with his assistant after football practice. He says he had no idea they were
going. Tonight there was an entirely
different atmosphere in the house, just below the mountains where the men who
run the Wild Boars meet. They laughed, shouted cheers and shook hands in a very
un-Thai way. And coach Nop was smiling for the first time, and almost
speechless. ""I donât know what to say â I just want to see them, and hug them,"" he told me. I was then able to show him a note from Manchester United to the rescued boys. It was an invitation to visit Old Trafford
next season, as most of the boys are passionate Man U fans. There was a little
disbelief, and then elation, even from coach Nop, who admits he is a Liverpool
fan who has failed to convert the rest of his team. ""Is this for real?"" they
asked. Getting them to UK from this
far-flung border town will be a challenge. Three of the boys and coach Ekapol,
who was with them in the caves, are not recognised as full Thai citizens, a
fairly common problem for communities along the Thai-Myanmar border. But they
just made an almost miraculous escape from a cave. They will probably make it to
Manchester Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The young footballers had been invited by Fifa to attend the World Cup Final in Moscow on Sunday. But their attendance was always a long shot, given the health risks they face after spending more than two weeks in a pitch-dark cave. Fifa has just told the BBC that the boys will not be making the match. Here's what they said: FIFA would like to express its great joy at the news of the rescue of the 12 young footballers and their coach. We would like to convey our profound gratitude to all persons involved in the rescue operation, which unfortunately took the life of one of the divers. Our thoughts are with his family. We have been informed by the Football Association of Thailand that due to medical reasons, the boys will not be in a position to travel to Moscow for the FIFA World Cup final. FIFA's priority remains the health of everyone involved in the operation and we will look into finding a new opportunity to invite the boys to a FIFA event to share with them a moment of communion and celebration. We can also confirm that a meeting with the Football Association of Thailand is scheduled to take place in Moscow around the FIFA World Cup final. The BBC's Nick Beake is at the hospital where the boys are being treated: This is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission
Accomplished. Families in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the
final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldnât believe
it, others claimed they never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles.
Scores of reporters rushed to their live positions to bring the news to
their audiences at home. Japanese and Brazilian networks were either side of
us. Up on the 8th floor, the doctors who declared this morning that the
first eight boys to be rescued are doing well will now be examining their remaining
teammates and their coach. Psychologists will be being assessing the impact a
fortnight trapped underground has had. The Wild Boars footballers went into the
Tham Luang cave as a team. They survived as a team. And tonight, at the end of
a remarkable 72-hour rescue, they are together as a team once again.

"Flypast over Palace to mark RAF centenaryUp to 100 aircraft will take part in this afternoon's flypast, which will be watched by the Queen.UK","This video can not be played A flypast of aircraft marks the centenary of the Royal Air Force Thousands of people have gathered outside Buckingham Palace to watch a flypast of aircraft to mark the centenary of the Royal Air Force. Almost 100 planes representing the RAF over the years flew over The Mall following a parade by personnel. The Queen and other members of the Royal Family saw the display - which included the new F-35 fighter and Spitfires - from the palace balcony. Earlier they marked the centenary at a special service in Westminster Abbey. The service began what the head of the RAF said would be a ""tremendous"" day of events to mark its 100 years. Three F-35 Lightning stealth fighters were involved in the flypast and 22 Typhoons spelt out 100 as they flew over the palace.

Surrounded by other members of the Royal Family, the Queen presented a new Queen's Colour to the RAF in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace before moving to the balcony. In a brief speech, she congratulated the RAF for a ""remarkable contribution to defence"" over the last 100 years, saying ""tenacity, skill and gallantry"" had been its hallmarks. She added: ""I remember the Battle of Britain being fought over the skies above us and we shall never forget the courage and sacrifice of that time.""

In his address at Westminster Abbey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, said the RAF had played a ""decisive factor in saving this country's independence, its democracy and its freedom; its hope of civilisation and its contribution to humanity for the future"". He added: ""It is also right to remember with sorrow and again profound thanksgiving the scores of thousands who have given their lives in service as part of the RAF."" The Queen,who did not attend Prince Louis' christening on Monday,was at the service along with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke of York, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

'Sick' EU ivory sales a 'cover for poaching',"The open, legal sale of antique ivory in many European countries is covering up a trade in illegal and recently poached ivory, campaigners say. Researchers from environmental groupAvaaz,externalbought 100 ivory items and had them radiocarbon dated at Oxford University. Three quarters were modern ivory, being sold illegally as fake antiques. Ivory from an elephant killed by poachers as recently as 2010 was among the items passed off as being antique. ""It's sick,"" said Bert Wander from Avaaz, which organised the purchase of the items. ""I'm looking at the trinkets we bought on my desk, and to think that an elephant with all the things we are learning about them, about their cognition and their advanced societies, and to think that one of them has died for this bracelet I'm holding now, it makes you sick to your stomach."" The items were purchased from both antique dealers and private sellers in 10 countries across Europe. All the ivory pieces were advertised as originating from before 1947 or had no date information. The 1947 date is important because the EU classes ivory from before this date as antique and it can be traded without restriction. Fossil of 'first giant' discovered Krill companies cut Antarctic fishing Farage criticised over shark photo When the items were analysed by Oxford University's Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, more than 74% were found to be from after 1947. The tests are able to show when the ivory grew on a living elephant, not when the creature died. This means the ivory could have come from elephants killed decades after the date of the sample. Almost three quarters of the trinkets were illegal under EU rules The crude nature of many of the items is striking Of greater concern, though, was the fact that one in five were from elephants killed after the global ban on the ivory trade came into force in 1989. One piece purchased in Spain may have come from an elephant whose ivory was formed after 2010. All the pieces bought in Bulgaria, Italy and Spain were illegal, as were large majorities of the items in France, the Netherlands and Portugal. In the UK, one fifth of the pieces purchased by Avaaz were outside the law. ""These shocking results show that the supposed 'legal' ivory market is actually driving the mindless slaughter of elephants,"" said Catherine Bearder, a member of the European Parliament who authored that body's resolution in favour of a ban. ""It is time for all EU countries to introduce a full ivory ban with a limited number of exceptions for exceptional art works."" The EU says that last year it strengthened measures to fight poaching and end the trade in raw ivory. Tackling trafficking should be a priority for all enforcement agencies in member states, officials said. ""The Commission will continue to fight any kind of illegal trading, including the fraud of passing off recent ivory as antique,"" said EU spokesman Enrico Brivio. ""Addressing elephant poaching and ivory trafficking is a cornerstone of the EU action against wildlife trafficking and the EU has recently adopted numerous initiatives to this end."" European Union officials have claimed that there is no evidence that the legal ivory trade in the EU is helping to cover up a trade in illegal items - but this survey calls that into question. It will undoubtedly lead to calls for a complete ban. The EU legal market in ivory may consist mainly of small items, but they add up to several tonnes sold each year. Europe also remains a major exporter of legal, worked ivory to big Asian markets which is also encouraging poaching across Africa, according to experts. While the numbers of elephants being killed has dropped for the last five years, around 55 are still being killed every day. In many locations, the future of the elephant will not be sustainable if this keeps up. The EU has tried to curtail the trade in legal ivory being used as a cover for illegal sales by requiring all material acquired between 1947 and 1990 to be sold with a government issued certificate. But all a seller has to do is say that they believe the ivory comes from before 1947 and it's almost impossible to contradict them. Accurately determining the age of a piece of ivory is impossible without going to the expense of radiocarbon dating. Not many. Some of the leading markets have now banned any sales including Hong Kong, the world's biggest, which will phase out the legal trade over the next three years. China has also banned all trade except what it terms ""genuine antiques"". The US has effectively banned trade while the UK is in the process of adopting a near total ban on ivory sales, with exemptions for the trade in musical instruments and ivory sales to museums. One of the ivory trinkets purchased in Bulgaria The European Parliament has already called for a ban, and member states like the UK are leading the way with a comprehensive phase out of legal sales on the way to becoming law. The European Commission is currently reviewing whether or not EU restrictions on ivory go far enough. ""The EU consultation which closed in December 2017, collected almost 90,000 responses,"" said Eleonora Panella, from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw). ""We know that the vast majority was from people asking for stringent measures, this has for sure an impact of further decisions. We hope that a good decision will be taken soon, we were expecting something already this July, [it] now seems that it has been postponed. ""TheIllegal Wildlife Trade Conference,externalin London in October could be the perfect moment to show the leadership we are asking for."" If the sales of all ivory pieces is outlawed across the EU and the UK, many people will mixed feelings about the small tokens they're left with. ""We would support exemptions such as the ones proposed in the UK for family heirlooms and historical items,"" said Eleonora Panella. ""These should be allowed to be passed down to family members or donated to museums, but they cannot be bought, sold or traded for goods in kind."" People might also want to donate them to an elephant charity which could arrange for their destruction or use them in educational activities.

"Rail timetable changes for winter scaled backTimetable changes for eight franchises, including Govia Thameslink Railway, have been postponed.Business","A rail timetable overhaul planned for December has been scaled back amid fears of a repeat of the chaos seen in May when a new schedule was introduced. Timetable changes for eight franchises, including Govia Thameslink Railway and Northern, whose operations descended into chaos in May, have been postponed. Other franchises will introduce only minor timetable changes in December. Industry bodyThe Rail Delivery Group sai,externald the ""more cautious approach"" took into account ""recent painful lessons"". Rail timetable chaos inquiry launched Rise in late trains since new timetables Rail firm changes time of every train Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, said: ""In parts of the country, many people have suffered unacceptable disruption following the introduction of the new timetable in May for which we are sincerely sorry. ""The industry is determined to learn the lessons from what went wrong."" He said train operators would focus on making sure passengers received a ""reliable service"" in December. The operators which will not make changes to their existing timetable in December are Cross Country, Govia, Thameslink Railway, Great Western Railway, London Overground, Northern, South Western Railway (SWR), TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains. In May, the time of every Govia Thameslink was changed In May, what was billed as the biggest ever overhaul of rail timetables led towidespread rail disruption. The overhaul was aimed at improving punctuality and boosting capacity, but instead led to a huge number of train services being cancelled or severely delayed. The Transport Select Committee is investigating the reasons behind the disruption andis asking for evidence from passengers and as well as rail industry groups.,external The committee's chair, Lilian Greenwood, said May's timetable change caused ""upset and distress"". ""Before we look at steps taken to improve the situation and compensation, we want to hear the experiences of passengers themselves. I strongly encourage them to engage with us via the Committee's Twitter account or submit written evidence to our inquiry."" Train timetables are usually changed twice a year, in summer and winter, but normally on a much smaller scale. The Rail Delivery Group said December's changes would now be on a similar scale to ""the smaller changes of recent years"". South Western Railway said it was ""disappointed"" that it would not be going ahead with its ""major timetable change"" in December, which would have led to more capacity. The decision was taken ""at a national level that a period of stability is needed"", it added. Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said the timetable announcement was a ""pragmatic step to help maintain a more dependable service"". But he warned that ""long-suffering passengers who have put up with much inconvenience... will be disappointed that promised improvements may be delivered more slowly"".

Prince Louis christened in private ceremony,"This video can not be played Royals arrive for Prince Louis' christening Prince Louis, the youngest son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, has been christened in a private ceremony. The 11-week-old was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace. Guests included newlyweds the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. But the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh did not attend, with the decision made ""some time ago"" and not on health grounds, Buckingham Palace said. The Queen, 92, was travelling back from Norfolk on Monday and has a busy week ahead, with celebrations marking the centenary of the RAF on Tuesday and US President Donald Trump's visit to Windsor on Friday. Prince Louis wore the christening gown that his siblings had also worn Prince Louis was sleeping as he arrived at the ceremony, held by his mother. His siblings, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, walked slightly in front, holding their father's hands. Charlotte's kiss for new baby prince Royal births past and present It is the first time the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their three children have been seen together as a family of five. She was heard describing her son as ""very relaxed and peaceful"", telling the archbishop with a smile: ""I hope he stays like this.""

They also chose two anthems for the choir to sing - This is the Day which the Lord hath Made, written for their wedding in 2011 by John Rutter, and Suo Gan, a traditional Welsh lullaby. Prince Louis's christening gown is the same one that was used by his siblings. The cream lace and white satin robe is a replica of the robe made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter in 1841, which is now too delicate to be worn. The new version was made by the Queen's dresser, Angela Kelly. According to tradition,water from the River Jordanwas used at the christening. Following the 40-minute traditional religious service, guests attended a private tea which included slices of christening cake, from a tier taken from the duke and duchess' wedding cake.

PM to meet new cabinet amid Brexit turmoil,"Theresa May tweeted a picture of the cabinet, saying it had been a ""productive"" meeting Theresa May's new-look cabinet has met for the first time after a string of resignations over her Brexit strategy left her government in crisis. Mrs May was forced to carry out a reshuffle of her top team after Boris Johnson and David Davis both quit. The prime minister has warned the Tory party it must unite or face the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn in power. Jeremy Hunt, who has replaced Mr Johnson as foreign secretary, said he would be ""four square"" behind her. After the cabinet meeting, Mrs May tweeted that she was ""looking ahead to a busy week"". US President Donald Trump, who arrives in the country for a visit on Thursday, said the UK was in ""turmoil"" and ""it is up to the people"" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister. Live updates: Brexit resignations reaction Laura Kuenssberg: Could it be opportunity for PM? Katya Adler: The view from Brussels on UK turmoil Trump talks of UK turmoil ahead of visit The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU after that. The delay has been partly blamed on deep disagreements within the Conservative Party over what shape Brexit should take. Essentially the arguments are about how much the UK should prioritise business interests by compromising on post-referendum promises to end free movement of people, remove the UK from the remit of the European Court of Justice, and also have an independent trade policy which allows the UK to set its own trade rules and strike its own trade deals. Last Friday at the prime minister's country retreat at Chequers Mrs May brokered a ""collective"" agreement on proposals for the future relationship between the EU and UK. However, Mr Johnson - whose departure on Monday followed that of Brexit Secretary David Davis and several junior figures - accused Mrs May of pursuing a ""semi-Brexit"". In his resignation letter, he said the Brexit ""dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"". This video can not be played David Davis explains why he resigned Mr Davis, who has been leading Brexit negotiations for the UK so far, said he did not agree with the prime minister's proposals, so was the wrong person to be going into negotiations with them. He said that the UK was ""giving away too much, too easily"" ahead of negotiations with the European Union. Several junior government figures also quit, including Brexit minister Steve Baker who told the BBC's Daily Politics they had been ""blindsided"" by the No 10 plan that emerged at Chequers. Asked on Tuesday morning whether he too had considered resigning, another prominent Brexiteer, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, replied ""absolutely not"" and declared himself ""100%"" behind Mrs May's Brexit plan. On Monday evening, the prime minister faced down backbench critics at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, amid rumours they were close to getting the 48 signatures needed to trigger a no-confidence vote that could spark a leadership election. She told her critics the alternative to the party coming together could be a left-wing Labour administration, with Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said that while Brexiteers were still unhappy with the Chequers plan, their focus was on getting that changed, not on ousting Mrs May. ""There is a genuine weariness and horror at the thought of more disruption, turmoil and a possible leadership contest,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Above all, I just don't think one should underestimate Mrs May's sheer durability - you look around her cabinet table and there are bodies littered all over the placeâ¦ and she is still there. ""Yes, her position is extraordinarily fragile and vulnerable, but it is far from game over."" Former Conservative leader Lord Howard called for a ""degree of humility all around"". He told the Today programme: ""I do think it would be extremely foolish and extremely ill-advised for anyone to send in letters to mount a motion of no confidence in the prime minister and I am delighted that good sense seems to be breaking out."" Under Conservative Party rules, a leadership contest is triggered either if the leader resigns or if 15% of all Tory MPs (currently 48) write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, triggering a vote of no confidence by MPs If Mrs May lost such a vote, a leadership election would be triggered and she would be unable to stand as a candidate But if she won, she would be immune from motions of confidence for a year To enter the contest, a candidate needs to be nominated by 15% of MPs MPs then vote in successive ballots - with the candidate with the lowest number of votes eliminated in each round - until two candidates remain Finally, Tory members vote for which candidate they want (unless there's just one, in which case they become leader) The UK's negotiations with the EU will now be fronted by Dominic Raab, a staunch Leave supporter who has been promoted from the job of housing minister. Mr Hunt, who has been health secretary for the past six years, was a Remain campaigner in the 2016 EU referendum. He has since said he is a convert to the Brexit cause. But his appointment means the four great offices of state - prime minister, chancellor, foreign secretary, and home secretary - are all held by ministers who voted to stay in the EU. Jeremy Hunt replaces Boris Johnson as foreign secretary Dominic Raab has been made Brexit secretary Boris Johnson's resignation letter and May's reply in full Who's who guide: Theresa May's cabinet In his first comments as foreign secretary, Mr Hunt said he would be standing ""four square"" behind the prime minister ""so that we can get through an agreement with the European Union based on what was agreed by the cabinet last week at Chequers"". Matt Hancock is the new health secretary, with Attorney General Jeremy Wright replacing him as the culture secretary, and backbencher Geoffrey Cox becoming the new attorney general. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson and Mr Davis had abandoned a ""sinking ship"", shattering the ""illusion of unity"" initially surrounding the Chequers plan. The UK and the EU have been negotiating Brexit terms for more than a year now and have been hoping to agree broad aims for their future relationship in October. The aim of the Chequers away day had been to agree the UK position - after two years of discussion - but the resignations have put a question mark over that. Allow Twitter content?

The uncertainty in the UK comes before the plan is officially put to the EU, who may well be unhappy with aspects of it they have previously referred to as ""cherry picking"". One other element of Friday's agreement worth noting is that it pledged to speed up preparations for the UK to be ready to leave the EU without a Brexit deal in March next year. Labour MP and Remainer Chuka Umunna told Today that all the drama of Monday needed to be put to one side, saying: ""This has gone from a soap opera to a comedy, and it would be funny were it not for the fact that the subject matter is going to have a fundamental impact on hundreds of thousands of people's jobs.""

Deprivation 'should count for university'The university access watchdog says students' background should be a factor in awarding places.Family & Education,"The university access watchdog says students' backgrounds should be taken into account when awarding places, to improve ""equality of opportunity"". A-level grades are a ""robust measure"" only if the applicants' ""context"" is also considered, Chris Millward says. Many universities give extra help to disadvantaged applicants - but a report warns of a lack of openness about how this operates. All Russell Group universities use some form of ""contextual admissions"". Top universities have faced accusations of being socially exclusive and recruiting too few applicants from ethnic minorities. But they also face scrutiny for being unfair to individual applicants who might lose out on places to disadvantaged candidates with worse results. A report from the Fair Education Alliance campaign group says there needs to be much more transparency about how universities use the background of applicants when making offers and awarding places. 'Ditch predicted grades' from university applications 'I want to be the first in my family to go to university' How diverse are universities? The campaign group, of more than 100 education and business organisations, says this can include taking into account family income, whether an applicant lives in a deprived area or if they attended a school with poor exam results or where few pupils go on to university. There might be extra consideration given to applications from disadvantaged pupils or they might be offered places on lower grades. But the report says there needs to be much more clarity about these decisions and how different forms of disadvantage are defined. Research for the report, carried out by the University of Exeter, shows the extent of the challenge - with figures showing how few places in 2016 were awarded to applicants from areas with few young people going to university. The University of Cambridge had only 3% of entrants from such ""low participation neighbourhoods"", the University of Bristol 3.7%, Oxford 4.6% and Exeter 5.3%. Mr Millward, the Office for Students' director of fair access and participation, said: ""We are a long way from equality of opportunity in relation to access to higher education."" Universities are in charge of their own admissions, so the fair access director can encourage but not instruct. But Mr Millward said: ""An ambitious approach to contextual admissions must be central to our strategy if we are going to make progress on access at the scale and pace necessary to meet the expectations of government, students and the wider public. ""A-level grades can only be considered to be a robust measure of potential if they are considered alongside the context in which they are achieved,"" he said. Sarah Stevens, of the Russell Group, said that all of its universities used ""contextual data"" in some form. ""Qualifications and predicted grades are a key indicator of academic ability - but universities take a range of other factors into account to understand the applicant's achievements in context,"" she said. ""This includes the school or college attended, where a student grew up, whether they are a care leaver, or whether they are the first in their family to enter higher education.""

UKIP councillor 'killed wife after affair'A trial hears a former Royal Marine had an affair with his son's partner and strangled his wife.Suffolk,"UKIP member Stephen Searle was elected to Suffolk County Council in 2013 A former UKIP councillor strangled his wife to death after she discovered he was having an affair with their son's partner, a court has heard. Stephen Searle, 64, denies murdering Anne Searle, who was found suffocated at their home in The Brickfields, Stowmarket, Suffolk, on 30 December. Andrew Jackson, prosecuting, said the discovery of the affair ""would have put considerable strain on the marriage"". Ipswich Crown Court jurors were told Mr Searle said he acted in self-defence. Anne Searle was found dead at home in Stowmarket minutes after police took a call from Mr Searle, the court heard Mr Jackson said Mr Searle, a former Royal Marine and Suffolk county councillor, had been working at a bowling alley with his son Gary. Gary Searle was in a relationship with his colleague Anastasia Pomiateeva and the couple ""had children but never married"", the court heard. Stephen Searle began an affair with Ms Pomiateeva in April last year and kept it hidden, but the rest of the family found out about it in June. Mr Jackson said: ""The prosecution case is that on that Saturday night [30 December] there had probably been yet another row between the two of them and in anger the defendant strangled his wife to death."" The court heard the defendant and his wife had been married for 45 years and had three sons. The prosecution said Mr Searle had trained in unarmed combat with the Royal Navy and knew how to perform a choke hold. ""It's that technique the prosecution say the defendant probably used to kill his wife,"" said Mr Jackson. He told the court the defendant had called police to say ""I've just killed my wife"" and that Mrs Searle had posted a message on Facebook which said ""Happy Christmas... I hope I will still be here in 2018. We will see"". The trial continues.
