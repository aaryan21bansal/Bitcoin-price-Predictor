Atlantic microplastic 'weighs millions of tonnes',"This video can not be played The ocean-sieving expedition revealed 12 to 21 million tonnes of plastic fragments are suspended in the ocean There are 12-21 million tonnes of tiny plastic fragments floating in the Atlantic Ocean, scientists have found. A study, led by the UK's National Oceanography Centre, scooped through layers of the upper 200m (650ft) of the ocean during a research expedition through the middle of the Atlantic. Such an amount of plastic - 21 million tonnes - would be enough to fully load almost 1,000 container ships. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications. The researchers used a device to sift ocean water for the smallest fragments of plastic they could collect Dr Katsia Pabortsava, from theNational Oceanography Centre,external, who led the study, said by measuring the mass of very small plastic particles in the top 5% of the ocean, she and her colleagues could estimate ""the load of plastic in the entire Atlantic"" which is ""much larger"" than the previous figure. ""Previously, we haven't been able to balance the amount of plastic we found in the ocean with the amount we thought we had put in,"" she said. ""That's because we weren't measuring the very smallest particles."" The plastics research expedition traversed the Atlantic Ocean On their expedition - from the UK to the Falkland Islands - she and her colleagues detected up to 7,000 particles per cubic metre of seawater. They analysed their samples for the three most commonly used, and most commonly discarded, polymers - polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene - all often used in packaging. The biggest use of plastics is in packaging - where it tends to be used just once before being thrown away The findings, the team hopes, will help future efforts to measure the ecological and environmental damage that might be caused by these plastic fragments, by providing a more ""robust measure"" of its accumulation in remote parts of the ocean. Where legacy landfill sites are eroded by the sea, even buried plastic can find its way into the marine environment Prof Jamie Woodward, an expert in plastic pollution, from the University of Manchester, told BBC News the findings confirm earlier studies that the microplastic load in the oceans is ""much higher than [we had] estimated"". ""The geographical scale of the study is impressive,"" he said. ""And the authors estimate inputs over 65 years. This is important because microplastics have been flooding into the oceans for many decades. ""We now need to understand the ecological impacts of this contamination in all parts of the ocean, since they have been in the oceans at all depths for a long time."" Plastics can take hundreds of years to degrade Amid the coronavirus pandemic, some environmental groups have reported the disposable face mask is now one of the most common items of plastic litter. Susannah Bleakley, from the Cumbria-based charity Morecambe Bay Partnership, which co-ordinatesbeach clean-ups,external, told BBC News: ""We now find more disposable masks than plastic bags. ""What we're really asking is, as much as possible, can people reduce their use of single-use plastics and if people can dispose of it carefully.""

'I'm very anxious about getting back to work',"""I'm very anxious... anxious about catching Covid,"" says Kate Skoczylas. She is one of thousands of extremely clinically vulnerable people who have been shielding due to their health, and face a return to work in the autumn. Kate, 56, works for her local museums service, and had been about to return to work after undergoing cancer treatment when the first UK lockdown began in March. Kate, and millions of other vulnerable people, were initially told to not go outside, and to self-isolate, to reduce the risk of catching coronavirus. This guidance wasgradually relaxed, and in August the government told extremely vulnerable people thatthey no longer needed to shield in England. Kate lives in Leicester, so is locally locked down at the moment, but as it stands, she expects to return to work in September. This is daunting for her, especially as trips which used to be mundane now seem very risky. She has left the house twice since March. ""It's quite nerve-wracking,"" she says. ""I've been to the dentist and it's absolutely fraught with danger."" She is nervous about how to go about her daily life, and is unsure about the reality of wearing masks in shops and having to use customer one-way systems. Due to the nature of her treatment - Kate had surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy - she understands her immune system is ""severely depressed"". She is not sure what would happen if she caught Covid-19. ""Physically, I'm not in the best shape to be out in the world,"" she says. While she has faith in her employer to take steps to keep her safe, she still works in contact with the public, and feels that there is a risk that she could catch coronavirus. Kate says she was ""lucky"" as she was not furloughed, having been able to work from home during the lockdown. She will be expected to go back to work. However, thousands of people who have been shielding during the coronavirus pandemic, and who can't work from home, could be forced to choose between their job and their health as furloughing winds down, charities have warned. Eleven charities have called for the government to introduce furloughing for high-risk workers in that situation to avoid job losses. Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""As more and more people who have been shielding return to the workplace, we need clarity around how people with cancer who continue to be particularly vulnerable to coronavirus will be supported and kept safe. ""We are calling for the government to introduce a furlough-style scheme to protect these high-risk employees."" The charities said many workers have concerns that their workplaces won't be safe enough for them to return. The Office for National Statistics,externalestimated recently that 176,000 people who were shielding were furloughed and can't work from home. According to this data, an estimated 38,000 people who normally worked would not return within the next four months. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ""We fear thousands of shielding workers will end up losing their jobs because they can't return to them safely. ""These people have made a lot of sacrifices over the last six months to protect the NHS as well as themselves, and they shouldn't have to lose their jobs as well."" The Department for Work and Pensions said employers must make sure staff feel safe returning to work. ""We know it has been a challenging time for people shielding and their families, and we have been doing everything we can to support them throughout this pandemic,"" a spokesperson said. ""Shielding for the clinically extremely vulnerable has been paused since the start of August in most of the country as average rates of coronavirus remain sufficiently low. ""Staff and employers must carefully discuss options around returning to the workplace, and employers are responsible for ensuring all their workers - including those who have been shielding - feel safe in doing so."" ""It is important our response remains proportionate, and shielding is still advised in specific areas of the country where prevalence of the virus is higher."" The government position is that no employer should force their staff to return to an unsafe workplace, and they should ensure that vulnerable workers can return safely. The furlough scheme has so far supported the wages of 9.6 million people at a cost to the taxpayer of Â£34.7bn, and the government has supported business through measures including tax deferrals, VAT cuts, business rates relief, rent moratoriums, and loans.

Tiny elephant shrew rediscovered after 50 years,"The animal is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand A little-known mammal related to an elephant but as small as a mouse has been rediscovered in Africa after 50 years of obscurity. The last scientific record of the ""lost species"" of elephant shrew was in the 1970s, despite local sightings. The creature was found alive and well in Djibouti, a country in the Horn of Africa, during a scientific expedition. Elephant shrews, or sengis, are neither elephants nor shrews, but related to aardvarks, elephants and manatees. They have distinctive trunk-like noses, which they use to feast on insects. There are 20 species of sengis in the world, and the Somali sengi (Elephantulus revoilii) is one of the most mysterious, known to science only from 39 individuals collected decades ago and stored in museums. The species was previously known only from Somalia, hence its name. Steven Heritage, a research scientist at the Duke University Lemur Center in Durham, US, and a member of the expedition to the Horn of Africa in 2019, said he was thrilled to put the species ""back on the radar"". He told the BBC: ""We were really excited and elated when we opened the first trap that had an elephant shrew in it, a Somali sengi. ""We did not know which species occurred in Djibouti and when we saw the diagnostic feature of a little tufted tail, we looked at each other and we knew that it was something special."" The creature lives in a dry, rocky habitat The scientists had heard reports of sightings in Djibouti, and Houssein Rayaleh, a Djiboutian research ecologist and conservationist who joined the trip, believed he had seen the animal before. He said while people living in Djibouti never considered the sengis to be ""lost"", the new research brings the Somali sengi back into the scientific community, which is valued. ""For Djibouti this is an important story that highlights the great biodiversity of the country and the region and shows that there are opportunities for new science and research here,"" he said. The team set more than 1,000 traps at 12 locations, baiting the traps with a concoction of peanut butter, oatmeal and yeast. They caught one of the creatures in the first trap they set in the dry, rocky landscape of Djibouti. In total, they saw 12 sengis during their expedition and obtained the first-ever photos and video of live Somali elephant shrews for scientific documentation. They did not observe any immediate threats to the species' habitat, which is inaccessible and far from farming and human developments. The abundance of the species seems similar to other elephant shrews and its range may extend beyond Somalia into Djibouti and possibly Ethiopia. Djibouti has valuable biodiversity, much of which is unknown The Somali sengi is one of the 25 ""most wanted lost species"" of the charity, Global Wildlife Conservation. ""Usually when we rediscover lost species, we find just one or two individuals and have to act quickly to try to prevent their imminent extinction,"" said Robin Moore. ""This is a welcome and wonderful rediscovery during a time of turmoil for our planet, and one that fills us with renewed hope for the remaining small mammal species on our most wanted list, such as the DeWinton's golden mole, a relative of the sengi, and the Ilin Island cloudrunner."" DNA analysis shows that the Somali sengi is most closely related to other species from as far away as Morocco and South Africa, placing it in a new genus. The mammal has somehow dispersed across great distances over time, leaving biologists with a new puzzle. The scientists plan to launch another expedition in 2022 to GPS radio-tag individual sengis to study their behaviour and ecology. Kelsey Neam of Global Wildlife Conservation added: ""Finding that the Somali sengi exists in the wild is the first step in conservation. Now that we know it survives, scientists and conservationists will be able to ensure it never disappears again."" The research is published in the journal Peer J. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"Pizza Express to close 73 sites hitting 1,100 jobs","Pizza Express is to close 73 of its UK restaurants with the potential loss of 1,100 jobs. The chain, which at the moment has 454 UK outlets, said it had cut a deal to reduce rent costs. It said although most of its restaurants have been profitable over the past three years, earnings had been declining. Pizza Express also confirmed it had hired advisers from Lazard to lead a sale process for the business. It is currently majority owned by Chinese firm Hony Capital. Zoe Bowley, Pizza Express's managing director for the UK and Ireland, said: ""Unfortunately, the impact of the global pandemic has meant that we have had to make some incredibly tough decisions to safeguard Pizza Express for the long term."" Ms Bowley said that in most cases, the stores selected for closure are near to another Pizza Express that has already reopened or will be reopening soon. She added that the process ""will protect the jobs of over 9,000 of our colleagues"". The outlets to close are: Aberdeen, Belmont St Aylesbury Barnstaple, Three Tuns Biggleswade Billericay Birmingham, Corporation St Birmingham, Mailbox Bournemouth, Post Office Road Bramhall Bristol, Berkeley Square Bristol, Regent Street Bromsgrove Bruton Place, London Charlotte Street, London Chippenham Dalton Park Darlington Dudley, Merry Hill Earls Court, Earls Court Road, London Edinburgh, Holyrood Formby Fulham Palace Road, London Glasgow, Princes Square Glossop Gosforth Grantham Halifax Hampstead, London Hatch End Hereford Heswall Ipswich, Lloyds Avenue Leeds, Crown Street Leeds, Horsforth Ludlow Lymington Melton Mowbray Midhurst Milton Keynes, Hub Moseley New Brighton Newcastle Newport, Isle of Wight Newport, South Wales Northallerton Nottingham, Goosegate O2 Finchley, London Orpington Oxford, Oxford Castle Poole Port Solent Ramsgate Reading, St Mary's Butts Scarborough Sheffield, Devonshire Street Sheffield, The Moor Shirley Southport, Old Bank Stafford Staines Stoke Stourbridge Sudbury Torquay Uxbridge Wakefield Walsall Wapping Wardour Street, London Weston-super-Mare Whiteley Village Whitstable Wrexham 1965:Pizza Express founder, the late Peter Boizot, brought a pizza oven from Napoli and a chef from Sicily to open his first restaurant in London's Soho. 1992:Mr Boizot grew his empire over the following almost-three decades before selling it for Â£15m to Hugh Osmond and Luke Johnson, the man who was - until recently - chairman of Patisserie Valerie.

"'No real justice' for PC Harper, widow says","This video can not be played Lissie Harper said she was ""totally surprised and disappointed"" at the manslaughter verdict The widow of PC Andrew Harper has said it was ""heartbreaking"" to be denied ""real justice"" over his death. Lissie Harper, 29, said people had been ""outraged"" after jurors cleared three men of murdering her husband following a trial at the Old Bailey in July. She has launched a campaign for killers of emergency workers to face mandatory life sentences. PC Harper's killers had been accused of murder but were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. PC Harper, 28, suffered catastrophic injuries when he was dragged behind a getaway car driven by Henry Long in Berkshire last August. Long, 19, wasjailed for 16 years while his passengers Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both 18, were sentenced to 13 years each. The last picture of Mr and Mrs Harper was taken four days before the officer died Mrs Harper told the BBC she had received ""many messages from people who are outraged"" since the verdicts and sentences were handed down. She said her experience at the Old Bailey, which included reading a victim impact statement, and the ""disappointing"" trial result, had inspired her campaign. Speaking in the witness box was ""one of the hardest things"", she added. ""I had the defendants on my left not really caring what I was saying but I felt it important to speak directly to the judge and tell him what they'd taken from us,"" she said. ""We had the sense that, although it was going to be an awful and long journey, at the end of it we might at least get some justice for Andrew. ""So at the end of it, to not get any real justice is heartbreaking."" PC Harper and Lissie had been together since they were at secondary school The trial heard how PC Harper had responded to reports of a quad bike theft with a colleague hours after their shift had ended. As he attempted to apprehend one suspect, his feet became entangled in a rope trailing behind a getaway car which led to him being dragged to his death. Mrs Harper said it ""wasn't until I was looking at them [the defendants] in the eye, that I felt the disgrace and just how unfair it is"". ""They knew what they had taken away and the effect that it's had on so many people,"" she said. ""They could hear my words so if, even on the outside, they may not show any sort of remorse I hope that in some way they feel the guilt inside they should feel."" Jessie Cole, Henry Long and Albert Bowers (L-R) were convicted of killing PC Harper The sentences of PC Harper's killers prompted Mrs Harper and PC Harper's mother Deborah Adlam to launch campaigns calling for tougher sentences for killers of emergency service workers. Mrs Harper's campaign, which has been renamed Harper's Law, calls for all ""criminals convicted of killing a police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor, prison officer or paramedic to be jailed for life. No ifs. No buts"". She said the campaign, backed by the Police Federation of England and Wales, would ""help fix"" a ""broken"" justice system. Mrs Harper, who like her husband is from Wallingford in Oxfordshire, said Harper's Law was ""about the protection [emergency workers] need and potentially a deterrent for criminals"". Lissie Harper said the general public had been outraged by the outcome of the trial She hopes to meet Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel to discuss her campaign after they both sent letters to her offering their support during the court case. Mr Justice Edis, the sentencing judge, said each of the jail terms for PC Harper's killers had to reflect ""the seriousness of this case"". The maximum sentence a judge can impose for manslaughter is life imprisonment but they must specify a minimum term to be served. The Attorney General's Office said it had been asked to review the sentences and has until 28 August to decide if the Court of Appeal should review them. Mrs Harper said her husband was the ""kindest, loveliest, most selfless person you will ever meet"" Mrs Harper said her husband ""just wanted to protect people. He knew what was right and what was wrong and would have worked all the hours if he could"". ""Andrew made the ultimate sacrifice and it wasn't just his life - it was his future and my future and the lives of everyone who loved him,"" she added. ""I constantly felt that he had my back and that's why Harper's Law is so important for me. I want to do it for him.""

Coronavirus smell loss 'different from bad cold',"The loss of smell that can accompany coronavirus is unique and different from that experienced by someone with a bad cold or flu, say European researchers who have studied the experiences of patients. When Covid-19 patients have smell loss it tends to be sudden and severe. And they usually don't have a blocked, stuffy or runny nose - most people with coronavirus can still breathe freely. Another thing that sets them apart is their ""true"" loss of taste. It's not that their taste is somewhat impaired because their sense of smell is out of action, say the researchers in the journalRhinology,external. Coronavirus patients with loss of taste really cannot tell the difference between bitter or sweet. Experts suspect this is because the pandemic virus affects the nerve cells directly involved with smell and taste sensation. The main symptoms of coronavirus are: high temperature new, continuous cough loss of smell or taste Anyone with these symptoms should self-isolate and arrange to have aswab test to check if they have the virus,external. Members of their household should isolate too to prevent possible spread. Coronavirus: What are the rules? This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? Lead investigator Prof Carl Philpott, from the University of East Anglia, carried out smell and taste tests on 30 volunteers: 10 with Covid-19, 10 with bad colds and 10 healthy people with no cold or flu symptoms. Smell loss was much more profound in the Covid-19 patients. They were less able to identify smells, and they were not able to discern bitter or sweet tastes at all. Prof Philpott, who works with the charity Fifth Sense, which was set up to help with people with smell and taste disorders, said: ""There really do appear to be distinguishing features that set the coronavirus apart from other respiratory viruses. ""This is very exciting because it means that smell and taste tests could be used to discriminate between Covid-19 patients and people with a regular cold or flu."" He said people could do their own smell and taste tests at home using products like coffee, garlic, oranges or lemons and sugar. He stressed that diagnostic throat and nose swab tests were still essential if someone thought they might have coronavirus. The senses of smell and taste return within a few weeks in most people who recover from coronavirus, he added. Coronavirus wiped out my sense of smell Prof Andrew Lane is an expert in nose and sinus problems at Johns Hopkins University in the US. He and his team have been studying tissue samples from the back of the nose to understand how coronavirus might cause loss of smell and have published the findings in theEuropean Respiratory Journal,external. They identified extremely high levels of an enzyme which were present only in the area of the nose responsible for smelling. This enzyme, called ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme II), is thought to be the ""entry point"" that allows coronavirus to get into the cells of the body and cause an infection. The nose is one of the places where Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters the body. Prof Lane said: ""We are now doing more experiments in the lab to see whether the virus is indeed using these cells to access and infect the body. ""If that's the case, we may be able to tackle the infection with antiviral therapies delivered directly through the nose.""

Northern Ireland warns of virus 'treacherous slope',"Health Minister Robin Swann has urged people to follow the guidance and be vigilant Robin Swann has given the strongest hint yet that local lockdown measures or other restrictions could soon be reimposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 in NI. The health minister was speaking at the first Stormont press conference to take place in more than six weeks. On Tuesday, one more death was recorded bringing the death toll to 559. Mr Swann warned that NI was in danger of ""sliding down a very slippery and treacherous slope"". Forty-one new cases of coronavirus have also been recorded by the Department of Health, bringing its total to 6,471. NI's Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young said officials were seeing an indication of an increase in hospital admissions, but that they remained at a ""low level"". ""If cases continue to rise it's inevitable hospital admissions and deaths will rise in the future,"" he told the press conference. Almost 300 new cases have been confirmed in Northern Ireland over the past seven days. Mr Swann warned that people needed to realise the virus was still present in Northern Ireland. ""It is not inevitable, we can still arrest that slide but this requires decisive action from all of us,"" he added. ""Covid-19 won't go away just because we are fed up with it."" The minister said he wanted to ""address doubters and critics"" who had accused him of exaggerating the threat posed by the virus. ""They'll say infections are mainly impacting young people - this argument overlooks the fact there can be a time lag between infection and people becoming ill,"" added Mr Swann. He said there were always fine judgements to be made, but warned that the executive would soon need to consider the next steps in a bid to stop the virus from spreading more widely within the community. ""The time is coming for the executive to consider fresh and concrete actions to prevent further spread of the virus,"" said the minister. ""This could include imposing localised restrictions or general measures or a combination of both. Mr Swann said Covid-19 would not go away just because people were getting fed up with it ""Given where we are now, Thursday's executive meeting will have important decisions and options to consider."" The executive has to regularly consider the coronavirus lockdown restrictions, the latest of these being due to take place in two days' time. Prof Ian Young, the chief scientific advisor, said the figures showed that NI has a higher rate per 100,000 of the population than the rest of the UK at present. He said Northern Ireland's rate currently showed 24 cases per 100,000 over the past 14 days, evidence that pointed to the virus spreading again. Prof Young added that the number of new cases had increased 10-fold since the start of July and warned that ""increased testing is not sufficient to explain the increasing number of cases"". Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride said he did not want anyone to be in a position to reflect in the future and think they should have done more or ""listened more carefully to the advice"". He said the executive could need to look at restrictions on the number of people gathering outdoors. ""If indeed we see particular clusters related to particular establishments such as pubs or restaurants those also may be things we need to look at,"" he added. During Tuesday's press conference, Mr Swann also said the Department of Health's contract tracing app for Covid-19 had been downloaded almost 276,000 times so far. The department is also expanding its flu vaccination programme ahead of the winter season, due to the ongoing pandemic. The programme officially begins on 1 October, however the department said it was likely that deliveries of the vaccine will arrive from the end of this month, enabling the programme to commence in September once GPs have received their initial orders. The current groups eligible for a free flu vaccination are people aged 65 and over, pregnant women, those aged under 65 years of age in clinical ""at risk"" groups, all children aged 2 to 4, primary school pupils and frontline health and social care workers. The department said additional supplies had been secured so that other groups of people could receive a free vaccination this year, which include: Household contacts of those who received shielding letters during the Covid-19 pandemic can request vaccination via their GP Staff in independent care homes School children who will be in the first year of secondary school from September 2020 The programme could be extended by the end of the year to include those in the 50 to 64 age group, depending on eligibility of the vaccine, and will be phased to prioritise people deemed to be at risk.

Ireland at 'tipping point' as Covid-19 cases rise,"People are being urged to work from home and not use public transport The Republic of Ireland's cabinet has reversed some of its lockdown relaxation measures as it attempts to deal withrising Covid-19 case numbers. Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said: ""We are at a tipping point."" He added that a few weeks ago there were just 61 new reported cases for a seven day period but last week there were 533 cases. The tightening of restrictions comes ahead of the reopening of schools over the next two weeks. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said that if the current rates of Covid-19 continue to rise ""it will be impossible to stop the spread of the virus to our most vulnerable and our most compromised"". On Tuesday, a further coronavirus-related death was reported, bringing the Republic of Ireland's total to 1,775. There were 190 more confirmed cases of Covid-19. Crowds attending outdoor events, including sports, are to be reduced from 200 to 15. Indoor gatherings - excluding shops, restaurants and other businesses - are to be restricted to six people. Those aged over 70 are again being asked to stay at home as much as possible. People are also once again being encouraged to work from home and to avoid public transport where possible. Consideration is to be given as to whether GardaÃ­ (Irish police) should get new powers to intervene where they believe social distancing rules are not being complied with. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said there is a risk the virus could spread ""to our most vulnerable and our most compromised"" In an initial response to the measures the leader of Labour party, Alan Kelly, has said the measures send out the wrong signal and will affect morale. The restrictions will remain in place until 13 September at the earliest. Following Tuesday's cabinet meeting, Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly told a press conference that multiple clusters had emerged in homes and workplaces around the country. Mr Donnelly said the 14-day cumulative cases per 100,000 of population is now 26 and the Republic of Ireland's rate of growth in the past two weeks was the fourth highest in Europe. The number of coronavirus cases rose by 200 on Saturday, although the daily tally on subsequent days was lower. The number reported on Monday was 56, down from 66 on Sunday.

Education minister 'truly sorry' over exam results,"Students gathered outside the Senedd last weekend to protest against the grading system Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams has apologised ""directly and unreservedly"" for the way A-level results were handled last week. There was outrage after42% of A-level grades in Waleswere downgraded. On Monday ministersabandoned the systemused to calculate the results, awarding assessments made by teachers instead. Ms Williams said she was ""truly sorry"" for a process that made a stressful time ""worse"" for some students. The minister made the apology in asocial media video,external, and in evidence to a Senedd committee, a day after the U-turn. ""For our young people, and indeed everyone in Wales, the last few months have been and continue to be a stressful time,"" she said. ""It has been a time of anguish for people right across the country. ""I am sorry that, for some of our young people, the results process has made that worse."" Allow Twitter content?

""Recent months have thrown up unexpected, new and complex challenges,"" she said. ""Working with Qualifications Wales and the WJEC we looked for an approach which provided fairness and balanced out differences in the standards applied to judgments in schools. ""But, as I announced yesterday, and given decisions elsewhere, the balance of fairness now lies with awarding centre assessment grades to students."" Student tells schools minister: 'You've ruined my life' Teacher estimates to be used for Welsh exam grades How will unis cope with extra students? And other questions The apology marks a change in tone from the First Minister Mark Drakeford, who said on Monday he was ""sorry for those young people who've had to live through such an uncertain period"", but defended the system that had been used. Some of his comments after the U-turn were dubbed ""pretty shocking"" by Blaenau Gwent Labour AM Alun Davies, in atweet,external. Ms Williams' apology was the second that day from a Welsh Government minster, after Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was sorry for any anxiety and stress caused. UK government Education Minister Gavin Williamson has apologised for exam""distress"" in England, where ministers have also moved to grades estimated by teachers. Similar decisions were taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland. A-levels results were published on Thursday As well as A-levels, teacher assessed grades will be used for GCSEs, AS-levels, skills challenge certificates and the Welsh Baccalaureate. Last week's results in Wales were produced by a system known as standardisation - designed to ensure grades were ""as fair as possible"" and consistent with previous years. But it was criticised by students and politicians for producing unfair grades for individual students. GCSE results are to be published on Thursday. The Liberal Democrat education minister told the Senedd's education committee that she was not informed of the scale of the impact of using the algorithm to moderate A-level results until 10 August, three days before the results were due to be announced. She said she had been told on that day that 42% of grades would be depressed. ""I was given those results on the 10th of August, and we were concerned,"" she said. Ms Williams said the Welsh Government was ""particularly concerned"" about whether there might be a ""disproportionate effect"" on pupils receiving free school meals and had asked for more data. She said the WJEC supplied that information to Qualifications Wales the following evening, and it was given to her the morning after that - Wednesday - the day before the results came out. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford defended the A-level results system after the U-turn on Monday Lynne Neagle, chairwoman of the Senedd education select committee, thanked Ms Williams for her apology but said her colleagues ""need to know what the Welsh Government is doing to make sure this does not happen again"". She added: ""No one can predict if or when we may see another lockdown like this one, so we must learn from these experiences and avoid the confusing, confidence-sapping decisions we have seen over the last few weeks."" Later, in an interview with BBC Wales, Ms Williams insisted the new results would ""absolutely"" be credible, and ""young people should not feel that they aren't"". But she said the original system had been robust ""there or thereabouts"", with 95% of students having received either a grade at the level their teacher predicted or within one grade of that. Ms Williams' earlier comments followed calls for a ""full and proper apology to the young people of Wales"" from Plaid Cymru. It also came after a long day of evidence at the Senedd committee from officials involved in the process, where the chief executive of the Welsh examinations board, the WJEC, defended the algorithm used for A-level results. Ian Morgan said that system would have meant grades A* to E would have been up by 1% from last year and A* to A would have risen by 2.9%, with A* up 0.1% on 2019, with 1.7% of candidates reaching that level. He said the decision to use teachers' estimates instead meant 99.9% of candidates achieving grades A* to E. There was now a 13.4% increase in candidates getting A* to A, meaning 40.4% reaching that standard. Earlier on BBC Radio Wales Mr Morgan said that to ""some extent"" he was probably disappointed with the U-turn. ""I think there's a huge amount of rigour that's gone into the standardisation process,"" he said. ""I'm not here to try and question the effort teachers have put in, these were a complex set of circumstances and teachers have worked diligently."" Mr Morgan acknowledged there were ""imperfections"" with some students not receiving the correct grades - but said these would have been weeded out during the appeals process. Jo Richards, regulation director of Qualifications Wales, acknowledged a delay to BTEC results. She said students students should expect their results by the end of Tuesday. ""We've had notification of that from Pearson and we are working with them and are asking for regular updates, they are working through that data,"" she said. Meanwhile, teaching union NASUWT said ""urgent lessons"" need to be learned. General Secretary Dr Patrick Roach said: ""The problems that have been left to unfold over recent days have impacted not only on those young people who were receiving their awards this year, but also the confidence of the thousands of pupils who are now preparing for examinations next year.""

Call for urgent review into exam results 'fiasco',"Students took part in a protest in Leeds after the government's U-turn on the calculated grades system The education secretary has been urged to launch a review into the handling of A-level and GCSE results after exams were cancelled due to coronavirus. A union for education leaders, such as head teachers, says it will write to Gavin Williamson over the ""fiasco"". Mr Williamson apologised to students after reversing how A-levels and GCSEs are graded, following heavy criticism. Meanwhile, pupils will get GCSE results on Thursday as planned, the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) said. The confirmation comes following confusion over how results day would run after the government U-turn. Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the JCQ's confirmation would be a ""great relief"" to all concerned. The government decision to give A-level and GCSE students grades estimated by their teachers, rather than via an algorithm, means that tens of thousands of A-level students may now have the grades to trade up to their first-choice university offers. It has prompted concerns about the number of available places, with top universities warning that students who now have higher grades could still be asked to defer if there is no space left on their chosen course. What's happening with university admissions? How will universities cope with extra students? And other questions A-levels and GCSEs: How did the exam algorithm work? And uncertainty continues for students as the admissions service, Ucas, and individual universities have yet to be given access to the upgraded results. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, said problems could arise around issues of ""capacity, staffing, placements and facilities - particularly with the social distance measures in place"". Universities minister Michelle Donelan said she wanted to ensure any students who had accepted a ""different course"" than planned, as a result of being downgraded last week, should be able to ""change their mind and to reverse that decision"". She said No 10 was working with universities to help ""boost the capacity available"" in order to ""minimise the amount of students that will be looking to defer."" Senior Tory MP Huw Merriman suggested students could be compensated with reduced tuition fees. ""For the cohort coming up to university, I think it's all about making it up to them and saying 'we understand that you have been messed around over last week',"" he told the BBC's PM programme. By Hannah Richardson, BBC education reporter There is still doubt as to whether the education system will do right by the Class of Covid. Will their chosen universities be able to accommodate them? Or have they given their degree place away already? Will they have to come back next year and fight it out with students who have missed even more school? And for the first time since this ageing education journalist can remember, exam boards are not holding their usual mind-boggling briefing on GCSE results. So for some time at least, there will be no details of how the nation has done in their general school certificate examinations. Roll on the start of term - although that's uncertain, too. Hundreds of thousands of children in the UK have had their education disrupted by the pandemic afterschools, colleges and nurseries were ordered to shut in March- resulting in the cancellation of all assessments and exams. The ASCL - which is writing the letter to Mr Williamson - said a review was urgently needed into ""what went wrong"" with the grading system. ""This degree of transparency is necessary at a time when public confidence has been badly shaken,"" said ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton. Mr Barton also called on No 10 and Ofqual to put in place a ""robust contingency plan"" for students sitting GCSEs and A-levels next summer in the event of further coronavirus-related disruption. Both Frances Ramos (left) and Zainab Ali were left unsure if they would get their first-choice university places, despite their grades being bumped up Frances Ramos, 18, from Towcester, Northamptonshire, said she was pleased to be given her predicted grades of ABB - up from the BCD she received last Thursday. But she said the U-turn ""does feel like it's a bit too late"" and added: ""I kind of wish the government had done this on Thursday."" She is now waiting to hear if her first choice, the University of Liverpool, will accept her to study this year. Zainab Ali, 18, from London, also thought the government should have acted sooner. ""I think it's a shame. After the damage is done, that's when they will take action and I find it quite frustrating,"" she said. The U-turn should now mean Zainab is able to attend Queen Mary University, London. Students relieved and annoyed after A-level U-turn The University and College Union (UCU) and National Union of Students (NUS) have also written to the education secretary, urging No 10 to help students who have missed out on their first-choice courses and calling for financial support for the higher education sector. UCU general secretary Jo Grady said staff were facing ""unbearable workloads"" due to the fallout over exam results. She added that ""substantial financial support"" was needed ""so universities can protect all jobs, safely welcome students and continue to provide world class teaching and research"". And Ms Grady criticised Mr Williamson's decision to suspend a cap on student numbers for universities - effectively allowing institutions to accept unlimited numbers this year - because she said it meant ""certain universities can hoover up students, hitting the finances of other institutions"". Despite the cap being suspended, some universities have said numbers will have to remain limited, particularly on vocational courses such as medicine and dentistry. Ucas was unable to say how many students had not been able to take up places due to their results being downgraded. Earlier,Mr Williamson said he was ""incredibly sorryfor the distress"" caused to pupils. This video can not be played Gavin Williamson says his focus is on ""making sure that every student gets the grades that they deserve"" Mr Williamson said it had been the common view of the government, exams regulator Ofqual, and the devolved administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland - of different political parties - that the system in place was more robust and ""significantly better"" than that in Scotland, afteran earlier U-turn in Scotland. But after the release of A-level results on Thursday he said it had become ""increasingly apparent that there were too many young people that quite simply hadn't got the grade they truly deserved"". Mr Williamson's critics had called for him to resign or be sacked, butthere are several reasons why he hasn't yet received a ministerial P45, says BBC political correspondent Iain Watson. Mr Williamson would not say whether he had offered his resignation to Prime Minister Boris Johnson during interviews on Tuesday Ofqual's algorithm came under fireafter data showed its downgrading of about 40% of A-level grades in England had affected state schools more than private institutions. Ministers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales all decided on Monday - four days after A-level results were issued - to revert to teacher assessed grades rather than the algorithm.

What's happening with university admissions?,"As students begin the new term, they'll find many Covid restrictions have been lifted. There will be more face-to-face teaching, but things won't be entirely normal. Thegovernment wants all students to get vaccinated,external, but won't exclude those who aren't. Universities are also calling on undergraduates to get jabbed and many have on-site vaccination centres. What do under-30s need to know about the vaccine? Only double-jabbed people will be allowed to go to nightclubs and some other venuesin Scotland from 1 October. I'm fully vaccinated, but how can I prove it? Freshers' Week events include parties, club nights, sports sessions and society fairs. Many universities will hold in-person events for the first time since 2019. But experts warn any sessions where people from across the country mix, could become ""super spreader"" events. UCL professor Susan Michie, a member of the Sage group of scientists which advises the government, saidfreshers' events are high risk,external, especially if they involve alcohol. Earlier this year, Scottish universitieswere advised to postpone ""mass activities"" for freshers,but events are going ahead. Universities will offer much more face-to-face teaching this year. The Russell Group of leading universities saysstaff are preparing for most seminars, small group classes and lab work to be taught in person.,externalHowever it sayssome online learning will continue- partly to minimise disruption in the event of future Covid spikes. Students should ask their institution about plans for their course. Students are likely to be askedto wear a face covering in crowded areassuch as libraries, and will be encouraged totake regular Covid tests. Staff will be asked to test twice a week.

The National Union of Students,externaland theStudent Minds mental health charity,externalwant the government to provide financial support for all students, with extra help for those on lower incomes.

How will unis cope? And other questions,"A-level and GCSE students in England will be given grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm, after a government U-turn. Experts Eddie Playfair and Catherine Sezen, senior policy managers at theAssociation of Colleges,,externalare answering your questions. Williamson 'incredibly sorry' for exam distress U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs as teacher grades used How have exam results been decided this year? Catherine Sezen and Eddie Playfair offer personalised advice on what to do next Now that we know that the grades predicted by teachers - also known as centre assessment grades, or CAGs for short - will stand, this means that there will be a five-point increase in A* grades and a 10-point increase in A grades or above. University courses may well be able to manage the increased demand for high tariff courses, particularly if there is a relaxation of the cap on growth - called the student number controls. Health Secretary Matthew Hancock has saidthe government is also considering lifting the cap on medical places. I'm so sorry you missed your firm offer. First of all it may be worth revisiting this with Durham in case the position has changed. Universities are working hard to honour the offers they've made, whether UK or international, and Covid-19 has disrupted education for students across the world. UK and international applicants are not really competing for the same places though, as the admissions and funding systems are different. For example, the removal of Student Number Controls means that many universities could now offer more places to their UK students, and this does not apply to international students. I'm afraid the triple lock system has been overtaken by events and your son's D will stand, since it is higher than the CAG. There may be some grounds for an appeal and it's worth discussing this with his college or school. There's no reason to expect that this year's higher-than-usual grades will impact the opportunities for next year's students. Universities will be aware of the different grade profiles in different years and are likely to adjust their offers and decision-making accordingly. If your daughter's offer has been confirmed this shouldn't be withdrawn. Students may have some opportunity to change their minds but confirmed offers should stand. The government's announcement thatit is considering lifting the cap on the number of medical student placesmay also help. As far we are aware, students awaiting their GCSE grades on Thursday will receive their CAG from their school or college - and students who received their A or AS-level results last Thursday will be reissued their CAG. If students' calculated grades were higher than the CAG, their calculated grade will stand. If you received results last Thursday, the best thing to do is to contact your school or college. If you are expecting results this week, your school or college should confirm the process. Schools and colleges have very thorough quality assurance systems in place to ensure that results are not biased. The grades given by teachers are moderated at department and centre level to ensure that they are as fair as possible. Pupils protesting outside Education Secretary Gavin Williamson's constituency office BTecs are structured very differently to A-levels, and so the approach to awarding them is also different. BTecs were not subject to the same statistical moderation process as A-levels. They comprise modular units that students complete and are assessed at regular stages during their course of study, so prior to March 2020, students had already ""banked"" graded units for their qualification. These formed part of the evidence used to award grades for the externally assessed units and the final overall qualification grade. If you have individual concerns about BTec or other technical and vocational qualifications, the best thing to do is to contact your school or college. Universities are used to dealing with fluctuations in numbers between years but at this stage it's impossible to tell whether the number of university places in 2021 will be affected at all. Students taking exams next summer will certainly have been impacted by the disruption this year - and of course further disruption can't be ruled out. There have been some adaptations made to assessment and content for 2021 but the assumption is that public exams will go ahead next summer - the public health situation permitting. If exams take place next year, the grading system should be more like a normal year, but there will be a case for some ""leniency"" to allow for disruption. You are absolutely right - this summer's Centre Assessed Grades are separate from the predicted grades used for UCAS or other purposes and they may not be the same. The process for producing CAGs was careful and rigorous, and was subjected to internal moderation. It is these CAGs and rankings which were submitted to awarding organisations as part of this summer's process. The ""calculated"" grades which were issued last week had been statistically adjusted resulting in 39% of them being downgraded. These have now mostly been superseded by the original CAGs where they are higher. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster - but no one will have lower A-level grades than they got last week and many will have higher grades. If your son has accepted this place and is happy with it he doesn't need to do anything more except perhaps confirm that decision with the university concerned. We can't give a legal opinion on that, but universities are doing their best to honour all the offers they made - including where a student's grade has now changed. They will need a few days to sort this out but they will have been helped by the lifting of student number controls which would have limited how many places they could fill. As far as we know, the autumn series is still going ahead so students will have the opportunity to take exams this autumn as well as next summer - so the ""resit"" option is still available where it makes sense. These are questions which should be raised directly with the IB Organisation. We know that Ofqual has asked it to scrutinise the grades awarded this summer to ensure they have been delivered in line with Ofqual's new process. I'm sure that receiving universities will want to be as flexible and helpful in responding to candidates with IB Diplomas as they were with A-level candidates. We gather that there have been some delays with some BTec awards and we know that Pearson - the company which runs BTecs - is working to resolve this. We think that only 0.5% of BTec centre assessed grades were adjusted downwards and it's not clear whether they will now be moved up. Will BTec students have their grades changed? Ofqual has just published an update on vocational and technical qualifications. Although calculated results have been issued for many vocational and technical qualifications, in only a very few cases has the same kind of statistical standardisation process of CAGs been used and so Monday's announcement shouldn't impact on the majority of vocational qualifications. You can findmore information on the Ofqual website.,externalIf you still have any questions about your result I would suggest that you speak to your school or college. It's possible that more students with Scottish Highers might have a small impact on places available in English universities, but the difference in scale between the two countries probably means this will not be significant overall. I am sure universities will want to honour the offers they've made. This was the year of the results without any exams being taken It's been clear from the start that unfortunately some private candidates would not be able to receive CAGs, and this is obviously far from ideal. It may be possible for them to progress on to the course they want if they can be assessed by the institution they wish to join. There is also the option of taking exams in the autumn which will result in grades which can be used for progression. You will need to discuss this with both your firm and insurance universities as soon as possible, now that you know that your CAG will be your final grade. Now that your son knows what his final grade is, he should discuss this with both his first choice university and also with the university he applied to through clearing. Calculated grades were higher than CAGs for 2.3% of all entries, and these will be honoured. Yes, it is possible to accept an offer and take the exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you on the best option. If your son or daughter is 18 then the college cannot share information with you unless your child agrees, as they are now classified as an adult. They should be able to tell you how results will be sent out, or whether your son or daughter can collect them from the college. The college will be able to provide information, advice and guidance to your son or daughter to help them think about next steps. This might help as the basis of a chat with your child. The best thing to do is to ask the university how long they will keep the place open while you weigh up the options. Universities are being very flexible this year. The alternative offer from your firm choice, including a foundation year, is of course an extra year. If you really want to go to that university it is a good option, but the other university course may also be right for you. Give the university a call and then you will know how long you have got to consider both. Your daughter might get results if the school or college that was going to enter her had sufficient evidence (course work for example) to give her a centre assessed grade. If not there will be an opportunity for your daughter to take an exam in the autumn. The school or college will have more details about that. You need to discuss this with the college or school you attended in 2019-20 to consider the various options open to you. Simply repeating a year is not generally recommended unless there are exceptional circumstances - but of course 2020 has been pretty exceptional! If you have the possibility of progressing to a higher level - for example university - that might be the best option, but don't make any final decisions without getting support and advice from your college or school first. When producing CAGs, centres will have predicted how a student would have performed assuming they had received all the additional support and access arrangements which they require because of a disability. Hopefully, any mock processes would also have included that additional support and this is definitely worth discussing with your centre. The system this year was designed to make sure that the class of 2020 was not disadvantaged, and to produce outcomes which are broadly similar to previous years. So we expect the national grade profile to reflect this. This should provide reassurance for employers, universities and colleges that this year's grades have an equivalent value to those of previous years. How can I find a new job? The autumn exams are an opportunity for students entered this summer to take an exam. The grade they are awarded will have equal value and so this can inform any applications they are making to university in 2021. The current plan is for exams next summer to go ahead as normal, with a few alterations, and they should be seen as equivalent to any other year. In the future this is certainly worth exploring, but given the timeframe this year it would have been very difficult to ensure that all students would have been adequately prepared to undertake exams online. Not all students will have had appropriate equipment or spaces to undertake exams. Do you have a question about your exam results? Use the form to send it to us.

Students relieved and annoyed,"A-level students in England will be given grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm,after a government U-turn. Here are some reactions from those who, amid the confusion, still don't know if they have lost their university places. Emily Kingdoesn't feel much better about the government's decision, because ""not that much has changed"". The 18-year-old from Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, says being downgraded from a C to a U in A-level biology last week ""really knocked my confidence"" - and meant she was rejected from the University of Lincoln, where she had an offer to study midwifery. Emily has emailed the university since the government announcement, but still doesn't know if she's in or not. She's got no other offers so will face a year out and will apply again next year if Lincoln say no. ""I'd have to re-do that whole interview process again, which takes up a lot of time and a lot of money,"" she says. Emily says she's not found much comfort in the idea of being awarded her predicted grades. ""I'll always know that I was given a U. And I know that I didn't deserve that grade,"" she says. ""I'm pretty happy [about the U-turn] but also a bit annoyed. This should have happened last week. Or even a month ago."" Like Emily,Josh Reidis also repeatedly refreshing his inbox for email confirmation - he says he has been told there will be a place for him to study theology at Oxford University's Regent's Park College - in line with his initial offer - once he's sent over his teacher assessed grades. ""I'm just completely over the moon. It's been just an utterly horrific few days in terms of stress and anxiety, just trying to get this all sorted. Just to finally have confirmation that our grades will be changed - it's such a relief,"" he says. The 19-year-old, from Woking, says it was ""frustrating"" and ""heart-breaking"" to be downgraded last week. ""I was so furious that I was getting these grades that in no way shape or form represented any of the work I had done over the past two years."" Although his place is more or less secure, Josh's anger hasn't abated. He says the government has had months to come up with an alternative way of grading students whose exams were cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""They've had five or six months to do it, and to get it so wrong - it just puts so much stress on students. And [the confusion] really just showed that, for whatever reason, the students weren't the priority."" ""I'm relieved but quite frustrated at the same time. It's too late,"" saysZainab Ali, 18, from London, minutes after hearing about the U-turn. Zainab's predicted grades were an A* in history, an A in psychology, and a C in chemistry. But after she was given an A, B and a D on results day last week, she lost her place to study psychology at Queen Mary University of London - and was told the course had filled up. ""I'm facing the consequences for the indecisiveness of people who are in charge,"" Zainab says. She'd come to terms with the fact that she's going to her second choice, the University of Westminster, instead - but still feels frustrated because she had ""always wanted"" to go to Queen Mary's since being a child. ""It's just a very vibrant environment and I really had admired that. I just automatically fell in love,"" she says. After first speaking to the BBC, Zainab says Queen Mary decided to offer her a place. The university said on Monday evening that it was ""deeply sympathetic"" to all students affected by the U-turn, and that applicants with revised grades will be guaranteed a place if they meet the terms of their original offer. Although she is now likely to get her first choice of university after all, Zainab says the past week has been an ""awful"" and ""confusing"" experience. ""I felt like I've been really let down. Now [after the U-turn] it's a bit different, but I still feel a bit let down after all of that. It was really, really stressful."" Connor Bragger, 18, from Redditch, was given BCD last Thursday, and needed a BBB to get into a journalism course at Sheffield. He was predicted ABB so should, theoretically, be allowed to go now. But tonight, he's disappointed to find the phone lines for the University of Sheffield's admissions office are closed for the day - so despite the announcement, he doesn't yet know if he'll be heading there in September. ""Results day is [supposed to be] when you get answers - not more questions,"" Connor says. His second choice is the University of Gloucestershire, where he has an unconditional offer. But now he's got the grades for Sheffield, he hopes he can go there. Connor is trying to stay positive, and says he's pleased with the U-turn. ""There were two boxes that I was annoyed about not meeting, which was getting into my first choice, and getting grades I felt like I had earned. So even if I'm unable to get into my first choice, I feel as though I've now got results that I earned from my hard work all year. So if it doesn't all go to plan, I can still keep my head up a little bit higher."" This video can not be played A-level student Nina welcomes the government's U-turn which means she can train to become a vet Kath Burbidge's sonSam Thieris working a shift at B&Q near his home in Willsbridge, Bristol. At the same time, the 18-year-old is on the phone waiting his turn to speak to Cardiff University. He wants to see if they'll make space for him on the dentistry course he initially had an offer for, but was rejected last week as his predicted grades of A*AA were downgraded to BBB. ""I cried for 48 hours and didn't sleep after Thursday. I just feel so sorry for him,"" Kath says. ""He's worked so hard on everything."" Sam's A* in chemistry meant Cardiff offered him a place on their chemistry Masters course. He'd just decided to accept it - and therefore handed in his notice at B&Q - when the news came through that his grades would be bumped up. As she receives updates by text from Sam (he's now 20th in the queue), Kath wonders if he might take the chemistry offer instead. ""He's trying to just make the best of an awful, awful job that just never should have happened. Will he think 'I'll go and do chemistry now', just because he's fed up with the whole thing?""

US stocks hit new high after coronavirus crash,"The speed of this rebound is unusually fast - and surprising given the concerns about the economy A key US stock index has hit a new high despite ongoing worries about the sharp economic impact of the pandemic. The S&P 500, one of the widest and most prominent US market measures, inched higher on Tuesday to close at 3,389.78 - about three points above its 19 February record. Other US indexes have also rebounded. The Nasdaq hit another record after surpassing its prior high in June while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is within about 5% of its February record. US shares have been on an upward path since 23 March, when America's central bank announced a slew of unprecedented economic support measures. Trading: 'I didn't know I'd lose money so fast' US economy suffers sharpest contraction in decades But when the pandemic set in and markets tumbled more than 33%, such a rapid market recovery seemed nearly unthinkable, said William Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird. ""To be even having this conversation right now is remarkable,"" he said. He said the strength and speed of the rebound was especially surprising, given America's continuing struggle to contain the coronavirus and ongoing concerns about the economy. The US saw its sharpest quarterly contraction on record in the three months to July, amid widespread lockdowns. ""It's not surprising that we had a meaningful recovery, but that over the last couple of months we've continued to rally... I'm shocked that we're having this conversation,"" Mr Delwiche said. This video can not be played Despite the economy shrinking, US stocks have rallied Analysts say the recovery is partly due to Federal Reserve moves and other stimulus, as well as demand from investors who are confident the economy will heal and see few better opportunities to make money than on the stock markets. While surprising, such a speedy market rebound is not unprecedented, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. By his calculations, it's actually the third fastest rise to a new high for the S&P after such a deep fall since 1929. But the gains in the US have outstripped many other markets. London's FTSE 100 remains about 20% lower than its January high, while France's CAC 40 is off about 19%. Japan, which has seen its Nikkei 225 index climb back to roughly 4% of its pre-crisis high, has benefited from both aggressive government stimulus and relative success at controlling the virus without mass lockdowns. The unusual strength of the US rebound comes from its tech companies, such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, which have been seen as winners despite lockdowns, along with companies in areas like cloud computing and machine learning. ""We would not be flirting with all-time highs were it not for technology,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. Shares in the S&P 500's tech sector have climbed roughly 25% so far this year, even as other areas remain flat or negative. The energy sector, for example, is down roughly 37% since the beginning of January, while financials are down about 20%. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said that's a warning sign for those who might want to see the new S&P 500 high as a signal about the broader economy. ""There's big dispersion between those that have done well and those that have done poorly,"" he said. The New York Stock Exchange reopened for in-person trading in May after closing the trading floor in March Overall, the S&P 500 is up about 5% since the start of the year. But of the 500 companies in the index, more than half have shares trading lower than they were start of the year, he said. And that's even though the big companies in the S&P 500 index are better equipped to withstand a downturn than many smaller firms. ""We've come a long way and there's a lot of optimism in there and that is concerning,"" Mr Silverblatt said. ""If we don't get what we expect - disappointment is not a good item in the market."" Mr Sandven said unless prospects for the wider economy improve further gains will be limited. Political questions - about whether Washington will approve further economic stimulus and how the US presidential election will play out - could also mean a bumpy ride ahead for investors, he added. ""Clearly there's a lot of optimism riding on a return to growth in 2021,"" Mr Sandven said. ""But there's reason for caution.""

Labour calls for evictions ban to be extended,"The ban on evictions in England should be extended in order to prevent a ""homelessness crisis"", Labour has said. The government introduced the ban in March to help those financially hit by the coronavirus lockdown. Homeless charity Shelter estimates 227,000 private renters have fallen into arrears since the pandemic and could lose their homes when the ban on evictions is lifted on 23 August. The government said it would offer ""appropriate support"" to renters. New evictions in England and Wales had initially been suspended until 25 June, but the pause was extended to 23 August. The Labour-led Welsh government has doubled the notice period required for evictions issued on or after 24 July to six months, excluding cases relating to anti-social behaviour. Meanwhile the Scottish government has proposed extending its ban on evicting renters until March 2021. Fears of homeless surge when eviction ban ends Charities welcome extended Scottish eviction ban All rough sleepers in England 'to be housed' Labour's shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said with the furlough scheme coming to an end and coronavirus infections rising, the government needed to set out how it would prevent a ""self-made homelessness crisis"". ""Veering from crisis to crisis is no way to run a country... after the incompetent handling of the exams fiasco, the government must act now to avoid more chaos of its own making,"" she said. The opposition is pressing for emergency legislation to ensure no one will lose their home because of coronavirus. In a letter to Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, she said Labour did not want to see the ban on evictions lifted until ""the government has introduced changes to our broken housing system that will protect tenants"". Specifically, she said the government should fulfil its manifesto promise and end Section 21 evictions - also known as 'no-fault evictions'. She also called for Section 8 evictions to be changed in order to prevent automatic eviction for tenants whose income had been hit by the pandemic. Section 8 evictions allow landlords to remove tenants before the end of their tenancy agreement. Earlier this week Labour and Lib Dem MPs urged the government to guarantee councils financial support to house rough sleepers for a year and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the ban on evictions should be extended for at least a year. However the National Residential Landlords Association urged ministers to resist calls for a further extension, arguing that the majority of tenants had ""paid their rent as normal or come to a payment arrangement with their landlord during the pandemic"". The organisation said the UK government should instead establish a loan scheme to help renters,similar to the Â£8m packageoffered by the Welsh government. A spokesperson for the Housing, Communities, and Local Government Department said the government had taken ""unprecedented action"" to support renters during the pandemic and would continue to support those affected when the eviction ban lifts. ""We have changed court rules so landlords need to provide more information about their tenants' situation when seeking an eviction - with judges able to adjourn a case if they don't,"" they said. They also said landlords would still need to give tenants three months' notice for possession cases, including Section 21 evictions, until at least 30 September. Landlords in England and Wales can evict their tenants without giving a reason by issuing a Section 21 notice. Normally, this can only be done when the initial fixed term has ended. This notice might be ruled invalid if the landlord hasfailed to stick to certain rules,external, for instance by failing to properly protect a tenant's deposit. The normal notice period for this type of eviction is two months, but this has been extended to three months in England because of the Covid-19 crisis. In Wales this period is now six months, except for cases relating to anti-social behaviour. If tenants fail to leave by the due date on the notice, landlords can then apply to a court to enforce it. To evict a tenant who has broken the terms of a rental agreement, including by not paying rent, landlords can issue a Section 8 notice. Again, if the tenant does not leave by the specified date, landlords can apply to get a court to enforce the notice. As long as the landlord has followed the rules, a judge can then order tenants to leave by a certain date, repay outstanding rent, or both. The government has put new rules in place for when new repossession proceedings are allowed to start again after 23 August. Under the new rules,external, landlords will have to say how the pandemic has affected their tenants financially when applying for a hearing. They will also be required to produce a tenant's full rent arrears history in advance of proceedings, rather than at the hearing itself. Are you at risk of eviction as the ban gets lifted?

Chariots of Fire actor Ben Cross dies aged 72,"Actor Ben Cross, who was best known for playing athlete Harold Abrahams in the film Chariots of Fire, has died at the age of 72. His other roles included the leads in HBO's first ever mini-series, The Far Pavilions, in 1984, and the 1991 horror series Dark Shadows. His representatives said he died ""suddenly"" following a short illness. His daughter Lauren wrote on Facebook that she was ""utterly heartbroken"" that her ""darling father"" had passed away. She said he had been ""sick for a while"" but there had been a ""rapid decline over the past week"". His representatives said he had just finishing shooting horror film The Devil's Light and later this year will appear in a leading role in the romantic drama film Last Letter From Your Lover. He was born Harry Bernard Cross in London to a working-class Catholic family. Ben Cross as British athlete Harold Abrahams in Chariots of Fire After graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (Rada), he moved from the stage to screen and took a minor role in the 1977 war film A Bridge Too Far, which starred Sir Sean Connery and Sir Michael Caine. He became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in the same year, before gaining wider acclaim as Billy Flynn - the lawyer representing murderer Roxie Hart - in a 1978 version of the stage musical Chicago. It was a performance that was widely believed to have earned him his role in 1981's Chariots Of Fire, which went on to win four Oscars including best picture. Cross played Jewish runner Harold Abrahams in the film, which was based on the true story of two British men racing for Olympic gold in 1924. BBC religion editor Martin Bashir said Cross's portrayal of Abrahams had ""captured the burden of being an outsider"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After Chariots of Fire, Cross was cast as a British officer in 19th Century colonial India in The Far Pavilions, which was described by The New York Times as ""the most expensive, ambitious production ever risked by a pay cable service"". He later appeared as Malagant in the 1995 film First Knight and Sarek in the 2009 Star Trek reboot. Cross also played Adolf Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess in the 2006 BBC production Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial. James Bond star Colin Salmon, who worked on The Devil's Light alongside Cross, tweeted: ""It was good working with him, seeing his twinkle & his craft. ""He wrote songs for the Sinatra of Bulgaria, had so many stories & spoke in Bulgarian and German on set. Go Well Ben RIP."" US television and film director Todd Holland also shared a tribute, saying he had met Cross early in his own career. ""We shot a screen test at Pinewood Studios. I went to his home for dinner with his family,"" he said. ""Ben Cross was a lovely man and talented actor. That movie never got made. But... what a classy guy."" Cross, who died in Vienna, Austria, had two children, Lauren and Theo.

Wrexham has highest weekly number of Covid deaths,"There have been nine hospital deaths in Wrexham in the most recent week There were more deaths registered involving coronavirus in Wrexham than any other area of Wales or England, for the second week running, Office for National Statistics figures show. There have been 24 Covid-19 deaths registered in Wales in the week ending 7 August - nine were hospital deaths in Wrexham. This means a rise in deaths from the 10 registered the previous week. Altogether 16 deaths were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area. The ONS figures show deaths in hospitals, care homes and people's homes, and where coronavirus is suspected by a doctor or confirmed. Although there were 16 deaths in north Wales - 15 in hospitals - this is far fewer than at the height of the pandemic in April. But there are more involving the virus being registered than in other health board areas in Wales at the moment. Separate daily figures from Public Health Wales - which deal only with confirmed cases of coronavirus - have been showingmost deaths over the last fortnight have been in north Wales hospitals. In July, there was a spike in infections in Wrexham and in cases caughtat the town's Maelor hospital,with health officials also offering community testing at mobile units for a period. The rate of positive cases in the area has eased off in the last week or so and the number of hospital infections also appears to have dropped in recent weeks. What do the stats in Wales tell us about covid? Hundreds caught virus in hospitals in Wales Depression doubles during coronavirus pandemic Very low numbers of deaths or no deaths at all involving the virus are now being registered when broken down by council areas, the ONS figures show. Below Wrexham, for the same week there were five deaths in Tameside, Greater Manchester, four deaths in both Denbighshire and Kirklees in West Yorkshire. Three deaths were registered in Flintshire, alongside Allerdale in Cumbria, Bradford, Mansfield in Nottinghamshire and Medway in Kent. There were no deaths at all involving the virus in 15 Welsh council areas at all. Speaking at the Welsh Government's weekly news conference, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the number of infections in Wrexham was falling and that there was a ""continuing and improved picture"". ""The evidence shows there has not been widespread community transmission within Wrexham,"" Mr Gething said. ""That's really important - that shows that our system is working as it should do: identifying clusters, taking proactive action. ""And we'll need to see more of that as we see different cases and clusters around the rest of the country."" In Wales, the number of so-called excess deaths is again below what we normally see at this time of year. There were 563 deaths from all causes, which is eight fewer than the five-year average. This is seen as a useful tool in looking at how coronavirus is progressing. The total number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales up to 7 August was 2,544 - for deaths to be included in these figures, they must have been registered by 15 August. The weekly ONS figures also show there were six deaths in care homes. Separate figures published by Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW) show Covid-19 was confirmed or suspected in 742 deaths of care home residents in the pandemic up to 14 August. This makes up 19% of all deaths notified to CIW, which is now updating its figures every two weeks.

Lockdown party house closed for three months,"This video can not be played A police helicopter used heat-sensitive cameras to record the party from above A house where about 200 people attended a lockdown party has been subjected to a three-month closure order with only the owner allowed access. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and Manchester City Council obtained a court order after a party at the house on Harlow Drive, Gorton, on Saturday. Officers were hit with missiles as they tried to break up the gathering. Insp Jim Adams of GMP said: ""This incident was completely unacceptable and incomprehensible."" He added: ""I am pleased that the court has accepted our application to extend the 48-hour closure notice to ensure that there are no further illegal large gatherings at this property."" GMP has already issued a Â£100 fixed penalty notice to a 27-year-old woman who organised the party. Closure orders are made under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 when disorderly, offensive or criminal behaviour has taken place on a premises in order to stop it happening again. Officers were called at about 22:10 BST on Saturday to a gathering of around 200 people, GMP said. Nigel Murphy, deputy leader of Manchester City Council, welcomed the ""tough action"" by the court and said: ""This was a particularly flagrant breach of Covid-19 restrictions, which are in place to protect everyone in our communities and must be respected. ""Public health must be our first priority and selfish breaches of the rules will not be tolerated."" Lockdown restrictions on social gatherings remainin Greater Manchester and some parts of northern England, despite measures being relaxed elsewhere across the country.

"UK-EU trade deal possible next month, says No 10","Negotiations over a free trade agreement between the UK and EU began in early March The UK still believes it can agree a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU next month, according to Downing Street. The PM's spokesman said UK negotiators would ""continue to plug the gaps"" when talks enter their seventh round in Brussels on Wednesday. The two sides remain divided over competition rules, fishing rights and how a deal would be enforced. The UK has ruled out extending the December deadline to reach an agreement. This week's talks are the lastscheduled negotiating round,externalahead of the autumn, although both sides have previously said talks would continue in September. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier had dinner with UK counterpart David Frost on Tuesday evening, with talks set to conclude on Friday. UK-EU trade deal some way off, both sides say What are the sticking points in the trade talks? What's happening in post-Brexit trade talks? On Tuesday, ahead of talks resuming, a European Commission spokesman said a deal would need to be agreed by October ""at the latest"". Mr Barnier has said an agreement is required by this date so it can be ratified before the UK's current post-Brexittransition periodends, in December. After the last negotiation round in London, he accused the UK of not showing a ""willingness to break the deadlock"" over difficult issues. Mr Frost said EU offers to break the deadlock had failed to honour the ""fundamental principles which we have repeatedly made clear"". But he said the UK, which has so far insisted on a series of separate deals in different areas, was also willing to consider a ""simpler"" structure for an agreement. He added the EU had shown a ""pragmatic approach"" over British demands to limit the role of the European Court of Justice after the transition period ends. Compromises on both sides are inevitable if a deal is to be struck, but don't expect breakthroughs this week. For now, much of Europe is still on holiday, or dealing with the coronavirus crisis. Boris Johnson is also busy dealing with the fallout from the exams U-turn. The EU wants a deal, but the keenness for an agreement - even a thin one - doesn't mean they will settle for a deal at any price. France is jumpy that Michel Barnier may be so keen to be seen to get a deal done with UK this autumn that he ""could be tempted to give away too much"". Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel repeats over and over that the EU won't agree to anything it believes would damage its single market. The EU believes Mr Johnson needs to show he can reach a deal, especially after controversy surrounding the government's initial handling of Covid-19. But the politics of compromise shouldn't be underestimated. Compromise can be found - but if it comes it is likely to be last-minute, around October time. The EU thinks a deal is still more likely than no deal. But only just. Among the issues the negotiating sides will discuss this week are transport, police co-operation, fishing rights and rules on investment. They will also discuss post-Brexit rules on competition and state support for companies, one of the thorniest issues in the talks to date. The UK is due to stop following EU rules on so-called ""state aid"" at the end of the transition period, and has not unveiled details of its subsequent regime. Mr Barnier has said the EU will require ""robust"" guarantees in this area if it is to agree a deal, and has called for more details on the UK's future plans.

Mali president seized by mutinying soldiers,"This video can not be played The mutinying soldiers were cheered by crowds as they reached the capital Bamako Soldiers in Mali have detained the country's president, as well as the prime minister and other top officials in an apparent coup attempt. President Ibrahim Boubacar KeÃ¯ta and PM Boubou CissÃ© are being held at a military camp near the capital Bamako. Earlier, the mutinying soldiers took control of the Kati camp. There has been anger among troops about pay and over a continuing conflict with jihadists - as well as widespread discontent with President KeÃ¯ta. Tuesday's mutiny and arrests have sparked international condemnation. The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional bloc that has been mediating talks between President KeÃ¯ta and opposition groups, has called for the immediate release of all officials. In a statement,external, it also said its 15 member states had agreed to close their borders with Mali, suspend all financial flows to the country, and eject Mali from all of Ecowas' decision-making bodies. Are coups on the rise in Africa? The popular imam taking on Mali's president A quick guide to Mali It was led by Col Malick Diaw - deputy head of the Kati camp - and another commander, Gen Sadio Camara, BBC Afrique's Abdoul Ba in Bamako reports. After taking over the camp, about 15km (nine miles) from Bamako, the mutineers marched on the capital, where they were cheered by crowds who had gathered to demand President KeÃ¯tas's resignation. In the afternoon they stormed his residence and arrested the president and his prime minister - who were both there. The president's son, the Speaker of the National Assembly, the foreign and finance ministers were reported to be among the other officials detained. The number soldiers taking part in the mutiny is unclear - as are their demands. Some reports say it was fuelled by a dispute over army pay. Kati camp was also the focus of a mutiny in 2012 by soldiers angry at the inability of the senior commanders to stop jihadists and Tuareg rebels taking control of northern Mali. Footage from AFP news agency showed a building owned by the justice ministry in Bamako ablaze on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Analysis by Will Ross, BBC World Service Africa editor What began as a mutiny appears to have morphed into a coup. This will be welcomed by the huge number of protesters who have been out on the streets for months calling for President KeÃ¯ta to step down. Parallels will be drawn between these events and 2012 when the government's mishandling of a rebellion led to another coup. Violent jihadists took advantage of that chaos to seize northern Mali. And they continue to cause havoc across the region. Ibrahim Boubacar KeÃ¯ta won a second term in elections in 2018, but there is widespread anger over corruption, the mismanagement of the economy and the worsening security situation with jihadist and communal violence on the increase. In recent months huge crowds led by populist imam Mahmoud Dicko have been calling on President KeÃ¯ta to step down. Much smaller crowds reportedly gathered in the capital on Tuesday in support of the soldiers. United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres demanded the ""unconditional release"" of Mali's leaders and the ""immediate restoration of constitutional order"". The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday, following a request by France and Niger, a senior UN diplomat told the AFP news agency. The chairman of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said he ""emphatically condemns"" the arrests of President KeÃ¯ta and his prime minister.

US Postal Service halts controversial changes,"The US Postal Service has suspended new policies that were decried as an attempt to sabotage the 2020 election. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said he would reverse operational changes that critics say would hamper postal voting. The U-turn comes as Mr DeJoy is due to testify to Congress and at least 20 states were preparing to sue. There is a fierce debate over postal funding in 2020, as record numbers of Americans are expected to vote by mail due to the pandemic. The US Postal Service (USPS) under Mr DeJoy had begun what it said were cost-cutting measures in recent months. Policies that were begun under Mr DeJoy included removing mail boxes, cancelling delivery runs and closing down sorting centres. In a sharp reversal, Mr DeJoy has now said that post office hours would not be cut, and post boxes and sorting machines would stop being removed. Mr DeJoy, a former Republican donor, also said overtime pay would continue to be approved to ensure deliveries arrive on time. ""To avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail, I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded,"" Mr DeJoy said in a statement. What is US row over postal service about? A week ago, Donald Trump said he had no interest in any additional funding for the US Postal Service, lest the money be used to help process mail-in voting. It was all part of his ongoing, and largely unfounded, campaign against the expanded use of postal ballots to minimise the risk of spreading coronavirus. By this Monday, the president tweeted that he wanted to ""save the post office"" and told a crowd in Minnesota that he would ""strengthen"" the service. And now, his postmaster general has said the agency will stop taking out postal boxes and limiting delivery routes. What changed? It turns out the Postal Service is pretty popular. AMorning Consult poll found,external80% of Americans have a positive view of it. The elderly use it to receive prescription drugs. For rural residents, it's a lifeline to the rest of the world. Whether the recent moves were a misconstrued part of a long-planned change or, as some on the left suspect, the result of a larger conspiracy, the White House concluded that there was only one way out - retreat. The development comes as the row over the politicisation of the most popular US government agency has become a top issue in the 2020 presidential campaign. Over the weekend, former President Barack Obama - in what was regarded as his most high-profile criticism of his successor to date - accused Mr Trump of trying to ""actively kneecap"" the postal service. Defenders of the changes said they were necessary to help the USPS get out of financial debt. Its budget shortfall has risen to $160bn (Â£122bn) amid a decade-long decline in mail volume. However, Mark Dimondstein, the president of the American Postal Workers Union which represents more than 200,000 postal employees, told Fox News on Tuesday that the changes ""are truly slowing down mail, the customers see it... the postal workers see it - mail is getting all backed up"". Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, cheered the postmaster's volte-face on Tuesday, telling reporters: ""They felt the heat and that's what we were trying to do, make it too hot to handle."" On Sunday, Ms Pelosi had recalled the House from a recess in order to investigate the USPS policies. Mr DeJoy, a major political donor who was appointed by Mr Trump to lead the USPS in May, is due to testify to a Republican-led Senate committee on Friday, and then to a Democrat-led House committee on Monday. Last week, President Trump said he rejected a funding boost for the USPS to shore up a predicted influx mail-in voting, claiming without evidence that it would lead to voter fraud and help Democrats. Mr Trump has also suggested delaying the election, which he does not have the power to do, to stop postal ballots leading to ""inaccurate and fraudulent"" results. Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Voting by mail is not new to the US. According to Reuters, approximately one in every four voters cast ballots by mail in 2016. Critics say people could vote more than once via absentee ballots and then again in person, though numerous nationwide and state-level studies over the years have found no evidence of widespread fraud. But these are rare incidents, and the rate of voting fraud overall in the US is between 0.00004% and 0.0009%, according to a2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice,external.

Fans flock to save Berlin's cheeky wild boarThe boar that fled from a nudist now has thousands of campaigners looking to protect her.,"Elsa's recent escapade made her a social media star Elsa might now be the world's most famous wild boar - and her celebrity has drawn a crowd of fans campaigning to save her from hunters. Elsa is the name given to the sow who was chased by a German nudist in Berlin, after she snatched his plastic bag containing a laptop. Pictures of the chase, in a popular bathing area, went viral. The boar managed to flee with her two piglets. But officials do not rule out that she could be culled, with other boars. Cheeky boar leaves nudist grunting in laptop chase The boars at Teufelssee - a lake in Berlin's leafy Grunewald district - ""have lost their normal timidity"" around humans, according to the local forestry office manager Katja Kammer. Speaking to Berlin broadcaster rbb24, she said the sow should be ""removed"" because there were too many wild boars there, which could get aggressive and could spread disease to humans, including swine fever. Removal, she added, did not mean relocation, because that would require an area to be fenced off. As many as 2,000 wild boars are shot in Berlin annually, and the hunting season starts in autumn. In hot summer months wild boars are attracted to lakes and pools A Grunewald forestry spokesman, Marc Franusch, explained however that a sow with young piglets would not be culled - at least not until the piglets were old enough to fend for themselves. ""These are wild animals which deserve our respect and should not be fed,"" he said. People have been feeding the Grunewald boars with apples and sandwiches, rbb24 reports. On Sunday, several campaigners demonstrated in Grunewald to save Elsa and her fellow boars. An online petitionon the campaign website change.org,externalhas picked up more than 9,000 signatures. It is called ""Save the cheeky but peaceful sow of Teufelssee!"" The now famous photos of the laptop chase were taken by Adele Landauer, who said the nudist laughed off the whole incident.

Chariots of fire actor Ben Cross dies aged 72,"Actor Ben Cross, who was best known for playing athlete Harold Abrahams in the film Chariots of Fire, has died at the age of 72. His other roles included the leads in HBO's first ever mini-series, The Far Pavilions, in 1984, and the 1991 horror series Dark Shadows. His representatives said he died ""suddenly"" following a short illness. His daughter Lauren wrote on Facebook that she was ""utterly heartbroken"" that her ""darling father"" had passed away. She said he had been ""sick for a while"" but there had been a ""rapid decline over the past week"". His representatives said he had just finishing shooting horror film The Devil's Light and later this year will appear in a leading role in the romantic drama film Last Letter From Your Lover. He was born Harry Bernard Cross in London to a working-class Catholic family. Ben Cross as British athlete Harold Abrahams in Chariots of Fire After graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (Rada), he moved from the stage to screen and took a minor role in the 1977 war film A Bridge Too Far, which starred Sir Sean Connery and Sir Michael Caine. He became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in the same year, before gaining wider acclaim as Billy Flynn - the lawyer representing murderer Roxie Hart - in a 1978 version of the stage musical Chicago. It was a performance that was widely believed to have earned him his role in 1981's Chariots Of Fire, which went on to win four Oscars including best picture. Cross played Jewish runner Harold Abrahams in the film, which was based on the true story of two British men racing for Olympic gold in 1924. BBC religion editor Martin Bashir said Cross's portrayal of Abrahams had ""captured the burden of being an outsider"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After Chariots of Fire, Cross was cast as a British officer in 19th Century colonial India in The Far Pavilions, which was described by The New York Times as ""the most expensive, ambitious production ever risked by a pay cable service"". He later appeared as Malagant in the 1995 film First Knight and Sarek in the 2009 Star Trek reboot. Cross also played Adolf Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess in the 2006 BBC production Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial. James Bond star Colin Salmon, who worked on The Devil's Light alongside Cross, tweeted: ""It was good working with him, seeing his twinkle & his craft. ""He wrote songs for the Sinatra of Bulgaria, had so many stories & spoke in Bulgarian and German on set. Go Well Ben RIP."" US television and film director Todd Holland also shared a tribute, saying he had met Cross early in his own career. ""We shot a screen test at Pinewood Studios. I went to his home for dinner with his family,"" he said. ""Ben Cross was a lovely man and talented actor. That movie never got made. But... what a classy guy."" Cross, who died in Vienna, Austria, had two children, Lauren and Theo.

Leicester lockdown measures eased,"The lockdown in Leicester was announced on 29 June Beauty salons and nail bars are among businesses in Leicester allowed to reopen from Wednesday in a further easing of lockdown restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the rate of infections ""has now dropped to a safe enough level"" for some businesses to reopen. However, restrictions on gatherings in private homes and gardens remain. Leicester became the first area in the UK to be subject to a local lockdown on 29 June. As well as salons and nail bars, spas, massage and tattoo parlours and body piercing services are also able to reopen from Wednesday. Shielding for the most vulnerable will continue, but it will be eased in Leicester to allow individuals to meet in a group of up to six if they are outdoors and maintaining social distancing. Though the relaxed restrictions allow outdoor swimming pools to reopen, the only one in Leicestershire is in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, is not in the lockdown area and already open. The move will bring the city into line with the easing of restrictions introduced for much of England on 11 and 13 July. ""My gratitude goes out to the people of Leicester who have all made sacrifices to keep the virus at bay and protect their local communities,"" Mr Hancock said. Leicester and some neighbouring areas were told to observe strict measures from 29 June Government figures released on Tuesday evening show there were 204 cases recorded in the week to 14 August. This compares with 226 recorded in the previous week and is down by more than half compared with whenthe city was first told it would face tighter restrictionsthan the rest of England at the end of June. The city still has one of the highest rates of new cases in England, with almost 58 per 100,000 of population in the week to 14 August. Sir Peter Soulsby, mayor of Leicester, said the announcement was ""more or less what we expected"", adding the relaxation some of the rules for people shielding ""will greatly benefit their mental health"". ""We had planned to continue our neighbourhood testing programme throughout August and the restrictions around households will help in our efforts to track down the virus and contain it,"" he said. ""What we really don't want is to see numbers increase which could result in more severe restrictions being put in place once again in parts, or all, of the city."" Salons in the city said they were looking forward to reopening. ""I'm super-excited because we have been closed since March and obviously lost lots of business throughout,"" said Minal Parmar, who owns The Beauty Refinery on London Road. ""Everyone has been affected financially - but I just can't wait to be open."" Krishna Devaliya said she hopes customers will feel comfortable to return Krishna Devaliya, owner of Your Beauty At The Cutting Room, said: ""I'm excited but also a little bit nervous - Leicester still isn't fully recovered, will people come back or not? ""But I do feel happy to be going back to work and seeing our clients again."" City bans care home visits as virus cases rise Councillors 'sorry' for lockdown breaches Aleksandrs Cibulskis, who owns Route 66 tattoo studio, said he was ""very happy"" to be able to reopen, describing the past few months as ""horrible"" for business. ""I understand [it] has been nobody's fault with the virus and everything,"" he said. ""For the whole time I have had to pay for rent and bills - I was given a grant but it was not enough."" Rose Feng said the lockdown rules ""have been very confusing"", but is looking forward to seeing customers again Rose Feng, who runs Vivian's Nail Bar on Narborough Road, welcomed the opportunity to bring back customers. ""The whole situation has been difficult,"" she said. ""The rules and guidance have been very confusing. ""We didn't understand why we couldn't open but barber shops could, but if we can open tomorrow then that is really good news."" At Femi Health and Beauty, the phone has ""not stopped ringing"" since the announcement, according to owner Femi Latif. ""It's a relief to know we can reopen, such a relief,"" she said.

Coronavirus update and A-levels inquiry - reaction,"Health Minister Vaughan Gething has given the Welsh Government's weekly coronavirus update He says an Â£32m extra investment in coronavirus testing will make sure results ""are returned as quickly as possible"" Mr Gething also apologised to A-level students for the ""stress and anxiety"" caused by decisions on grades after exams were cancelled Students will now be given the grades estimated by their teachers after an outcry over results downgraded by a standardisation system The Senedd's education committee has been recalled and is taking evidence on how the debacle happened Public Health Wales said there were no further deaths with coronavirus to announce on Tuesday, leaving the official total at 1,589 Natalie Grice and Ben Frampton We are bringing today's live page to a close. Thanks for joining us this afternoon. Here's a reminder of some of the key points:  We'll be back for the weekly government coronavirus briefing next Tuesday. Have a good evening. Five key areas will be used in managing coronavirus as Wales moves into autumn and winter. The Welsh government published its Coronavirus Control Plan on Tuesday, saying it will be a partnership between local government, health boards, businesses and the public. The areas are:  The plan represents an escalating level of response, should prevalence of the virus increase. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""We are placing a huge importance on prevention. By getting that stage right we can avoid further restrictions on our lives."" Gwyn Griffiths wants to study civil engineering ""It's just a waiting game."" That's how 18-year-old Gwyn Griffiths describes how he's feeling as he waits to find out if his re-graded A-level results will allow him into his first choice university. The Maesteg Comprehensive School pupil is ""still hopeful"" of winning a place to study civil engineering at the University of the West of England in Bristol. He was ""distraught"" on results days, when he got a B, C and two Us because he'd been predicted a B, two Cs and a D. ""I was really shocked, because of the massive downgrade I'd had. It was awful to be honest with you, knowing this could affect my future and possibly the rest of my life."" But after the elation of yesterdays' U-turn on grading, he's no clearer on whether he can go to UWE. ""They themselves still don't know what will happen. They said as soon as they know they'll inform me but as far as I know, that could take hours, it could take days. it could take weeks."" Gwyn has accepted a place at Swansea University but is still holding out hope of going to UWE. He said: ""I'm just waiting for emails from universities, or my head of sixth form, to see where I stand. I keep updating websites too see if any news has come out."" BTEC students who still have not received results which should have come last Thursday should get them by the end of the day, the exam regulatory body Qualification Wales has said. Speaking at the Senedd's education committee, the body's regulation director Jo Richards said: ""So we understand that there has been a delay to the BTEC results and weâve had notification of that from [exam board] Pearson. ""We are working with them and are asking for regular updates. They are working through that data and we understand students should expect that by the end of today.""  Some students have missed out on university courses because of a delay to results Education Minister Kirsty Williams says she apologises ""unreservedly"" to the young people of Wales for the way exam results have been handled. Speaking to MSs on the Senedd's Childen and Young People Committee, the minister said:

""It has been, and continues to be, a stressful time for our young people.

I am sorry that the results process has made that worse. ""I apologise directly and unreservedly to our young people.

I am truly sorry."" Kirsty Williams apologised at the virtual Senedd committee meeting Caroline Jones joined the Senedd as a UKIP member in 2016 The Brexit Party is down to three members in the Welsh Parliamentafter former UKIP Senedd leader Caroline Jones quit. The South Wales West politician said the party has a ""anti-devolution"" stance that was ""against her principles"". Senned leader Mark Reckless has vowed to campaign to scrap the Senedd, proposing a directly-elected first minister instead. The Brexit Party group wished her well.

Ms Jones was one of seven UKIP assembly members elected in 2016. Grade inflation for this year's students is a âpotential area of concernâ for the exam board and this could have an impact on next year's cohort, WJEC chief executive Ian Morgan says. Appearing before the Seneddâs education committee, Mr Morgan was asked by Labour MS Hefin David whether there could be âunintended consequencesâ of grade inflation, now that students will be awarded their predicted grades. Mr Morgan said there were âreal issues and concernsâ and it was an area the body would âneed to look atâ.

It came after the Welsh government announced on Monday it would be allowing students to receive their teacher-assessed grades if they were unhappy with ones predicted by an algorithm. Mr Morgan said that using centre-assessed grades in their âcurrent formâ, could âtransfer pressure back to schools and back to colleges in terms of teachers and how they now have to interact with learners"". âWeâve got to maintain a qualification standard that says, if you've got a GCSE in English language, your GCSE in English language for this year is the same level as your GCSE in English language for next year. âHow do we deal with that in an overarching process of saying thereâs equivalence between one year and the next year? I think we've got collective challenges in that."" Andrew RT Davies acknowledged society had to live with covid-19 for some time Covid-19 is here ""for the foreseeable future"" and so plans must be drawn up and implemented to deal with it and return ""life here to as normal as possible"", the Conservative's health spokesman has said. Andrew RT Davies was commenting following the earlier announcement by the Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, of the publication of plans to tackle the virus in the coming winter months. âTo allow this, then a targeted approach â including, if necessary, local lockdowns â is the way forward,"" Mr Davies said. âAnything else, any further blanket lockdown, will again have a damaging effect on our economy, on our young peopleâs education, and â critically â on the health of our nation. ""After all, weâre already facing the ticking time bomb of missed diagnoses or failures to start treatment for cancer and heart disease. âAll efforts must be channelled now at avoiding another national lockdown, and planning for the winter pressures NHS Wales faces annually while dealing with the backlog, and securing an economic recovery from the first lockdown.â Where are the hot spots in Wales and what is happening in care homes?Read the latest. Maia Gould was delighted about the U-turn Students have spoken of their ""massive relief"" after they were given the A-level results they were fighting for. The Welsh Government announced a U-turn on Monday and said those and GCSE results estimated by teachers would now be used, rather than those produced by an algorithm. There had been outrage after 42% of A-level grades in Wales were downgraded because of the system. For some students, the change means future plans are no longer in tatters. Universities said they were ""working hard to place applicants on the course of their choice"". Maia Gould, from Llangorse, near Brecon, almost lost her chance to study medicine. But after hearing about the U-turn, she said: ""I burst out crying straight away. I don't think I've ever been so happy in my life."" Read more here. WJEC exam board chief Ian Morgan's defence of the now abandoned algorithm system to predict A-level grades has rested on the increased number of students getting better results under teacher-assessed grades. This includes 15.4% of pupils getting A* grades, an increase of 6.3% on 2019. Mr Morgan told the Senedd's education committee: ""In any normal year if
there was an increase in outcomes of this magnitude I would be invited back to
the committee to explain how that had happened. ""You would want to know
what happened in the examination system that would allow an increase of that
kind."" More good news for pupils who feared they might have missed out on university places after initially receiving A-level grades lower than those predicted by their teachers. Aberystwyth University and the University of South Wales have joined other Welsh higher education institutions in saying they will honour places offered to pupils who have now got the necessary grades following the decision to scrap grades awarded by an algorithm. Some students missed out on their places last week when the results were first published. The Betsi Cadwaladr health board region in north Wales continues to see the most deaths in Wales, with no further deaths announced on Tuesday. Its running total of 415 includes two on Sunday, which accounts for 23 out of 24 Covid-19 deaths in the last two weeks. The total number of lab-confirmed deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales stands at 1,589. There were no further deaths with coronavirus in Wales to announce on Tuesday, Public Health Wales said, leaving the total at 1,589. The seven-day average number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales continues to follow a downward curve following a slight rise earlier in the month. The chief executive of the Welsh examinations board WJEC has defended the method used to set this year's A-level results that was abandoned by Welsh ministers on Monday. Ian Morgan said that system would have meant grades A* to E would have been up by 1% from last year and A* to A would have risen by 2.9%. A* would have been up 0.1% on 2019, with 1.7% of candidates reaching that level. Appearing before the Senedd's Children, Young People and Education Committee on Tuesday, he said the decision to use teachers' estimates instead meant 99.9% of candidates achieving grades A* to E. There was now a 13.4% increase in candidates getting A* to A, meaning 40.4% reaching that standard. The A* grade had been awarded to 15.4% of pupils, an increase of 6.3% on 2019 outcomes, Mr Morgan said. The committee was recalled during the Welsh Parliament''s summer break to scrutinise the handling of the examinations crisis. There have been no further deaths with coronavirus in Wales, the latest Public Health Wales figures have shown. It leaves the total number at 1,589. Twenty-four new cases were recorded, bringing Wales' count to 17,599. More than 100,000 people have signed up to take part in future NHS trials of a coronavirus vaccine - but more volunteers are needed, researchers say. They want as many people as possible to enrol, to speed up their efforts to find a safe and effective jab. And they are particularly looking for more volunteers from the ""high-priority groups"" disproportionately affected by the virus - those belonging to ethnic minorities or aged over 65. Volunteers canregister online,external. Marks & Spencer is cutting 7,000 jobs over the next three months across its stores and management. It said the coronavirus pandemic had made it clear there had been a ""material shift in trade"". In-store sales of clothing and home goods were ""well below"" 2019, although online and home deliveries were strong. M&S said it hoped a ""significant proportion"" of the cuts - about a tenth of its workforce - will be voluntary redundancy and early retirement. Read more here. A meeting of the Senedd's education committee has begun, after it was recalled to discuss the row over exam results. There had been outrage after 42% of A-level grades in Wales were downgraded because of the system. But results estimated by teachers will now be usedrather than those produced by an algorithm. Lynne Neagle, chair of the committee, said: âGiven the significant concerns and complexities surrounding the awarding of exam results this year we will be meeting urgently to seek clarity for those whoâve been through this challenging process in unprecedented times. âYoung peopleâs well-being, and their ability to plan for their future learning and careers, will be at the centre of our work looking at these issues. âWe recognise that these matters are complex and will need detailed, longer term consideration. However, we believe that there is an important role for us to play now, to ask questions which will ensure that a fair and clear approach is adopted and communicated to the Welsh people as quickly as possible.â It has invited the WJEC, Qualifications Wales and the Welsh Government to provide information on the latest developments and answer questions.

"'No real justice' for PC Harper, widow saysAndrew Harper's widow Lissie says it was ""heartbreaking"" when his killers were cleared of murder.Berkshire","This video can not be played Lissie Harper said she was ""totally surprised and disappointed"" at the manslaughter verdict The widow of PC Andrew Harper has said it was ""heartbreaking"" to be denied ""real justice"" over his death. Lissie Harper, 29, said people had been ""outraged"" after jurors cleared three men of murdering her husband following a trial at the Old Bailey in July. She has launched a campaign for killers of emergency workers to face mandatory life sentences. PC Harper's killers had been accused of murder but were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. PC Harper, 28, suffered catastrophic injuries when he was dragged behind a getaway car driven by Henry Long in Berkshire last August. Long, 19, wasjailed for 16 years while his passengers Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both 18, were sentenced to 13 years each. The last picture of Mr and Mrs Harper was taken four days before the officer died Mrs Harper told the BBC she had received ""many messages from people who are outraged"" since the verdicts and sentences were handed down. She said her experience at the Old Bailey, which included reading a victim impact statement, and the ""disappointing"" trial result, had inspired her campaign. Speaking in the witness box was ""one of the hardest things"", she added. ""I had the defendants on my left not really caring what I was saying but I felt it important to speak directly to the judge and tell him what they'd taken from us,"" she said. ""We had the sense that, although it was going to be an awful and long journey, at the end of it we might at least get some justice for Andrew. ""So at the end of it, to not get any real justice is heartbreaking."" PC Harper and Lissie had been together since they were at secondary school The trial heard how PC Harper had responded to reports of a quad bike theft with a colleague hours after their shift had ended. As he attempted to apprehend one suspect, his feet became entangled in a rope trailing behind a getaway car which led to him being dragged to his death. Mrs Harper said it ""wasn't until I was looking at them [the defendants] in the eye, that I felt the disgrace and just how unfair it is"". ""They knew what they had taken away and the effect that it's had on so many people,"" she said. ""They could hear my words so if, even on the outside, they may not show any sort of remorse I hope that in some way they feel the guilt inside they should feel."" Jessie Cole, Henry Long and Albert Bowers (L-R) were convicted of killing PC Harper The sentences of PC Harper's killers prompted Mrs Harper and PC Harper's mother Deborah Adlam to launch campaigns calling for tougher sentences for killers of emergency service workers. Mrs Harper's campaign, which has been renamed Harper's Law, calls for all ""criminals convicted of killing a police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor, prison officer or paramedic to be jailed for life.

Joe Biden: This time the Oval Office?," How Joe Biden overcame public and personal adversity By Anthony Zurcher By Anthony Zurcher This article was first published on 18 August, 2020 It was the winter of Joe Biden’s discontent. After a disappointing finish in the Iowa caucuses in February, his support in the upcoming New Hampshire primary was collapsing and his 2020 presidential campaign was in serious jeopardy. He was, for all appearances, a defeated man. The White House hopes Biden had been harbouring during his nearly half-century in public service were slipping away again, perhaps for the last time. At a campaign rally ahead of the New Hampshire vote, Biden was reflective - and at times visibly emotional. He spoke of the death of his son, Beau, almost five years earlier.  He recounted stories from his childhood, of his family’s economic hardships. But he reassured the audience. “There’s always hope,” he said. “There’s always hope.” It wasn’t a typical rally speech – and given his subsequent fifth-place finish in New Hampshire, probably not an effective one. But it offered a glimpse into the psyche, the emotional scar tissue, of a politician who has faced devastating personal, professional and political adversity over the course of his life. “I have an incredibly high regard for fate,” Biden told the National Journal back in 1989. “I have never been able to plan my life. Every time my personal life has been how I wanted it, something has intervened.” Biden has witnessed the untimely deaths of the closest of loved ones. He’s built platforms for his political ambitions, only to watch them crumble, then built them again. His hard-earned rhetorical skills have won him the adoration of crowds, and his propensity for malaprops and gaffes have made him the object of ridicule. Biden frequently says that the main lesson he learned from his father was that the measure of a man isn’t how many times he’s been knocked down, but how quickly he gets back up. After losing in New Hampshire, Biden’s campaign regrouped in the southern states and turned what appeared to be impending defeat into a convincing march to the Democratic nomination. That was only the latest example of Biden facing challenges – some beyond his control, others resulting from his own mistakes and miscalculations – and soldiering on. “We have choices when we suffer like Joe,” says former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, who served with Biden in Congress during the 1990s. “He's a man of faith. He chose not to quit. He chose to keep doing the work, even though he didn't have to.” Biden, if nothing else, is a survivor. Five pivotal days in his life put this in stark relief – days casting shadows that stretched for decades. Joe Biden was in Washington on 18 December, 1972, when the telephone rang. It was his brother Jimmy in Delaware, asking to speak to his sister, Valerie. There had been a “slight accident” involving Biden's family, his sister relayed. “Nothing to be worried about,” she said. “But we ought to go home.” His wife Neilia, he would learn later that day, had been killed, along with their infant daughter, Naomi, when the car she was driving was hit by a lorry. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were also seriously injured. The family had been shopping for a Christmas tree while Biden – who had just been elected to the Senate - was off interviewing staff for his congressional office and finalising the purchase of a new home for the family. Now, that family was shattered. “I could not speak, only felt this hollow core grow in my chest,” Biden wrote in his memoir, “like I was going to be sucked inside a black hole.” He considered giving up the Senate seat he had just won. He contemplated joining the priesthood. He found himself taking evening walks in rough neighbourhoods, looking for a fight. “I had not known I was capable of such rage,” he wrote. “ I felt God had played a horrible trick on me, and I was angry.” Up until that day, Biden’s life had been on a remarkable upward trajectory. Just over a month earlier, the then-29-year-old Democrat had become the second-youngest person elected to the US Senate, defeating a two-term Republican incumbent in a race few thought he had a chance of winning. He was considered a golden boy in a Democratic Party that had been trounced across the nation by Richard Nixon and the Republicans. Biden’s childhood was relatively challenging. While his father had his share of business successes, mostly before Biden was born, the ups were inevitably followed by downs, and young Biden spent much of his youth living with his extended family in a modest home in Scranton, Pennsylvania. “The values that Vice-President Biden was exposed to as a young man were values rooted in the Church, rooted in Catholic education, rooted in the culture we were growing up in, which was Irish-American,” says Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, whose family has lived in Scranton for generations. His biggest childhood challenge was overcoming a speech impediment – a stutter – that afflicted him well into high school. In his memoir, Biden recalls memorising a reading to avoid tripping up during class and, when he once did, how a teacher mocked his disability, calling him “buh-buh-Biden”. That teacher, a Catholic nun, received a tongue-lashing from Biden’s mother, who threatened to “knock your bonnet off your head”, in Biden’s retelling. His high-school classmates gave him nicknames that made references to his stutter. “Even today I can remember the dread, the shame, the absolute rage, as vividly as the day it was happening,” Biden wrote. By the time he finished high school, however, he had overcome the stutter - the result, he says, of months of training himself to relax his face while he practised speaking in front of a mirror. It still reveals itself on occasion, however, when he’s under pressure or fumbling for words. “A stutter does not get worse as a person ages, but trying to keep it at bay can take immense physical and mental energy,” wrote John Hendrickson, in an Atlantic Magazine article about Biden’s stutter. No-one is ever truly cured, he says, they simply find ways around the problem. After high school, Biden went on to attend the University of Delaware and then law school at Syracuse University, in part to be near Neilia, whom he had met during a college holiday. They eventually married, and Biden’s political career began shortly after their return to Wilmington. He briefly practised law at a major firm, but disillusioned with representing the rich and powerful, he switched to being a public defender. From there, he ran for – and won – a seat on the New Castle county council. This became his unlikely springboard to the US Senate after no other Democrat expressed interest in challenging the entrenched Republican incumbent. “Joe Biden looks like the photograph of a great statesman in his youth,” a local newspaper columnist gushed. “His eyes sparkle blue, and his teeth shine when he smiles, his cheeks glow, and his body is still boyishly slim.” Joe Biden, 1972 Joe Biden, 1972 The article concluded on a surprisingly sombre note, however: “He had the look – both triumphant and sad – of a young man who believes the world is his, and knows he is yet to be tested.” Those tests would come – none more daunting than the one on that December day, just a few years later. Biden would ultimately accept his Senate seat, taking the oath of office from the Delaware hospital where his two sons were recovering. It marked the beginning of 44 consecutive years in national politics – a stretch that ended, as it began, with the untimely death of a child. In May 2015 Beau Biden died of brain cancer at the age of 46. Like his father, Beau had pursued a career in politics, serving as Delaware’s attorney general, with the prospect of higher offices to come. “He had all the best of me, but with the bugs and flaws engineered out,"" Biden wrote of Beau in his 2017 book about his son’s illness. Biden details how close he came to announcing his own presidential bid in 2015, but that the rawness of his son’s death – and the toll a campaign might take on his family – pushed him to stay out. “I wasn’t sure if I would be able to find the emotional energy, and I knew from previous experience that grief is a process that respects no schedule and no timetable,” he wrote. A lifetime of loss was something Biden learned to live with and overcome, like his stutter - a piece of himself that he found a way to build on. “It's my belief that your empathy is informed by your experience, but you're either born with that sense or you're not,” Senator Casey says. “In Biden’s case, it was both a quality he was born with but also one that was informed by his own personal tragedies that gave him an insight into loss and tragedy and pain that a lot of people never fully understand.” Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009 Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009  On 23 September 1987, Joe Biden stood before a crowd of reporters and announced that he was abandoning the presidential bid he had launched just three months earlier. “I’m angry with myself for having been put in this position – for having put myself in this position of having to make this choice,” he said. “And I am no less frustrated at the environment of presidential politics that makes it so difficult to let the American people measure the whole Joe Biden and not just misstatements that I have made.” It was an ignominious end to Biden’s first attempt at the White House, after his campaign ran aground amid charges of plagiarism and dishonesty. It was a particularly bitter pill to swallow for a man who liked to offer his “word as a Biden” as an iron-clad guarantee of honesty and trustworthiness. The first blow came in a debate in Iowa where Biden, in his closing statement, recited – nearly word for word – a passage from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock’s speech about his working-class upbringing. Although he frequently quoted those lines with attribution, this time Biden didn’t – and an operative from a rival Democratic campaign took note. A plagiarism charge against Biden for a law school paper also resurfaced. He explained that it was the result of an improper citation, but combined with the Kinnock mistake and further allegations of unattributed speech quotes, it cemented for many the perception that there was no substance beneath Biden’s style. “Here I was, getting out of the race with my integrity being questioned,” Biden would later tell his biographer, Jules Witcover.  “It really ate me up. It was the core of who I thought I was, who I know I am, actually.” During his first 14 years in Washington, Biden rebuilt his personal life after the deaths of his wife and daughter. He committed to giving his two living children some semblance of a normal life, and commuted each day from their home in Delaware to Washington. He eventually remarried, to a schoolteacher named Jill Jacobs, with whom he had a child, Ashley. He established himself on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and began to build a national presence. After entertaining a run in 1984, he took the plunge four years later, with a campaign that played heavily on Kennedy-esque themes of generation change. “We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference,” he said at his campaign kick-off. “The clarion call for my generation is not, ‘It’s our turn,’ but rather, ‘It’s our moment of obligation and opportunity’.” The plagiarism row ensured this wouldn’t be Biden’s moment. At the same time he was attempting to keep his presidential campaign afloat, Biden was also chairing Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for a conservative Supreme Court nominee, Robert Bork – a high-profile battle over the ideological direction of the nation’s highest court. It was after a morning session of these hearings in Washington that Biden announced the end to his campaign. The decision turned out to be somewhat of a blessing, however, as a few months later – the night of the Iowa caucuses – he collapsed in a hotel room in Rochester, New York, the result of an intracranial aneurism. For the next six months, he was in and out of hospital. For a time, doctors feared he would have lasting brain damage. It would be 20 years before Biden ran for president again – this time as an elder statesman, not a fresh face. He promised to run the 2008 race on his own terms, after concluding that his 1987 campaign was too heavy on rhetorical flourishes and image-consultants. It was almost as if he was trying to right the wrongs of 20 years earlier. “Any of you who take a look at my life will not be able to conclude that I am not an honourable man,” he said at an Iowa campaign rally in June. “And that’s why I wasn’t afraid to get back into this thing.” The end result – defeat – was the same, however. And right out of the gate, it was Biden’s tongue that betrayed him. The day before he formally announced his candidacy, Biden told a New York Observer reporter that one of his opponents, Barack Obama, was “the first mainstream African American, who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy”. Biden was quickly forced to explain that he did not mean to disparage previous black presidential candidates or belittle Obama personally. It was cited as yet another of Biden’s propensity for gaffes – off-the-cuff remarks that would embarrass or distract from his intended message – which would bedevil his national efforts throughout his career. Although Biden eventually steadied his campaign, he never broke into the top tier. The Democratic race boiled down to a two-way battle between Obama and Hillary Clinton. A riveted US public watched on 11 October, 1991, as Anita Hill, then a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, testified before Joe Biden’s Senate Judiciary Committee that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her on multiple occasions when they both worked for the Reagan administration. Hill accused Thomas of repeatedly making “ugly”, “disgusting”, “dirty” comments to her, creating an intolerable workplace. Thomas, in his testimony, accused his critics of engaging in a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” - alluding to a term that has historicalracist connotations. “Unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you,” he said. “You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the US Senate rather than hung from a tree.” Biden chairs the Clarence Thomas hearings, 1991 Biden, as chair, presided over this spectacle – trying to provide what he described as a fair hearing for both sides. The committee had already voted once on Thomas’s nomination, during which Biden objected to Thomas on ideological grounds. This, however, was different. As the committee reopened its inquiry, the issue was Thomas’ moral character – and two distinct and conflicting accounts of what had taken place a decade earlier. Biden was conscious that he and his fellow senators – all men, all white - were open to charges of racism against only the second black nominee to the Supreme Court, and charges of sexism if they didn’t give Hill’s allegations a full airing. “The Democrats were deathly afraid of seeming to gang up on a black Supreme Court nominee, there's no doubt about that,” says journalist Jill Abramson, who covered the hearings for the Wall Street Journal and co-wrote a book, Strange Justice, on the topic. Instead of being fair, Abramson says, Biden and the Democrats allowed themselves to be “woefully outmanoeuvred” by the committee’s Republican minority, leaving many liberal supporters feeling betrayed. “As the Democrats are wont to do, they wanted to be seen as playing fair,” she says. “But it wasn't playing fair, it was two days of hearings where Anita Hill was trashed by the Republicans who portrayed her as a fantaciser or an erotomaniac.” If Biden was trying to find balance on issues of race and sex during the hearings, it’s a challenge he’s faced throughout his career, with varying levels of success. When Biden first ran for the Senate, he presented himself as an advocate of the civil rights movement. He recalled how, as a teenage volunteer at a swimming centre in a predominantly black neighbourhood of Wilmington, he learned about the unfair treatment ethnic minority groups frequently received in the US. “Every day, it seemed to me, black people got subtle and not-so-subtle reminders that they didn’t quite belong in America,” Biden wrote in his memoir. One of Biden’s first high-profile political battles upon entering the Senate, however, was fought alongside pro-segregation southerners in opposition of the court-ordered practice of transporting students to schools in different neighbourhoods in an effort to address racial segregation. It was a subject that would open Biden to attacks during his run for the 2020 Democratic nomination. “Biden at one time called the issue of bussing a ‘domestic Vietnam’,” says Jason Sokol, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire. “He meant that it was an issue that was tearing the country apart culturally. That's why he shied away from taking a strong stance against integration at that point. He saw that this politically was not a smart thing to do.” While Biden fought conservative judicial and executive appointees he thought were insufficiently dedicated to civil rights, he viewed the role of government as preventing discrimination in the current era, not offering remedies for past wrongs. “I do not buy the concept, popular in the ‘60s which said: ‘We have suppressed the black man for 300 years, and the white man is now far ahead in the ‘race’ for everything our society offers,” he told a newspaper interviewer in 1975. “In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a ‘head start’ or even hold the white man back to even the ‘race’. I don’t buy that."" Biden’s record on crime and law-enforcement issues also opened him up to accusations that he supported policies - designed to address a spike in violent crime and drug offences in the 1980s and early 1990s - that disproportionately affected ethnic minority groups. Sokol says Biden has spent his career inhabiting a “very conflicted, messy middle ground” on racial issues, where he weighed in angering some of his white constituents against ”honouring claims for racial justice”. In 1988, Biden enthusiastically backed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which established tougher mandatory sentences for narcotics like crack cocaine that were more frequently used by ethnic minority groups. He was the architect of a 1994 anti-crime bill that expanded mandatory minimum sentences and greatly increased federal funding for police departments and prisons – a push that since has been seen as a contributing factor in the US having one of the world’s largest incarcerated populations. According to Bob Kerrey, who was one of the 95 senators who voted for the crime bill, being labelled “soft on crime” was politically dangerous in the 1990s. Joe Biden speaks about crime and ""predators on our streets"", 1993 “I didn't know how controversial the crime bill would become,” he says. “The problem with that crime bill is it worked - crime went down. The larger problem is we tolerated racist attitudes of police forces way too long.” Attached to that 1994 crime bill was one of Biden’s most cherished legislative accomplishments - the Violence Against Women Act. The topic of domestic abuse - and how to address it on a federal level – was always among Biden’s top of priorities. “We ripped the Band-Aid off a shameful secret and exposed the ugly truth of domestic violence to the public eye,”Biden told the Huffington Post in 2019. While Biden has offered his legislative efforts as evidence of his support for women’s issues, it has been his personal conduct that has drawn the sharpest attacks. In the days before the formal launch of his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden was accused by a number of women of unwanted physical contact. “I had never experienced anything so blatantly inappropriate and unnerving before,” wrote Lucy Flores, a Nevada Democratic politician, of an encounter she had with Biden in 2014. “The vice-president of the United States of America had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends, family or romantic partners -and I felt powerless to do anything about it.” While not admitting to any specific misconduct, Biden released a video in which he said he would be “more mindful and respectful” of future conduct that might make women uncomfortable. Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 In March, one of the women who accused Biden of misconduct, Tara Reade, expanded her allegation to sexual assault, saying the then-senator had attacked her in an empty hallway when she worked in his office in 1993. Acquaintances of Reade said she told them about the alleged incident at the time. Two months later, Biden directly addressed the accusation, referencing his support for the Violence Against Women Act. “I recognise my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished,” he said. “So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago. They aren't true.” Reade called on Biden to quit the race.Subsequent investigations by journalists, including aNew York Times report, found inconsistencies in Reade’s accounts. The episode, however, raised uncomfortable issues for Democrats, especially women in the party who had backed the rallying cry of the #MeToo movement, Believe Women. It also drew parallels to the doubts and aspersions directed at Anita Hill decades earlier In recent years – and in light of the Me Too movement that has increased awareness of sexual harassment and assault - Biden has expressed regret over his handling of the Hill episode. “To this day, I regret that I could not come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us,” Biden said during a speech in March 2019. He later directly expressed this to Hill in a phone call. But for her, it was not enough. “He needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw,” she told the New York Times. “There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.” It was deja vu for Joe Biden. On 11 October, 2002, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations committee was once again deciding whether to authorise a Republican president to go to war with Iraq. Eleven years earlier, on the eve of the Gulf War, Biden had voted against giving President George HW Bush the approval to use force against Saddam Hussein’s military. “Before we ask Americans to die for the liberation of Kuwait, I would like to be sure we have tried every possible alternative,” he said during a Foreign Relations committee hearing. “So far, this has not been the case.” Despite Biden’s warning that there could be tens of thousands of US casualties, the resolution passed 52-47 - and the Gulf War ended quickly, with only a handful of American deaths. US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 Biden, along with other Democrats who opposed the war, were frequently branded as “doves” who were soft on national defence. Robert Gates, defence secretary under George W Bush, typified these kind of attacks when he wrote in his 2014 memoir that Biden was “wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"". He listed Biden’s support for withdrawal from South Vietnam, opposition to Ronald Reagan’s defence build-up and that fateful vote against the Gulf War resolution, among others. In the years after that vote, Biden staked out more hawkish positions on international affairs, including backing US involvement in the Balkan civil wars, bombing in Iraq and the invasion of Afghanistan. When President George W Bush began moving toward a new war with Iraq, alleging it possessed weapons of mass destruction, Biden was a vocal supporter. “I do not believe this is a rush to war,” he said. “I believe it’s a march to peace and security.” Biden was among the 77 senators to vote for that Iraq War resolution – joining numerous other Democrats with presidential ambitions, including John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Biden speaks at the Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing on Iraq, 2002 “It was kind of a simple calculation,” says Mark Weisbrot, who directed a documentary on Biden’s Iraq War support. “They knew there was a risk that if you were against the war and the war turned out to be a ‘success’ you could lose some swing votes. But if you voted for the war, and it turned out to be a disaster, which it did, you really didn't lose much because your base didn't have anywhere to go.” As the war dragged on, however, Biden’s war vote did become a political liability – this time with Democratic voters who increasingly saw the US occupation as a quagmire. Biden, after initially defending his vote, began to back away. He deals with this episode in a chapter on the Iraq War - titled “My Mistake” - in his 2007 memoir. Writing about those in the Bush administration who pushed for war, he wrote: “I vastly underestimated their disingenuousness and incompetence”. If Biden in the years after his Gulf War vote tried to compensate for his perceived error by moving to the right, he moved left after the Iraq War. He opposed a surge of US forces in Iraq, calling for US withdrawal and partitioning of the nation. As vice-president, he counselled against an increase in US forces in Afghanistan and advised against the Osama bin Laden raid. Shortly after announcing his 2020 presidential bid, Biden advocated ending US support for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen civil war. During the Obama presidency, Biden had an active role in carrying out the administration’s foreign policy objectives. Senator Casey recalls meeting the vice-president during a visit to Iraq, where they discussed his efforts to work with the leaders of the various governing factions. “I could tell by listening to his recitations from the interactions that he had learned a lot about these people as personalities,” Casey says. “It was a really valuable lesson in diplomacy. It wasn't just learning the substance of a white paper about a particular country or a particular foreign policy issue, but you literally have to get to know the individuals.” Biden’s other responsibilities included pressuring Congress to back nuclear negotiations with Iran, building international support for the Paris climate accords, representing US interests in China and encouraging democratic reforms in Ukraine. These last two areas – China and Ukraine – have become a focus for attacks from Donald Trump and Republicans, who have criticised Biden for being too close to China, and attempted to make a case that Biden’s Ukraine activities were to protect his son, Hunter, who had business ties to the nation. Last year, Hunter insisted he had done ""nothing wrong"" but admitted to ""poor judgment"",leaving him open to political attacks. Biden’s Iraq War vote again came up in the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, but nearly two decades later it lacked the political punch it once had. At the end of Biden’s 2008 presidential run, it seemed the senator would return to Washington and finish his career in Congress or, perhaps, as an official in a future Democratic administration. On 23 August, however, Barack Obama selected him as his vice-presidential running mate. The choice surprised many. Biden’s home state, Delaware, was not an electoral battleground. With more than three decades in Washington, he wasn’t the kind of outsider who fitted with Obama’s message of change. “There was this sense that they were very, very different,” says Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and author of a book on the vice-presidency. “Obama was very thoughtful and careful choosing his words, and Biden was always sticking his foot in his mouth. The one thing Biden told Obama when he agreed to do the job was that he wasn't going to change his brand. He said, ‘I am what I am’.” According to former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who ran for president in 2008 and was also on Obama’s vice-presidential short list, Obama and Biden developed a rapport on the Democratic primary campaign trail. “I knew in the debates they had a personal chemistry,” Richardson says. “Obama needed a senior foreign policy person on the ticket, but also I could tell they liked each other a lot.” A few hours after announcing his pick, Obama took the stage in Springfield, Illinois to introduce Biden to the gathered crowd. Biden is announced as Obama's running mate, 2008 “Joe Biden is that rare mix – for decades he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn’t changed him,” he said. “He is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track.” Obama would tick through the pivotal moments of Biden’s life – his stutter, the death of his wife and child, his brain aneurysm, the 1994 crime bill and his involvement in negotiating an end to the Balkan civil war – all in support of his choice. In the early days of the Obama presidency Biden frequently chafed at the White House’s directions. For more than 30 years, Biden – as a senator – ran his own political fiefdom. Now he was required to do someone else’s bidding. “It was galling for him at first,” says Bower. “It was this kind of a push-and-pull relationship.” There were moments when Biden broke from administration policy, most notably when he announced his support for gay marriage in 2012, frustrating a White House intent on message control. At other times Obama tasked Biden with important duties – shepherding the 2009 stimulus bill through Congress and overseeing the drawdown of US troops in Iraq. By the time Biden finished his eight years in the vice-presidency, he and Obama had formed a strong friendship. Bower recounts an interview she had with Biden during which Biden became visibly emotional when talking about Obama speaking at Beau’s funeral. “They were kind of, as hokey as it sounds, like a family during those eight years,” says Bower. “It was kind of a father-son relationship, too, because of their age difference.” In a surprise ceremony in the final days of his presidency, Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the nation’s highest civilian honour. After joking about their “bromance”, Obama turned serious. “To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretence, services without self-regard and to live life fully,” he said. The speech had the tenor of a benediction, marking the end of a long career in public service. A year and a half earlier, Obama pressured Biden not to challenge Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination. “The president was convinced I could not beat Hillary,” Biden wrote in his 2017 memoir, “and he worried that a long primary fight would split the party and leave the Democratic nominee vulnerable in the general election.” The Democrats had a long and acrimonious primary fight anyway – between Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And a vulnerable Clinton lost the general election. Four years later, Biden dispatched Sanders more easily than Clinton had and the former vice-president finally secured the Democratic nomination. His success was due, in no small part, to his service as a dutiful deputy to Obama, which won him overwhelming support among black Democrats. “Let me explain something to you about Joe Biden,” writes Laurie Goff in a Facebook post that captured this sentiment. “This old rich white man played second fiddle to a black man. Not just any black man but a younger black man, a smart black man. Not just for a day. Not one, not two but eight years.” “This is what showing up and being an ally looks like,” she concludes. “When black people say they know Joe,this is how we know.” In what could be seen as an acknowledgement of this support, Biden selected a former presidential rival, Kamala Harris, to be his vice-presidential running mate, giving a black woman the kind of stepping stone to the presidency that Obama had provided him eight years earlier. Once again the Democrats had a multi-generational, multi-ethnic presidential ticket. As Obama’s “wingman”, Biden was able to get a foothold in the White House.

France to make masks mandatory in most workplaces,"Until now, the French government has only advised the wearing of masks at work when social distancing is not possible France is to make face masks compulsory in most workplaces as it grapples with a resurgence in coronavirus cases. The new rule is likely to apply to all shared spaces in offices and factories where there is more than one employee present. The measure is set to begin on 1 September. Individual offices will be exempt. France has seen a sharp rise in coronavirus cases since July and masks are already widely used. Its average number of new cases over seven days is now well above 2,000, double what it was at the start of the month. About 220,000 people have now been infected and more than 30,000 have died. Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? Coronavirus: Cases surge as France goes 'wrong way' How Wuhan went from quiet streets to packed pools Health officials suggest that almost a quarter of new clusters have been linked to workplaces outside medical settings, reports BBC Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson. The spike comes as the government encourages the country back to work in order to fill a 11% hole in its budget, she adds. France imposed one of Europe's strictest lockdowns in March, which was gradually lifted from 11 May. Following fresh outbreaks in July, the government made face masks compulsory in enclosed public spaces. Several cities have also mandated their use in busy outdoor areas. Until now, however, the French government has only advised the wearing of masks at work when social distancing is not possible. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading Health minister Elisabeth Borne discussed the issue with union leaders on Tuesday and the new advice is expected to be published in the coming days. The latest measure follows updated advice on the risk of aerosol infections. Coronavirus is spread when droplets are sprayed into the air when infected people talk, cough or sneeze. Those droplets can then fall on surfaces. But experts say there is also emerging evidence of people catching the virus from tiny particles hanging in aerosol form in the air. France is among several European countries tightening coronavirus restrictions, amid increasing infections - particularly among younger people. Italy has made it compulsory to wear masks at bars and clubs in the evening. Meanwhile, theopening match of the 2020-21 season for France's top football league, Ligue 1, has been postponed. The first fixture, in which Marseille were set to take on Saint-Etienne on Friday, has been called off after four positive coronavirus tests at Marseille. The opening match will now be played on either 16 or 17 September. Covid map: Where are cases the highest?

Fans flock to save Berlin's cheeky wild boar,"Elsa's recent escapade made her a social media star Elsa might now be the world's most famous wild boar - and her celebrity has drawn a crowd of fans campaigning to save her from hunters. Elsa is the name given to the sow who was chased by a German nudist in Berlin, after she snatched his plastic bag containing a laptop. Pictures of the chase, in a popular bathing area, went viral. The boar managed to flee with her two piglets. But officials do not rule out that she could be culled, with other boars. Cheeky boar leaves nudist grunting in laptop chase The boars at Teufelssee - a lake in Berlin's leafy Grunewald district - ""have lost their normal timidity"" around humans, according to the local forestry office manager Katja Kammer. Speaking to Berlin broadcaster rbb24, she said the sow should be ""removed"" because there were too many wild boars there, which could get aggressive and could spread disease to humans, including swine fever. Removal, she added, did not mean relocation, because that would require an area to be fenced off. As many as 2,000 wild boars are shot in Berlin annually, and the hunting season starts in autumn. In hot summer months wild boars are attracted to lakes and pools A Grunewald forestry spokesman, Marc Franusch, explained however that a sow with young piglets would not be culled - at least not until the piglets were old enough to fend for themselves. ""These are wild animals which deserve our respect and should not be fed,"" he said. People have been feeding the Grunewald boars with apples and sandwiches, rbb24 reports. On Sunday, several campaigners demonstrated in Grunewald to save Elsa and her fellow boars. An online petitionon the campaign website change.org,externalhas picked up more than 9,000 signatures. It is called ""Save the cheeky but peaceful sow of Teufelssee!"" The now famous photos of the laptop chase were taken by Adele Landauer, who said the nudist laughed off the whole incident.

Boyfriend's Bestival drug-death conviction quashed,"Louella Fletcher-Michie was found dead in a wooded area on the edge of the Bestival site A man who gave his girlfriend drugs at a music festival and filmed her as she died has had his conviction for manslaughter overturned. Ceon Broughton, 31, was jailed for eight-and-a-half years in 2019 over the death of Louella Fletcher-Michie, 24. The daughter of Holby City actor John Michie died after taking the hallucinogenic class A drug 2-CP at Bestival in Dorset in 2017. Three judges at the Court of Appeal ruled to overturn the conviction. Miss Fletcher-Michie was found dead in woodland, 400m from the festival's hospital tent in the early hours of 11 September 2017, the day she was due to turn 25. During Broughton's trial, the jury was shown video shot by the rapper - who used the stage name CeonRPG - in which Miss Fletcher-Michie became ""disturbed, agitated, and then seriously ill"". Broughton, of Enfield, north London, was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence and supplying a class A drug at Winchester Crown Court in February last year. Ceon Broughton was found guilty of manslaughter and supplying a Class A drug in 2019 Delivering the Court of Appeal's ruling, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett said the prosecution had failed to prove that Miss Fletcher-Michie could have lived if her boyfriend had called for help. He added: ""In respectful disagreement with the judge, we conclude that the appellant's main argument, that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury, is established. ""Taken at its highest, the evidence adduced by the prosecution was incapable of proving causation to the criminal standard of proof. ""The appeal against conviction for manslaughter must be allowed."" Ms Fletcher-Michie's father is actor John Michie, who starred in Holby City and Coronation Street Lord Burnett said the jury had to rely on one expert's evidence when deciding if Broughton's actions contributed ""significantly"" to his girlfriend's death. He said the expert had suggested Miss Fletcher-Michie would have had a 90% chance of survival if she had been given medical treatment at 21:10 - nearly five hours after she took the drug. Given that the criminal standard of proof requires jurors to be sure ""beyond reasonable doubt"", Lord Burnett said the expert's evidence was ""not enough"" and therefore the issue of whether Broughton caused death by gross negligence should not have been for the jury to decide. The court ruled there should not be a retrial for the manslaughter conviction - which accounted for seven years of Broughton's sentence. His conviction for supplying his girlfriend with the class A drugs stands. It is believed Broughton will now be released. This video can not be played In footage shown to jurors by the defence, Louella Fletcher-Michie was filmed playing with fairy lights in a tent at the festival A statement issued by the rapper's lawyers said: ""The Court of Appeal has today found that Louella's death occurred not as a result of criminal negligence but was instead a tragic accident. ""Ceon remains devastated by her death. ""He has always wished that he could have done more to save her. ""He loved Louella and she him, but he knows that no words will ever be sufficient to convey his sense of responsibility for what happened or to begin to remove the pain that others have been caused."" The Crown Prosecution Service said it would fully consider the judgement and the points raised. Head of special crime and counter terrorism Jenny Hopkins, said: ""We respect the decision the Court of Appeal has made in the case of Ceon Broughton and are considering the next steps following today's judgment. ""Our thoughts remain with the family of Ms Fletcher-Michie at this difficult time."" A spokesperson for Mr Michie told the BBC he would not be commenting.

"Tiny elephant shrew rediscovered after 50 yearsThe last scientific record of the ""lost species"" of elephant shrew was in the 1970s.Science & Environment","The animal is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand A little-known mammal related to an elephant but as small as a mouse has been rediscovered in Africa after 50 years of obscurity. The last scientific record of the ""lost species"" of elephant shrew was in the 1970s, despite local sightings. The creature was found alive and well in Djibouti, a country in the Horn of Africa, during a scientific expedition. Elephant shrews, or sengis, are neither elephants nor shrews, but related to aardvarks, elephants and manatees. They have distinctive trunk-like noses, which they use to feast on insects. There are 20 species of sengis in the world, and the Somali sengi (Elephantulus revoilii) is one of the most mysterious, known to science only from 39 individuals collected decades ago and stored in museums. The species was previously known only from Somalia, hence its name. Steven Heritage, a research scientist at the Duke University Lemur Center in Durham, US, and a member of the expedition to the Horn of Africa in 2019, said he was thrilled to put the species ""back on the radar"". He told the BBC: ""We were really excited and elated when we opened the first trap that had an elephant shrew in it, a Somali sengi. ""We did not know which species occurred in Djibouti and when we saw the diagnostic feature of a little tufted tail, we looked at each other and we knew that it was something special."" The creature lives in a dry, rocky habitat The scientists had heard reports of sightings in Djibouti, and Houssein Rayaleh, a Djiboutian research ecologist and conservationist who joined the trip, believed he had seen the animal before. He said while people living in Djibouti never considered the sengis to be ""lost"", the new research brings the Somali sengi back into the scientific community, which is valued. ""For Djibouti this is an important story that highlights the great biodiversity of the country and the region and shows that there are opportunities for new science and research here,"" he said. The team set more than 1,000 traps at 12 locations, baiting the traps with a concoction of peanut butter, oatmeal and yeast. They caught one of the creatures in the first trap they set in the dry, rocky landscape of Djibouti. In total, they saw 12 sengis during their expedition and obtained the first-ever photos and video of live Somali elephant shrews for scientific documentation. They did not observe any immediate threats to the species' habitat, which is inaccessible and far from farming and human developments. The abundance of the species seems similar to other elephant shrews and its range may extend beyond Somalia into Djibouti and possibly Ethiopia. Djibouti has valuable biodiversity, much of which is unknown The Somali sengi is one of the 25 ""most wanted lost species"" of the charity, Global Wildlife Conservation. ""Usually when we rediscover lost species, we find just one or two individuals and have to act quickly to try to prevent their imminent extinction,"" said Robin Moore. ""This is a welcome and wonderful rediscovery during a time of turmoil for our planet, and one that fills us with renewed hope for the remaining small mammal species on our most wanted list, such as the DeWinton's golden mole, a relative of the sengi, and the Ilin Island cloudrunner."" DNA analysis shows that the Somali sengi is most closely related to other species from as far away as Morocco and South Africa, placing it in a new genus. The mammal has somehow dispersed across great distances over time, leaving biologists with a new puzzle. The scientists plan to launch another expedition in 2022 to GPS radio-tag individual sengis to study their behaviour and ecology. Kelsey Neam of Global Wildlife Conservation added: ""Finding that the Somali sengi exists in the wild is the first step in conservation. Now that we know it survives, scientists and conservationists will be able to ensure it never disappears again."" The research is published in the journal Peer J. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Eat Out discount dishes up 35m meals in two weeks,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the scheme last month Diners used the Eat Out to Help Out scheme more than 35 million times in its first two weeks, the latest Treasury figures show. The scheme offers customers in restaurants, pubs and cafes 50% off their meal up to a maximum of Â£10. It runs every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August to encourage support for the hospitality sector. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the 35 million figure ""is equivalent to over half of the UK taking part"". More than 85,000 restaurants have now registered for Eat Out to Help Out. According to data from booking site Open Table, it has helped restaurants to be 27% fuller on average than they were during the Monday-to-Wednesday period in August 2019. Mr Sunak said: ""With at least 35 million meals served up in the first two weeks alone, that is equivalent to over half of the UK taking part and supporting local jobs in the hospitality sector. ""To build back better we must protect as many jobs as possible, that is why I am urging all registered businesses to make the most of this by claiming back today - it's free, simple and pays out within five working days."" The government has set aside Â£500m to fund the scheme. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data. 'Eat out' scheme used 10.5m times in first week How can I get 50% off a meal out this week? ""The Eat Out to Help Out scheme has really been amazing,"" said Stephen Wall, managing director and co-founder of restaurant chain Pho. ""It's so nice to see our restaurants full of happy staff and customers again. ""It has certainly benefitted our early week figures and seems to have encouraged the British public to dine out safely, as our restaurants are filling up and staying busy throughout the weekend, too."" No vouchers are needed, with the participating establishment simply deducting 50% from the bill, up to the Â£10 per person maximum, and reclaiming the money from the Treasury. However, the discount is only on food and soft drinks eaten on the premises, and does not apply to takeaways. There is no limit on how many times the discount can be used in August, or for how many people, including children. However, the scheme has faced criticism. In July, the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecast it would most likely be a ""giveaway"" that benefitted those well-off enough to eat out. Anti-obesity campaignerssaid the scheme ""would be a green light to promote junk food"". Andsome restaurant ownerswere concerned the measures could pull in diners earlier in the week to the detriment of weekend trade.

Mali president 'seized by mutinying soldiers',"This video can not be played The mutinying soldiers were cheered by crowds as they reached the capital Bamako Soldiers in Mali have detained the country's president, as well as the prime minister and other top officials in an apparent coup attempt. President Ibrahim Boubacar KeÃ¯ta and PM Boubou CissÃ© are being held at a military camp near the capital Bamako. Earlier, the mutinying soldiers took control of the Kati camp. There has been anger among troops about pay and over a continuing conflict with jihadists - as well as widespread discontent with President KeÃ¯ta. Tuesday's mutiny and arrests have sparked international condemnation. The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional bloc that has been mediating talks between President KeÃ¯ta and opposition groups, has called for the immediate release of all officials. In a statement,external, it also said its 15 member states had agreed to close their borders with Mali, suspend all financial flows to the country, and eject Mali from all of Ecowas' decision-making bodies. Are coups on the rise in Africa? The popular imam taking on Mali's president A quick guide to Mali It was led by Col Malick Diaw - deputy head of the Kati camp - and another commander, Gen Sadio Camara, BBC Afrique's Abdoul Ba in Bamako reports. After taking over the camp, about 15km (nine miles) from Bamako, the mutineers marched on the capital, where they were cheered by crowds who had gathered to demand President KeÃ¯tas's resignation. In the afternoon they stormed his residence and arrested the president and his prime minister - who were both there. The president's son, the Speaker of the National Assembly, the foreign and finance ministers were reported to be among the other officials detained. The number soldiers taking part in the mutiny is unclear - as are their demands. Some reports say it was fuelled by a dispute over army pay. Kati camp was also the focus of a mutiny in 2012 by soldiers angry at the inability of the senior commanders to stop jihadists and Tuareg rebels taking control of northern Mali. Footage from AFP news agency showed a building owned by the justice ministry in Bamako ablaze on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Analysis by Will Ross, BBC World Service Africa editor What began as a mutiny appears to have morphed into a coup. This will be welcomed by the huge number of protesters who have been out on the streets for months calling for President KeÃ¯ta to step down. Parallels will be drawn between these events and 2012 when the government's mishandling of a rebellion led to another coup. Violent jihadists took advantage of that chaos to seize northern Mali. And they continue to cause havoc across the region. Ibrahim Boubacar KeÃ¯ta won a second term in elections in 2018, but there is widespread anger over corruption, the mismanagement of the economy and the worsening security situation with jihadist and communal violence on the increase. In recent months huge crowds led by populist imam Mahmoud Dicko have been calling on President KeÃ¯ta to step down. Much smaller crowds reportedly gathered in the capital on Tuesday in support of the soldiers. United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres demanded the ""unconditional release"" of Mali's leaders and the ""immediate restoration of constitutional order"". The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday, following a request by France and Niger, a senior UN diplomat told the AFP news agency. The chairman of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said he ""emphatically condemns"" the arrests of President KeÃ¯ta and his prime minister. The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) said: ""This mutiny comes at a time when, for several months now, Ecowas has been taking initiatives and conducting mediation efforts with all the Malian parties."" This video can not be played Mahmoud Dicko has emerged as the leader of an opposition movement seeking the Malian president's departure Mali is a key base for French troops fighting Islamist insurgents across the Sahel region, and the former colonial was quick to react to Tuesday's events.

"Camping gear sales jump amid staycation boomAsda, John Lewis and Halfords have all seen surging demand for equipment as pitch bookings rise.Business","Sales of camping gear have jumped as more Britons opt to holiday within the UK this summer due to coronavirus. Asda, John Lewis and Halfords said demand for tents, airbeds and stoves had surged due to the staycation trend. Camping booking website Pitchup.com said demand for pitches in August had been twice as high as last year, with demand for September also strong. It said many people were choosing to holiday outdoors because they felt it was easier to socially distance. It also said it had directly benefited from the government's travel quarantines on Spain and France, which had forced many Britons to change their holiday plans at the last minute. On Tuesday Asda reported it had seen a 25% jump in camping gear sales in the three months to 31 July, while Tesco said sales of camping chairs, airbeds, tents and inflatable pillows had all jumped. John Lewis said camping equipment sales were up 243% in the last six months compared with a year ago. Caravan and camp sites 'inundated' with calls And Halfords said it had seen a surge in demand for camping and touring products since lockdown was lifted on 4 July. Popular products include camping stoves, with sales up 300% in July, cool boxes (up 180%) and camping chairs (120%). Many Britons are holidaying at home this year due to coronavirus travel restrictions, fears about contagion and the recently scorching UK weather, all of which appears to have benefited camp sites. However, some have warned that thehigh demand could lead to a rise in uncontrolled - or wild - camping that could pose a health risk. Pitchup.com, which advertises around 2,000 camp sites, said total bookings equated to 660,000 so far for 2020, against 640,000 for the same period in 2019. It said this was a strong performance given camp sites had been forced to close for 15 weeks during lockdown. The firm added that there had been a 116% growth in bookings in August, and that it expected this year's peak season to last longer than usual as holidaymakers took deferred breaks. Founder Dan Yates said: ""To quote the deputy chief medical officer, it's a 'biological truism' that outdoor environments are safer than those indoors, and unlike other accommodation types, many of our clients have tens or even hundreds of acres to devote to social distancing. ""It's therefore not surprising that outdoor holidays have exploded in popularity this year. It's also the the only type of accommodation that has been able to expand to meet demand from the many holidaymakers who've switched plans from abroad to stay on home turf."" The Camping and Caravanning Club, which has more than 300,000 members across the UK, and represents more than 1,300 campsites, said it had seen similarly strong demand. A spokesman said: ""Pitch bookings for August are up 15% versus last year and September is currently 68% ahead of the same month for 2019. ""Looking further ahead, early indications are that pitch bookings are also looking positive for 2021."" Will you go camping in the UK this summer instead of holidaying abroad?

Williamson 'incredibly sorry' for exam distress,"This video can not be played Gavin Williamson says his focus is on ""making sure that every student gets the grades that they deserve"" Gavin Williamson says he is ""incredibly sorry for the distress"" caused to pupils after having to make a U-turn in how A-levels and GCSEs are graded. The education secretary refused to say if he will resign amid a fresh scramble to secure university places. ""My focus is making sure youngsters get the grades that they deserve,"" he said. Tens of thousands of students may now have the grades to trade up to their first-choice offers, prompting concerns about the number of available places. And uncertainty is continuing as admissions service Ucas and universities themselves have yet to be granted access to upgraded results. Exam results: Where did it go wrong and what happens next? How will universities cope with extra students? And other questions A-levels and GCSEs: How did the exam algorithm work? The University of Oxford said it now had ""many more offer-holders meeting their grades than in a normal year"" and as a result faced ""significant capacity constraints both within our colleges and on our academic courses"". Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK which represents vice-chancellors, said that many more students now had the grades to get into their first-choice university. He said this will ""cause challenges at this late stage in the admissions process - capacity, staffing, placements and facilities - particularly with the social distance measures in place"". The Association of School and College Leaders said it would write to Mr Williamson to request an immediate independent review into what it called the grading ""fiasco"". ""This degree of transparency is necessary at a time when public confidence has been badly shaken,"" general secretary Geoff Barton said. He called on No 10 and Ofqual to put in place a ""robust contingency plan"" for students sitting GCSEs and A-levels next summer in the event of further Covid-related disruption. Mr Williamson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday: ""I would like to start off by apologising - saying sorry to all those young people who've been affected by this. This is something none of us expected to see and none of us wanted to see."" Both Frances Ramos (left) and Zainab Ali were left unsure if they would get their first-choice university places, despite their grades being bumped up Frances Ramos, 18, from Towcester, Northamptonshire, said she was pleased to be given her predicted grades of ABB - up from the BCD she received last Thursday. But she said the U-turn ""does feel like it's a bit too late"" and added: ""I kind of wish the government had done this on Thursday."" She is now waiting to hear if her first choice, the University of Liverpool, will accept her to study this year. Zainab Ali, 18, from London, also thought the government should have acted sooner. ""I think it's a shame. After the damage is done, that's when they will take action and I find it quite frustrating,"" she said. The U-turn should now mean Zainab is able to attend Queen Mary University, London. Students relieved and annoyed after A-level U-turn Mr Williamson said it had been the common view of the government, Ofqual, and the devolved administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland of different political parties that the system in place was more robust and ""significantly better"" than that in Scotland, afteran earlier U-turn there. But after the release of A-level results on Thursday he said it ""became increasingly apparent that there were too many young people that quite simply hadn't got the grade they truly deserved"". The ""exact same challenge"" would have remained had there been a U-turn earlier, he said, and ""we would still be faced with the challenge of the fact of how do we expand the capacity within the university sector"". He refused to address questions about his future as education secretary during interviews on Tuesday morning and he declined to offer explicit support for Ofqual's chief regulator, Sally Collier, to stay in her job. Mr Williamson later told LBC: ""We ended up in a situation where Ofqual didn't deliver the system that we had been reassured and believed that would be in place."" Mr Williamson would not say whether he had offered his resignation to Prime Minister Boris Johnson during interviews on Tuesday Labour's shadow higher education minister Emma Hardy told Breakfast it appeared Ofqual had been ""thrown under the bus"" by the government despite it working to ministers' instructions during the pandemic. Ofqual's algorithm downgraded around 40% of entries and came under fire after data showed poorer students' grades were marked down further than better off pupils. Ministers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales all decided on Monday - four days after A-level results were issued - to revert to teacher assessed grades rather than the algorithm. NI: Assembly recall over exam results to go ahead Wales: Exam board chief 'disappointed' by grades U-turn The government's U-turn means teachers' assessments will also be used for all GCSE results - except for any cases where the algorithm adjustment actually suggests a better grade. It is still unclear what the climbdown will mean for students taking vocational qualifications, including BTecs, with studentstelling BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat: ""We've been forgotten about."" Mr Williamson said he hoped they would also be subject to teacher-assessed grades, adding that the government was working with awarding authorities to ensure this happened. Pearson, which awards BTecs, said it was aware that some BTec students had experienced a delay in receiving grades but did not say how many were impacted. As part of the changes to grading, Mr Williamson has suspended a cap on student numbers for universities - effectively allowing institutions to accept unlimited numbers this year. 11 August:Gavin Williamson announced A-level students would be able to use their results in mock tests to appeal if they are unhappy with the grades they are given, calling it a ""safety net"". Earlier in the day Scotland's government decided to switch to teachers' predicted grades 12 August:Nick Gibb, schools minister for England, acknowledged the government was ""concerned"" about what had happened in Scotland but insisted the system in England remained ""robust"" Thursday 13 August (results day):Mr Williamson ruled out following the Scottish government in reversing position, telling Sky News: ""You've got to have a system that has checks and balances"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the results were a ""robust set of grades"" Saturday:Mr Williamson told the Times there would be ""no U-turn"" on the grading system, saying Scotland had ended up with ""a system where there aren't any controls"" and had ""rampant grade inflation"" Sunday:Mr Williamson defended Ofqual's grading method in the Sunday Express, saying the calculated grade ""makes certain that everyone can be confident that these qualifications carry the same weight as previous years"" Monday:Mr Williamson announces a move to teacher-assessed grades for A-levels and GCSES saying ""we now believe it is better"" Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group which represents 24 leading universities, said there were ""limits to what can be done by the university sector alone to address that uncertainty without stretching resources to the point that it undermines the experience for all"". VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Universities including Bristol, Durham, Sheffield and Liverpool stopped offering places through the clearing system that matches students to unfilled courses on Monday. Bristol later said it would accept all applicants who now met the terms of an offer and Sheffield said it would do so ""wherever possible"". But some universities say that numbers will have to remain limited on medicine and dentistry courses. Ucas was unable to say how many students had not been able to take up places due to their results being downgraded. It said its latest figures early on Tuesday showed: 327,350 university applicants had been placed at their first-choice university since the results were released last week, slightly up on the same point last year 45,300 candidates had accepted a place at a back-up choice university, and a further 25,190 candidates had found a place through clearing. This means that a maximum of around 60,000 students could have accepted offers at lower-choice universities due to the exam results chaos - although it is likely to be less than that as some would still have fallen short of the grades needed for their first choice A Ucas spokesman said students who have not got into their first-choice institution should seek advice from their parents or teachers before contacting the university. Sam Freedman, who was a senior policy adviser to the Department for Education between 2010 and 2013, said it ""beggared belief"" that the secretary of state had said he was only aware of problems over the weekend. ""I can't think of many other education secretaries who wouldn't have already resigned,"" he said.

Guilty verdict over assassination of Lebanon ex-PM,"The blast near Beirut's seafront killed Hariri and 21 other people A UN-backed court has found a member of the militant group Hezbollah guilty of involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri. Judges at the Netherlands-based Special Tribunal for Lebanon said Salim Ayyash had a central role in the bomb attack in Beirut in 2005 that killed Hariri. They acquitted three other defendants, who like Ayyash were tried in absentia. Hezbollah denied any involvement, and the judges said no evidence implicated the Shia militant group's leaders. Hariri's son Saad, who is himself a former prime minister, told reporters outside the court: ""I think today everybody's expectation was much higher than what came out, but I believe the tribunal came out with a verdict that is satisfying and we accept it."" Rafik Hariri's son Saad said the family would ""not rest until the punishment is carried out"" Now, he said, it was time for Hezbollah to ""make sacrifices"". ""It is clear that the network responsible is from its ranks,"" he added. ""We will not rest until the punishment is carried out."" The verdict comes at a time of crisis in Lebanon, with the country still reeling from a devastating explosion at Beirut's port two weeks ago that killed at least 180 people. The blast led to the resignation of the government, already embattled by protests over an economic collapse that has seen many people lose their savings and jobs. The tribunal's verdicts will disappoint supporters of Rafik Hariri as well the families of the 21 others who were killed and the 226 who were wounded, many grievously. The man convicted in his absence, Salim Ayyash, was a well-connected, mid-level operative in Hezbollah, the most powerful military and political group in Lebanon. It is classified by the UK, the US and others as a terrorist organisation. Hezbollah's leader, Hasan Nasrallah, has denied it was involved and refused to allow the arrest of Ayyash or the other men who have been cleared. One of his top military commanders, Mustafa Badreddine, was also indicted until he was killed in Syria in 2016. The verdict has nevertheless given Rafik Hariri's son Saad, a former prime minister who might get the job again, a lever to use against Hezbollah. The Hariri camp, and others, believe Ayyash was acting under orders, from Hassan Nasrallah and most likely from Hezbollah's backers, Syria and Iran. Rafik Hariri was seen as a threat to their power in Lebanon. One of the judges, David Re, said the court had found motive but not evidence. Even so, the conviction of a Hezbollah man will feed into the fevered political atmosphere in Lebanon. Rafik Hariri, a Sunni, was a billionaire businessman who served as prime minister of Lebanon five times following the 1975-90 civil war. His last term in office ended in 2004, after which he aligned himself with the opposition in parliament and backed calls for Syria to withdraw its forces, which had been in Lebanon since 1976. Hariri, a billionaire businessman, had urged Syria to leave Lebanon On the morning of 14 February 2005, Hariri was travelling in a motorcade past the St George Hotel in downtown Beirut when a bomb hidden in a van exploded. The blast created a crater at least 10m (32ft) wide and 2m deep in the street, and left nearby vehicles smouldering and shopfronts blown out and blackened. Who were the accused at Rafik Hariri tribunal? The killing brought tens of thousands of demonstrators onto the streets in protest against the pro-Syrian government, with the finger of blame for the assassination pointed at Lebanon's heavily influential neighbour. The government resigned two weeks later and Syrian troops pulled out that April. The killing of Hariri triggered huge anti-government protests in Beirut After collecting evidence, the UN and Lebanon set up the STL in 2007 to investigate the bombing, and four suspects were ultimately put on trial in absentia. The prosecution's case relied on the analysis of calls between mobile phones that it said were used to plan, prepare and execute the attack. A Lebanese investigator who started the trawl of the phone data and made crucial early breakthroughs, Wissam Eid, was assassinated in Beirut in 2008. They found Ayyash, 56, guilty of five charges, including conspiracy aimed at committing a terrorist act, committing a terrorist act by means of an explosive device, and the intentional murder of Hariri with premeditation by using explosive materials. The whereabouts of Salim Ayyash remains unknown STL prosecutors alleged that Ayyash co-ordinated the physical perpetration of the attack and, together with Mustafa Badreddine, the surveillance of Hariri. Ayyash was also accused of purchasing the van that exploded, and of having played a role in preparing what prosecutors said was a false claim of responsibility made by a Palestinian man on behalf of a fictional Sunni fundamentalist group. Ayyash's court-appointed defence lawyers said the prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence that did not prove his involvement in the conspiracy. But Judge David Re told the court on Tuesday: ""Mr Ayyash had a central role in the execution of the attack and directly contributed to it. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah rejected the trial as a plot ""Mr Ayyash intended to kill Mr Hariri and had the required knowledge about the circumstances of the assassination mission, including that explosives were the means to be used."" The judge said there was not enough evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the other defendants - Assad Sabra, 43, Hussein Oneissi, 46, and Hassan Habib Merhi, 54. The panel also concluded that while Syria and Hezbollah ""may have had motives to eliminate"" Hariri and some of his political allies, there was ""no evidence that the Hezbollah leadership had any involvement in Hariri's murder and there is no direct evidence of Syrian involvement"", according to Judge Re.

Camping gear sales jump amid staycation boom,"Sales of camping gear have jumped as more Britons opt to holiday within the UK this summer due to coronavirus. Asda, John Lewis and Halfords said demand for tents, airbeds and stoves had surged due to the staycation trend. Camping booking website Pitchup.com said demand for pitches in August had been twice as high as last year, with demand for September also strong. It said many people were choosing to holiday outdoors because they felt it was easier to socially distance. It also said it had directly benefited from the government's travel quarantines on Spain and France, which had forced many Britons to change their holiday plans at the last minute. On Tuesday Asda reported it had seen a 25% jump in camping gear sales in the three months to 31 July, while Tesco said sales of camping chairs, airbeds, tents and inflatable pillows had all jumped. John Lewis said camping equipment sales were up 243% in the last six months compared with a year ago. Caravan and camp sites 'inundated' with calls And Halfords said it had seen a surge in demand for camping and touring products since lockdown was lifted on 4 July. Popular products include camping stoves, with sales up 300% in July, cool boxes (up 180%) and camping chairs (120%). Many Britons are holidaying at home this year due to coronavirus travel restrictions, fears about contagion and the recently scorching UK weather, all of which appears to have benefited camp sites. However, some have warned that thehigh demand could lead to a rise in uncontrolled - or wild - camping that could pose a health risk. Pitchup.com, which advertises around 2,000 camp sites, said total bookings equated to 660,000 so far for 2020, against 640,000 for the same period in 2019. It said this was a strong performance given camp sites had been forced to close for 15 weeks during lockdown. The firm added that there had been a 116% growth in bookings in August, and that it expected this year's peak season to last longer than usual as holidaymakers took deferred breaks. Founder Dan Yates said: ""To quote the deputy chief medical officer, it's a 'biological truism' that outdoor environments are safer than those indoors, and unlike other accommodation types, many of our clients have tens or even hundreds of acres to devote to social distancing. ""It's therefore not surprising that outdoor holidays have exploded in popularity this year. It's also the the only type of accommodation that has been able to expand to meet demand from the many holidaymakers who've switched plans from abroad to stay on home turf."" The Camping and Caravanning Club, which has more than 300,000 members across the UK, and represents more than 1,300 campsites, said it had seen similarly strong demand. A spokesman said: ""Pitch bookings for August are up 15% versus last year and September is currently 68% ahead of the same month for 2019. ""Looking further ahead, early indications are that pitch bookings are also looking positive for 2021."" Will you go camping in the UK this summer instead of holidaying abroad?

Ferdinand hit with road ban for speeding,"Rio Ferdinand was disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for six months Former England footballer Rio Ferdinand has been banned from driving for six months after he admitted speeding. The ex-Manchester United star, who is now a football pundit, was caught doing more than 70mph in a Mercedes on the A27 at Hangleton in Hove, East Sussex. Crawley Magistrates' Court was told the 41-year-old, who lives in Orpington, south-east London, hit a speed of 85mph on the dual carriageway last July. He was ordered to pay a total of Â£822 in fines and costs. In 2012, Ferdinand was caught speeding three times in five weeks on the same stretch of road in Manchester.

Depression doubles during coronavirus pandemic,"Twice as many adults in Britain are reporting symptoms of depression now compared with this time last year, Office for National Statistics figures suggest. One in five people appeared to have depressive symptoms compared with one in ten before the pandemic. The conclusions are based on a survey of more than 3,500 adults followed up over a 12-month period. They were asked the standard set of questions used to assess depression. People were asked to consider the previous two weeks and say how often they had experienced a range of symptoms, including changes in sleep or appetite, a loss of interest and pleasure in doing things, and difficulty concentrating. Almost 20% of people met the criteria for depression, based on their responses, in June 2020 compared with just under 10% between July 2019 and March 2020. While the measure of depression used is a well-known screening questionnaire though, Prof Elaine Fox at the University of Oxford, said: ""It is important to remember that this does not give a diagnosis but rather an indication of everyday depressive feelings and behaviours"". Severe mental health problems rise amid pandemic A small number of people (3.5%) saw an improvement in their symptoms. But 13% of people surveyed had newly developed symptoms of ""moderate to severe"" depression over the survey period. People under 40, women, people with a disability and those who said they would struggle to meet an unexpected cost of Â£850 were the groups most likely to show symptoms of depression. Laura Moulding, a 23-year-old recent graduate from Cardiff had this experience of struggling with worsening mental health over lockdown, while also managing a form of chronic fatigue called ME. Although she was already managing with the symptoms of severe depression prior to coronavirus, not being able to go out or have face-to-face psychiatrist appointments left her feeling ""the worst I've ever felt,"" she told the BBC. Pre-Covid she found going outside and keeping busy by volunteering helped to clear her head. But over lockdown, she had ""dark and intrusive thoughts...I've never known my depression feel this bad"". Dr Charley Baker, an associate professor of mental health at the University of Nottingham, said: ""It's unsurprising to see these rates of low mood and depressive symptoms emerging...The people highlighted as struggling the most are those who are already more vulnerable to low mood, anxiety and poorer wellbeing."" But she points out that not all of the increase in mental health symptoms will be among people who have clinical conditions. ""It's important though to avoid over-pathologising what might be seen as reasonable responses to the current pandemic,"" she said. Stephen Buckley, head of information at the charity Mind, said: ""It's important to bear in mind that most of us will have found the last five or six months more difficult than usual, and there's no 'normal' way to respond to a pandemic. ""If you notice changes to your thoughts, feelings and behaviours that are affecting your daily life, last longer than two weeks, or keep returning - talk to someone you trust, like your GP. A GP should be able to let you know if you might have a common mental health problem, like depression and anxiety, and signpost you to support.""

Fortnite: Epic files new injunction against Apple,"Epic released a defiant video about its fight against Apple Fortnite-maker Epic Games has filed a fresh injunction against Apple in its continuing dispute with the technology giant over its App Store policy. Apple removed Fortnite from the store after the game offered a discount on its virtual currency for purchases made outside of the app, from which Apple receives a 30% cut. Epic says the fee is unfair. And now, it says, Apple has threatened to remove it from its developer programme, on 28 August. This would leave it unable to offer any other games or apps on Apple platforms. Offering in-app purchasing only is a condition of being on both Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store - and both companies take the same percentage of sales. After circumventing the rule, Fortnite was removed from both stores last week. It has filed separate legal complaints against them. Existing Fortnite players on these platforms (iPhone or Android phones, for example) still have the game but are currently unable to get updates, which are regularly released elsewhere. New players cannot download it. Apple has given Epic two weeks to re-instate the in-app payments if it wants Fortnite to return to the store. Fortnite sues Google as ban battle intensifies Fortnite sues Apple over App Store ban In its latest legal papers,external, Epic says it will be ""irreparably harmed"" by being completely removed from Apple's developer programme. The ban would also include its Unreal Engine, a popular graphics tool widely used by third-party developers of other games, films and virtual reality - meaning they too would have to find an alternative tool. In a statement, Apple said the rules applied to every app in the store and Epic had created the problem for itself by choosing to break the terms. ""We won't make an exception for Epic because we don't think it's right to put their business interests ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers,"" it said. Epic accused Apple of operating ""a complete monopoly"" over the one billion users of its operating system, which underpins all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad and Macbook.

Coronavirus update and A-levels inquiry - reactionThe Welsh government holds its weekly briefing as politicians seek answers on the A-levels row.,"Health Minister Vaughan Gething has given the Welsh Government's weekly coronavirus update He says an Â£32m extra investment in coronavirus testing will make sure results ""are returned as quickly as possible"" Mr Gething also apologised to A-level students for the ""stress and anxiety"" caused by decisions on grades after exams were cancelled Students will now be given the grades estimated by their teachers after an outcry over results downgraded by a standardisation system The Senedd's education committee has been recalled and is taking evidence on how the debacle happened Public Health Wales said there were no further deaths with coronavirus to announce on Tuesday, leaving the official total at 1,589 Natalie Grice and Ben Frampton We are bringing today's live page to a close. Thanks for joining us this afternoon. Here's a reminder of some of the key points:  We'll be back for the weekly government coronavirus briefing next Tuesday. Have a good evening. Five key areas will be used in managing coronavirus as Wales moves into autumn and winter. The Welsh government published its Coronavirus Control Plan on Tuesday, saying it will be a partnership between local government, health boards, businesses and the public. The areas are:  The plan represents an escalating level of response, should prevalence of the virus increase. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""We are placing a huge importance on prevention. By getting that stage right we can avoid further restrictions on our lives."" Gwyn Griffiths wants to study civil engineering ""It's just a waiting game."" That's how 18-year-old Gwyn Griffiths describes how he's feeling as he waits to find out if his re-graded A-level results will allow him into his first choice university. The Maesteg Comprehensive School pupil is ""still hopeful"" of winning a place to study civil engineering at the University of the West of England in Bristol. He was ""distraught"" on results days, when he got a B, C and two Us because he'd been predicted a B, two Cs and a D. ""I was really shocked, because of the massive downgrade I'd had. It was awful to be honest with you, knowing this could affect my future and possibly the rest of my life."" But after the elation of yesterdays' U-turn on grading, he's no clearer on whether he can go to UWE. ""They themselves still don't know what will happen. They said as soon as they know they'll inform me but as far as I know, that could take hours, it could take days. it could take weeks."" Gwyn has accepted a place at Swansea University but is still holding out hope of going to UWE. He said: ""I'm just waiting for emails from universities, or my head of sixth form, to see where I stand. I keep updating websites too see if any news has come out."" BTEC students who still have not received results which should have come last Thursday should get them by the end of the day, the exam regulatory body Qualification Wales has said. Speaking at the Senedd's education committee, the body's regulation director Jo Richards said: ""So we understand that there has been a delay to the BTEC results and weâve had notification of that from [exam board] Pearson. ""We are working with them and are asking for regular updates. They are working through that data and we understand students should expect that by the end of today.""  Some students have missed out on university courses because of a delay to results Education Minister Kirsty Williams says she apologises ""unreservedly"" to the young people of Wales for the way exam results have been handled. Speaking to MSs on the Senedd's Childen and Young People Committee, the minister said:

""It has been, and continues to be, a stressful time for our young people.

I am sorry that the results process has made that worse. ""I apologise directly and unreservedly to our young people.

I am truly sorry."" Kirsty Williams apologised at the virtual Senedd committee meeting Caroline Jones joined the Senedd as a UKIP member in 2016 The Brexit Party is down to three members in the Welsh Parliamentafter former UKIP Senedd leader Caroline Jones quit. The South Wales West politician said the party has a ""anti-devolution"" stance that was ""against her principles"". Senned leader Mark Reckless has vowed to campaign to scrap the Senedd, proposing a directly-elected first minister instead. The Brexit Party group wished her well.

Ms Jones was one of seven UKIP assembly members elected in 2016. Grade inflation for this year's students is a âpotential area of concernâ for the exam board and this could have an impact on next year's cohort, WJEC chief executive Ian Morgan says. Appearing before the Seneddâs education committee, Mr Morgan was asked by Labour MS Hefin David whether there could be âunintended consequencesâ of grade inflation, now that students will be awarded their predicted grades. Mr Morgan said there were âreal issues and concernsâ and it was an area the body would âneed to look atâ.

It came after the Welsh government announced on Monday it would be allowing students to receive their teacher-assessed grades if they were unhappy with ones predicted by an algorithm. Mr Morgan said that using centre-assessed grades in their âcurrent formâ, could âtransfer pressure back to schools and back to colleges in terms of teachers and how they now have to interact with learners"". âWeâve got to maintain a qualification standard that says, if you've got a GCSE in English language, your GCSE in English language for this year is the same level as your GCSE in English language for next year. âHow do we deal with that in an overarching process of saying thereâs equivalence between one year and the next year? I think we've got collective challenges in that."" Andrew RT Davies acknowledged society had to live with covid-19 for some time Covid-19 is here ""for the foreseeable future"" and so plans must be drawn up and implemented to deal with it and return ""life here to as normal as possible"", the Conservative's health spokesman has said. Andrew RT Davies was commenting following the earlier announcement by the Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, of the publication of plans to tackle the virus in the coming winter months. âTo allow this, then a targeted approach â including, if necessary, local lockdowns â is the way forward,"" Mr Davies said. âAnything else, any further blanket lockdown, will again have a damaging effect on our economy, on our young peopleâs education, and â critically â on the health of our nation. ""After all, weâre already facing the ticking time bomb of missed diagnoses or failures to start treatment for cancer and heart disease. âAll efforts must be channelled now at avoiding another national lockdown, and planning for the winter pressures NHS Wales faces annually while dealing with the backlog, and securing an economic recovery from the first lockdown.â Where are the hot spots in Wales and what is happening in care homes?Read the latest. Maia Gould was delighted about the U-turn Students have spoken of their ""massive relief"" after they were given the A-level results they were fighting for. The Welsh Government announced a U-turn on Monday and said those and GCSE results estimated by teachers would now be used, rather than those produced by an algorithm. There had been outrage after 42% of A-level grades in Wales were downgraded because of the system. For some students, the change means future plans are no longer in tatters. Universities said they were ""working hard to place applicants on the course of their choice"". Maia Gould, from Llangorse, near Brecon, almost lost her chance to study medicine. But after hearing about the U-turn, she said: ""I burst out crying straight away. I don't think I've ever been so happy in my life."" Read more here. WJEC exam board chief Ian Morgan's defence of the now abandoned algorithm system to predict A-level grades has rested on the increased number of students getting better results under teacher-assessed grades. This includes 15.4% of pupils getting A* grades, an increase of 6.3% on 2019. Mr Morgan told the Senedd's education committee: ""In any normal year if
there was an increase in outcomes of this magnitude I would be invited back to
the committee to explain how that had happened. ""You would want to know
what happened in the examination system that would allow an increase of that
kind."" More good news for pupils who feared they might have missed out on university places after initially receiving A-level grades lower than those predicted by their teachers. Aberystwyth University and the University of South Wales have joined other Welsh higher education institutions in saying they will honour places offered to pupils who have now got the necessary grades following the decision to scrap grades awarded by an algorithm. Some students missed out on their places last week when the results were first published. The Betsi Cadwaladr health board region in north Wales continues to see the most deaths in Wales, with no further deaths announced on Tuesday. Its running total of 415 includes two on Sunday, which accounts for 23 out of 24 Covid-19 deaths in the last two weeks. The total number of lab-confirmed deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales stands at 1,589. There were no further deaths with coronavirus in Wales to announce on Tuesday, Public Health Wales said, leaving the total at 1,589. The seven-day average number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales continues to follow a downward curve following a slight rise earlier in the month. The chief executive of the Welsh examinations board WJEC has defended the method used to set this year's A-level results that was abandoned by Welsh ministers on Monday. Ian Morgan said that system would have meant grades A* to E would have been up by 1% from last year and A* to A would have risen by 2.9%. A* would have been up 0.1% on 2019, with 1.7% of candidates reaching that level. Appearing before the Senedd's Children, Young People and Education Committee on Tuesday, he said the decision to use teachers' estimates instead meant 99.9% of candidates achieving grades A* to E. There was now a 13.4% increase in candidates getting A* to A, meaning 40.4% reaching that standard. The A* grade had been awarded to 15.4% of pupils, an increase of 6.3% on 2019 outcomes, Mr Morgan said. The committee was recalled during the Welsh Parliament''s summer break to scrutinise the handling of the examinations crisis. There have been no further deaths with coronavirus in Wales, the latest Public Health Wales figures have shown. It leaves the total number at 1,589. Twenty-four new cases were recorded, bringing Wales' count to 17,599. More than 100,000 people have signed up to take part in future NHS trials of a coronavirus vaccine - but more volunteers are needed, researchers say. They want as many people as possible to enrol, to speed up their efforts to find a safe and effective jab. And they are particularly looking for more volunteers from the ""high-priority groups"" disproportionately affected by the virus - those belonging to ethnic minorities or aged over 65. Volunteers canregister online,external. Marks & Spencer is cutting 7,000 jobs over the next three months across its stores and management. It said the coronavirus pandemic had made it clear there had been a ""material shift in trade"". In-store sales of clothing and home goods were ""well below"" 2019, although online and home deliveries were strong. M&S said it hoped a ""significant proportion"" of the cuts - about a tenth of its workforce - will be voluntary redundancy and early retirement. Read more here. A meeting of the Senedd's education committee has begun, after it was recalled to discuss the row over exam results. There had been outrage after 42% of A-level grades in Wales were downgraded because of the system. But results estimated by teachers will now be usedrather than those produced by an algorithm. Lynne Neagle, chair of the committee, said: âGiven the significant concerns and complexities surrounding the awarding of exam results this year we will be meeting urgently to seek clarity for those whoâve been through this challenging process in unprecedented times. âYoung peopleâs well-being, and their ability to plan for their future learning and careers, will be at the centre of our work looking at these issues. âWe recognise that these matters are complex and will need detailed, longer term consideration. However, we believe that there is an important role for us to play now, to ask questions which will ensure that a fair and clear approach is adopted and communicated to the Welsh people as quickly as possible.â It has invited the WJEC, Qualifications Wales and the Welsh Government to provide information on the latest developments and answer questions.

Guilty verdict over assassination of Lebanon ex-PMOne of four men on trial over the killing of Rafik Hariri in a 2005 bomb attack has been convicted.,"The blast near Beirut's seafront killed Hariri and 21 other people A UN-backed court has found a member of the militant group Hezbollah guilty of involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri. Judges at the Netherlands-based Special Tribunal for Lebanon said Salim Ayyash had a central role in the bomb attack in Beirut in 2005 that killed Hariri. They acquitted three other defendants, who like Ayyash were tried in absentia. Hezbollah denied any involvement, and the judges said no evidence implicated the Shia militant group's leaders. Hariri's son Saad, who is himself a former prime minister, told reporters outside the court: ""I think today everybody's expectation was much higher than what came out, but I believe the tribunal came out with a verdict that is satisfying and we accept it."" Rafik Hariri's son Saad said the family would ""not rest until the punishment is carried out"" Now, he said, it was time for Hezbollah to ""make sacrifices"". ""It is clear that the network responsible is from its ranks,"" he added. ""We will not rest until the punishment is carried out."" The verdict comes at a time of crisis in Lebanon, with the country still reeling from a devastating explosion at Beirut's port two weeks ago that killed at least 180 people. The blast led to the resignation of the government, already embattled by protests over an economic collapse that has seen many people lose their savings and jobs. The tribunal's verdicts will disappoint supporters of Rafik Hariri as well the families of the 21 others who were killed and the 226 who were wounded, many grievously. The man convicted in his absence, Salim Ayyash, was a well-connected, mid-level operative in Hezbollah, the most powerful military and political group in Lebanon. It is classified by the UK, the US and others as a terrorist organisation. Hezbollah's leader, Hasan Nasrallah, has denied it was involved and refused to allow the arrest of Ayyash or the other men who have been cleared. One of his top military commanders, Mustafa Badreddine, was also indicted until he was killed in Syria in 2016. The verdict has nevertheless given Rafik Hariri's son Saad, a former prime minister who might get the job again, a lever to use against Hezbollah. The Hariri camp, and others, believe Ayyash was acting under orders, from Hassan Nasrallah and most likely from Hezbollah's backers, Syria and Iran. Rafik Hariri was seen as a threat to their power in Lebanon. One of the judges, David Re, said the court had found motive but not evidence. Even so, the conviction of a Hezbollah man will feed into the fevered political atmosphere in Lebanon. Rafik Hariri, a Sunni, was a billionaire businessman who served as prime minister of Lebanon five times following the 1975-90 civil war. His last term in office ended in 2004, after which he aligned himself with the opposition in parliament and backed calls for Syria to withdraw its forces, which had been in Lebanon since 1976. Hariri, a billionaire businessman, had urged Syria to leave Lebanon On the morning of 14 February 2005, Hariri was travelling in a motorcade past the St George Hotel in downtown Beirut when a bomb hidden in a van exploded. The blast created a crater at least 10m (32ft) wide and 2m deep in the street, and left nearby vehicles smouldering and shopfronts blown out and blackened. Who were the accused at Rafik Hariri tribunal? The killing brought tens of thousands of demonstrators onto the streets in protest against the pro-Syrian government, with the finger of blame for the assassination pointed at Lebanon's heavily influential neighbour. The government resigned two weeks later and Syrian troops pulled out that April. The killing of Hariri triggered huge anti-government protests in Beirut After collecting evidence, the UN and Lebanon set up the STL in 2007 to investigate the bombing, and four suspects were ultimately put on trial in absentia. The prosecution's case relied on the analysis of calls between mobile phones that it said were used to plan, prepare and execute the attack. A Lebanese investigator who started the trawl of the phone data and made crucial early breakthroughs, Wissam Eid, was assassinated in Beirut in 2008. They found Ayyash, 56, guilty of five charges, including conspiracy aimed at committing a terrorist act, committing a terrorist act by means of an explosive device, and the intentional murder of Hariri with premeditation by using explosive materials. The whereabouts of Salim Ayyash remains unknown STL prosecutors alleged that Ayyash co-ordinated the physical perpetration of the attack and, together with Mustafa Badreddine, the surveillance of Hariri. Ayyash was also accused of purchasing the van that exploded, and of having played a role in preparing what prosecutors said was a false claim of responsibility made by a Palestinian man on behalf of a fictional Sunni fundamentalist group. Ayyash's court-appointed defence lawyers said the prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence that did not prove his involvement in the conspiracy. But Judge David Re told the court on Tuesday: ""Mr Ayyash had a central role in the execution of the attack and directly contributed to it. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah rejected the trial as a plot ""Mr Ayyash intended to kill Mr Hariri and had the required knowledge about the circumstances of the assassination mission, including that explosives were the means to be used."" The judge said there was not enough evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the other defendants - Assad Sabra, 43, Hussein Oneissi, 46, and Hassan Habib Merhi, 54. The panel also concluded that while Syria and Hezbollah ""may have had motives to eliminate"" Hariri and some of his political allies, there was ""no evidence that the Hezbollah leadership had any involvement in Hariri's murder and there is no direct evidence of Syrian involvement"", according to Judge Re.

Rapper's Bestival drug-death conviction quashed,"Louella Fletcher-Michie was found dead in a wooded area on the edge of the Bestival site A man who gave his girlfriend drugs at a music festival and filmed her as she died has had his conviction for manslaughter overturned. Ceon Broughton, 31, was jailed for eight-and-a-half years in 2019 over the death of Louella Fletcher-Michie, 24. The daughter of Holby City actor John Michie died after taking the hallucinogenic class A drug 2-CP at Bestival in Dorset in 2017. Three judges at the Court of Appeal ruled to overturn the conviction. Miss Fletcher-Michie was found dead in woodland, 400m from the festival's hospital tent in the early hours of 11 September 2017, the day she was due to turn 25. During Broughton's trial, the jury was shown video shot by the rapper - who used the stage name CeonRPG - in which Miss Fletcher-Michie became ""disturbed, agitated, and then seriously ill"". Broughton, of Enfield, north London, was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence and supplying a class A drug at Winchester Crown Court in February last year. Ceon Broughton was found guilty of manslaughter and supplying a Class A drug in 2019 Delivering the Court of Appeal's ruling, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett said the prosecution had failed to prove that Miss Fletcher-Michie could have lived if her boyfriend had called for help. He added: ""In respectful disagreement with the judge, we conclude that the appellant's main argument, that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury, is established. ""Taken at its highest, the evidence adduced by the prosecution was incapable of proving causation to the criminal standard of proof. ""The appeal against conviction for manslaughter must be allowed."" Ms Fletcher-Michie's father is actor John Michie, who starred in Holby City and Coronation Street Lord Burnett said the jury had to rely on one expert's evidence when deciding if Broughton's actions contributed ""significantly"" to his girlfriend's death. He said the expert had suggested Miss Fletcher-Michie would have had a 90% chance of survival if she had been given medical treatment at 21:10 - nearly five hours after she took the drug. Given that the criminal standard of proof requires jurors to be sure ""beyond reasonable doubt"", Lord Burnett said the expert's evidence was ""not enough"" and therefore the issue of whether Broughton caused death by gross negligence should not have been for the jury to decide. The court ruled there should not be a retrial for the manslaughter conviction - which accounted for seven years of Broughton's sentence. His conviction for supplying his girlfriend with the class A drugs stands. It is believed Broughton will now be released. This video can not be played In footage shown to jurors by the defence, Louella Fletcher-Michie was filmed playing with fairy lights in a tent at the festival A statement issued by the rapper's lawyers said: ""The Court of Appeal has today found that Louella's death occurred not as a result of criminal negligence but was instead a tragic accident. ""Ceon remains devastated by her death. ""He has always wished that he could have done more to save her. ""He loved Louella and she him, but he knows that no words will ever be sufficient to convey his sense of responsibility for what happened or to begin to remove the pain that others have been caused."" The Crown Prosecution Service said it would fully consider the judgement and the points raised. Head of special crime and counter terrorism Jenny Hopkins, said: ""We respect the decision the Court of Appeal has made in the case of Ceon Broughton and are considering the next steps following today's judgment. ""Our thoughts remain with the family of Ms Fletcher-Michie at this difficult time."" A spokesperson for Mr Michie told the BBC he would not be commenting.

Beauty salons and nail bars to reopen in Leicester,"The lockdown in Leicester was announced on 29 June Beauty salons and nail bars are among businesses in Leicester allowed to reopen from Wednesday in a further easing of lockdown restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the rate of infections ""has now dropped to a safe enough level"" for some businesses to reopen. However, restrictions on gatherings in private homes and gardens remain. Leicester became the first area in the UK to be subject to a local lockdown on 29 June. As well as salons and nail bars, spas, massage and tattoo parlours and body piercing services are also able to reopen from Wednesday. Shielding for the most vulnerable will continue, but it will be eased in Leicester to allow individuals to meet in a group of up to six if they are outdoors and maintaining social distancing. Though the relaxed restrictions allow outdoor swimming pools to reopen, the only one in Leicestershire is in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, is not in the lockdown area and already open. The move will bring the city into line with the easing of restrictions introduced for much of England on 11 and 13 July. ""My gratitude goes out to the people of Leicester who have all made sacrifices to keep the virus at bay and protect their local communities,"" Mr Hancock said. Leicester and some neighbouring areas were told to observe strict measures from 29 June Government figures released on Tuesday evening show there were 204 cases recorded in the week to 14 August. This compares with 226 recorded in the previous week and is down by more than half compared with whenthe city was first told it would face tighter restrictionsthan the rest of England at the end of June. The city still has one of the highest rates of new cases in England, with almost 58 per 100,000 of population in the week to 14 August. Sir Peter Soulsby, mayor of Leicester, said the announcement was ""more or less what we expected"", adding the relaxation some of the rules for people shielding ""will greatly benefit their mental health"". ""We had planned to continue our neighbourhood testing programme throughout August and the restrictions around households will help in our efforts to track down the virus and contain it,"" he said. ""What we really don't want is to see numbers increase which could result in more severe restrictions being put in place once again in parts, or all, of the city."" Salons in the city said they were looking forward to reopening. ""I'm super-excited because we have been closed since March and obviously lost lots of business throughout,"" said Minal Parmar, who owns The Beauty Refinery on London Road. ""Everyone has been affected financially - but I just can't wait to be open."" Krishna Devaliya said she hopes customers will feel comfortable to return Krishna Devaliya, owner of Your Beauty At The Cutting Room, said: ""I'm excited but also a little bit nervous - Leicester still isn't fully recovered, will people come back or not?

Belarus protesters mark jailed activist's birthday,"As far as the protesters outside the prison are concerned, President Lukashenko got 0% of the vote President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has accused the opposition of trying to stage a coup, amid widespread anger over a disputed election. Speaking as opposition leaders formed a council to organise a transfer of power, he said: ""We definitely consider this as an attempt to seize power."" The opposition contests the official results of the 9 August poll, which gave Mr Lukashenko 80% of the vote. The country has since seen 10 days of street protests and strikes. The protesters allege massive vote-rigging and say the winner was opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya - who officially secured only about 10% of votes. There were no independent election observers. What's happening in Belarus? 'The people will not forgive this' Hundreds of protesters have been wounded and two have died in clashes with police during the post-election protests. Thousands have been arrested, and many have spoken of torture at the hands of security forces. Ms Tikhanovskaya was forced to leave for neighbouring Lithuania, after being after being detained for hours in the aftermath of the vote. Mr Lukashenko, who has led Belarus since 1994, insists he has won fairly and has ruled out holding another election. On Tuesday he threatened action against the 35 people appointed by Ms Tikhanovskaya to the opposition co-ordination council, saying he had the means to ""cool those hotheads"". The group includes artists, writers and business people. In a televised meeting, Mr Lukashenko said the group's aim was clear: ""They demand nothing less than the transfer of power. We see it unequivocally: it is an attempt to seize power... with all the consequences that come with it."" In pictures: Striking images from Belarus protests 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change Also on Tuesday, he awarded medals ""for impeccable service"" to security officials who have helped him crack down on protesters. At the weekend, more than 100,000 people gathered in Minsk - the largest protest held in Belarus since it declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990 - to express opposition to his rule. This video can not be played Large crowds of anti-government demonstrators rallied in the capital on Sunday Strike action is also keeping up the pressure on the president. State TV and key factories have been affected, and postal workers are now also reported to have joined the strikes. 'If you croak we don't care': brutality in Belarus Five things you may not know about the country On a visit to a tractor plant on Monday, Mr Lukashenko defended the official election tally, telling workers: ""We held the election. Until you kill me, there will be no other election."" But as he spoke, many in the audience booed him and chanted ""leave"". Hundreds of opposition protesters gathered outside a Minsk prison to mark the birthday of Ms Tikhanovskaya's jailed husband. Sergei Tikhanovsky, who has just turned 42, was detained on charges of inciting violence, alongside other rivals of President Lukashenko ahead of the 9 August poll. Ms Tikhanovskaya ran in his place. Many protesters held red-and-white balloons, the colours of the opposition, while some chanted ""happy birthday Sergei"" and sang a song about prison walls coming down. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Tikhanovskaya, 37, said her husband was spending his birthday in prison because of ""a crime he did not commit"". ""All of this blatant lawlessness and injustice shows how this rotting system works, in which one person controls everything, one person who has kept the country in fear for 26 years, one person who robbed Belarusians of their choice,"" she said in a video message. Many protesters regard Svetlana Tikhanovskaya as the legitimately elected president Ms Tikhanovskaya says that if votes had been counted correctly, she would have won a comfortable majority. Mr Lukashenko, who has maintained close ties with neighbouring Russia, has sought Moscow's help, saying President Vladimir Putin has promised to provide assistance in the event of any external military threat. On Tuesday, Mr Putin had phone calls with both Emmanuel Macron of France and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Both said the Belarusian government must start a dialogue with the opposition. Mr Putin told them that foreign interference would only escalate the crisis, Russian officials say. EU leaders are to hold an emergency video summit on Wednesday.EU foreign ministers agreed last week to prepare new sanctions,externalagainst Belarusian officials responsible for ""violence, repression and the falsification of election results"". On Monday, the UK said it did not accept the results of the ""fraudulent"" election and US President Donald Trump said his administration was following the ""terrible situation"" in Belarus closely.

Scottish government 'was not out to get Salmond',"Ms Evans was the first person to give evidence to the inquiry The Scottish government's harassment complaints system was not drawn up to ""get Alex Salmond"", the country's top civil servant has told an inquiry. Leslie Evans apologised for the government's handling of allegations against the former first minister. But she insisted that investigating them was ""the right thing to do"". MSPs are investigating the failure of the government's complaints handling process, which saw Mr Salmondawarded a Â£500,000 expenses payout in court. Ms Evans - who is the permanent secretary to the Scottish government - told the Scottish Parliament inquiry she wanted to ""apologise unreservedly to all concerned for this procedural failure"". Mr Salmond has previously called for the civil servant to quit, but she has been backed by the current first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. How will Holyrood's Alex Salmond inquiry work? Who is Leslie Evans? The government launched an internal investigation into harassment complaints against Mr Salmond from two female members of staff in January 2018. The allegations dated back to when he was serving as first minister. Alex Salmond walked free from court in March having been cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault and attempted rape However, Mr Salmond raised a legal challenge which led to the government admitting thatthe investigation had been unlawful. Judge Lord Pentland said it had been ""procedurally unfair"" and ""tainted with apparent bias"" because the investigating officer assigned to the case had had prior contact with the complainers. Mr Salmond was subsequently cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault at the High Court in Edinburgh in March. Ms Evans accepted that ""one part of our procedure should have been applied differently"" during the government's investigation of the first two complaints that were made against Mr Salmond. She said she would ""apologise unreservedly to all concerned for this procedural failure"". But she told the committee that ""when complaints were raised, it would have been unconscionable, and a failure in our duty of care, not to investigate those complaints"". Ms Evans has been strongly backed by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon She went on to say that lessons had been learned from the failure, but insisted that the Scottish government ""is and remains ahead of many other institutions in designing and implementing a procedure to address harassment and particularly to address historical allegations of sexual misconduct"". Ms Evans told the committee: ""The Scottish government has been on a journey of cultural change since 2015 to ensure the organisation is more open, capable and responsive. ""As permanent secretary, I have led a focus on equality, inclusion and wellbeing, including addressing bullying and harassment."" Mr Salmond's defence during his criminal trial claimed that he had been thevictim of a political conspiracy- something Ms Sturgeon has dismissed as ""a heap of nonsense"". Ms Evans was asked directly if the complaints handling procedure - signed off by Ms Sturgeon in December 2017 - had been ""engineered"" specifically to target Mr Salmond. The permanent secretary replied: ""Absolutely not"". She confirmed that one staff member who had raised a concern about Mr Salmond's behaviour had been shown a draft of the policy, but said it was ""not unusual"" for someone with ""lived experience"" to be consulted. ""I don't believe there were any changes made as a result of that,"" she added. Ms Evans was also asked about claims from civil service unions about ""bullying behaviour"" within the government in the past, replying that ""we have got a more inclusive culture than we did have"". Committee convener Linda Fabiani has clashed with Ms Evans over the disclosure of documents The Holyrood inquiry has pledged not to re-investigate any of the complaints against Mr Salmond, and will instead focus on the development of the internal government policy and the ""culture of government"". The committee, led by Deputy Presiding Officer Linda Fabiani, is examining the development of the government's harassment complaints procedure, the application of that procedure to the case of Mr Salmond, and the judicial review case. Ms Fabiani, an SNP MSP, has repeatedly clashed with the permanent secretary over documentation and written evidence being supplied by the government ahead of the hearing. She has spoken of her ""frustration and disappointment,externalat the very limited amount of information the Scottish government has chosen to disclose"" about the judicial review. Alex Salmond trial: What is the political fallout? Ms Sturgeon has insisted that the complaints handling procedure she ordered to be drawn up in the wake of the Me Too movement remained ""completely robust"" despite the ""deeply regrettable"" failure in the case of her predecessor. She has ordered an internal review of ""the specific application of this one element of the procedure"", and has also triggered an independent review to decidewhether she broke the ministerial codein her dealings with Mr Salmond.

"M&S to cut 7,000 jobs over next three months","Marks & Spencer is cutting 7,000 jobs over the next three months across its stores and management. It said the coronavirus pandemic had made it clear there had been a ""material shift in trade"". In-store sales of clothing and home goods were ""well below"" 2019, although online and home deliveries were strong. M&S said it hoped a ""significant proportion"" of the cuts - about a tenth of its workforce - will be voluntary redundancy and early retirement. In a statement,external, M&S said it was ""too early to predict with precision where a new post-Covid sales mix will settle. We must now act to reflect this change"". But the retailer said operating during the pandemic had showed it could work ""more flexibly and productively"", with more staff multi-tasking and moving between food, clothing and home departments. M&S said total sales in its hard-hit clothing and home arm plunged 29.9% in the eight weeks since shops reopened, with store sales tumbling 47.9% and online surging 39.2%. At the height of lockdown, M&S boss Steve Rowe said customers might ""never shop the same way again"" after the coronavirus crisis. And last month the retailer announced 950 store management and head office jobs were at risk because it needed to accelerate its restructuring. Shopping may never be the same again, says M&S M&S extends 30-minute home delivery service John Lewis and Boots to cut 5,300 jobs WH Smith may cut 1,500 jobs after sales plummet Alongside Tuesday's announcement of more job cuts Mr Rowe said: ""In May we outlined our plans to learn from the crisis, accelerate our transformation and deliver a stronger, more agile business in a world in which some customer habits were changed forever. ""Three months on and our 'Never the Same Again' programme is progressing; albeit the outlook is uncertain and we remain cautious. He said the proposals to ""further streamline store operations and management"" were an ""important step in becoming a leaner, faster business set up to serve changing customer needs"". Retail Economics chief executive Richard Lim said the cuts represented a ""massive reduction"" in the M&S workforce. The retailer was ""desperately attempting to reposition the business towards a new-normal emerging in the sector"". ""Retailers were already battling with the pace of structural change facing the sector but the impact of the pandemic has been a step-change for the industry."" He said retailers remained in ""survival mode, preserving cash and hanging on for more sustainable levels of demand to return"". ""But the way we shop has changed on a permanent basis for many parts of the sector almost overnight. ""The reality is that many more retailers will fail and the number of job losses will ramp up as government support is withdrawn. This is the calm before the storm."" In recent weeks, several retailers have announced job cuts, among themJohn Lewis, which warned 1,300 jobs could go, Boots, which said 4,000 were at risk, andWH Smith, which may shed 1,500 jobs. Dave Gill, national officer of the shopworkers' union Usdaw, said Tuesday's announcement was ""yet another devastating blow for M&S staff and yet another bombshell for our High Streets. The government has a clear choice: do they want to see the High Street go to the wall, or do they want to help save it""? Marks and Spencer has been in the throes of a big reorganisation of one sort or another for most of the past two decades. Successive management teams have struggled to come to terms with rapid shifts in consumer behaviour - but none so rapid as what has happened over the past four months. M&S had already begun what looked like it most serious restructuring in years before the pandemic struck, with a big drive to boost online sales - notably with a partnership with Ocado - and to close underperforming stores. But those plans, drawn up by Chairman Archie Norman and Chief Executive Steve Rowe, have been accelerated by the coronavirus. The bigger question now is whether the drastic action now being taken is enough to cope not only with the sudden decline in sales brought about by the pandemic, but the longer-term shifts that have so vexed M&S management in the past. The size of the job cuts suggests that M&S is at least taking those threats seriously. M&S employs almost 78,000 people, most of them in the UK. The bulk of the latest job cuts are expected to come among shop floor workers, with about 12% of customer assistant roles going. Cuts will also be made at head office and in regional management. However, the company is shifting resources and recruiting towards areas that are expanding - online and food. M&S said online clothing and home goods sales had been performing strongly since the beginning of the year, and over the last eight weeks had accounted for 41% of its total clothing and home goods sales. In the last 13 weeks M&S's total food sales increased by 2.5%. On Tuesday, the latest Kantar grocery index showed that as a whole, the market expanded by 14.4% in the 12 weeks to 9 August. Sales at Morrisons increased the most, rising by 16% over that period. Dixons Carphone to cut 800 store management jobs Selfridges job cuts 'toughest decision ever' Marks & Spencer set to cut 950 jobs John Lewis and Boots to cut 5,300 jobs Shopping may never be the same again, says M&S M&S extends 30-minute home delivery service WH Smith may cut 1,500 jobs after sales plummet Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Health Secretary axes public health body,"The health secretary said there was huge global demand for protective equipment Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed Public Health England will be replaced by a new body focused on preparing for external threats like pandemics. Baroness Dido Harding, who runs NHS Test and Trace in England, will be the interim chief of the new National Institute for Health Protection (NIHP). PHE has come under intense scrutiny of its coronavirus response. Ministers have been accused of using PHE as a scapegoat for failings. Government has been criticised for the controversial decision in March to halt community testing and tracing of contacts. The new institute will begin work with immediate effect and will bring together Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace, as well as the analytical capability of the Joint Biosecurity Centre under a single leadership team, to ""strengthen"" public health. Matt Hancock said it would have a ""single and relentless mission"" of protecting people from external health threats including pandemics, biological weapons and infections diseases ""To give ourselves the best chance of beating this virus once and for all - and of spotting and being ready to respond to other health threats, now and in the future, we are creating a brand new organisation to provide a new approach to public health protection and resilience. ""My single biggest fear is a novel flu, or another major health alert, hitting us right now in the middle of this battle against coronavirus. ""Even once this crisis has passed - and it will pass - we need a disease control infrastructure that gives us the permanent, standing capacity to respond as a nation and the ability to scale up at pace."" Public Health England 'to be replaced' Contact tracers in England cut by 6,000 Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number The new health protection agency for England will, we are told, be modelled on Germany's Robert Koch Institute which combats infectious diseases. Expertise from Public Health England and the Test and Trace network will be pooled to form an organisation focussed on tackling the coronavirus threat and future pandemics.  And therein lies the historic problem. PHE was formed as part of Government health reforms in 2012 with an ungainly merger of health protection and prevention initiatives such as obesity strategies. It was pulled in different directions and had to get by with successive annual budget cuts. PHE has been blamed for the suspension of community testing and tracing in March but senior sources say it was not set up to run a mass diagnostic testing system and any decisions made then were in partnership with Government advisers. The centrepiece of the reforms is the creation of the new agency but there are still big questions over what will happen to PHE's vital work on prevention of ill health and tackling health inequalities. The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) questioned the timing of an announcement on the scrapping of a national public health agency in the midst of a global pandemic. RSPH chief executive Christina Marriott said: ""We recognise that there have been some serious challenges in terms of our response to Covid-19, including the timing of the lockdown, the ongoing ineffectiveness of Tier 2 Track and Trace and postcode-level data previously not being available to directors of public health."" But she said ""multiple lessons"" needed to be learned ""before solutions can be in place in advance of the winter"", adding: ""to do otherwise risks avoidable mistakes in subsequent waves of the pandemic which will only harm the public's health further."" Prof Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology at Imperial College London, defended PHE as an ""assembly of some of the wisest and most committed microbiologists and epidemiologists you could hope for anywhere"". He criticised what he called the ""persistent meddling from on-high"", which he said had ""disenfranchised and fractured"" staff ""to the great detriment of the UK as a whole"". Prof Tedder warned the plans to merge existing laboratory staff with NHS Test and Trace were ""misplaced"" and would ""further dismantle"" the ""irreplaceable"" expertise that exists within PHE. Liberal Democrat Health spokesperson Munira Wilson told the BBC News Channel it was ""quite clear"" that ministers were trying to deflect responsibility from some of the ""terrible decisions"" taken, ""from the provision of protective equipment, test and trace and the tracing app being botched and a whole series of other blunders through this crisis"" then trying to scapegoat PHE as a result. She said they should be going forward with an independent inquiry so lessons learned could be used in any second wave of the pandemic. Labour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said in a tweetthat there had been ""no transparency or accountability"" in Baroness Harding's appointment,external.

Eat Out discount dishes up 35m meals in two weeksThe government set aside Â£500m for Eat Out to Help Out in order to support the hospitality sector.Business,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the scheme last month Diners used the Eat Out to Help Out scheme more than 35 million times in its first two weeks, the latest Treasury figures show. The scheme offers customers in restaurants, pubs and cafes 50% off their meal up to a maximum of Â£10. It runs every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August to encourage support for the hospitality sector. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the 35 million figure ""is equivalent to over half of the UK taking part"". More than 85,000 restaurants have now registered for Eat Out to Help Out. According to data from booking site Open Table, it has helped restaurants to be 27% fuller on average than they were during the Monday-to-Wednesday period in August 2019. Mr Sunak said: ""With at least 35 million meals served up in the first two weeks alone, that is equivalent to over half of the UK taking part and supporting local jobs in the hospitality sector. ""To build back better we must protect as many jobs as possible, that is why I am urging all registered businesses to make the most of this by claiming back today - it's free, simple and pays out within five working days."" The government has set aside Â£500m to fund the scheme. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data. 'Eat out' scheme used 10.5m times in first week How can I get 50% off a meal out this week? ""The Eat Out to Help Out scheme has really been amazing,"" said Stephen Wall, managing director and co-founder of restaurant chain Pho. ""It's so nice to see our restaurants full of happy staff and customers again. ""It has certainly benefitted our early week figures and seems to have encouraged the British public to dine out safely, as our restaurants are filling up and staying busy throughout the weekend, too."" No vouchers are needed, with the participating establishment simply deducting 50% from the bill, up to the Â£10 per person maximum, and reclaiming the money from the Treasury. However, the discount is only on food and soft drinks eaten on the premises, and does not apply to takeaways. There is no limit on how many times the discount can be used in August, or for how many people, including children. However, the scheme has faced criticism. In July, the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecast it would most likely be a ""giveaway"" that benefitted those well-off enough to eat out. Anti-obesity campaignerssaid the scheme ""would be a green light to promote junk food"". Andsome restaurant ownerswere concerned the measures could pull in diners earlier in the week to the detriment of weekend trade.

"'Trump cannot meet this moment' - Michelle Obama""Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country,"" says the ex-first lady in an emotional message.","This video can not be played Michelle Obama campaigned against Donald Trump in the 2020 election Michelle Obama has launched a stinging attack on US President Donald Trump as Democrats prepared to crown Joe Biden as their White House challenger. ""Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country,"" said the former US first lady in an emotional recorded message to the Democratic convention. Disaffected members of Mr Trump's Republican party also piled in on him at the Democratic party conference. The election takes place on Tuesday 3 November. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, Democrats scrapped plans for a crowded party extravaganza with balloon drops and all the other political razzmatazz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But it is unclear whether the largely virtual schedule of pre-recorded speeches with no live audience can generate the same level of enthusiasm as pre-pandemic gatherings of the party faithful. Republicans will face the same challenge as they make their case for four more years in the White House at a drastically scaled-down convention next week. A really simple guide to the US election What to watch for at the US Democratic convention How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mrs Obama, who recorded her keynote address before Mr Biden announced his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, six days ago, launched a blistering attack on Mr Trump. ""You simply cannot fake your way through this job,"" she said in remarks that closed the first night of the convention on Monday. The headline speaker added: ""Our economy is in shambles because of a virus that this president downplayed for too long."" ""Stating the simple fact that a black life matters is still met with derision from the nation's highest office,"" Mrs Obama continued. ""Because whenever we look to this White House for some leadership, or consolation or any semblance of steadiness, what we get instead is chaos, division and a total and utter lack of empathy."" She said the last four years had been difficult to explain to America's children. ""They see our leaders labelling fellow citizens enemies of the state, while emboldening torch-bearing white supremacists. This video can not be played Democratic National Convention day one: Biden's grandchildren and famous faces ""They watch in horror as children are torn from their families and thrown into cages, and pepper spray and rubber bullets are used on peaceful protests for a photo op."" Mrs Obama continued: ""Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. ""He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is."" She described Mr Biden as a ""profoundly decent man"", touting the Democratic White House candidate's experience as vice-president under her husband, President Barack Obama. ""We have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it,"" she said, wearing a necklace that said ""Vote"". A lot of politicians spoke at the camera during the ""virtual"" Democratic convention on Monday night. The only speaker who landed an emotional punch, however, was Michelle Obama. The truth, she said, was that Donald Trump ""simply cannot be who we need him to be for us"". ""It is what it is,"" she said, employing the same words the president recently used about the coronavirus death toll - a jab that was as subtle as it was devastating. She wasn't trying to convince Republicans to switch sides. That was the job of John Kasich, the Republican ex-governor of Ohio. She wasn't trying to get left-wing progressives to rally to Biden. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders handled that. Mrs Obama was speaking to loyal Democrats, some of whom may have stayed at home or voted for a third party in 2016, some of whom may be dispirited or scared this year. Her goal was to drive home the gravity of the moment and to give them a call to action. The opening night of the convention, a two-hour programme hosted by former Desperate Housewives actress Eva Longoria Baston, was titled by party organisers ""We the People"". John Kasich, who ran against Mr Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, recorded a message calling on Americans to deny the president a second term in office. This video can not be played What happens at the US conventions? Mr Kasich endorsed Mr Biden, saying: ""We can all see what's going on in our country today and all the questions that are facing us, and no one person or party has all the answers. ""But what we do know is that we can do better than what we've been seeing today, for sure."" What does Kamala Harris believe? Where Joe Biden stands on the key issues Bernie Sanders, the left-wing Vermont senator who was Mr Biden's fiercest competitor during the Democratic party's contest to pick a challenger to Mr Trump, also recorded a message. He said: ""My friends, I say to you, and to everyone who supported other candidates in this primary and to those who may have voted for Donald Trump in the last election: The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake."" He added: ""Nero fiddled while Rome burned - Trump golfs."" This video can not be played What do young Democrats think of Joe Biden? Along with Mr Kasich, three other high-profile Republicans recorded messages for the convention's opening night: California businesswoman Meg Whitman, former New Jersey Governor Christine Whitman and former New York congresswoman Susan Molinari. While their inclusion left the Biden team claiming a broad coalition, some Democrats grumbled that the Republicans used up precious time that could have benefited progressive speakers or lesser-known rising stars. But Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and Biden campaign co-chairman, rejected that idea, saying, ""remember tonight's theme is 'We the People,' not 'We the Democrats'"". The opening night also featured pre-recorded messages from everyday Americans, including repentant Trump voters and a woman who blamed her father's death from Covid-19 on the president. On Tuesday morning, Mr Trump responded to Mrs Obama's criticism in a series of tweets. ""[I] would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren't for the job done by your husband,"" he wrote. This video can not be played What does this hat mean to Americans? And on Monday, Mr Trump spoke to the BBC on Air Force One and lashed out at Mr Kasich. ""He was a loser as a Republican, and he'll be a loser as a Democrat,"" the president said. During a campaign speech earlier that day in Mankato, Minnesota, Mr Trump warned that if Mr Biden won in November, news outlets would lose their audiences. ""Nobody's going to want to cover sleepy Joe,"" Mr Trump said. ""We will end up with one very boring socialist country that will go to hell."" Mr Trump also confirmed he would accept the Republican nomination for a second term during a live speech at the White House next week. Democrats and some fellow Republicans have criticised the plan for using the White House as a campaign venue. The four-night jamboree will culminate in Mr Biden's speech on Thursday in a mostly empty ballroom in his home state of Delaware. On Wednesday, his vice-presidential pick, Ms Harris, the daughter of immigrant parents from India and Jamaica, will accept her nomination as the first woman of colour to be a running mate on a major party presidential ticket. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Also speaking on Wednesday are former President Obama, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, and one of Mr Biden's former rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren. Tuesday will hear speeches from former President Bill Clinton and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Joe Biden: This time the Oval Office?Guilty verdict over assassination of Lebanon ex-PM," How Joe Biden overcame public and personal adversity By Anthony Zurcher By Anthony Zurcher This article was first published on 18 August, 2020 It was the winter of Joe Biden’s discontent. After a disappointing finish in the Iowa caucuses in February, his support in the upcoming New Hampshire primary was collapsing and his 2020 presidential campaign was in serious jeopardy. He was, for all appearances, a defeated man. The White House hopes Biden had been harbouring during his nearly half-century in public service were slipping away again, perhaps for the last time. At a campaign rally ahead of the New Hampshire vote, Biden was reflective - and at times visibly emotional. He spoke of the death of his son, Beau, almost five years earlier.  He recounted stories from his childhood, of his family’s economic hardships. But he reassured the audience. “There’s always hope,” he said. “There’s always hope.” It wasn’t a typical rally speech – and given his subsequent fifth-place finish in New Hampshire, probably not an effective one. But it offered a glimpse into the psyche, the emotional scar tissue, of a politician who has faced devastating personal, professional and political adversity over the course of his life. “I have an incredibly high regard for fate,” Biden told the National Journal back in 1989. “I have never been able to plan my life. Every time my personal life has been how I wanted it, something has intervened.” Biden has witnessed the untimely deaths of the closest of loved ones. He’s built platforms for his political ambitions, only to watch them crumble, then built them again. His hard-earned rhetorical skills have won him the adoration of crowds, and his propensity for malaprops and gaffes have made him the object of ridicule. Biden frequently says that the main lesson he learned from his father was that the measure of a man isn’t how many times he’s been knocked down, but how quickly he gets back up. After losing in New Hampshire, Biden’s campaign regrouped in the southern states and turned what appeared to be impending defeat into a convincing march to the Democratic nomination. That was only the latest example of Biden facing challenges – some beyond his control, others resulting from his own mistakes and miscalculations – and soldiering on. “We have choices when we suffer like Joe,” says former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, who served with Biden in Congress during the 1990s. “He's a man of faith. He chose not to quit. He chose to keep doing the work, even though he didn't have to.” Biden, if nothing else, is a survivor. Five pivotal days in his life put this in stark relief – days casting shadows that stretched for decades. Joe Biden was in Washington on 18 December, 1972, when the telephone rang. It was his brother Jimmy in Delaware, asking to speak to his sister, Valerie. There had been a “slight accident” involving Biden's family, his sister relayed. “Nothing to be worried about,” she said. “But we ought to go home.” His wife Neilia, he would learn later that day, had been killed, along with their infant daughter, Naomi, when the car she was driving was hit by a lorry. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were also seriously injured. The family had been shopping for a Christmas tree while Biden – who had just been elected to the Senate - was off interviewing staff for his congressional office and finalising the purchase of a new home for the family. Now, that family was shattered. “I could not speak, only felt this hollow core grow in my chest,” Biden wrote in his memoir, “like I was going to be sucked inside a black hole.” He considered giving up the Senate seat he had just won. He contemplated joining the priesthood. He found himself taking evening walks in rough neighbourhoods, looking for a fight. “I had not known I was capable of such rage,” he wrote. “ I felt God had played a horrible trick on me, and I was angry.” Up until that day, Biden’s life had been on a remarkable upward trajectory. Just over a month earlier, the then-29-year-old Democrat had become the second-youngest person elected to the US Senate, defeating a two-term Republican incumbent in a race few thought he had a chance of winning. He was considered a golden boy in a Democratic Party that had been trounced across the nation by Richard Nixon and the Republicans. Biden’s childhood was relatively challenging. While his father had his share of business successes, mostly before Biden was born, the ups were inevitably followed by downs, and young Biden spent much of his youth living with his extended family in a modest home in Scranton, Pennsylvania. “The values that Vice-President Biden was exposed to as a young man were values rooted in the Church, rooted in Catholic education, rooted in the culture we were growing up in, which was Irish-American,” says Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, whose family has lived in Scranton for generations. His biggest childhood challenge was overcoming a speech impediment – a stutter – that afflicted him well into high school. In his memoir, Biden recalls memorising a reading to avoid tripping up during class and, when he once did, how a teacher mocked his disability, calling him “buh-buh-Biden”. That teacher, a Catholic nun, received a tongue-lashing from Biden’s mother, who threatened to “knock your bonnet off your head”, in Biden’s retelling. His high-school classmates gave him nicknames that made references to his stutter. “Even today I can remember the dread, the shame, the absolute rage, as vividly as the day it was happening,” Biden wrote. By the time he finished high school, however, he had overcome the stutter - the result, he says, of months of training himself to relax his face while he practised speaking in front of a mirror. It still reveals itself on occasion, however, when he’s under pressure or fumbling for words. “A stutter does not get worse as a person ages, but trying to keep it at bay can take immense physical and mental energy,” wrote John Hendrickson, in an Atlantic Magazine article about Biden’s stutter. No-one is ever truly cured, he says, they simply find ways around the problem. After high school, Biden went on to attend the University of Delaware and then law school at Syracuse University, in part to be near Neilia, whom he had met during a college holiday. They eventually married, and Biden’s political career began shortly after their return to Wilmington. He briefly practised law at a major firm, but disillusioned with representing the rich and powerful, he switched to being a public defender. From there, he ran for – and won – a seat on the New Castle county council. This became his unlikely springboard to the US Senate after no other Democrat expressed interest in challenging the entrenched Republican incumbent. “Joe Biden looks like the photograph of a great statesman in his youth,” a local newspaper columnist gushed. “His eyes sparkle blue, and his teeth shine when he smiles, his cheeks glow, and his body is still boyishly slim.” Joe Biden, 1972 Joe Biden, 1972 The article concluded on a surprisingly sombre note, however: “He had the look – both triumphant and sad – of a young man who believes the world is his, and knows he is yet to be tested.” Those tests would come – none more daunting than the one on that December day, just a few years later. Biden would ultimately accept his Senate seat, taking the oath of office from the Delaware hospital where his two sons were recovering. It marked the beginning of 44 consecutive years in national politics – a stretch that ended, as it began, with the untimely death of a child. In May 2015 Beau Biden died of brain cancer at the age of 46. Like his father, Beau had pursued a career in politics, serving as Delaware’s attorney general, with the prospect of higher offices to come. “He had all the best of me, but with the bugs and flaws engineered out,"" Biden wrote of Beau in his 2017 book about his son’s illness. Biden details how close he came to announcing his own presidential bid in 2015, but that the rawness of his son’s death – and the toll a campaign might take on his family – pushed him to stay out. “I wasn’t sure if I would be able to find the emotional energy, and I knew from previous experience that grief is a process that respects no schedule and no timetable,” he wrote. A lifetime of loss was something Biden learned to live with and overcome, like his stutter - a piece of himself that he found a way to build on. “It's my belief that your empathy is informed by your experience, but you're either born with that sense or you're not,” Senator Casey says. “In Biden’s case, it was both a quality he was born with but also one that was informed by his own personal tragedies that gave him an insight into loss and tragedy and pain that a lot of people never fully understand.” Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009 Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009  On 23 September 1987, Joe Biden stood before a crowd of reporters and announced that he was abandoning the presidential bid he had launched just three months earlier. “I’m angry with myself for having been put in this position – for having put myself in this position of having to make this choice,” he said. “And I am no less frustrated at the environment of presidential politics that makes it so difficult to let the American people measure the whole Joe Biden and not just misstatements that I have made.” It was an ignominious end to Biden’s first attempt at the White House, after his campaign ran aground amid charges of plagiarism and dishonesty. It was a particularly bitter pill to swallow for a man who liked to offer his “word as a Biden” as an iron-clad guarantee of honesty and trustworthiness. The first blow came in a debate in Iowa where Biden, in his closing statement, recited – nearly word for word – a passage from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock’s speech about his working-class upbringing. Although he frequently quoted those lines with attribution, this time Biden didn’t – and an operative from a rival Democratic campaign took note. A plagiarism charge against Biden for a law school paper also resurfaced. He explained that it was the result of an improper citation, but combined with the Kinnock mistake and further allegations of unattributed speech quotes, it cemented for many the perception that there was no substance beneath Biden’s style. “Here I was, getting out of the race with my integrity being questioned,” Biden would later tell his biographer, Jules Witcover.  “It really ate me up. It was the core of who I thought I was, who I know I am, actually.” During his first 14 years in Washington, Biden rebuilt his personal life after the deaths of his wife and daughter. He committed to giving his two living children some semblance of a normal life, and commuted each day from their home in Delaware to Washington. He eventually remarried, to a schoolteacher named Jill Jacobs, with whom he had a child, Ashley. He established himself on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and began to build a national presence. After entertaining a run in 1984, he took the plunge four years later, with a campaign that played heavily on Kennedy-esque themes of generation change. “We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference,” he said at his campaign kick-off. “The clarion call for my generation is not, ‘It’s our turn,’ but rather, ‘It’s our moment of obligation and opportunity’.” The plagiarism row ensured this wouldn’t be Biden’s moment. At the same time he was attempting to keep his presidential campaign afloat, Biden was also chairing Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for a conservative Supreme Court nominee, Robert Bork – a high-profile battle over the ideological direction of the nation’s highest court. It was after a morning session of these hearings in Washington that Biden announced the end to his campaign. The decision turned out to be somewhat of a blessing, however, as a few months later – the night of the Iowa caucuses – he collapsed in a hotel room in Rochester, New York, the result of an intracranial aneurism. For the next six months, he was in and out of hospital. For a time, doctors feared he would have lasting brain damage. It would be 20 years before Biden ran for president again – this time as an elder statesman, not a fresh face. He promised to run the 2008 race on his own terms, after concluding that his 1987 campaign was too heavy on rhetorical flourishes and image-consultants. It was almost as if he was trying to right the wrongs of 20 years earlier. “Any of you who take a look at my life will not be able to conclude that I am not an honourable man,” he said at an Iowa campaign rally in June. “And that’s why I wasn’t afraid to get back into this thing.” The end result – defeat – was the same, however. And right out of the gate, it was Biden’s tongue that betrayed him. The day before he formally announced his candidacy, Biden told a New York Observer reporter that one of his opponents, Barack Obama, was “the first mainstream African American, who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy”. Biden was quickly forced to explain that he did not mean to disparage previous black presidential candidates or belittle Obama personally. It was cited as yet another of Biden’s propensity for gaffes – off-the-cuff remarks that would embarrass or distract from his intended message – which would bedevil his national efforts throughout his career. Although Biden eventually steadied his campaign, he never broke into the top tier. The Democratic race boiled down to a two-way battle between Obama and Hillary Clinton. A riveted US public watched on 11 October, 1991, as Anita Hill, then a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, testified before Joe Biden’s Senate Judiciary Committee that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her on multiple occasions when they both worked for the Reagan administration. Hill accused Thomas of repeatedly making “ugly”, “disgusting”, “dirty” comments to her, creating an intolerable workplace. Thomas, in his testimony, accused his critics of engaging in a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” - alluding to a term that has historicalracist connotations. “Unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you,” he said. “You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the US Senate rather than hung from a tree.” Biden chairs the Clarence Thomas hearings, 1991 Biden, as chair, presided over this spectacle – trying to provide what he described as a fair hearing for both sides. The committee had already voted once on Thomas’s nomination, during which Biden objected to Thomas on ideological grounds. This, however, was different. As the committee reopened its inquiry, the issue was Thomas’ moral character – and two distinct and conflicting accounts of what had taken place a decade earlier. Biden was conscious that he and his fellow senators – all men, all white - were open to charges of racism against only the second black nominee to the Supreme Court, and charges of sexism if they didn’t give Hill’s allegations a full airing. “The Democrats were deathly afraid of seeming to gang up on a black Supreme Court nominee, there's no doubt about that,” says journalist Jill Abramson, who covered the hearings for the Wall Street Journal and co-wrote a book, Strange Justice, on the topic. Instead of being fair, Abramson says, Biden and the Democrats allowed themselves to be “woefully outmanoeuvred” by the committee’s Republican minority, leaving many liberal supporters feeling betrayed. “As the Democrats are wont to do, they wanted to be seen as playing fair,” she says. “But it wasn't playing fair, it was two days of hearings where Anita Hill was trashed by the Republicans who portrayed her as a fantaciser or an erotomaniac.” If Biden was trying to find balance on issues of race and sex during the hearings, it’s a challenge he’s faced throughout his career, with varying levels of success. When Biden first ran for the Senate, he presented himself as an advocate of the civil rights movement. He recalled how, as a teenage volunteer at a swimming centre in a predominantly black neighbourhood of Wilmington, he learned about the unfair treatment ethnic minority groups frequently received in the US. “Every day, it seemed to me, black people got subtle and not-so-subtle reminders that they didn’t quite belong in America,” Biden wrote in his memoir. One of Biden’s first high-profile political battles upon entering the Senate, however, was fought alongside pro-segregation southerners in opposition of the court-ordered practice of transporting students to schools in different neighbourhoods in an effort to address racial segregation. It was a subject that would open Biden to attacks during his run for the 2020 Democratic nomination. “Biden at one time called the issue of bussing a ‘domestic Vietnam’,” says Jason Sokol, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire. “He meant that it was an issue that was tearing the country apart culturally. That's why he shied away from taking a strong stance against integration at that point. He saw that this politically was not a smart thing to do.” While Biden fought conservative judicial and executive appointees he thought were insufficiently dedicated to civil rights, he viewed the role of government as preventing discrimination in the current era, not offering remedies for past wrongs. “I do not buy the concept, popular in the ‘60s which said: ‘We have suppressed the black man for 300 years, and the white man is now far ahead in the ‘race’ for everything our society offers,” he told a newspaper interviewer in 1975. “In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a ‘head start’ or even hold the white man back to even the ‘race’. I don’t buy that."" Biden’s record on crime and law-enforcement issues also opened him up to accusations that he supported policies - designed to address a spike in violent crime and drug offences in the 1980s and early 1990s - that disproportionately affected ethnic minority groups. Sokol says Biden has spent his career inhabiting a “very conflicted, messy middle ground” on racial issues, where he weighed in angering some of his white constituents against ”honouring claims for racial justice”. In 1988, Biden enthusiastically backed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which established tougher mandatory sentences for narcotics like crack cocaine that were more frequently used by ethnic minority groups. He was the architect of a 1994 anti-crime bill that expanded mandatory minimum sentences and greatly increased federal funding for police departments and prisons – a push that since has been seen as a contributing factor in the US having one of the world’s largest incarcerated populations. According to Bob Kerrey, who was one of the 95 senators who voted for the crime bill, being labelled “soft on crime” was politically dangerous in the 1990s. Joe Biden speaks about crime and ""predators on our streets"", 1993 “I didn't know how controversial the crime bill would become,” he says. “The problem with that crime bill is it worked - crime went down. The larger problem is we tolerated racist attitudes of police forces way too long.” Attached to that 1994 crime bill was one of Biden’s most cherished legislative accomplishments - the Violence Against Women Act. The topic of domestic abuse - and how to address it on a federal level – was always among Biden’s top of priorities. “We ripped the Band-Aid off a shameful secret and exposed the ugly truth of domestic violence to the public eye,”Biden told the Huffington Post in 2019. While Biden has offered his legislative efforts as evidence of his support for women’s issues, it has been his personal conduct that has drawn the sharpest attacks. In the days before the formal launch of his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden was accused by a number of women of unwanted physical contact. “I had never experienced anything so blatantly inappropriate and unnerving before,” wrote Lucy Flores, a Nevada Democratic politician, of an encounter she had with Biden in 2014. “The vice-president of the United States of America had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends, family or romantic partners -and I felt powerless to do anything about it.” While not admitting to any specific misconduct, Biden released a video in which he said he would be “more mindful and respectful” of future conduct that might make women uncomfortable. Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 In March, one of the women who accused Biden of misconduct, Tara Reade, expanded her allegation to sexual assault, saying the then-senator had attacked her in an empty hallway when she worked in his office in 1993. Acquaintances of Reade said she told them about the alleged incident at the time. Two months later, Biden directly addressed the accusation, referencing his support for the Violence Against Women Act. “I recognise my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished,” he said. “So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago. They aren't true.” Reade called on Biden to quit the race.Subsequent investigations by journalists, including aNew York Times report, found inconsistencies in Reade’s accounts. The episode, however, raised uncomfortable issues for Democrats, especially women in the party who had backed the rallying cry of the #MeToo movement, Believe Women. It also drew parallels to the doubts and aspersions directed at Anita Hill decades earlier In recent years – and in light of the Me Too movement that has increased awareness of sexual harassment and assault - Biden has expressed regret over his handling of the Hill episode. “To this day, I regret that I could not come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us,” Biden said during a speech in March 2019. He later directly expressed this to Hill in a phone call. But for her, it was not enough. “He needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw,” she told the New York Times. “There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.” It was deja vu for Joe Biden. On 11 October, 2002, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations committee was once again deciding whether to authorise a Republican president to go to war with Iraq. Eleven years earlier, on the eve of the Gulf War, Biden had voted against giving President George HW Bush the approval to use force against Saddam Hussein’s military. “Before we ask Americans to die for the liberation of Kuwait, I would like to be sure we have tried every possible alternative,” he said during a Foreign Relations committee hearing. “So far, this has not been the case.” Despite Biden’s warning that there could be tens of thousands of US casualties, the resolution passed 52-47 - and the Gulf War ended quickly, with only a handful of American deaths. US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 Biden, along with other Democrats who opposed the war, were frequently branded as “doves” who were soft on national defence. Robert Gates, defence secretary under George W Bush, typified these kind of attacks when he wrote in his 2014 memoir that Biden was “wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"". He listed Biden’s support for withdrawal from South Vietnam, opposition to Ronald Reagan’s defence build-up and that fateful vote against the Gulf War resolution, among others. In the years after that vote, Biden staked out more hawkish positions on international affairs, including backing US involvement in the Balkan civil wars, bombing in Iraq and the invasion of Afghanistan. When President George W Bush began moving toward a new war with Iraq, alleging it possessed weapons of mass destruction, Biden was a vocal supporter. “I do not believe this is a rush to war,” he said. “I believe it’s a march to peace and security.” Biden was among the 77 senators to vote for that Iraq War resolution – joining numerous other Democrats with presidential ambitions, including John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Biden speaks at the Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing on Iraq, 2002 “It was kind of a simple calculation,” says Mark Weisbrot, who directed a documentary on Biden’s Iraq War support. “They knew there was a risk that if you were against the war and the war turned out to be a ‘success’ you could lose some swing votes. But if you voted for the war, and it turned out to be a disaster, which it did, you really didn't lose much because your base didn't have anywhere to go.” As the war dragged on, however, Biden’s war vote did become a political liability – this time with Democratic voters who increasingly saw the US occupation as a quagmire. Biden, after initially defending his vote, began to back away. He deals with this episode in a chapter on the Iraq War - titled “My Mistake” - in his 2007 memoir. Writing about those in the Bush administration who pushed for war, he wrote: “I vastly underestimated their disingenuousness and incompetence”. If Biden in the years after his Gulf War vote tried to compensate for his perceived error by moving to the right, he moved left after the Iraq War. He opposed a surge of US forces in Iraq, calling for US withdrawal and partitioning of the nation. As vice-president, he counselled against an increase in US forces in Afghanistan and advised against the Osama bin Laden raid. Shortly after announcing his 2020 presidential bid, Biden advocated ending US support for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen civil war. During the Obama presidency, Biden had an active role in carrying out the administration’s foreign policy objectives. Senator Casey recalls meeting the vice-president during a visit to Iraq, where they discussed his efforts to work with the leaders of the various governing factions. “I could tell by listening to his recitations from the interactions that he had learned a lot about these people as personalities,” Casey says. “It was a really valuable lesson in diplomacy. It wasn't just learning the substance of a white paper about a particular country or a particular foreign policy issue, but you literally have to get to know the individuals.” Biden’s other responsibilities included pressuring Congress to back nuclear negotiations with Iran, building international support for the Paris climate accords, representing US interests in China and encouraging democratic reforms in Ukraine. These last two areas – China and Ukraine – have become a focus for attacks from Donald Trump and Republicans, who have criticised Biden for being too close to China, and attempted to make a case that Biden’s Ukraine activities were to protect his son, Hunter, who had business ties to the nation. Last year, Hunter insisted he had done ""nothing wrong"" but admitted to ""poor judgment"",leaving him open to political attacks. Biden’s Iraq War vote again came up in the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, but nearly two decades later it lacked the political punch it once had. At the end of Biden’s 2008 presidential run, it seemed the senator would return to Washington and finish his career in Congress or, perhaps, as an official in a future Democratic administration. On 23 August, however, Barack Obama selected him as his vice-presidential running mate. The choice surprised many. Biden’s home state, Delaware, was not an electoral battleground. With more than three decades in Washington, he wasn’t the kind of outsider who fitted with Obama’s message of change. “There was this sense that they were very, very different,” says Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and author of a book on the vice-presidency. “Obama was very thoughtful and careful choosing his words, and Biden was always sticking his foot in his mouth. The one thing Biden told Obama when he agreed to do the job was that he wasn't going to change his brand. He said, ‘I am what I am’.” According to former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who ran for president in 2008 and was also on Obama’s vice-presidential short list, Obama and Biden developed a rapport on the Democratic primary campaign trail. “I knew in the debates they had a personal chemistry,” Richardson says. “Obama needed a senior foreign policy person on the ticket, but also I could tell they liked each other a lot.” A few hours after announcing his pick, Obama took the stage in Springfield, Illinois to introduce Biden to the gathered crowd. Biden is announced as Obama's running mate, 2008 “Joe Biden is that rare mix – for decades he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn’t changed him,” he said. “He is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track.” Obama would tick through the pivotal moments of Biden’s life – his stutter, the death of his wife and child, his brain aneurysm, the 1994 crime bill and his involvement in negotiating an end to the Balkan civil war – all in support of his choice. In the early days of the Obama presidency Biden frequently chafed at the White House’s directions. For more than 30 years, Biden – as a senator – ran his own political fiefdom. Now he was required to do someone else’s bidding. “It was galling for him at first,” says Bower. “It was this kind of a push-and-pull relationship.” There were moments when Biden broke from administration policy, most notably when he announced his support for gay marriage in 2012, frustrating a White House intent on message control. At other times Obama tasked Biden with important duties – shepherding the 2009 stimulus bill through Congress and overseeing the drawdown of US troops in Iraq. By the time Biden finished his eight years in the vice-presidency, he and Obama had formed a strong friendship. Bower recounts an interview she had with Biden during which Biden became visibly emotional when talking about Obama speaking at Beau’s funeral. “They were kind of, as hokey as it sounds, like a family during those eight years,” says Bower. “It was kind of a father-son relationship, too, because of their age difference.” In a surprise ceremony in the final days of his presidency, Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the nation’s highest civilian honour. After joking about their “bromance”, Obama turned serious. “To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretence, services without self-regard and to live life fully,” he said. The speech had the tenor of a benediction, marking the end of a long career in public service. A year and a half earlier, Obama pressured Biden not to challenge Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination. “The president was convinced I could not beat Hillary,” Biden wrote in his 2017 memoir, “and he worried that a long primary fight would split the party and leave the Democratic nominee vulnerable in the general election.” The Democrats had a long and acrimonious primary fight anyway – between Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And a vulnerable Clinton lost the general election. Four years later, Biden dispatched Sanders more easily than Clinton had and the former vice-president finally secured the Democratic nomination. His success was due, in no small part, to his service as a dutiful deputy to Obama, which won him overwhelming support among black Democrats. “Let me explain something to you about Joe Biden,” writes Laurie Goff in a Facebook post that captured this sentiment. “This old rich white man played second fiddle to a black man. Not just any black man but a younger black man, a smart black man. Not just for a day. Not one, not two but eight years.” “This is what showing up and being an ally looks like,” she concludes. “When black people say they know Joe,this is how we know.” In what could be seen as an acknowledgement of this support, Biden selected a former presidential rival, Kamala Harris, to be his vice-presidential running mate, giving a black woman the kind of stepping stone to the presidency that Obama had provided him eight years earlier. Once again the Democrats had a multi-generational, multi-ethnic presidential ticket. As Obama’s “wingman”, Biden was able to get a foothold in the White House. His third try for the top office, after more than 40 years of political ambition buffeted by public and personal adversity, was his last shot at the prize.

'Trump cannot meet this moment' - Michelle Obama,"This video can not be played Michelle Obama campaigned against Donald Trump in the 2020 election Michelle Obama has launched a stinging attack on US President Donald Trump as Democrats prepared to crown Joe Biden as their White House challenger. ""Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country,"" said the former US first lady in an emotional recorded message to the Democratic convention. Disaffected members of Mr Trump's Republican party also piled in on him at the Democratic party conference. The election takes place on Tuesday 3 November. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, Democrats scrapped plans for a crowded party extravaganza with balloon drops and all the other political razzmatazz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But it is unclear whether the largely virtual schedule of pre-recorded speeches with no live audience can generate the same level of enthusiasm as pre-pandemic gatherings of the party faithful. Republicans will face the same challenge as they make their case for four more years in the White House at a drastically scaled-down convention next week. A really simple guide to the US election What to watch for at the US Democratic convention How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mrs Obama, who recorded her keynote address before Mr Biden announced his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, six days ago, launched a blistering attack on Mr Trump. ""You simply cannot fake your way through this job,"" she said in remarks that closed the first night of the convention on Monday. The headline speaker added: ""Our economy is in shambles because of a virus that this president downplayed for too long."" ""Stating the simple fact that a black life matters is still met with derision from the nation's highest office,"" Mrs Obama continued. ""Because whenever we look to this White House for some leadership, or consolation or any semblance of steadiness, what we get instead is chaos, division and a total and utter lack of empathy."" She said the last four years had been difficult to explain to America's children. ""They see our leaders labelling fellow citizens enemies of the state, while emboldening torch-bearing white supremacists. This video can not be played Democratic National Convention day one: Biden's grandchildren and famous faces ""They watch in horror as children are torn from their families and thrown into cages, and pepper spray and rubber bullets are used on peaceful protests for a photo op."" Mrs Obama continued: ""Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. ""He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is."" She described Mr Biden as a ""profoundly decent man"", touting the Democratic White House candidate's experience as vice-president under her husband, President Barack Obama. ""We have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it,"" she said, wearing a necklace that said ""Vote"". A lot of politicians spoke at the camera during the ""virtual"" Democratic convention on Monday night. The only speaker who landed an emotional punch, however, was Michelle Obama. The truth, she said, was that Donald Trump ""simply cannot be who we need him to be for us"". ""It is what it is,"" she said, employing the same words the president recently used about the coronavirus death toll - a jab that was as subtle as it was devastating. She wasn't trying to convince Republicans to switch sides. That was the job of John Kasich, the Republican ex-governor of Ohio. She wasn't trying to get left-wing progressives to rally to Biden. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders handled that. Mrs Obama was speaking to loyal Democrats, some of whom may have stayed at home or voted for a third party in 2016, some of whom may be dispirited or scared this year. Her goal was to drive home the gravity of the moment and to give them a call to action. The opening night of the convention, a two-hour programme hosted by former Desperate Housewives actress Eva Longoria Baston, was titled by party organisers ""We the People"". John Kasich, who ran against Mr Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, recorded a message calling on Americans to deny the president a second term in office. This video can not be played What happens at the US conventions? Mr Kasich endorsed Mr Biden, saying: ""We can all see what's going on in our country today and all the questions that are facing us, and no one person or party has all the answers. ""But what we do know is that we can do better than what we've been seeing today, for sure."" What does Kamala Harris believe? Where Joe Biden stands on the key issues Bernie Sanders, the left-wing Vermont senator who was Mr Biden's fiercest competitor during the Democratic party's contest to pick a challenger to Mr Trump, also recorded a message. He said: ""My friends, I say to you, and to everyone who supported other candidates in this primary and to those who may have voted for Donald Trump in the last election: The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake."" He added: ""Nero fiddled while Rome burned - Trump golfs."" This video can not be played What do young Democrats think of Joe Biden? Along with Mr Kasich, three other high-profile Republicans recorded messages for the convention's opening night: California businesswoman Meg Whitman, former New Jersey Governor Christine Whitman and former New York congresswoman Susan Molinari. While their inclusion left the Biden team claiming a broad coalition, some Democrats grumbled that the Republicans used up precious time that could have benefited progressive speakers or lesser-known rising stars. But Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and Biden campaign co-chairman, rejected that idea, saying, ""remember tonight's theme is 'We the People,' not 'We the Democrats'"". The opening night also featured pre-recorded messages from everyday Americans, including repentant Trump voters and a woman who blamed her father's death from Covid-19 on the president. On Tuesday morning, Mr Trump responded to Mrs Obama's criticism in a series of tweets. ""[I] would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren't for the job done by your husband,"" he wrote. This video can not be played What does this hat mean to Americans? And on Monday, Mr Trump spoke to the BBC on Air Force One and lashed out at Mr Kasich. ""He was a loser as a Republican, and he'll be a loser as a Democrat,"" the president said. During a campaign speech earlier that day in Mankato, Minnesota, Mr Trump warned that if Mr Biden won in November, news outlets would lose their audiences. ""Nobody's going to want to cover sleepy Joe,"" Mr Trump said. ""We will end up with one very boring socialist country that will go to hell."" Mr Trump also confirmed he would accept the Republican nomination for a second term during a live speech at the White House next week. Democrats and some fellow Republicans have criticised the plan for using the White House as a campaign venue. The four-night jamboree will culminate in Mr Biden's speech on Thursday in a mostly empty ballroom in his home state of Delaware. On Wednesday, his vice-presidential pick, Ms Harris, the daughter of immigrant parents from India and Jamaica, will accept her nomination as the first woman of colour to be a running mate on a major party presidential ticket. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Also speaking on Wednesday are former President Obama, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, and one of Mr Biden's former rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren. Tuesday will hear speeches from former President Bill Clinton and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Lego falls out of boy's nose after two years,"A toy hand from a Lego set has come out of a boy's nose two years after it got stuck up there. Samir Anwar, from Dunedin on New Zealand's South Island was playing with the Lego piece in 2018 when he put it up his nostril. His dad Mudassir shone a torch up Samir's nose at the time but couldn't see it. The GP told the family it would quickly find its way out naturally through his body, but it didn't. ""Since then we were pretty confident that he didn't have anything in his nose,"" Mudassir tells Newsbeat. However Samir wasn't so certain that the hand from his Lego set had made its way out the other side. His dad says he was complaining in the days after: ""He was saying 'no, there is something in my nose'."" But two years on the family had assumed it had passed through his system. Then this week Samir was out with his family having a muffin with some fairy dust on the top that agitated his nose. According to his father: ""He started getting anxious again and we said to him just go and blow your nose. So he did."" That's when he says the black Lego hand came out into the tissue, leaving them all really surprised. ""We were shocked, his eyes were wide open and he was like, I found the Lego, I kept telling you that it was there, but you were saying that it was not."" Read other health stories from our team of reporters likeGreg Rutherford's story Today Samir has been to the doctor once more and has been told for the second and hopefully final time, that he has the all-clear. ""I was surprised and a bit scared,"" Samir tells Newsbeat, adding he is still a massive Lego fan and that he's impressed that the piece had stayed intact. ""It [still] looked like a hand,"" he says.

Black Met inspector 'racially harassed' by PCs,"Insp Charles Ehikioya has served with the Met for more than two decades A black police inspector is suing the Met Police for racial harassment after being stopped in his car by two white officers. Insp Charles Ehikioya recorded the incident in which he said officers stopped him without justification as he drove home from work in south London. He told the BBC it showed an ""abuse of power"" and he was speaking out in solidarity with the black community. The Met said it found no evidence of misconduct. The 55-year-old had been driving home after his shift on 23 May when he was followed for two miles by officers and stopped in Croydon, according to his complaint. As one officer approached, Insp Ehikioya said he noticed he had not switched on his body-worn camera and for that reason he refused to leave his car. He said he then started to record the incident for protection, at which point the officer turned on his bodycam. In the recording, shared with BBC News, the officer said Insp Ehikioya was being stopped for driving at speed and it ""looked like he had gone through a red light"". Insp Charles Ehikioya said he was driving home from work in his red Toyota iQ when he was stopped The officer said he needed to see Insp Ehikioya's driving licence and proof he was insured to drive the car, that the vehicle had not been stolen, and to check he was not drunk or had been using his phone. He claimed Insp Ehikioya's driving was ""unusual"", which he strongly disputed, according to the recording. Insp Ehikioya was then accused of being obstructive and the officer said his own behaviour had been perfectly reasonable, it can be heard. ""These were alleged offences that could have ended my whole career,"" said Mr Ehikioya, who has worked for the Met Police for more than 22 years. In his formal complaint, Insp Ehikioya wrote: ""The officers did not believe or did not care that I was an officer, because I am black. ""They are both clearly racist police officers pretending to be polite whilst falsely accusing me without any evidence whatsoever of having committed serious criminal and road traffic act offences."" After Insp Ehikioya informed them he was a serving police officer and later showed them his police ID, both officers left the scene. The Met said Insp Ehikioya was not arrested, charged or cautioned for any offence in relation to the stop. ""I believed I was racially profiled and received no apology,"" Insp Ehikioya added. ""I have kids and a grandson, I would not want them treated like this."" Asked why he had chosen to take legal action against the Met, Insp Ehikioya said he was ""not prepared to sit quietly and be silenced"". ""In my view it's not the whole organisation that's like that, it's only a few individuals that are causing this issue. ""I have no choice but to react in the way I'm reacting to bring it to the attention... Actions speak louder than words,"" he said. The Met has come under increasing scrutiny since the wave of Black Lives Matter protests in the UK after the death of African-American George Floyd. Last week, theLabour MP Dawn Butler called for a ""system change""after she and a black male friend were stopped and pulled over in east London by two police cars. In July, theBritish sprinter Bianca Williams received an apology from the Met Policeafter she and her partner were pulled over in their car for a stop-and-search in west London. This video can not be played Footage of the stop of Bianca Williams was shared widely on Twitter Lawrence Davies, of Equal Justice Solicitors who is representing Insp Ehikioya, said the incident showed the ""extent of the current racism in the Metropolitan Police"". ""The conduct of a few embarrasses the vast majority of officers who are not racist but who, as a consequence of that conduct, have to work with very distrusting BAME communities,"" he said. The Met confirmed it had received an internal complaint from a driver who alleged they were stopped as a result of racial profiling and said an investigation was undertaken by the Professional Standards Unit. In a statement, the Met said the vehicle was followed by officers through suspicion of excessive speed at a traffic signal and onward. No action was taken against the man stopped and, after reviewing body-worn footage, no evidence of misconduct was found, it said. The statement added: ""Any allegation, whether external or internal, made concerning the conduct of our staff is taken extremely seriously. ""Where the conduct of staff is proven to have fallen below the standards of behaviour expected, we will take robust action to ensure that staff are appropriately disciplined and that lessons are learnt from each case.""

Investigating Salmond complaints 'right thing to do',"Ms Evans was the first person to give evidence to the inquiry The Scottish government's harassment complaints system was not drawn up to ""get Alex Salmond"", the country's top civil servant has told an inquiry. Leslie Evans apologised for the government's handling of allegations against the former first minister. But she insisted that investigating them was ""the right thing to do"". MSPs are investigating the failure of the government's complaints handling process, which saw Mr Salmondawarded a Â£500,000 expenses payout in court. Ms Evans - who is the permanent secretary to the Scottish government - told the Scottish Parliament inquiry she wanted to ""apologise unreservedly to all concerned for this procedural failure"". Mr Salmond has previously called for the civil servant to quit, but she has been backed by the current first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. How will Holyrood's Alex Salmond inquiry work? Who is Leslie Evans? The government launched an internal investigation into harassment complaints against Mr Salmond from two female members of staff in January 2018. The allegations dated back to when he was serving as first minister. Alex Salmond walked free from court in March having been cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault and attempted rape However, Mr Salmond raised a legal challenge which led to the government admitting thatthe investigation had been unlawful. Judge Lord Pentland said it had been ""procedurally unfair"" and ""tainted with apparent bias"" because the investigating officer assigned to the case had had prior contact with the complainers. Mr Salmond was subsequently cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault at the High Court in Edinburgh in March. Ms Evans accepted that ""one part of our procedure should have been applied differently"" during the government's investigation of the first two complaints that were made against Mr Salmond. She said she would ""apologise unreservedly to all concerned for this procedural failure"". But she told the committee that ""when complaints were raised, it would have been unconscionable, and a failure in our duty of care, not to investigate those complaints"". Ms Evans has been strongly backed by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon She went on to say that lessons had been learned from the failure, but insisted that the Scottish government ""is and remains ahead of many other institutions in designing and implementing a procedure to address harassment and particularly to address historical allegations of sexual misconduct"". Ms Evans told the committee: ""The Scottish government has been on a journey of cultural change since 2015 to ensure the organisation is more open, capable and responsive. ""As permanent secretary, I have led a focus on equality, inclusion and wellbeing, including addressing bullying and harassment."" Mr Salmond's defence during his criminal trial claimed that he had been thevictim of a political conspiracy- something Ms Sturgeon has dismissed as ""a heap of nonsense"". Ms Evans was asked directly if the complaints handling procedure - signed off by Ms Sturgeon in December 2017 - had been ""engineered"" specifically to target Mr Salmond. The permanent secretary replied: ""Absolutely not"". She confirmed that one staff member who had raised a concern about Mr Salmond's behaviour had been shown a draft of the policy, but said it was ""not unusual"" for someone with ""lived experience"" to be consulted. ""I don't believe there were any changes made as a result of that,"" she added. Ms Evans was also asked about claims from civil service unions about ""bullying behaviour"" within the government in the past, replying that ""we have got a more inclusive culture than we did have"". Committee convener Linda Fabiani has clashed with Ms Evans over the disclosure of documents The Holyrood inquiry has pledged not to re-investigate any of the complaints against Mr Salmond, and will instead focus on the development of the internal government policy and the ""culture of government"". The committee, led by Deputy Presiding Officer Linda Fabiani, is examining the development of the government's harassment complaints procedure, the application of that procedure to the case of Mr Salmond, and the judicial review case. Ms Fabiani, an SNP MSP, has repeatedly clashed with the permanent secretary over documentation and written evidence being supplied by the government ahead of the hearing. She has spoken of her ""frustration and disappointment,externalat the very limited amount of information the Scottish government has chosen to disclose"" about the judicial review. Alex Salmond trial: What is the political fallout? Ms Sturgeon has insisted that the complaints handling procedure she ordered to be drawn up in the wake of the Me Too movement remained ""completely robust"" despite the ""deeply regrettable"" failure in the case of her predecessor. She has ordered an internal review of ""the specific application of this one element of the procedure"", and has also triggered an independent review to decidewhether she broke the ministerial codein her dealings with Mr Salmond.

Dessert factory coronavirus cases rise to 72,"Nottinghamshire County Council said 1,130 staff members at Bakkavor in Newark have been tested Coronavirus cases at a dessert factory testing its entire workforce have risen to more than 70. Some 1,600 staff at Bakkavor in Newark, Nottinghamshire, are undergoing testing. So far 1,130 have been checked, with 74 confirmed cases, Nottinghamshire County Council said, while 33 people have been able to return to work. The company, which makes desserts for Waitrose and Tesco, said it ""understood the importance of the testing"". Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Bakkavor said it had communicated to staff the dangers of car sharing and the need for social distancing Richard Wiles, from Collingham, who works next to the site, told the BBC the outbreak did not come as a surprise. ""The workers have been upset for quite a while that they don't think enough has been done to protect them,"" he said. ""People here are somewhere between baffled and very angry because when there have been outbreaks at food plants elsewhere, they have been closed instantly. ""It seems there has been a slow, modern British response to this and cakes have come before Covid safety."" The council hadpreviously saidthe entire workforce would be tested after the number of positive cases increased from 20 to 39. Staff from other areas of the business have been seconded to help upload the details into the NHS portal. Throughout most of July new cases of coronavirus in Newark and Sherwood were low, but they have risen in recent weeks. The district was added to the government's hotspotwatch list,externallast week and a testing site for members of the public was set up at the district council building after a spike in cases. In the week to Thursday 13 August there were 39 cases, equivalent to nearly 32 per 100,000 population. Across England overall in the same week the rate was just under 12 per 100,000. Ten cases were people living in the Newark North area, which is also where the Bakkavor dessert factory is located, with a further 10 in Balderton. However, some of the 74 cases so far confirmed at Bakkavor may not yet be reflected in the official data, which is updated daily as more test results come back. Newark and Sherwood's weekly infection rate per 100,000 people has risen from 26.1 up to 6 August to 31.9 up to 13 August. Jonathan Gribbin, director of public health at Nottinghamshire County Council, said closing the factory with 1,600 staff depending on it for their livelihoods, was not something they wanted to do. ""Reports from the Health and Safety Executive and environmental health colleagues indicates there are a really good set of controls in place within the factory,"" he said. ""So [closing it] would be quite a radical thing to do, not something we would want to bring forward at this point and certainly not before we have followed through on every other possible avenue, including finishing off on this whole workplace testing."" He added: ""We know that not all the cases in Newark are linked to Bakkavor so it is vital that people continue to follow the strict guidance to prevent the transmission of Covid-19 across the whole community."" Shona Taylor, from Bakkavor, said: ""The [testing] programme has been positively received, and colleagues have been supportive and reassured that every effort is being taken to ensure their safety."" At the Bakkavor bakery in Devizes, last week it was confirmed thenumber of positive tests had risen to 15from seven the week before. Wiltshire Council has confirmed the number of cases there has not changed. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work?

Health Secretary axes public health bodyMatt Hancock says creating a new public health agency will make the country safer.,"The health secretary said there was huge global demand for protective equipment Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed Public Health England will be replaced by a new body focused on preparing for external threats like pandemics. Baroness Dido Harding, who runs NHS Test and Trace in England, will be the interim chief of the new National Institute for Health Protection (NIHP). PHE has come under intense scrutiny of its coronavirus response. Ministers have been accused of using PHE as a scapegoat for failings. Government has been criticised for the controversial decision in March to halt community testing and tracing of contacts. The new institute will begin work with immediate effect and will bring together Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace, as well as the analytical capability of the Joint Biosecurity Centre under a single leadership team, to ""strengthen"" public health. Matt Hancock said it would have a ""single and relentless mission"" of protecting people from external health threats including pandemics, biological weapons and infections diseases ""To give ourselves the best chance of beating this virus once and for all - and of spotting and being ready to respond to other health threats, now and in the future, we are creating a brand new organisation to provide a new approach to public health protection and resilience. ""My single biggest fear is a novel flu, or another major health alert, hitting us right now in the middle of this battle against coronavirus. ""Even once this crisis has passed - and it will pass - we need a disease control infrastructure that gives us the permanent, standing capacity to respond as a nation and the ability to scale up at pace."" Public Health England 'to be replaced' Contact tracers in England cut by 6,000 Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number The new health protection agency for England will, we are told, be modelled on Germany's Robert Koch Institute which combats infectious diseases. Expertise from Public Health England and the Test and Trace network will be pooled to form an organisation focussed on tackling the coronavirus threat and future pandemics.  And therein lies the historic problem. PHE was formed as part of Government health reforms in 2012 with an ungainly merger of health protection and prevention initiatives such as obesity strategies. It was pulled in different directions and had to get by with successive annual budget cuts. PHE has been blamed for the suspension of community testing and tracing in March but senior sources say it was not set up to run a mass diagnostic testing system and any decisions made then were in partnership with Government advisers. The centrepiece of the reforms is the creation of the new agency but there are still big questions over what will happen to PHE's vital work on prevention of ill health and tackling health inequalities. The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) questioned the timing of an announcement on the scrapping of a national public health agency in the midst of a global pandemic. RSPH chief executive Christina Marriott said: ""We recognise that there have been some serious challenges in terms of our response to Covid-19, including the timing of the lockdown, the ongoing ineffectiveness of Tier 2 Track and Trace and postcode-level data previously not being available to directors of public health."" But she said ""multiple lessons"" needed to be learned ""before solutions can be in place in advance of the winter"", adding: ""to do otherwise risks avoidable mistakes in subsequent waves of the pandemic which will only harm the public's health further."" Prof Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology at Imperial College London, defended PHE as an ""assembly of some of the wisest and most committed microbiologists and epidemiologists you could hope for anywhere"". He criticised what he called the ""persistent meddling from on-high"", which he said had ""disenfranchised and fractured"" staff ""to the great detriment of the UK as a whole"". Prof Tedder warned the plans to merge existing laboratory staff with NHS Test and Trace were ""misplaced"" and would ""further dismantle"" the ""irreplaceable"" expertise that exists within PHE. Liberal Democrat Health spokesperson Munira Wilson told the BBC News Channel it was ""quite clear"" that ministers were trying to deflect responsibility from some of the ""terrible decisions"" taken, ""from the provision of protective equipment, test and trace and the tracing app being botched and a whole series of other blunders through this crisis"" then trying to scapegoat PHE as a result. She said they should be going forward with an independent inquiry so lessons learned could be used in any second wave of the pandemic. Labour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said in a tweetthat there had been ""no transparency or accountability"" in Baroness Harding's appointment,external.

"M&S to cut 7,000 jobs over next three monthsThe High Street retailer says the coronavirus pandemic has meant a ""material shift in trade"".Business","Marks & Spencer is cutting 7,000 jobs over the next three months across its stores and management. It said the coronavirus pandemic had made it clear there had been a ""material shift in trade"". In-store sales of clothing and home goods were ""well below"" 2019, although online and home deliveries were strong. M&S said it hoped a ""significant proportion"" of the cuts - about a tenth of its workforce - will be voluntary redundancy and early retirement. In a statement,external, M&S said it was ""too early to predict with precision where a new post-Covid sales mix will settle. We must now act to reflect this change"". But the retailer said operating during the pandemic had showed it could work ""more flexibly and productively"", with more staff multi-tasking and moving between food, clothing and home departments. M&S said total sales in its hard-hit clothing and home arm plunged 29.9% in the eight weeks since shops reopened, with store sales tumbling 47.9% and online surging 39.2%. At the height of lockdown, M&S boss Steve Rowe said customers might ""never shop the same way again"" after the coronavirus crisis. And last month the retailer announced 950 store management and head office jobs were at risk because it needed to accelerate its restructuring. Shopping may never be the same again, says M&S M&S extends 30-minute home delivery service John Lewis and Boots to cut 5,300 jobs WH Smith may cut 1,500 jobs after sales plummet Alongside Tuesday's announcement of more job cuts Mr Rowe said: ""In May we outlined our plans to learn from the crisis, accelerate our transformation and deliver a stronger, more agile business in a world in which some customer habits were changed forever. ""Three months on and our 'Never the Same Again' programme is progressing; albeit the outlook is uncertain and we remain cautious. He said the proposals to ""further streamline store operations and management"" were an ""important step in becoming a leaner, faster business set up to serve changing customer needs"". Retail Economics chief executive Richard Lim said the cuts represented a ""massive reduction"" in the M&S workforce. The retailer was ""desperately attempting to reposition the business towards a new-normal emerging in the sector"". ""Retailers were already battling with the pace of structural change facing the sector but the impact of the pandemic has been a step-change for the industry."" He said retailers remained in ""survival mode, preserving cash and hanging on for more sustainable levels of demand to return"". ""But the way we shop has changed on a permanent basis for many parts of the sector almost overnight. ""The reality is that many more retailers will fail and the number of job losses will ramp up as government support is withdrawn. This is the calm before the storm."" In recent weeks, several retailers have announced job cuts, among themJohn Lewis, which warned 1,300 jobs could go, Boots, which said 4,000 were at risk, andWH Smith, which may shed 1,500 jobs. Dave Gill, national officer of the shopworkers' union Usdaw, said Tuesday's announcement was ""yet another devastating blow for M&S staff and yet another bombshell for our High Streets. The government has a clear choice: do they want to see the High Street go to the wall, or do they want to help save it""? Marks and Spencer has been in the throes of a big reorganisation of one sort or another for most of the past two decades. Successive management teams have struggled to come to terms with rapid shifts in consumer behaviour - but none so rapid as what has happened over the past four months. M&S had already begun what looked like it most serious restructuring in years before the pandemic struck, with a big drive to boost online sales - notably with a partnership with Ocado - and to close underperforming stores. But those plans, drawn up by Chairman Archie Norman and Chief Executive Steve Rowe, have been accelerated by the coronavirus. The bigger question now is whether the drastic action now being taken is enough to cope not only with the sudden decline in sales brought about by the pandemic, but the longer-term shifts that have so vexed M&S management in the past. The size of the job cuts suggests that M&S is at least taking those threats seriously. M&S employs almost 78,000 people, most of them in the UK. The bulk of the latest job cuts are expected to come among shop floor workers, with about 12% of customer assistant roles going. Cuts will also be made at head office and in regional management. However, the company is shifting resources and recruiting towards areas that are expanding - online and food. M&S said online clothing and home goods sales had been performing strongly since the beginning of the year, and over the last eight weeks had accounted for 41% of its total clothing and home goods sales. In the last 13 weeks M&S's total food sales increased by 2.5%. On Tuesday, the latest Kantar grocery index showed that as a whole, the market expanded by 14.4% in the 12 weeks to 9 August. Sales at Morrisons increased the most, rising by 16% over that period.

'Hot labs' in hospitals for faster Covid testing,"Up to 160 staff will be recruited for the labs Six new ""hot labs"" with rapid testing equipment will be created in hospitals as part of a drive to improve coronavirus test processing times. Three regional laboratories will also become 24/7 operations, with the Welsh Government spending up to Â£32m, including on extra staff. The latest weekly data showed 56% of tests processed in NHS Wales labs came back within a day. Fast turnaround of tests is seen as key to a successful contact tracing system. The money will pay for extra staff and equipment to enable Public Health Wales laboratories at University Hospital Wales, Cardiff, Singleton Hospital, Swansea and Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Rhyl, to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week from October. Coronavirus test times under the microscope Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales What is it like to be contact traced? The six ""hot labs"" with fast testing equipment will be created at Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli, Morriston Hospital, Swansea, Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil, University Hospital in Llandough and Grange Hospital, Cwmbran. The labs are seen as a key part of testing and tracing The Welsh Government said they will begin operating in November from 08:00 to 22:00 GMT, seven days a week. Dr Tracey Cooper, chief executive of Public Health Wales, said it will recruit up to 160 staff into the new roles. The government said the initial outlay on staffing and new equipment is expected to be nearly Â£8m and the cost of carrying out tests is expected to vary between Â£8m and Â£24m depending on demand. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""This investment will ensure we have the laboratory capacity in Wales to deliver our Test, Trace, Protect strategy to keep coronavirus under control, and be ready for the winter. ""I hope we don't need to use all the testing capacity this investment will create but we have to be prepared."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies welcomed the new capacity, but warned: ""We need to be sure that this additional resource will make a real difference."" by Paul Martin, BBC Wales political correspondent For weeks data has been showing that many tests processed in Welsh labs are not hitting the 24 hour target. And for weeks ministers have been saying they want to see improvement. Now we see the potential price tag: Â£32m This isn't a bit of tinkering here and there to increase the number of courier deliveries or ensure that samples arrive at regular, manageable intervals. It's a significant investment in recruitment and machinery to increase the capacity of NHS Wales laboratories. The specialist pan-UK ""Lighthouse Labs"", which operate 24 hours a day, have shown just how quickly tests can be turned around. The hope in government will be that this investment achieves something similar, so that the Test, Trace Protect system stands a good chance of working if coronavirus makes its feared winter comeback.

Golden eagle reintroduction plan launched,"Golden eagles have a wingspan of up to 7ft (2.2m) Golden eagles could be flying over Wales if plans to reintroduce them to the wild are successful. Wilder Britain has launched a public consultation following a feasibility study done with Lancaster University. Director Paul O'Donoghue hopes the ""most exciting conservation project ever proposed"" in Wales could see six to 10 breeding pairs in Snowdonia. But sheep farmer Hedd Pugh, 61, said he was worried about the reintroduction of a ""king of the predators"". Golden eagles have been all but extinct in Wales and England since 1850. One captive bird, which went on to live in the Cambrian Mountains,was recently found dead by a walker. Paul O'Donoghue said the plan would be a big draw for ecotourists In 2019, Cardiff University researchers said Wales was home to""large expanses of potentially suitable eagle habitat""but reintroduction was not likely to happen ""for some time"". Walker 'used boxing skills' to fight off black bear Beavers win legal fight to keep their home Wolf 'snatches pet kangaroo' The university's Eagle Reintroduction Wales (ERW) said such programmes were""usually a strict, highly-regulated, licensing process"",external. Natural Resources Wales said: ""We are aware of interest in the reintroduction of golden eagles into Wales. Reintroducing golden eagles to Wales would need to be carried out under a licence issued by Natural Resources Wales. ""Our assessment of any application for a licence would need to carefully consider the effects of a reintroduction on existing wildlife and land use."" A reintroduction plan in Ireland saw chicks released in County Donegal between 2001 and 2012. This resulted inthe first successful rearing of a chick by an Irish-bred eagle in more than 100 yearsin 2018. Snowdonia is already home to buzzards, peregrines, goshawks and black grouse, among other species Dr O'Donoghue said the juvenile eagles would be brought in from Scandinavia and central Europe and hoped the first birds could be introduced in the summer of 2021 - although this depends on all licensing criteria being met and approved by NRW, which can take several months. He said he was ""extremely encouraged by what we have seen in Ireland"" and hoped ""to establish the same level of success and engagement in Wales"". He added: ""We are delighted that the scientific feasibility work has confirmed how great Snowdonia would be for golden eagles. ""The sight of these majestic birds soaring over the mountain peaks, once seen, would never be forgotten."" Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

I'm concerned not just for lambs - what about other birds as well?"" Golden eagles are capable of lifting up to 11lbs (5kg) and lambs weigh up to 10lbs (4.5kg) when they are born.

"'Trump cannot meet this moment' - Michelle Obama""Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country,"" says the ex-first lady in an emotional message.US Election 2020","This video can not be played Michelle Obama campaigned against Donald Trump in the 2020 election Michelle Obama has launched a stinging attack on US President Donald Trump as Democrats prepared to crown Joe Biden as their White House challenger. ""Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country,"" said the former US first lady in an emotional recorded message to the Democratic convention. Disaffected members of Mr Trump's Republican party also piled in on him at the Democratic party conference. The election takes place on Tuesday 3 November. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, Democrats scrapped plans for a crowded party extravaganza with balloon drops and all the other political razzmatazz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But it is unclear whether the largely virtual schedule of pre-recorded speeches with no live audience can generate the same level of enthusiasm as pre-pandemic gatherings of the party faithful. Republicans will face the same challenge as they make their case for four more years in the White House at a drastically scaled-down convention next week. A really simple guide to the US election What to watch for at the US Democratic convention How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mrs Obama, who recorded her keynote address before Mr Biden announced his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, six days ago, launched a blistering attack on Mr Trump. ""You simply cannot fake your way through this job,"" she said in remarks that closed the first night of the convention on Monday. The headline speaker added: ""Our economy is in shambles because of a virus that this president downplayed for too long."" ""Stating the simple fact that a black life matters is still met with derision from the nation's highest office,"" Mrs Obama continued. ""Because whenever we look to this White House for some leadership, or consolation or any semblance of steadiness, what we get instead is chaos, division and a total and utter lack of empathy."" She said the last four years had been difficult to explain to America's children. ""They see our leaders labelling fellow citizens enemies of the state, while emboldening torch-bearing white supremacists. This video can not be played Democratic National Convention day one: Biden's grandchildren and famous faces ""They watch in horror as children are torn from their families and thrown into cages, and pepper spray and rubber bullets are used on peaceful protests for a photo op."" Mrs Obama continued: ""Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. ""He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is."" She described Mr Biden as a ""profoundly decent man"", touting the Democratic White House candidate's experience as vice-president under her husband, President Barack Obama. ""We have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it,"" she said, wearing a necklace that said ""Vote"". A lot of politicians spoke at the camera during the ""virtual"" Democratic convention on Monday night. The only speaker who landed an emotional punch, however, was Michelle Obama. The truth, she said, was that Donald Trump ""simply cannot be who we need him to be for us"". ""It is what it is,"" she said, employing the same words the president recently used about the coronavirus death toll - a jab that was as subtle as it was devastating. She wasn't trying to convince Republicans to switch sides. That was the job of John Kasich, the Republican ex-governor of Ohio. She wasn't trying to get left-wing progressives to rally to Biden. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders handled that. Mrs Obama was speaking to loyal Democrats, some of whom may have stayed at home or voted for a third party in 2016, some of whom may be dispirited or scared this year. Her goal was to drive home the gravity of the moment and to give them a call to action. The opening night of the convention, a two-hour programme hosted by former Desperate Housewives actress Eva Longoria Baston, was titled by party organisers ""We the People"". John Kasich, who ran against Mr Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, recorded a message calling on Americans to deny the president a second term in office. This video can not be played What happens at the US conventions? Mr Kasich endorsed Mr Biden, saying: ""We can all see what's going on in our country today and all the questions that are facing us, and no one person or party has all the answers. ""But what we do know is that we can do better than what we've been seeing today, for sure."" What does Kamala Harris believe? Where Joe Biden stands on the key issues Bernie Sanders, the left-wing Vermont senator who was Mr Biden's fiercest competitor during the Democratic party's contest to pick a challenger to Mr Trump, also recorded a message. He said: ""My friends, I say to you, and to everyone who supported other candidates in this primary and to those who may have voted for Donald Trump in the last election: The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake."" He added: ""Nero fiddled while Rome burned - Trump golfs."" This video can not be played What do young Democrats think of Joe Biden? Along with Mr Kasich, three other high-profile Republicans recorded messages for the convention's opening night: California businesswoman Meg Whitman, former New Jersey Governor Christine Whitman and former New York congresswoman Susan Molinari. While their inclusion left the Biden team claiming a broad coalition, some Democrats grumbled that the Republicans used up precious time that could have benefited progressive speakers or lesser-known rising stars. But Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and Biden campaign co-chairman, rejected that idea, saying, ""remember tonight's theme is 'We the People,' not 'We the Democrats'"". The opening night also featured pre-recorded messages from everyday Americans, including repentant Trump voters and a woman who blamed her father's death from Covid-19 on the president. On Tuesday morning, Mr Trump responded to Mrs Obama's criticism in a series of tweets. ""[I] would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren't for the job done by your husband,"" he wrote. This video can not be played What does this hat mean to Americans? And on Monday, Mr Trump spoke to the BBC on Air Force One and lashed out at Mr Kasich. ""He was a loser as a Republican, and he'll be a loser as a Democrat,"" the president said. During a campaign speech earlier that day in Mankato, Minnesota, Mr Trump warned that if Mr Biden won in November, news outlets would lose their audiences. ""Nobody's going to want to cover sleepy Joe,"" Mr Trump said. ""We will end up with one very boring socialist country that will go to hell."" Mr Trump also confirmed he would accept the Republican nomination for a second term during a live speech at the White House next week. Democrats and some fellow Republicans have criticised the plan for using the White House as a campaign venue. The four-night jamboree will culminate in Mr Biden's speech on Thursday in a mostly empty ballroom in his home state of Delaware. On Wednesday, his vice-presidential pick, Ms Harris, the daughter of immigrant parents from India and Jamaica, will accept her nomination as the first woman of colour to be a running mate on a major party presidential ticket. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Also speaking on Wednesday are former President Obama, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, and one of Mr Biden's former rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren. Tuesday will hear speeches from former President Bill Clinton and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Rapper's Bestival drugs-death conviction quashed,"Louella Fletcher-Michie was found dead in a wooded area on the edge of the Bestival site A man who gave his girlfriend drugs at a music festival and filmed her as she died has had his conviction for manslaughter overturned. Ceon Broughton, 31, was jailed for eight-and-a-half years in 2019 over the death of Louella Fletcher-Michie, 24. The daughter of Holby City actor John Michie died after taking the hallucinogenic class A drug 2-CP at Bestival in Dorset in 2017. Three judges at the Court of Appeal ruled to overturn the conviction. Miss Fletcher-Michie was found dead in woodland, 400m from the festival's hospital tent in the early hours of 11 September 2017, the day she was due to turn 25. During Broughton's trial, the jury was shown video shot by the rapper - who used the stage name CeonRPG - in which Miss Fletcher-Michie became ""disturbed, agitated, and then seriously ill"". Broughton, of Enfield, north London, was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence and supplying a class A drug at Winchester Crown Court in February last year. Ceon Broughton was found guilty of manslaughter and supplying a Class A drug in 2019 Delivering the Court of Appeal's ruling, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett said the prosecution had failed to prove that Miss Fletcher-Michie could have lived if her boyfriend had called for help. He added: ""In respectful disagreement with the judge, we conclude that the appellant's main argument, that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury, is established. ""Taken at its highest, the evidence adduced by the prosecution was incapable of proving causation to the criminal standard of proof. ""The appeal against conviction for manslaughter must be allowed."" Ms Fletcher-Michie's father is actor John Michie, who starred in Holby City and Coronation Street Lord Burnett said the jury had to rely on one expert's evidence when deciding if Broughton's actions contributed ""significantly"" to his girlfriend's death. He said the expert had suggested Miss Fletcher-Michie would have had a 90% chance of survival if she had been given medical treatment at 21:10 - nearly five hours after she took the drug. Given that the criminal standard of proof requires jurors to be sure ""beyond reasonable doubt"", Lord Burnett said the expert's evidence was ""not enough"" and therefore the issue of whether Broughton caused death by gross negligence should not have been for the jury to decide. The court ruled there should not be a retrial for the manslaughter conviction - which accounted for seven years of Broughton's sentence. His conviction for supplying his girlfriend with the class A drugs stands. It is believed Broughton will now be released. This video can not be played In footage shown to jurors by the defence, Louella Fletcher-Michie was filmed playing with fairy lights in a tent at the festival A statement issued by the rapper's lawyers said: ""The Court of Appeal has today found that Louella's death occurred not as a result of criminal negligence but was instead a tragic accident. ""Ceon remains devastated by her death. ""He has always wished that he could have done more to save her. ""He loved Louella and she him, but he knows that no words will ever be sufficient to convey his sense of responsibility for what happened or to begin to remove the pain that others have been caused."" The Crown Prosecution Service said it would fully consider the judgement and the points raised. Head of special crime and counter terrorism Jenny Hopkins, said: ""We respect the decision the Court of Appeal has made in the case of Ceon Broughton and are considering the next steps following today's judgment.

Williamson 'incredibly sorry' for exam distressThe education secretary repeatedly refuses to say if he will resign following a U-turn on Monday.,"This video can not be played Gavin Williamson says his focus is on ""making sure that every student gets the grades that they deserve"" Gavin Williamson says he is ""incredibly sorry for the distress"" caused to pupils after having to make a U-turn in how A-levels and GCSEs are graded. The education secretary refused to say if he will resign amid a fresh scramble to secure university places. ""My focus is making sure youngsters get the grades that they deserve,"" he said. Tens of thousands of students may now have the grades to trade up to their first-choice offers, prompting concerns about the number of available places. And uncertainty is continuing as admissions service Ucas and universities themselves have yet to be granted access to upgraded results. Exam results: Where did it go wrong and what happens next? How will universities cope with extra students? And other questions A-levels and GCSEs: How did the exam algorithm work? The University of Oxford said it now had ""many more offer-holders meeting their grades than in a normal year"" and as a result faced ""significant capacity constraints both within our colleges and on our academic courses"". Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK which represents vice-chancellors, said that many more students now had the grades to get into their first-choice university. He said this will ""cause challenges at this late stage in the admissions process - capacity, staffing, placements and facilities - particularly with the social distance measures in place"". The Association of School and College Leaders said it would write to Mr Williamson to request an immediate independent review into what it called the grading ""fiasco"". ""This degree of transparency is necessary at a time when public confidence has been badly shaken,"" general secretary Geoff Barton said. He called on No 10 and Ofqual to put in place a ""robust contingency plan"" for students sitting GCSEs and A-levels next summer in the event of further Covid-related disruption. Mr Williamson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday: ""I would like to start off by apologising - saying sorry to all those young people who've been affected by this. This is something none of us expected to see and none of us wanted to see."" Both Frances Ramos (left) and Zainab Ali were left unsure if they would get their first-choice university places, despite their grades being bumped up Frances Ramos, 18, from Towcester, Northamptonshire, said she was pleased to be given her predicted grades of ABB - up from the BCD she received last Thursday. But she said the U-turn ""does feel like it's a bit too late"" and added: ""I kind of wish the government had done this on Thursday."" She is now waiting to hear if her first choice, the University of Liverpool, will accept her to study this year. Zainab Ali, 18, from London, also thought the government should have acted sooner. ""I think it's a shame. After the damage is done, that's when they will take action and I find it quite frustrating,"" she said. The U-turn should now mean Zainab is able to attend Queen Mary University, London. Students relieved and annoyed after A-level U-turn Mr Williamson said it had been the common view of the government, Ofqual, and the devolved administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland of different political parties that the system in place was more robust and ""significantly better"" than that in Scotland, afteran earlier U-turn there. But after the release of A-level results on Thursday he said it ""became increasingly apparent that there were too many young people that quite simply hadn't got the grade they truly deserved"". The ""exact same challenge"" would have remained had there been a U-turn earlier, he said, and ""we would still be faced with the challenge of the fact of how do we expand the capacity within the university sector"". He refused to address questions about his future as education secretary during interviews on Tuesday morning and he declined to offer explicit support for Ofqual's chief regulator, Sally Collier, to stay in her job. Mr Williamson later told LBC: ""We ended up in a situation where Ofqual didn't deliver the system that we had been reassured and believed that would be in place."" Mr Williamson would not say whether he had offered his resignation to Prime Minister Boris Johnson during interviews on Tuesday Labour's shadow higher education minister Emma Hardy told Breakfast it appeared Ofqual had been ""thrown under the bus"" by the government despite it working to ministers' instructions during the pandemic. Ofqual's algorithm downgraded around 40% of entries and came under fire after data showed poorer students' grades were marked down further than better off pupils. Ministers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales all decided on Monday - four days after A-level results were issued - to revert to teacher assessed grades rather than the algorithm. NI: Assembly recall over exam results to go ahead Wales: Exam board chief 'disappointed' by grades U-turn The government's U-turn means teachers' assessments will also be used for all GCSE results - except for any cases where the algorithm adjustment actually suggests a better grade. It is still unclear what the climbdown will mean for students taking vocational qualifications, including BTecs, with studentstelling BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat: ""We've been forgotten about."" Mr Williamson said he hoped they would also be subject to teacher-assessed grades, adding that the government was working with awarding authorities to ensure this happened. Pearson, which awards BTecs, said it was aware that some BTec students had experienced a delay in receiving grades but did not say how many were impacted. As part of the changes to grading, Mr Williamson has suspended a cap on student numbers for universities - effectively allowing institutions to accept unlimited numbers this year. 11 August:Gavin Williamson announced A-level students would be able to use their results in mock tests to appeal if they are unhappy with the grades they are given, calling it a ""safety net"". Earlier in the day Scotland's government decided to switch to teachers' predicted grades 12 August:Nick Gibb, schools minister for England, acknowledged the government was ""concerned"" about what had happened in Scotland but insisted the system in England remained ""robust"" Thursday 13 August (results day):Mr Williamson ruled out following the Scottish government in reversing position, telling Sky News: ""You've got to have a system that has checks and balances"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the results were a ""robust set of grades"" Saturday:Mr Williamson told the Times there would be ""no U-turn"" on the grading system, saying Scotland had ended up with ""a system where there aren't any controls"" and had ""rampant grade inflation"" Sunday:Mr Williamson defended Ofqual's grading method in the Sunday Express, saying the calculated grade ""makes certain that everyone can be confident that these qualifications carry the same weight as previous years"" Monday:Mr Williamson announces a move to teacher-assessed grades for A-levels and GCSES saying ""we now believe it is better"" Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group which represents 24 leading universities, said there were ""limits to what can be done by the university sector alone to address that uncertainty without stretching resources to the point that it undermines the experience for all"". VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Universities including Bristol, Durham, Sheffield and Liverpool stopped offering places through the clearing system that matches students to unfilled courses on Monday. Bristol later said it would accept all applicants who now met the terms of an offer and Sheffield said it would do so ""wherever possible"". But some universities say that numbers will have to remain limited on medicine and dentistry courses. Ucas was unable to say how many students had not been able to take up places due to their results being downgraded. It said its latest figures early on Tuesday showed: 327,350 university applicants had been placed at their first-choice university since the results were released last week, slightly up on the same point last year 45,300 candidates had accepted a place at a back-up choice university, and a further 25,190 candidates had found a place through clearing. This means that a maximum of around 60,000 students could have accepted offers at lower-choice universities due to the exam results chaos - although it is likely to be less than that as some would still have fallen short of the grades needed for their first choice A Ucas spokesman said students who have not got into their first-choice institution should seek advice from their parents or teachers before contacting the university. Sam Freedman, who was a senior policy adviser to the Department for Education between 2010 and 2013, said it ""beggared belief"" that the secretary of state had said he was only aware of problems over the weekend. ""I can't think of many other education secretaries who wouldn't have already resigned,"" he said.

Depression doubles during coronavirus pandemicFigures suggest one in five adults in Britain are experiencing depressive symptoms.HealthJoe Biden: This time the Oval Office?Lego falls out of boy's nose after two yearsSamir Anwar was eating a muffin on a day out when he sneezed the 10 mm piece out of his nose.Newsbeat,"Twice as many adults in Britain are reporting symptoms of depression now compared with this time last year, Office for National Statistics figures suggest. One in five people appeared to have depressive symptoms compared with one in ten before the pandemic. The conclusions are based on a survey of more than 3,500 adults followed up over a 12-month period. They were asked the standard set of questions used to assess depression. People were asked to consider the previous two weeks and say how often they had experienced a range of symptoms, including changes in sleep or appetite, a loss of interest and pleasure in doing things, and difficulty concentrating. Almost 20% of people met the criteria for depression, based on their responses, in June 2020 compared with just under 10% between July 2019 and March 2020. While the measure of depression used is a well-known screening questionnaire though, Prof Elaine Fox at the University of Oxford, said: ""It is important to remember that this does not give a diagnosis but rather an indication of everyday depressive feelings and behaviours"". Severe mental health problems rise amid pandemic A small number of people (3.5%) saw an improvement in their symptoms. But 13% of people surveyed had newly developed symptoms of ""moderate to severe"" depression over the survey period. People under 40, women, people with a disability and those who said they would struggle to meet an unexpected cost of Â£850 were the groups most likely to show symptoms of depression. Laura Moulding, a 23-year-old recent graduate from Cardiff had this experience of struggling with worsening mental health over lockdown, while also managing a form of chronic fatigue called ME. Although she was already managing with the symptoms of severe depression prior to coronavirus, not being able to go out or have face-to-face psychiatrist appointments left her feeling ""the worst I've ever felt,"" she told the BBC. Pre-Covid she found going outside and keeping busy by volunteering helped to clear her head. But over lockdown, she had ""dark and intrusive thoughts...I've never known my depression feel this bad"". Dr Charley Baker, an associate professor of mental health at the University of Nottingham, said: ""It's unsurprising to see these rates of low mood and depressive symptoms emerging...The people highlighted as struggling the most are those who are already more vulnerable to low mood, anxiety and poorer wellbeing."" But she points out that not all of the increase in mental health symptoms will be among people who have clinical conditions. ""It's important though to avoid over-pathologising what might be seen as reasonable responses to the current pandemic,"" she said. Stephen Buckley, head of information at the charity Mind, said: ""It's important to bear in mind that most of us will have found the last five or six months more difficult than usual, and there's no 'normal' way to respond to a pandemic. ""If you notice changes to your thoughts, feelings and behaviours that are affecting your daily life, last longer than two weeks, or keep returning - talk to someone you trust, like your GP. A GP should be able to let you know if you might have a common mental health problem, like depression and anxiety, and signpost you to support.""

Joe Biden: This time the Oval Office?Lego falls out of boy's nose after two yearsSamir Anwar was eating a muffin on a day out when he sneezed the 10 mm piece out of his nose.Newsbeat," How Joe Biden overcame public and personal adversity By Anthony Zurcher By Anthony Zurcher This article was first published on 18 August, 2020 It was the winter of Joe Biden’s discontent. After a disappointing finish in the Iowa caucuses in February, his support in the upcoming New Hampshire primary was collapsing and his 2020 presidential campaign was in serious jeopardy. He was, for all appearances, a defeated man. The White House hopes Biden had been harbouring during his nearly half-century in public service were slipping away again, perhaps for the last time. At a campaign rally ahead of the New Hampshire vote, Biden was reflective - and at times visibly emotional. He spoke of the death of his son, Beau, almost five years earlier.  He recounted stories from his childhood, of his family’s economic hardships. But he reassured the audience. “There’s always hope,” he said. “There’s always hope.” It wasn’t a typical rally speech – and given his subsequent fifth-place finish in New Hampshire, probably not an effective one. But it offered a glimpse into the psyche, the emotional scar tissue, of a politician who has faced devastating personal, professional and political adversity over the course of his life. “I have an incredibly high regard for fate,” Biden told the National Journal back in 1989. “I have never been able to plan my life. Every time my personal life has been how I wanted it, something has intervened.” Biden has witnessed the untimely deaths of the closest of loved ones. He’s built platforms for his political ambitions, only to watch them crumble, then built them again. His hard-earned rhetorical skills have won him the adoration of crowds, and his propensity for malaprops and gaffes have made him the object of ridicule. Biden frequently says that the main lesson he learned from his father was that the measure of a man isn’t how many times he’s been knocked down, but how quickly he gets back up. After losing in New Hampshire, Biden’s campaign regrouped in the southern states and turned what appeared to be impending defeat into a convincing march to the Democratic nomination. That was only the latest example of Biden facing challenges – some beyond his control, others resulting from his own mistakes and miscalculations – and soldiering on. “We have choices when we suffer like Joe,” says former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, who served with Biden in Congress during the 1990s. “He's a man of faith. He chose not to quit. He chose to keep doing the work, even though he didn't have to.” Biden, if nothing else, is a survivor. Five pivotal days in his life put this in stark relief – days casting shadows that stretched for decades. Joe Biden was in Washington on 18 December, 1972, when the telephone rang. It was his brother Jimmy in Delaware, asking to speak to his sister, Valerie. There had been a “slight accident” involving Biden's family, his sister relayed. “Nothing to be worried about,” she said. “But we ought to go home.” His wife Neilia, he would learn later that day, had been killed, along with their infant daughter, Naomi, when the car she was driving was hit by a lorry. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were also seriously injured. The family had been shopping for a Christmas tree while Biden – who had just been elected to the Senate - was off interviewing staff for his congressional office and finalising the purchase of a new home for the family. Now, that family was shattered. “I could not speak, only felt this hollow core grow in my chest,” Biden wrote in his memoir, “like I was going to be sucked inside a black hole.” He considered giving up the Senate seat he had just won. He contemplated joining the priesthood. He found himself taking evening walks in rough neighbourhoods, looking for a fight. “I had not known I was capable of such rage,” he wrote. “ I felt God had played a horrible trick on me, and I was angry.” Up until that day, Biden’s life had been on a remarkable upward trajectory. Just over a month earlier, the then-29-year-old Democrat had become the second-youngest person elected to the US Senate, defeating a two-term Republican incumbent in a race few thought he had a chance of winning. He was considered a golden boy in a Democratic Party that had been trounced across the nation by Richard Nixon and the Republicans. Biden’s childhood was relatively challenging. While his father had his share of business successes, mostly before Biden was born, the ups were inevitably followed by downs, and young Biden spent much of his youth living with his extended family in a modest home in Scranton, Pennsylvania. “The values that Vice-President Biden was exposed to as a young man were values rooted in the Church, rooted in Catholic education, rooted in the culture we were growing up in, which was Irish-American,” says Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, whose family has lived in Scranton for generations. His biggest childhood challenge was overcoming a speech impediment – a stutter – that afflicted him well into high school. In his memoir, Biden recalls memorising a reading to avoid tripping up during class and, when he once did, how a teacher mocked his disability, calling him “buh-buh-Biden”. That teacher, a Catholic nun, received a tongue-lashing from Biden’s mother, who threatened to “knock your bonnet off your head”, in Biden’s retelling. His high-school classmates gave him nicknames that made references to his stutter. “Even today I can remember the dread, the shame, the absolute rage, as vividly as the day it was happening,” Biden wrote. By the time he finished high school, however, he had overcome the stutter - the result, he says, of months of training himself to relax his face while he practised speaking in front of a mirror. It still reveals itself on occasion, however, when he’s under pressure or fumbling for words. “A stutter does not get worse as a person ages, but trying to keep it at bay can take immense physical and mental energy,” wrote John Hendrickson, in an Atlantic Magazine article about Biden’s stutter. No-one is ever truly cured, he says, they simply find ways around the problem. After high school, Biden went on to attend the University of Delaware and then law school at Syracuse University, in part to be near Neilia, whom he had met during a college holiday. They eventually married, and Biden’s political career began shortly after their return to Wilmington. He briefly practised law at a major firm, but disillusioned with representing the rich and powerful, he switched to being a public defender. From there, he ran for – and won – a seat on the New Castle county council. This became his unlikely springboard to the US Senate after no other Democrat expressed interest in challenging the entrenched Republican incumbent. “Joe Biden looks like the photograph of a great statesman in his youth,” a local newspaper columnist gushed. “His eyes sparkle blue, and his teeth shine when he smiles, his cheeks glow, and his body is still boyishly slim.” Joe Biden, 1972 Joe Biden, 1972 The article concluded on a surprisingly sombre note, however: “He had the look – both triumphant and sad – of a young man who believes the world is his, and knows he is yet to be tested.” Those tests would come – none more daunting than the one on that December day, just a few years later. Biden would ultimately accept his Senate seat, taking the oath of office from the Delaware hospital where his two sons were recovering. It marked the beginning of 44 consecutive years in national politics – a stretch that ended, as it began, with the untimely death of a child. In May 2015 Beau Biden died of brain cancer at the age of 46. Like his father, Beau had pursued a career in politics, serving as Delaware’s attorney general, with the prospect of higher offices to come. “He had all the best of me, but with the bugs and flaws engineered out,"" Biden wrote of Beau in his 2017 book about his son’s illness. Biden details how close he came to announcing his own presidential bid in 2015, but that the rawness of his son’s death – and the toll a campaign might take on his family – pushed him to stay out. “I wasn’t sure if I would be able to find the emotional energy, and I knew from previous experience that grief is a process that respects no schedule and no timetable,” he wrote. A lifetime of loss was something Biden learned to live with and overcome, like his stutter - a piece of himself that he found a way to build on. “It's my belief that your empathy is informed by your experience, but you're either born with that sense or you're not,” Senator Casey says. “In Biden’s case, it was both a quality he was born with but also one that was informed by his own personal tragedies that gave him an insight into loss and tragedy and pain that a lot of people never fully understand.” Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009 Biden and his son Beau, Camp Victory, Baghdad 2009  On 23 September 1987, Joe Biden stood before a crowd of reporters and announced that he was abandoning the presidential bid he had launched just three months earlier. “I’m angry with myself for having been put in this position – for having put myself in this position of having to make this choice,” he said. “And I am no less frustrated at the environment of presidential politics that makes it so difficult to let the American people measure the whole Joe Biden and not just misstatements that I have made.” It was an ignominious end to Biden’s first attempt at the White House, after his campaign ran aground amid charges of plagiarism and dishonesty. It was a particularly bitter pill to swallow for a man who liked to offer his “word as a Biden” as an iron-clad guarantee of honesty and trustworthiness. The first blow came in a debate in Iowa where Biden, in his closing statement, recited – nearly word for word – a passage from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock’s speech about his working-class upbringing. Although he frequently quoted those lines with attribution, this time Biden didn’t – and an operative from a rival Democratic campaign took note. A plagiarism charge against Biden for a law school paper also resurfaced. He explained that it was the result of an improper citation, but combined with the Kinnock mistake and further allegations of unattributed speech quotes, it cemented for many the perception that there was no substance beneath Biden’s style. “Here I was, getting out of the race with my integrity being questioned,” Biden would later tell his biographer, Jules Witcover.  “It really ate me up. It was the core of who I thought I was, who I know I am, actually.” During his first 14 years in Washington, Biden rebuilt his personal life after the deaths of his wife and daughter. He committed to giving his two living children some semblance of a normal life, and commuted each day from their home in Delaware to Washington. He eventually remarried, to a schoolteacher named Jill Jacobs, with whom he had a child, Ashley. He established himself on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and began to build a national presence. After entertaining a run in 1984, he took the plunge four years later, with a campaign that played heavily on Kennedy-esque themes of generation change. “We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference,” he said at his campaign kick-off. “The clarion call for my generation is not, ‘It’s our turn,’ but rather, ‘It’s our moment of obligation and opportunity’.” The plagiarism row ensured this wouldn’t be Biden’s moment. At the same time he was attempting to keep his presidential campaign afloat, Biden was also chairing Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings for a conservative Supreme Court nominee, Robert Bork – a high-profile battle over the ideological direction of the nation’s highest court. It was after a morning session of these hearings in Washington that Biden announced the end to his campaign. The decision turned out to be somewhat of a blessing, however, as a few months later – the night of the Iowa caucuses – he collapsed in a hotel room in Rochester, New York, the result of an intracranial aneurism. For the next six months, he was in and out of hospital. For a time, doctors feared he would have lasting brain damage. It would be 20 years before Biden ran for president again – this time as an elder statesman, not a fresh face. He promised to run the 2008 race on his own terms, after concluding that his 1987 campaign was too heavy on rhetorical flourishes and image-consultants. It was almost as if he was trying to right the wrongs of 20 years earlier. “Any of you who take a look at my life will not be able to conclude that I am not an honourable man,” he said at an Iowa campaign rally in June. “And that’s why I wasn’t afraid to get back into this thing.” The end result – defeat – was the same, however. And right out of the gate, it was Biden’s tongue that betrayed him. The day before he formally announced his candidacy, Biden told a New York Observer reporter that one of his opponents, Barack Obama, was “the first mainstream African American, who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy”. Biden was quickly forced to explain that he did not mean to disparage previous black presidential candidates or belittle Obama personally. It was cited as yet another of Biden’s propensity for gaffes – off-the-cuff remarks that would embarrass or distract from his intended message – which would bedevil his national efforts throughout his career. Although Biden eventually steadied his campaign, he never broke into the top tier. The Democratic race boiled down to a two-way battle between Obama and Hillary Clinton. A riveted US public watched on 11 October, 1991, as Anita Hill, then a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, testified before Joe Biden’s Senate Judiciary Committee that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her on multiple occasions when they both worked for the Reagan administration. Hill accused Thomas of repeatedly making “ugly”, “disgusting”, “dirty” comments to her, creating an intolerable workplace. Thomas, in his testimony, accused his critics of engaging in a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” - alluding to a term that has historicalracist connotations. “Unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you,” he said. “You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the US Senate rather than hung from a tree.” Biden chairs the Clarence Thomas hearings, 1991 Biden, as chair, presided over this spectacle – trying to provide what he described as a fair hearing for both sides. The committee had already voted once on Thomas’s nomination, during which Biden objected to Thomas on ideological grounds. This, however, was different. As the committee reopened its inquiry, the issue was Thomas’ moral character – and two distinct and conflicting accounts of what had taken place a decade earlier. Biden was conscious that he and his fellow senators – all men, all white - were open to charges of racism against only the second black nominee to the Supreme Court, and charges of sexism if they didn’t give Hill’s allegations a full airing. “The Democrats were deathly afraid of seeming to gang up on a black Supreme Court nominee, there's no doubt about that,” says journalist Jill Abramson, who covered the hearings for the Wall Street Journal and co-wrote a book, Strange Justice, on the topic. Instead of being fair, Abramson says, Biden and the Democrats allowed themselves to be “woefully outmanoeuvred” by the committee’s Republican minority, leaving many liberal supporters feeling betrayed. “As the Democrats are wont to do, they wanted to be seen as playing fair,” she says. “But it wasn't playing fair, it was two days of hearings where Anita Hill was trashed by the Republicans who portrayed her as a fantaciser or an erotomaniac.” If Biden was trying to find balance on issues of race and sex during the hearings, it’s a challenge he’s faced throughout his career, with varying levels of success. When Biden first ran for the Senate, he presented himself as an advocate of the civil rights movement. He recalled how, as a teenage volunteer at a swimming centre in a predominantly black neighbourhood of Wilmington, he learned about the unfair treatment ethnic minority groups frequently received in the US. “Every day, it seemed to me, black people got subtle and not-so-subtle reminders that they didn’t quite belong in America,” Biden wrote in his memoir. One of Biden’s first high-profile political battles upon entering the Senate, however, was fought alongside pro-segregation southerners in opposition of the court-ordered practice of transporting students to schools in different neighbourhoods in an effort to address racial segregation. It was a subject that would open Biden to attacks during his run for the 2020 Democratic nomination. “Biden at one time called the issue of bussing a ‘domestic Vietnam’,” says Jason Sokol, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire. “He meant that it was an issue that was tearing the country apart culturally. That's why he shied away from taking a strong stance against integration at that point. He saw that this politically was not a smart thing to do.” While Biden fought conservative judicial and executive appointees he thought were insufficiently dedicated to civil rights, he viewed the role of government as preventing discrimination in the current era, not offering remedies for past wrongs. “I do not buy the concept, popular in the ‘60s which said: ‘We have suppressed the black man for 300 years, and the white man is now far ahead in the ‘race’ for everything our society offers,” he told a newspaper interviewer in 1975. “In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a ‘head start’ or even hold the white man back to even the ‘race’. I don’t buy that."" Biden’s record on crime and law-enforcement issues also opened him up to accusations that he supported policies - designed to address a spike in violent crime and drug offences in the 1980s and early 1990s - that disproportionately affected ethnic minority groups. Sokol says Biden has spent his career inhabiting a “very conflicted, messy middle ground” on racial issues, where he weighed in angering some of his white constituents against ”honouring claims for racial justice”. In 1988, Biden enthusiastically backed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which established tougher mandatory sentences for narcotics like crack cocaine that were more frequently used by ethnic minority groups. He was the architect of a 1994 anti-crime bill that expanded mandatory minimum sentences and greatly increased federal funding for police departments and prisons – a push that since has been seen as a contributing factor in the US having one of the world’s largest incarcerated populations. According to Bob Kerrey, who was one of the 95 senators who voted for the crime bill, being labelled “soft on crime” was politically dangerous in the 1990s. Joe Biden speaks about crime and ""predators on our streets"", 1993 “I didn't know how controversial the crime bill would become,” he says. “The problem with that crime bill is it worked - crime went down. The larger problem is we tolerated racist attitudes of police forces way too long.” Attached to that 1994 crime bill was one of Biden’s most cherished legislative accomplishments - the Violence Against Women Act. The topic of domestic abuse - and how to address it on a federal level – was always among Biden’s top of priorities. “We ripped the Band-Aid off a shameful secret and exposed the ugly truth of domestic violence to the public eye,”Biden told the Huffington Post in 2019. While Biden has offered his legislative efforts as evidence of his support for women’s issues, it has been his personal conduct that has drawn the sharpest attacks. In the days before the formal launch of his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden was accused by a number of women of unwanted physical contact. “I had never experienced anything so blatantly inappropriate and unnerving before,” wrote Lucy Flores, a Nevada Democratic politician, of an encounter she had with Biden in 2014. “The vice-president of the United States of America had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends, family or romantic partners -and I felt powerless to do anything about it.” While not admitting to any specific misconduct, Biden released a video in which he said he would be “more mindful and respectful” of future conduct that might make women uncomfortable. Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 Lucy Flores and Joe Biden, Las Vegas, 2014 In March, one of the women who accused Biden of misconduct, Tara Reade, expanded her allegation to sexual assault, saying the then-senator had attacked her in an empty hallway when she worked in his office in 1993. Acquaintances of Reade said she told them about the alleged incident at the time. Two months later, Biden directly addressed the accusation, referencing his support for the Violence Against Women Act. “I recognise my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished,” he said. “So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago. They aren't true.” Reade called on Biden to quit the race.Subsequent investigations by journalists, including aNew York Times report, found inconsistencies in Reade’s accounts. The episode, however, raised uncomfortable issues for Democrats, especially women in the party who had backed the rallying cry of the #MeToo movement, Believe Women. It also drew parallels to the doubts and aspersions directed at Anita Hill decades earlier In recent years – and in light of the Me Too movement that has increased awareness of sexual harassment and assault - Biden has expressed regret over his handling of the Hill episode. “To this day, I regret that I could not come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved, given the courage she showed by reaching out to us,” Biden said during a speech in March 2019. He later directly expressed this to Hill in a phone call. But for her, it was not enough. “He needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw,” she told the New York Times. “There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.” It was deja vu for Joe Biden. On 11 October, 2002, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations committee was once again deciding whether to authorise a Republican president to go to war with Iraq. Eleven years earlier, on the eve of the Gulf War, Biden had voted against giving President George HW Bush the approval to use force against Saddam Hussein’s military. “Before we ask Americans to die for the liberation of Kuwait, I would like to be sure we have tried every possible alternative,” he said during a Foreign Relations committee hearing. “So far, this has not been the case.” Despite Biden’s warning that there could be tens of thousands of US casualties, the resolution passed 52-47 - and the Gulf War ended quickly, with only a handful of American deaths. US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 US President George HW Bush with US Marines in Saudi Arabia, during the Gulf War, 1990 Biden, along with other Democrats who opposed the war, were frequently branded as “doves” who were soft on national defence. Robert Gates, defence secretary under George W Bush, typified these kind of attacks when he wrote in his 2014 memoir that Biden was “wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"". He listed Biden’s support for withdrawal from South Vietnam, opposition to Ronald Reagan’s defence build-up and that fateful vote against the Gulf War resolution, among others. In the years after that vote, Biden staked out more hawkish positions on international affairs, including backing US involvement in the Balkan civil wars, bombing in Iraq and the invasion of Afghanistan. When President George W Bush began moving toward a new war with Iraq, alleging it possessed weapons of mass destruction, Biden was a vocal supporter. “I do not believe this is a rush to war,” he said. “I believe it’s a march to peace and security.” Biden was among the 77 senators to vote for that Iraq War resolution – joining numerous other Democrats with presidential ambitions, including John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Biden speaks at the Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing on Iraq, 2002 “It was kind of a simple calculation,” says Mark Weisbrot, who directed a documentary on Biden’s Iraq War support. “They knew there was a risk that if you were against the war and the war turned out to be a ‘success’ you could lose some swing votes. But if you voted for the war, and it turned out to be a disaster, which it did, you really didn't lose much because your base didn't have anywhere to go.” As the war dragged on, however, Biden’s war vote did become a political liability – this time with Democratic voters who increasingly saw the US occupation as a quagmire. Biden, after initially defending his vote, began to back away. He deals with this episode in a chapter on the Iraq War - titled “My Mistake” - in his 2007 memoir. Writing about those in the Bush administration who pushed for war, he wrote: “I vastly underestimated their disingenuousness and incompetence”. If Biden in the years after his Gulf War vote tried to compensate for his perceived error by moving to the right, he moved left after the Iraq War. He opposed a surge of US forces in Iraq, calling for US withdrawal and partitioning of the nation. As vice-president, he counselled against an increase in US forces in Afghanistan and advised against the Osama bin Laden raid. Shortly after announcing his 2020 presidential bid, Biden advocated ending US support for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen civil war. During the Obama presidency, Biden had an active role in carrying out the administration’s foreign policy objectives. Senator Casey recalls meeting the vice-president during a visit to Iraq, where they discussed his efforts to work with the leaders of the various governing factions. “I could tell by listening to his recitations from the interactions that he had learned a lot about these people as personalities,” Casey says. “It was a really valuable lesson in diplomacy. It wasn't just learning the substance of a white paper about a particular country or a particular foreign policy issue, but you literally have to get to know the individuals.” Biden’s other responsibilities included pressuring Congress to back nuclear negotiations with Iran, building international support for the Paris climate accords, representing US interests in China and encouraging democratic reforms in Ukraine. These last two areas – China and Ukraine – have become a focus for attacks from Donald Trump and Republicans, who have criticised Biden for being too close to China, and attempted to make a case that Biden’s Ukraine activities were to protect his son, Hunter, who had business ties to the nation. Last year, Hunter insisted he had done ""nothing wrong"" but admitted to ""poor judgment"",leaving him open to political attacks. Biden’s Iraq War vote again came up in the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, but nearly two decades later it lacked the political punch it once had. At the end of Biden’s 2008 presidential run, it seemed the senator would return to Washington and finish his career in Congress or, perhaps, as an official in a future Democratic administration. On 23 August, however, Barack Obama selected him as his vice-presidential running mate. The choice surprised many. Biden’s home state, Delaware, was not an electoral battleground. With more than three decades in Washington, he wasn’t the kind of outsider who fitted with Obama’s message of change. “There was this sense that they were very, very different,” says Kate Andersen Brower, a journalist and author of a book on the vice-presidency. “Obama was very thoughtful and careful choosing his words, and Biden was always sticking his foot in his mouth. The one thing Biden told Obama when he agreed to do the job was that he wasn't going to change his brand. He said, ‘I am what I am’.” According to former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who ran for president in 2008 and was also on Obama’s vice-presidential short list, Obama and Biden developed a rapport on the Democratic primary campaign trail. “I knew in the debates they had a personal chemistry,” Richardson says. “Obama needed a senior foreign policy person on the ticket, but also I could tell they liked each other a lot.” A few hours after announcing his pick, Obama took the stage in Springfield, Illinois to introduce Biden to the gathered crowd. Biden is announced as Obama's running mate, 2008 “Joe Biden is that rare mix – for decades he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn’t changed him,” he said. “He is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track.” Obama would tick through the pivotal moments of Biden’s life – his stutter, the death of his wife and child, his brain aneurysm, the 1994 crime bill and his involvement in negotiating an end to the Balkan civil war – all in support of his choice. In the early days of the Obama presidency Biden frequently chafed at the White House’s directions. For more than 30 years, Biden – as a senator – ran his own political fiefdom. Now he was required to do someone else’s bidding. “It was galling for him at first,” says Bower. “It was this kind of a push-and-pull relationship.” There were moments when Biden broke from administration policy, most notably when he announced his support for gay marriage in 2012, frustrating a White House intent on message control. At other times Obama tasked Biden with important duties – shepherding the 2009 stimulus bill through Congress and overseeing the drawdown of US troops in Iraq. By the time Biden finished his eight years in the vice-presidency, he and Obama had formed a strong friendship. Bower recounts an interview she had with Biden during which Biden became visibly emotional when talking about Obama speaking at Beau’s funeral. “They were kind of, as hokey as it sounds, like a family during those eight years,” says Bower. “It was kind of a father-son relationship, too, because of their age difference.” In a surprise ceremony in the final days of his presidency, Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the nation’s highest civilian honour. After joking about their “bromance”, Obama turned serious. “To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretence, services without self-regard and to live life fully,” he said. The speech had the tenor of a benediction, marking the end of a long career in public service. A year and a half earlier, Obama pressured Biden not to challenge Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination. “The president was convinced I could not beat Hillary,” Biden wrote in his 2017 memoir, “and he worried that a long primary fight would split the party and leave the Democratic nominee vulnerable in the general election.” The Democrats had a long and acrimonious primary fight anyway – between Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And a vulnerable Clinton lost the general election. Four years later, Biden dispatched Sanders more easily than Clinton had and the former vice-president finally secured the Democratic nomination. His success was due, in no small part, to his service as a dutiful deputy to Obama, which won him overwhelming support among black Democrats. “Let me explain something to you about Joe Biden,” writes Laurie Goff in a Facebook post that captured this sentiment. “This old rich white man played second fiddle to a black man. Not just any black man but a younger black man, a smart black man. Not just for a day. Not one, not two but eight years.” “This is what showing up and being an ally looks like,” she concludes. “When black people say they know Joe,this is how we know.” In what could be seen as an acknowledgement of this support, Biden selected a former presidential rival, Kamala Harris, to be his vice-presidential running mate, giving a black woman the kind of stepping stone to the presidency that Obama had provided him eight years earlier. Once again the Democrats had a multi-generational, multi-ethnic presidential ticket. As Obama’s “wingman”, Biden was able to get a foothold in the White House. His third try for the top office, after more than 40 years of political ambition buffeted by public and personal adversity, was his last shot at the prize.

"Dessert factory coronavirus cases rise to 72Bakkavor, which makes desserts for Waitrose and Tesco, is testing its whole workforce.Nottingham","Nottinghamshire County Council said 1,130 staff members at Bakkavor in Newark have been tested Coronavirus cases at a dessert factory testing its entire workforce have risen to more than 70. Some 1,600 staff at Bakkavor in Newark, Nottinghamshire, are undergoing testing. So far 1,130 have been checked, with 74 confirmed cases, Nottinghamshire County Council said, while 33 people have been able to return to work. The company, which makes desserts for Waitrose and Tesco, said it ""understood the importance of the testing"". Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Bakkavor said it had communicated to staff the dangers of car sharing and the need for social distancing Richard Wiles, from Collingham, who works next to the site, told the BBC the outbreak did not come as a surprise. ""The workers have been upset for quite a while that they don't think enough has been done to protect them,"" he said. ""People here are somewhere between baffled and very angry because when there have been outbreaks at food plants elsewhere, they have been closed instantly. ""It seems there has been a slow, modern British response to this and cakes have come before Covid safety."" The council hadpreviously saidthe entire workforce would be tested after the number of positive cases increased from 20 to 39. Staff from other areas of the business have been seconded to help upload the details into the NHS portal. Throughout most of July new cases of coronavirus in Newark and Sherwood were low, but they have risen in recent weeks. The district was added to the government's hotspotwatch list,externallast week and a testing site for members of the public was set up at the district council building after a spike in cases. In the week to Thursday 13 August there were 39 cases, equivalent to nearly 32 per 100,000 population. Across England overall in the same week the rate was just under 12 per 100,000. Ten cases were people living in the Newark North area, which is also where the Bakkavor dessert factory is located, with a further 10 in Balderton. However, some of the 74 cases so far confirmed at Bakkavor may not yet be reflected in the official data, which is updated daily as more test results come back. Newark and Sherwood's weekly infection rate per 100,000 people has risen from 26.1 up to 6 August to 31.9 up to 13 August. Jonathan Gribbin, director of public health at Nottinghamshire County Council, said closing the factory with 1,600 staff depending on it for their livelihoods, was not something they wanted to do. ""Reports from the Health and Safety Executive and environmental health colleagues indicates there are a really good set of controls in place within the factory,"" he said. ""So [closing it] would be quite a radical thing to do, not something we would want to bring forward at this point and certainly not before we have followed through on every other possible avenue, including finishing off on this whole workplace testing."" He added: ""We know that not all the cases in Newark are linked to Bakkavor so it is vital that people continue to follow the strict guidance to prevent the transmission of Covid-19 across the whole community."" Shona Taylor, from Bakkavor, said: ""The [testing] programme has been positively received, and colleagues have been supportive and reassured that every effort is being taken to ensure their safety."" At the Bakkavor bakery in Devizes, last week it was confirmed thenumber of positive tests had risen to 15from seven the week before. Wiltshire Council has confirmed the number of cases there has not changed. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work?

Depression doubles during coronavirus pandemicFigures suggest one in five adults in Britain are experiencing depressive symptoms.,"Twice as many adults in Britain are reporting symptoms of depression now compared with this time last year, Office for National Statistics figures suggest. One in five people appeared to have depressive symptoms compared with one in ten before the pandemic. The conclusions are based on a survey of more than 3,500 adults followed up over a 12-month period. They were asked the standard set of questions used to assess depression. People were asked to consider the previous two weeks and say how often they had experienced a range of symptoms, including changes in sleep or appetite, a loss of interest and pleasure in doing things, and difficulty concentrating. Almost 20% of people met the criteria for depression, based on their responses, in June 2020 compared with just under 10% between July 2019 and March 2020. While the measure of depression used is a well-known screening questionnaire though, Prof Elaine Fox at the University of Oxford, said: ""It is important to remember that this does not give a diagnosis but rather an indication of everyday depressive feelings and behaviours"". Severe mental health problems rise amid pandemic A small number of people (3.5%) saw an improvement in their symptoms. But 13% of people surveyed had newly developed symptoms of ""moderate to severe"" depression over the survey period. People under 40, women, people with a disability and those who said they would struggle to meet an unexpected cost of Â£850 were the groups most likely to show symptoms of depression. Laura Moulding, a 23-year-old recent graduate from Cardiff had this experience of struggling with worsening mental health over lockdown, while also managing a form of chronic fatigue called ME. Although she was already managing with the symptoms of severe depression prior to coronavirus, not being able to go out or have face-to-face psychiatrist appointments left her feeling ""the worst I've ever felt,"" she told the BBC. Pre-Covid she found going outside and keeping busy by volunteering helped to clear her head. But over lockdown, she had ""dark and intrusive thoughts...I've never known my depression feel this bad"". Dr Charley Baker, an associate professor of mental health at the University of Nottingham, said: ""It's unsurprising to see these rates of low mood and depressive symptoms emerging...The people highlighted as struggling the most are those who are already more vulnerable to low mood, anxiety and poorer wellbeing."" But she points out that not all of the increase in mental health symptoms will be among people who have clinical conditions. ""It's important though to avoid over-pathologising what might be seen as reasonable responses to the current pandemic,"" she said. Stephen Buckley, head of information at the charity Mind, said: ""It's important to bear in mind that most of us will have found the last five or six months more difficult than usual, and there's no 'normal' way to respond to a pandemic. ""If you notice changes to your thoughts, feelings and behaviours that are affecting your daily life, last longer than two weeks, or keep returning - talk to someone you trust, like your GP. A GP should be able to let you know if you might have a common mental health problem, like depression and anxiety, and signpost you to support.""

Man has festival drugs death conviction overturned,"Louella Fletcher-Michie was found dead in a wooded area on the edge of the Bestival site A man who gave his girlfriend drugs at a music festival and filmed her as she died has had his conviction for manslaughter overturned. Ceon Broughton, 31, was jailed for eight-and-a-half years in 2019 over the death of Louella Fletcher-Michie, 24. The daughter of Holby City actor John Michie died after taking the hallucinogenic class A drug 2-CP at Bestival in Dorset in 2017. Three judges at the Court of Appeal ruled to overturn the conviction. Miss Fletcher-Michie was found dead in woodland, 400m from the festival's hospital tent in the early hours of 11 September 2017, the day she was due to turn 25. During Broughton's trial, the jury was shown video shot by the rapper - who used the stage name CeonRPG - in which Miss Fletcher-Michie became ""disturbed, agitated, and then seriously ill"". Broughton, of Enfield, north London, was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence and supplying a class A drug at Winchester Crown Court in February last year. Ceon Broughton was found guilty of manslaughter and supplying a Class A drug in 2019 Delivering the Court of Appeal's ruling, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett said the prosecution had failed to prove that Miss Fletcher-Michie could have lived if her boyfriend had called for help. He added: ""In respectful disagreement with the judge, we conclude that the appellant's main argument, that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury, is established. ""Taken at its highest, the evidence adduced by the prosecution was incapable of proving causation to the criminal standard of proof. ""The appeal against conviction for manslaughter must be allowed."" Ms Fletcher-Michie's father is actor John Michie, who starred in Holby City and Coronation Street Lord Burnett said the jury had to rely on one expert's evidence when deciding if Broughton's actions contributed ""significantly"" to his girlfriend's death. He said the expert had suggested Miss Fletcher-Michie would have had a 90% chance of survival if she had been given medical treatment at 21:10 - nearly five hours after she took the drug. Given that the criminal standard of proof requires jurors to be sure ""beyond reasonable doubt"", Lord Burnett said the expert's evidence was ""not enough"" and therefore the issue of whether Broughton caused death by gross negligence should not have been for the jury to decide. The court ruled there should not be a retrial for the manslaughter conviction - which accounted for seven years of Broughton's sentence. His conviction for supplying his girlfriend with the class A drugs stands. It is believed Broughton will now be released. This video can not be played In footage shown to jurors by the defence, Louella Fletcher-Michie was filmed playing with fairy lights in a tent at the festival A statement issued by the rapper's lawyers said: ""The Court of Appeal has today found that Louella's death occurred not as a result of criminal negligence but was instead a tragic accident. ""Ceon remains devastated by her death. ""He has always wished that he could have done more to save her. ""He loved Louella and she him, but he knows that no words will ever be sufficient to convey his sense of responsibility for what happened or to begin to remove the pain that others have been caused."" The Crown Prosecution Service said it would fully consider the judgement and the points raised. Head of special crime and counter terrorism Jenny Hopkins, said: ""We respect the decision the Court of Appeal has made in the case of Ceon Broughton and are considering the next steps following today's judgment. ""Our thoughts remain with the family of Ms Fletcher-Michie at this difficult time."" A spokesperson for Mr Michie told the BBC he would not be commenting.

"Boy thrown from Tate Modern balcony 'goes home'The boy, 7, is making progress in reading, breathing and singing in France, his parents say.London","The six-year-old boy taken by air ambulance to Royal London Hospital A boy who suffered catastrophic injuries when he was thrown from the balcony of the Tate Modern has been able to visit home, his family said. Last August the boy, aged six at the time and visiting London from France with his family, fell 100ft (30m) and suffered life-changing injuries. Now, the boy's family says he is ""happy to see his toys again"". Jonty Bravery, 18, who threw the boy from the balcony, was convicted of his attempted murder and jailed, in June. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spent time at Royal London Hospital before moving to a hospital in France. This video can not be played Audio recording of Jonty Bravery telling carers in autumn 2018 about his plan to commit murder During Bravery's sentencing, the court was told the boy would require round-the-clock care until at least 2022. His injuries included a bleed to the brain and fractures to his spine and he has been left needing the use of a wheelchair. An update posted on a GoFundMe site, which has raised almost Â£250,000 for the boy's medical care, said his parents were able to bring him home ""just for a weekend"". ""We took him to the sea and he was able to build sandcastles with a friend on the beach,"" the statement said. ""He stays seated in one place, and we bring him what he needs to build. He couldn't swim, of course, mainly because he still can't move around without his splints. ""He also returned at home for the first time and he was super happy to see his house and his toys again, even though he couldn't go upstairs to see his room."" The boy had been visiting London from France with his parents The parents thanked the public for their continued support and said their son's reading, breathing and singing was improving ""little by little"". ""He still spends most of his day in a wheelchair and still cannot walk on his own,"" the statement added. ""But when we give him our hand, we don't need to carry his weight anymore like before - it is mostly about helping him to find his balance. ""He can walk a few metres like that and he now also manages to climb one or two steps, always with our help."" A GoFundMe page has raised more than Â£200,000 for the boy's medical treatment Bravery, of Northolt in west London, who was diagnosed with autism from a young age, was jailed at the Old Bailey for at least 15 years. Hammersmith and Fulham Council has been carrying out a serious case review into Bravery's care as the council was responsible for the handling of it. Tate balcony teen told care workers of plan to kill Teen threw boy from Tate Modern 'to be on TV' Man jailed for throwing boy from Tate balcony In a victim impact statement in February, the boy's parents described to the court how Bravery's actions were ""unspeakable"". ""Words cannot express the horror and fear his actions have brought up on us,"" the couple said. A spokesman for Tate Modern said: ""A full security review was undertaken, as would happen after any major incident, and we continue to follow best practice guidelines to keep the public safe.""

Ellen DeGeneres Show staff fired over allegations,"Host Ellen DeGeneres has issued an apology to staff over the allegations Three top producers of the Ellen DeGeneres Show have been fired amid allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment. DeGeneres announced the overhaul in a video meeting with staff, and said an internal investigation was under way. In a message to staff she said she was ""so sorry for what this has become,"" according to the Hollywood Reporter. The departures follow investigations by journalists into claims of bullying and intimidation on set. A spokesperson for Warner Brothers confirmed the show has ""parted ways"" with executive producers Ed Glavin and Kevin Leman, and co-executive producer Jonathan Norman. In a story published earlier this year,several former employees told Buzzfeed News they had experienced racism,externalwhile working on the show, which has won over 60 Emmy Awards since it first aired in 2003. Kevin Leman (right) and Jonathan Norman have denied the claims against them, while Ed Glavin (second from left) has not publicly commented Others accused Mr Glavin of inappropriate touching, and leading with intimidation and fear. Mr Leman and Mr Norman were also accused of sexual harassment by former staff. In earlier statements to Buzzfeed News, Mr Leman denied ""any kind of sexual impropriety,"" and Mr Norman said he was ""100% categorically denying these allegations."" Mr Glavin has not publicly responded to the claims. DeGeneres initially distanced herself from the claims of a toxic work environment, saying in an email to staff that she had been ""misrepresented"" by ""people who work with me and for me"". But she apologised to staff and said she was ""glad the issues were brought to her attention"". A host of celebrities, including singer Katy Perry and comedian Kevin Hart, have spoken out in support of the chat show host. However, other stars have supported the claims made against her programme, among them Everybody Loves Raymond actor Brad Garrett. In an email to staff, David McGuire, executive vice president of programming at Warner Brothers, said the studio was ""absolutely committed"" to ""change and a new culture. ""Many of you have spoken with WarnerMedia's investigators, and we thank you for your honesty,"" he added, according to Buzzfeed News.

Alex Salmond inquiry hears from top civil servant,"Ms Evans was the first person to give evidence to the inquiry The Scottish government's harassment complaints system was not drawn up to ""get Alex Salmond"", the country's top civil servant has told an inquiry. Leslie Evans apologised for the government's handling of allegations against the former first minister. But she insisted that investigating them was ""the right thing to do"". MSPs are investigating the failure of the government's complaints handling process, which saw Mr Salmondawarded a Â£500,000 expenses payout in court. Ms Evans - who is the permanent secretary to the Scottish government - told the Scottish Parliament inquiry she wanted to ""apologise unreservedly to all concerned for this procedural failure"". Mr Salmond has previously called for the civil servant to quit, but she has been backed by the current first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. How will Holyrood's Alex Salmond inquiry work? Who is Leslie Evans? The government launched an internal investigation into harassment complaints against Mr Salmond from two female members of staff in January 2018. The allegations dated back to when he was serving as first minister. Alex Salmond walked free from court in March having been cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault and attempted rape However, Mr Salmond raised a legal challenge which led to the government admitting thatthe investigation had been unlawful. Judge Lord Pentland said it had been ""procedurally unfair"" and ""tainted with apparent bias"" because the investigating officer assigned to the case had had prior contact with the complainers. Mr Salmond was subsequently cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault at the High Court in Edinburgh in March. Ms Evans accepted that ""one part of our procedure should have been applied differently"" during the government's investigation of the first two complaints that were made against Mr Salmond. She said she would ""apologise unreservedly to all concerned for this procedural failure"". But she told the committee that ""when complaints were raised, it would have been unconscionable, and a failure in our duty of care, not to investigate those complaints"". Ms Evans has been strongly backed by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon She went on to say that lessons had been learned from the failure, but insisted that the Scottish government ""is and remains ahead of many other institutions in designing and implementing a procedure to address harassment and particularly to address historical allegations of sexual misconduct"". Ms Evans told the committee: ""The Scottish government has been on a journey of cultural change since 2015 to ensure the organisation is more open, capable and responsive. ""As permanent secretary, I have led a focus on equality, inclusion and wellbeing, including addressing bullying and harassment."" Mr Salmond's defence during his criminal trial claimed that he had been thevictim of a political conspiracy- something Ms Sturgeon has dismissed as ""a heap of nonsense"". Ms Evans was asked directly if the complaints handling procedure - signed off by Ms Sturgeon in December 2017 - had been ""engineered"" specifically to target Mr Salmond. The permanent secretary replied: ""Absolutely not"". She confirmed that one staff member who had raised a concern about Mr Salmond's behaviour had been shown a draft of the policy, but said it was ""not unusual"" for someone with ""lived experience"" to be consulted. ""I don't believe there were any changes made as a result of that,"" she added. Ms Evans was also asked about claims from civil service unions about ""bullying behaviour"" within the government in the past, replying that ""we have got a more inclusive culture than we did have"". Committee convener Linda Fabiani has clashed with Ms Evans over the disclosure of documents The Holyrood inquiry has pledged not to re-investigate any of the complaints against Mr Salmond, and will instead focus on the development of the internal government policy and the ""culture of government"". The committee, led by Deputy Presiding Officer Linda Fabiani, is examining the development of the government's harassment complaints procedure, the application of that procedure to the case of Mr Salmond, and the judicial review case. Ms Fabiani, an SNP MSP, has repeatedly clashed with the permanent secretary over documentation and written evidence being supplied by the government ahead of the hearing. She has spoken of her ""frustration and disappointment,externalat the very limited amount of information the Scottish government has chosen to disclose"" about the judicial review. Alex Salmond trial: What is the political fallout? Ms Sturgeon has insisted that the complaints handling procedure she ordered to be drawn up in the wake of the Me Too movement remained ""completely robust"" despite the ""deeply regrettable"" failure in the case of her predecessor. She has ordered an internal review of ""the specific application of this one element of the procedure"", and has also triggered an independent review to decidewhether she broke the ministerial codein her dealings with Mr Salmond.

No fines issued by police over face coverings,"Face coverings have been mandatory in NI shops since 10 August Police have not fined anyone in Northern Ireland for failing to wear a face covering. Itbecame compulsory to wear a face covering in enclosed public spaceson Monday 10 August. The Department of Health said breaches could lead to a fixed penalty notice of Â£60, reduced to Â£30 if paid within 14 days. Responsibility for enforcement has caused confusion, with police saying it would only be used as a last resort. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) previously said the primary responsibility for enforcing the wearing of face coverings would lie with shop owners. There have been no enforcement fines issued Emma McMahon, who co-owns a shop in Belfast, said it was not reasonable to expect business owners to bear the brunt of the work enforcing the legislation. ""I do think it is unfair that the responsibility is put on to the shop owners,"" she said. ""I would have to employ another person at the front door to police this on a very local basis and I simply can't afford to do that. Emma McMahon co-owns a shop with artist Stephen Farnan ""We're finding that the vast majority of customers are following the rules and wearing masks and there's only maybe one or two people a day that aren't wearing masks. ""Whenever a customer has come in without a face covering, I haven't confronted them because I don't feel comfortable enough to do so, in case there's a medical reason behind that. ""We are really dependent on the goodwill and trust that people will wear their masks and certainly customers have as much responsibility as owners to help us all get through this."" Ahead of the rules coming into effect, the PSNI said: ""Where necessary, officers will continue to engage, explain and encourage people to make the right choices and this includes the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport, in shops and other public enclosed spaces. ""The primary responsibility for ensuring compliance lies with transport operators and businesses but where police become involved, we will do so on the basis of the four 'Es' and only use enforcement as a last resort, when all other approaches have been unsuccessful."" Glyn Roberts from Retail NI said he was not surprised no fines had been issused Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, said the scope of the legislation meant it would be difficult to enforce. ""It's not surprising there haven't been any fines in the first week,"" he said. ""I think it's going to be a very difficult situation to police and first and foremost, it is up to the individual shopper to obey the law. ""The police can't be everywhere and indeed it's very clear retailers and their staff are not required to enforce this, so it is very much up to the individual shopper to play their part in this. ""I think the big challenge is complacency and everyone has to do their bit to ensure that we avoid a second wave or any further significant increases in transmissions."" TheNI Direct webpage,externalcarries advice for people who are indoors in circumstances where it is not possible to wear a face covering, for example, where they are eating or drinking in a restaurant, pub or cafÃ©, or are exercising in a gym. In these circumstances, it said it was acceptable not to use a face covering, but you should replace it as soon as practicable afterwards and maintain social distancing of at least 2m if you are in an enclosed space undertaking physical exercise. Other circumstances where it may be difficult for some people to wear face coverings, include: Physical illness; Where it is distressing for someone to cover their face; Where someone is accompanying a person who relies on lip reading to communicate; The reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. There is no need to get a letter from a doctor or government to show that you do not need to wear a face covering. If you have a condition which means you cannot wear a face covering you only need to say, if asked, that you cannot wear a face covering because you are exempt.

'Hot labs' in hospitals for faster Covid testingThree regional Welsh laboratories will also work 24/7 as part of improving coronavirus test times.Wales,"Up to 160 staff will be recruited for the labs Six new ""hot labs"" with rapid testing equipment will be created in hospitals as part of a drive to improve coronavirus test processing times. Three regional laboratories will also become 24/7 operations, with the Welsh Government spending up to Â£32m, including on extra staff. The latest weekly data showed 56% of tests processed in NHS Wales labs came back within a day. Fast turnaround of tests is seen as key to a successful contact tracing system. The money will pay for extra staff and equipment to enable Public Health Wales laboratories at University Hospital Wales, Cardiff, Singleton Hospital, Swansea and Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Rhyl, to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week from October. Coronavirus test times under the microscope Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales What is it like to be contact traced? The six ""hot labs"" with fast testing equipment will be created at Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli, Morriston Hospital, Swansea, Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil, University Hospital in Llandough and Grange Hospital, Cwmbran. The labs are seen as a key part of testing and tracing The Welsh Government said they will begin operating in November from 08:00 to 22:00 GMT, seven days a week. Dr Tracey Cooper, chief executive of Public Health Wales, said it will recruit up to 160 staff into the new roles. The government said the initial outlay on staffing and new equipment is expected to be nearly Â£8m and the cost of carrying out tests is expected to vary between Â£8m and Â£24m depending on demand. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""This investment will ensure we have the laboratory capacity in Wales to deliver our Test, Trace, Protect strategy to keep coronavirus under control, and be ready for the winter. ""I hope we don't need to use all the testing capacity this investment will create but we have to be prepared."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies welcomed the new capacity, but warned: ""We need to be sure that this additional resource will make a real difference."" by Paul Martin, BBC Wales political correspondent For weeks data has been showing that many tests processed in Welsh labs are not hitting the 24 hour target. And for weeks ministers have been saying they want to see improvement. Now we see the potential price tag: Â£32m This isn't a bit of tinkering here and there to increase the number of courier deliveries or ensure that samples arrive at regular, manageable intervals. It's a significant investment in recruitment and machinery to increase the capacity of NHS Wales laboratories. The specialist pan-UK ""Lighthouse Labs"", which operate 24 hours a day, have shown just how quickly tests can be turned around. The hope in government will be that this investment achieves something similar, so that the Test, Trace Protect system stands a good chance of working if coronavirus makes its feared winter comeback.

Black Met inspector 'racially harassed' by PCsA serving inspector has formally complained of racial profiling to the Met after being stopped.London,"Insp Charles Ehikioya has served with the Met for more than two decades A black police inspector is suing the Met Police for racial harassment after being stopped in his car by two white officers. Insp Charles Ehikioya recorded the incident in which he said officers stopped him without justification as he drove home from work in south London. He told the BBC it showed an ""abuse of power"" and he was speaking out in solidarity with the black community. The Met said it found no evidence of misconduct. The 55-year-old had been driving home after his shift on 23 May when he was followed for two miles by officers and stopped in Croydon, according to his complaint. As one officer approached, Insp Ehikioya said he noticed he had not switched on his body-worn camera and for that reason he refused to leave his car. He said he then started to record the incident for protection, at which point the officer turned on his bodycam. In the recording, shared with BBC News, the officer said Insp Ehikioya was being stopped for driving at speed and it ""looked like he had gone through a red light"". Insp Charles Ehikioya said he was driving home from work in his red Toyota iQ when he was stopped The officer said he needed to see Insp Ehikioya's driving licence and proof he was insured to drive the car, that the vehicle had not been stolen, and to check he was not drunk or had been using his phone. He claimed Insp Ehikioya's driving was ""unusual"", which he strongly disputed, according to the recording. Insp Ehikioya was then accused of being obstructive and the officer said his own behaviour had been perfectly reasonable, it can be heard. ""These were alleged offences that could have ended my whole career,"" said Mr Ehikioya, who has worked for the Met Police for more than 22 years. In his formal complaint, Insp Ehikioya wrote: ""The officers did not believe or did not care that I was an officer, because I am black. ""They are both clearly racist police officers pretending to be polite whilst falsely accusing me without any evidence whatsoever of having committed serious criminal and road traffic act offences."" After Insp Ehikioya informed them he was a serving police officer and later showed them his police ID, both officers left the scene. The Met said Insp Ehikioya was not arrested, charged or cautioned for any offence in relation to the stop. ""I believed I was racially profiled and received no apology,"" Insp Ehikioya added. ""I have kids and a grandson, I would not want them treated like this."" Asked why he had chosen to take legal action against the Met, Insp Ehikioya said he was ""not prepared to sit quietly and be silenced"". ""In my view it's not the whole organisation that's like that, it's only a few individuals that are causing this issue. ""I have no choice but to react in the way I'm reacting to bring it to the attention... Actions speak louder than words,"" he said. The Met has come under increasing scrutiny since the wave of Black Lives Matter protests in the UK after the death of African-American George Floyd. Last week, theLabour MP Dawn Butler called for a ""system change""after she and a black male friend were stopped and pulled over in east London by two police cars. In July, theBritish sprinter Bianca Williams received an apology from the Met Policeafter she and her partner were pulled over in their car for a stop-and-search in west London. This video can not be played Footage of the stop of Bianca Williams was shared widely on Twitter Lawrence Davies, of Equal Justice Solicitors who is representing Insp Ehikioya, said the incident showed the ""extent of the current racism in the Metropolitan Police"". ""The conduct of a few embarrasses the vast majority of officers who are not racist but who, as a consequence of that conduct, have to work with very distrusting BAME communities,"" he said. The Met confirmed it had received an internal complaint from a driver who alleged they were stopped as a result of racial profiling and said an investigation was undertaken by the Professional Standards Unit. In a statement, the Met said the vehicle was followed by officers through suspicion of excessive speed at a traffic signal and onward. No action was taken against the man stopped and, after reviewing body-worn footage, no evidence of misconduct was found, it said. The statement added: ""Any allegation, whether external or internal, made concerning the conduct of our staff is taken extremely seriously. ""Where the conduct of staff is proven to have fallen below the standards of behaviour expected, we will take robust action to ensure that staff are appropriately disciplined and that lessons are learnt from each case.""

Top civil servant to face Holyrood-Salmond inquiry,"Ms Evans was the first person to give evidence to the inquiry The Scottish government's harassment complaints system was not drawn up to ""get Alex Salmond"", the country's top civil servant has told an inquiry. Leslie Evans apologised for the government's handling of allegations against the former first minister. But she insisted that investigating them was ""the right thing to do"". MSPs are investigating the failure of the government's complaints handling process, which saw Mr Salmondawarded a Â£500,000 expenses payout in court. Ms Evans - who is the permanent secretary to the Scottish government - told the Scottish Parliament inquiry she wanted to ""apologise unreservedly to all concerned for this procedural failure"". Mr Salmond has previously called for the civil servant to quit, but she has been backed by the current first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. How will Holyrood's Alex Salmond inquiry work? Who is Leslie Evans? The government launched an internal investigation into harassment complaints against Mr Salmond from two female members of staff in January 2018. The allegations dated back to when he was serving as first minister. Alex Salmond walked free from court in March having been cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault and attempted rape However, Mr Salmond raised a legal challenge which led to the government admitting thatthe investigation had been unlawful. Judge Lord Pentland said it had been ""procedurally unfair"" and ""tainted with apparent bias"" because the investigating officer assigned to the case had had prior contact with the complainers. Mr Salmond was subsequently cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault at the High Court in Edinburgh in March. Ms Evans accepted that ""one part of our procedure should have been applied differently"" during the government's investigation of the first two complaints that were made against Mr Salmond. She said she would ""apologise unreservedly to all concerned for this procedural failure"". But she told the committee that ""when complaints were raised, it would have been unconscionable, and a failure in our duty of care, not to investigate those complaints"". Ms Evans has been strongly backed by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon She went on to say that lessons had been learned from the failure, but insisted that the Scottish government ""is and remains ahead of many other institutions in designing and implementing a procedure to address harassment and particularly to address historical allegations of sexual misconduct"". Ms Evans told the committee: ""The Scottish government has been on a journey of cultural change since 2015 to ensure the organisation is more open, capable and responsive. ""As permanent secretary, I have led a focus on equality, inclusion and wellbeing, including addressing bullying and harassment."" Mr Salmond's defence during his criminal trial claimed that he had been thevictim of a political conspiracy- something Ms Sturgeon has dismissed as ""a heap of nonsense"". Ms Evans was asked directly if the complaints handling procedure - signed off by Ms Sturgeon in December 2017 - had been ""engineered"" specifically to target Mr Salmond. The permanent secretary replied: ""Absolutely not"". She confirmed that one staff member who had raised a concern about Mr Salmond's behaviour had been shown a draft of the policy, but said it was ""not unusual"" for someone with ""lived experience"" to be consulted. ""I don't believe there were any changes made as a result of that,"" she added. Ms Evans was also asked about claims from civil service unions about ""bullying behaviour"" within the government in the past, replying that ""we have got a more inclusive culture than we did have"". Committee convener Linda Fabiani has clashed with Ms Evans over the disclosure of documents The Holyrood inquiry has pledged not to re-investigate any of the complaints against Mr Salmond, and will instead focus on the development of the internal government policy and the ""culture of government"". The committee, led by Deputy Presiding Officer Linda Fabiani, is examining the development of the government's harassment complaints procedure, the application of that procedure to the case of Mr Salmond, and the judicial review case. Ms Fabiani, an SNP MSP, has repeatedly clashed with the permanent secretary over documentation and written evidence being supplied by the government ahead of the hearing. She has spoken of her ""frustration and disappointment,externalat the very limited amount of information the Scottish government has chosen to disclose"" about the judicial review. Alex Salmond trial: What is the political fallout? Ms Sturgeon has insisted that the complaints handling procedure she ordered to be drawn up in the wake of the Me Too movement remained ""completely robust"" despite the ""deeply regrettable"" failure in the case of her predecessor. She has ordered an internal review of ""the specific application of this one element of the procedure"", and has also triggered an independent review to decidewhether she broke the ministerial codein her dealings with Mr Salmond.

The Welsh Government announced a U-turn on Monday and said those and GCSE results estimated by teachers would now be used, rather than those produced by an algorithm. There had been outrage after 42% of A-level grades in Wales were downgraded because of the system. For some students, the change means future plans are no longer in tatters. Universities said they were ""working hard to place applicants on the course of their choice"". Maia Gould is now hopeful she can pursue a career in medicine Maia Gould, from Llangorse, near Brecon, was devastated to learn her dreams of a career in medicine were in jeopardy after being awarded A*,B,C and D instead of her predicted A*, A, A, B. She said the announcement over centre-assessed grades was ""an absolute triumph for all Welsh students"". Teacher estimates to be used for Welsh exam grades How will unis cope with extra students? And other questions How did the A-level algorithm work? The Crickhowell High School student, who plans to study medicine at Liverpool University, said: ""I burst out crying straight away. I don't think I've ever been so happy in my life. ""Not just for me, but for everyone. These A-levels are for life, they are the most important things to get you on your next steps from school to university."" But she added she might have some difficult decisions to make, as the universities had filled so many places. ""Fingers crossed it's a place in Liverpool, either this year if they can fit me in or next year if I have to defer, or a place this year at Southampton University, also for medicine,"" Ms Gould said. ""As soon as I heard the news I was on the phone to Liverpool, speaking to them about the next steps. ""It's still going to be a struggle for all the universities to try to get all the places, fit all the students in."" But, for now, she can celebrate getting the results she deserves. ""I don't know if I've ever been so stressed in my life. Opening the results... then finding out it wasn't what I wanted. ""It's not something anyone wants to go through. I am so, so relieved,"" she added. Riley Mann said it seems he can now go to the university of his choice Riley Mann, from Cardiff, had been predicted A*, A, A but got B, B, C. His dreams of studying physics at Bristol University seemed over, but things are now looking hopeful. ""I'm feeling much better than I was on Thursday, I can tell you that,"" he said. ""It's looking like everything's heading in the right direction and I will be going to the uni that I want to go to and the uni I deserve to go to."" His sister, Laani Mann, was ""heartbroken"" for her brother when he received his first set of grades. After that she became nervous for herself and her GCSE results which are due on Thursday. She was worried if she did not get good grades at GCSE top universities would rule her out for a medicine degree. Laani Mann was ""heartbroken"" for brother Riley when he was given his first set of grades When she heard about the U-turn she was relieved for Riley - and herself. ""It was a huge relief when I knew they were still on the table, as long as they go through with the teacher's predictive grades,"" Laani said. ""Going into A-levels, as long as I keep my head down, those top universities will still be an option for me."" She said she has been predicted ""one A*, a few As, a few Bs and two Cs"". ""It's been such a surreal year, and I feel like the last few days have just been all over the place,"" she said. Universities Wales, which represents institutions in Wales, advised students to discuss their options with universities. ""Every effort will be made by universities to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by this year's processes,"" it said in a statement. ""Universities admissions teams have been working hard to place applicants on the course of their choice, and they will look at the circumstances of each applicant who has had their results improved as a result of today's announcement, to ensure that wherever possible they can start a course this term. ""Our advice to students would be to contact their first-choice university who will be happy to discuss their options. They also have the choice of applying to courses through clearing, which has been enhanced to provide more tailored options than ever before."" Courteney Sheppard, from the further education admissions service Ucas, said it had been ""an interesting"" period. He said this time of year was ""always an emotional time for people taking the next step for their future."" Universities would be ""as flexible as possible"", he said. ""This is an unprecedented situation."" ""I think what we might find is there will be some courses which will be more constrained by particular physical elements, there could be particular lab space or spaces where students need to do any performances or things like that. ""Those are the courses where they will likely feel they have got less spaces on them."" Mr Sheppard said universities would also need to contend with things like accommodation arrangements. ""We need to navigate through a changing situation and understand what is in the best interest of all students, for those whose grades have changed, but also those who have secured their place,"" he said. Cardiff University said it would honour places for students with revised grades, who selected the university as their firm or insurance choice, if the required grades are awarded by certain deadlines. Students protested outside the Senedd at the weekend to call for the change Exams were cancelled across the UK after schools shut in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Last week's results in Wales were produced by a system known as standardisation - designed to ensure grades were ""as fair as possible"" and consistent with previous years. Teachers had estimated grades but they were then processed by an algorithm. The system was criticised by students and politicians for producing unfair grades for individual students after 42% of grades were lower than teacher assessments. The U-turn also affects AS-levels, skills challenge certificates and the Welsh Baccalaureate. But students who received higher grades than those predicted by teachers will keep them. GCSE results in Wales are due to be published on Thursday. This video can not be played Exams had been scrapped because of the coronavirus lockdown Despite the U-turn, on Monday Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford defended the original process. In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Drakeford said the original process, was ""fairer"" than that used elsewhere in the UK, and was ""more based on evidence"". But he said the decision to award estimated grades instead was taken because ""we heard early in the day that things were moving elsewhere"" in the United Kingdom. ""We were determined that we would have a level playing field where our young people were not disadvantaged,"" he said. Students in England and Northern Ireland will also have their results based on teacher estimates, in decisions taken on Monday.

Boy thrown from Tate Modern balcony 'goes home',"The six-year-old boy taken by air ambulance to Royal London Hospital A boy who suffered catastrophic injuries when he was thrown from the balcony of the Tate Modern has been able to visit home, his family said. Last August the boy, aged six at the time and visiting London from France with his family, fell 100ft (30m) and suffered life-changing injuries. Now, the boy's family says he is ""happy to see his toys again"". Jonty Bravery, 18, who threw the boy from the balcony, was convicted of his attempted murder and jailed, in June. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spent time at Royal London Hospital before moving to a hospital in France. This video can not be played Audio recording of Jonty Bravery telling carers in autumn 2018 about his plan to commit murder During Bravery's sentencing, the court was told the boy would require round-the-clock care until at least 2022. His injuries included a bleed to the brain and fractures to his spine and he has been left needing the use of a wheelchair. An update posted on a GoFundMe site, which has raised almost Â£250,000 for the boy's medical care, said his parents were able to bring him home ""just for a weekend"". ""We took him to the sea and he was able to build sandcastles with a friend on the beach,"" the statement said. ""He stays seated in one place, and we bring him what he needs to build. He couldn't swim, of course, mainly because he still can't move around without his splints. ""He also returned at home for the first time and he was super happy to see his house and his toys again, even though he couldn't go upstairs to see his room."" The boy had been visiting London from France with his parents The parents thanked the public for their continued support and said their son's reading, breathing and singing was improving ""little by little"". ""He still spends most of his day in a wheelchair and still cannot walk on his own,"" the statement added. ""But when we give him our hand, we don't need to carry his weight anymore like before - it is mostly about helping him to find his balance. ""He can walk a few metres like that and he now also manages to climb one or two steps, always with our help."" A GoFundMe page has raised more than Â£200,000 for the boy's medical treatment Bravery, of Northolt in west London, who was diagnosed with autism from a young age, was jailed at the Old Bailey for at least 15 years. Hammersmith and Fulham Council has been carrying out a serious case review into Bravery's care as the council was responsible for the handling of it. Tate balcony teen told care workers of plan to kill Teen threw boy from Tate Modern 'to be on TV' Man jailed for throwing boy from Tate balcony In a victim impact statement in February, the boy's parents described to the court how Bravery's actions were ""unspeakable"". ""Words cannot express the horror and fear his actions have brought up on us,"" the couple said. A spokesman for Tate Modern said: ""A full security review was undertaken, as would happen after any major incident, and we continue to follow best practice guidelines to keep the public safe.""

Exam board chief 'disappointed' by grades U-turn,"Students gathered outside the Senedd last weekend to protest against the grading system Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams has apologised ""directly and unreservedly"" for the way A-level results were handled last week. There was outrage after42% of A-level grades in Waleswere downgraded. On Monday ministersabandoned the systemused to calculate the results, awarding assessments made by teachers instead. Ms Williams said she was ""truly sorry"" for a process that made a stressful time ""worse"" for some students. The minister made the apology in asocial media video,external, and in evidence to a Senedd committee, a day after the U-turn. ""For our young people, and indeed everyone in Wales, the last few months have been and continue to be a stressful time,"" she said. ""It has been a time of anguish for people right across the country. ""I am sorry that, for some of our young people, the results process has made that worse."" Allow Twitter content?

""Recent months have thrown up unexpected, new and complex challenges,"" she said. ""Working with Qualifications Wales and the WJEC we looked for an approach which provided fairness and balanced out differences in the standards applied to judgments in schools. ""But, as I announced yesterday, and given decisions elsewhere, the balance of fairness now lies with awarding centre assessment grades to students."" Student tells schools minister: 'You've ruined my life' Teacher estimates to be used for Welsh exam grades How will unis cope with extra students? And other questions The apology marks a change in tone from the First Minister Mark Drakeford, who said on Monday he was ""sorry for those young people who've had to live through such an uncertain period"", but defended the system that had been used. Some of his comments after the U-turn were dubbed ""pretty shocking"" by Blaenau Gwent Labour AM Alun Davies, in atweet,external. Ms Williams' apology was the second that day from a Welsh Government minster, after Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was sorry for any anxiety and stress caused. UK government Education Minister Gavin Williamson has apologised for exam""distress"" in England, where ministers have also moved to grades estimated by teachers. Similar decisions were taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland. A-levels results were published on Thursday As well as A-levels, teacher assessed grades will be used for GCSEs, AS-levels, skills challenge certificates and the Welsh Baccalaureate. Last week's results in Wales were produced by a system known as standardisation - designed to ensure grades were ""as fair as possible"" and consistent with previous years. But it was criticised by students and politicians for producing unfair grades for individual students. GCSE results are to be published on Thursday. The Liberal Democrat education minister told the Senedd's education committee that she was not informed of the scale of the impact of using the algorithm to moderate A-level results until 10 August, three days before the results were due to be announced. She said she had been told on that day that 42% of grades would be depressed. ""I was given those results on the 10th of August, and we were concerned,"" she said. Ms Williams said the Welsh Government was ""particularly concerned"" about whether there might be a ""disproportionate effect"" on pupils receiving free school meals and had asked for more data. She said the WJEC supplied that information to Qualifications Wales the following evening, and it was given to her the morning after that - Wednesday - the day before the results came out. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford defended the A-level results system after the U-turn on Monday Lynne Neagle, chairwoman of the Senedd education select committee, thanked Ms Williams for her apology but said her colleagues ""need to know what the Welsh Government is doing to make sure this does not happen again"". She added: ""No one can predict if or when we may see another lockdown like this one, so we must learn from these experiences and avoid the confusing, confidence-sapping decisions we have seen over the last few weeks."" Later, in an interview with BBC Wales, Ms Williams insisted the new results would ""absolutely"" be credible, and ""young people should not feel that they aren't"". But she said the original system had been robust ""there or thereabouts"", with 95% of students having received either a grade at the level their teacher predicted or within one grade of that. Ms Williams' earlier comments followed calls for a ""full and proper apology to the young people of Wales"" from Plaid Cymru. It also came after a long day of evidence at the Senedd committee from officials involved in the process, where the chief executive of the Welsh examinations board, the WJEC, defended the algorithm used for A-level results. Ian Morgan said that system would have meant grades A* to E would have been up by 1% from last year and A* to A would have risen by 2.9%, with A* up 0.1% on 2019, with 1.7% of candidates reaching that level. He said the decision to use teachers' estimates instead meant 99.9% of candidates achieving grades A* to E. There was now a 13.4% increase in candidates getting A* to A, meaning 40.4% reaching that standard. Earlier on BBC Radio Wales Mr Morgan said that to ""some extent"" he was probably disappointed with the U-turn. ""I think there's a huge amount of rigour that's gone into the standardisation process,"" he said. ""I'm not here to try and question the effort teachers have put in, these were a complex set of circumstances and teachers have worked diligently."" Mr Morgan acknowledged there were ""imperfections"" with some students not receiving the correct grades - but said these would have been weeded out during the appeals process. Jo Richards, regulation director of Qualifications Wales, acknowledged a delay to BTEC results. She said students students should expect their results by the end of Tuesday. ""We've had notification of that from Pearson and we are working with them and are asking for regular updates, they are working through that data,"" she said. Meanwhile, teaching union NASUWT said ""urgent lessons"" need to be learned. General Secretary Dr Patrick Roach said: ""The problems that have been left to unfold over recent days have impacted not only on those young people who were receiving their awards this year, but also the confidence of the thousands of pupils who are now preparing for examinations next year.""

How will unis cope with extra students? And other questions,"A-level and GCSE students in England will be given grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm, after a government U-turn. Experts Eddie Playfair and Catherine Sezen, senior policy managers at theAssociation of Colleges,,externalare answering your questions. Williamson 'incredibly sorry' for exam distress U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs as teacher grades used How have exam results been decided this year? Catherine Sezen and Eddie Playfair offer personalised advice on what to do next Now that we know that the grades predicted by teachers - also known as centre assessment grades, or CAGs for short - will stand, this means that there will be a five-point increase in A* grades and a 10-point increase in A grades or above. University courses may well be able to manage the increased demand for high tariff courses, particularly if there is a relaxation of the cap on growth - called the student number controls. Health Secretary Matthew Hancock has saidthe government is also considering lifting the cap on medical places. I'm so sorry you missed your firm offer. First of all it may be worth revisiting this with Durham in case the position has changed. Universities are working hard to honour the offers they've made, whether UK or international, and Covid-19 has disrupted education for students across the world. UK and international applicants are not really competing for the same places though, as the admissions and funding systems are different. For example, the removal of Student Number Controls means that many universities could now offer more places to their UK students, and this does not apply to international students. I'm afraid the triple lock system has been overtaken by events and your son's D will stand, since it is higher than the CAG. There may be some grounds for an appeal and it's worth discussing this with his college or school. There's no reason to expect that this year's higher-than-usual grades will impact the opportunities for next year's students. Universities will be aware of the different grade profiles in different years and are likely to adjust their offers and decision-making accordingly. If your daughter's offer has been confirmed this shouldn't be withdrawn. Students may have some opportunity to change their minds but confirmed offers should stand. The government's announcement thatit is considering lifting the cap on the number of medical student placesmay also help. As far we are aware, students awaiting their GCSE grades on Thursday will receive their CAG from their school or college - and students who received their A or AS-level results last Thursday will be reissued their CAG. If students' calculated grades were higher than the CAG, their calculated grade will stand. If you received results last Thursday, the best thing to do is to contact your school or college. If you are expecting results this week, your school or college should confirm the process. Schools and colleges have very thorough quality assurance systems in place to ensure that results are not biased. The grades given by teachers are moderated at department and centre level to ensure that they are as fair as possible. Pupils protesting outside Education Secretary Gavin Williamson's constituency office BTecs are structured very differently to A-levels, and so the approach to awarding them is also different. BTecs were not subject to the same statistical moderation process as A-levels. They comprise modular units that students complete and are assessed at regular stages during their course of study, so prior to March 2020, students had already ""banked"" graded units for their qualification. These formed part of the evidence used to award grades for the externally assessed units and the final overall qualification grade. If you have individual concerns about BTec or other technical and vocational qualifications, the best thing to do is to contact your school or college. Universities are used to dealing with fluctuations in numbers between years but at this stage it's impossible to tell whether the number of university places in 2021 will be affected at all. Students taking exams next summer will certainly have been impacted by the disruption this year - and of course further disruption can't be ruled out. There have been some adaptations made to assessment and content for 2021 but the assumption is that public exams will go ahead next summer - the public health situation permitting. If exams take place next year, the grading system should be more like a normal year, but there will be a case for some ""leniency"" to allow for disruption. You are absolutely right - this summer's Centre Assessed Grades are separate from the predicted grades used for UCAS or other purposes and they may not be the same. The process for producing CAGs was careful and rigorous, and was subjected to internal moderation. It is these CAGs and rankings which were submitted to awarding organisations as part of this summer's process. The ""calculated"" grades which were issued last week had been statistically adjusted resulting in 39% of them being downgraded. These have now mostly been superseded by the original CAGs where they are higher. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster - but no one will have lower A-level grades than they got last week and many will have higher grades. If your son has accepted this place and is happy with it he doesn't need to do anything more except perhaps confirm that decision with the university concerned. We can't give a legal opinion on that, but universities are doing their best to honour all the offers they made - including where a student's grade has now changed. They will need a few days to sort this out but they will have been helped by the lifting of student number controls which would have limited how many places they could fill. As far as we know, the autumn series is still going ahead so students will have the opportunity to take exams this autumn as well as next summer - so the ""resit"" option is still available where it makes sense. These are questions which should be raised directly with the IB Organisation. We know that Ofqual has asked it to scrutinise the grades awarded this summer to ensure they have been delivered in line with Ofqual's new process. I'm sure that receiving universities will want to be as flexible and helpful in responding to candidates with IB Diplomas as they were with A-level candidates. We gather that there have been some delays with some BTec awards and we know that Pearson - the company which runs BTecs - is working to resolve this. We think that only 0.5% of BTec centre assessed grades were adjusted downwards and it's not clear whether they will now be moved up. Will BTec students have their grades changed? Ofqual has just published an update on vocational and technical qualifications. Although calculated results have been issued for many vocational and technical qualifications, in only a very few cases has the same kind of statistical standardisation process of CAGs been used and so Monday's announcement shouldn't impact on the majority of vocational qualifications. You can findmore information on the Ofqual website.,externalIf you still have any questions about your result I would suggest that you speak to your school or college. It's possible that more students with Scottish Highers might have a small impact on places available in English universities, but the difference in scale between the two countries probably means this will not be significant overall. I am sure universities will want to honour the offers they've made. This was the year of the results without any exams being taken It's been clear from the start that unfortunately some private candidates would not be able to receive CAGs, and this is obviously far from ideal. It may be possible for them to progress on to the course they want if they can be assessed by the institution they wish to join. There is also the option of taking exams in the autumn which will result in grades which can be used for progression. You will need to discuss this with both your firm and insurance universities as soon as possible, now that you know that your CAG will be your final grade. Now that your son knows what his final grade is, he should discuss this with both his first choice university and also with the university he applied to through clearing. Calculated grades were higher than CAGs for 2.3% of all entries, and these will be honoured. Yes, it is possible to accept an offer and take the exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you on the best option. If your son or daughter is 18 then the college cannot share information with you unless your child agrees, as they are now classified as an adult. They should be able to tell you how results will be sent out, or whether your son or daughter can collect them from the college. The college will be able to provide information, advice and guidance to your son or daughter to help them think about next steps. This might help as the basis of a chat with your child. The best thing to do is to ask the university how long they will keep the place open while you weigh up the options. Universities are being very flexible this year. The alternative offer from your firm choice, including a foundation year, is of course an extra year. If you really want to go to that university it is a good option, but the other university course may also be right for you. Give the university a call and then you will know how long you have got to consider both. Your daughter might get results if the school or college that was going to enter her had sufficient evidence (course work for example) to give her a centre assessed grade. If not there will be an opportunity for your daughter to take an exam in the autumn. The school or college will have more details about that. You need to discuss this with the college or school you attended in 2019-20 to consider the various options open to you. Simply repeating a year is not generally recommended unless there are exceptional circumstances - but of course 2020 has been pretty exceptional! If you have the possibility of progressing to a higher level - for example university - that might be the best option, but don't make any final decisions without getting support and advice from your college or school first. When producing CAGs, centres will have predicted how a student would have performed assuming they had received all the additional support and access arrangements which they require because of a disability. Hopefully, any mock processes would also have included that additional support and this is definitely worth discussing with your centre. The system this year was designed to make sure that the class of 2020 was not disadvantaged, and to produce outcomes which are broadly similar to previous years. So we expect the national grade profile to reflect this. This should provide reassurance for employers, universities and colleges that this year's grades have an equivalent value to those of previous years. How can I find a new job? The autumn exams are an opportunity for students entered this summer to take an exam. The grade they are awarded will have equal value and so this can inform any applications they are making to university in 2021. The current plan is for exams next summer to go ahead as normal, with a few alterations, and they should be seen as equivalent to any other year. In the future this is certainly worth exploring, but given the timeframe this year it would have been very difficult to ensure that all students would have been adequately prepared to undertake exams online. Not all students will have had appropriate equipment or spaces to undertake exams. Do you have a question about your exam results? Use the form to send it to us.

Verdict due over assassination of Lebanon ex-PMFour men have been tried in absentia over the killing of Rafik Hariri in a 2005 bomb attack.Middle East,"The blast near Beirut's seafront killed Hariri and 21 other people A UN-backed court has found a member of the militant group Hezbollah guilty of involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri. Judges at the Netherlands-based Special Tribunal for Lebanon said Salim Ayyash had a central role in the bomb attack in Beirut in 2005 that killed Hariri. They acquitted three other defendants, who like Ayyash were tried in absentia. Hezbollah denied any involvement, and the judges said no evidence implicated the Shia militant group's leaders. Hariri's son Saad, who is himself a former prime minister, told reporters outside the court: ""I think today everybody's expectation was much higher than what came out, but I believe the tribunal came out with a verdict that is satisfying and we accept it."" Rafik Hariri's son Saad said the family would ""not rest until the punishment is carried out"" Now, he said, it was time for Hezbollah to ""make sacrifices"". ""It is clear that the network responsible is from its ranks,"" he added. ""We will not rest until the punishment is carried out."" The verdict comes at a time of crisis in Lebanon, with the country still reeling from a devastating explosion at Beirut's port two weeks ago that killed at least 180 people. The blast led to the resignation of the government, already embattled by protests over an economic collapse that has seen many people lose their savings and jobs. The tribunal's verdicts will disappoint supporters of Rafik Hariri as well the families of the 21 others who were killed and the 226 who were wounded, many grievously. The man convicted in his absence, Salim Ayyash, was a well-connected, mid-level operative in Hezbollah, the most powerful military and political group in Lebanon. It is classified by the UK, the US and others as a terrorist organisation. Hezbollah's leader, Hasan Nasrallah, has denied it was involved and refused to allow the arrest of Ayyash or the other men who have been cleared. One of his top military commanders, Mustafa Badreddine, was also indicted until he was killed in Syria in 2016. The verdict has nevertheless given Rafik Hariri's son Saad, a former prime minister who might get the job again, a lever to use against Hezbollah. The Hariri camp, and others, believe Ayyash was acting under orders, from Hassan Nasrallah and most likely from Hezbollah's backers, Syria and Iran. Rafik Hariri was seen as a threat to their power in Lebanon. One of the judges, David Re, said the court had found motive but not evidence. Even so, the conviction of a Hezbollah man will feed into the fevered political atmosphere in Lebanon. Rafik Hariri, a Sunni, was a billionaire businessman who served as prime minister of Lebanon five times following the 1975-90 civil war. His last term in office ended in 2004, after which he aligned himself with the opposition in parliament and backed calls for Syria to withdraw its forces, which had been in Lebanon since 1976. Hariri, a billionaire businessman, had urged Syria to leave Lebanon On the morning of 14 February 2005, Hariri was travelling in a motorcade past the St George Hotel in downtown Beirut when a bomb hidden in a van exploded. The blast created a crater at least 10m (32ft) wide and 2m deep in the street, and left nearby vehicles smouldering and shopfronts blown out and blackened. Who were the accused at Rafik Hariri tribunal? The killing brought tens of thousands of demonstrators onto the streets in protest against the pro-Syrian government, with the finger of blame for the assassination pointed at Lebanon's heavily influential neighbour. The government resigned two weeks later and Syrian troops pulled out that April. The killing of Hariri triggered huge anti-government protests in Beirut After collecting evidence, the UN and Lebanon set up the STL in 2007 to investigate the bombing, and four suspects were ultimately put on trial in absentia. The prosecution's case relied on the analysis of calls between mobile phones that it said were used to plan, prepare and execute the attack. A Lebanese investigator who started the trawl of the phone data and made crucial early breakthroughs, Wissam Eid, was assassinated in Beirut in 2008. They found Ayyash, 56, guilty of five charges, including conspiracy aimed at committing a terrorist act, committing a terrorist act by means of an explosive device, and the intentional murder of Hariri with premeditation by using explosive materials. The whereabouts of Salim Ayyash remains unknown STL prosecutors alleged that Ayyash co-ordinated the physical perpetration of the attack and, together with Mustafa Badreddine, the surveillance of Hariri. Ayyash was also accused of purchasing the van that exploded, and of having played a role in preparing what prosecutors said was a false claim of responsibility made by a Palestinian man on behalf of a fictional Sunni fundamentalist group. Ayyash's court-appointed defence lawyers said the prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence that did not prove his involvement in the conspiracy. But Judge David Re told the court on Tuesday: ""Mr Ayyash had a central role in the execution of the attack and directly contributed to it. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah rejected the trial as a plot ""Mr Ayyash intended to kill Mr Hariri and had the required knowledge about the circumstances of the assassination mission, including that explosives were the means to be used."" The judge said there was not enough evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the other defendants - Assad Sabra, 43, Hussein Oneissi, 46, and Hassan Habib Merhi, 54. The panel also concluded that while Syria and Hezbollah ""may have had motives to eliminate"" Hariri and some of his political allies, there was ""no evidence that the Hezbollah leadership had any involvement in Hariri's murder and there is no direct evidence of Syrian involvement"", according to Judge Re.

"Breaking|Breaking newsM&S to cut 7,000 jobs over next three monthsThe High Street retailer says the coronavirus pandemic has meant a ""material shift in trade"".Business","Marks & Spencer is cutting 7,000 jobs over the next three months across its stores and management. It said the coronavirus pandemic had made it clear there had been a ""material shift in trade"". In-store sales of clothing and home goods were ""well below"" 2019, although online and home deliveries were strong. M&S said it hoped a ""significant proportion"" of the cuts - about a tenth of its workforce - will be voluntary redundancy and early retirement. In a statement,external, M&S said it was ""too early to predict with precision where a new post-Covid sales mix will settle. We must now act to reflect this change"". But the retailer said operating during the pandemic had showed it could work ""more flexibly and productively"", with more staff multi-tasking and moving between food, clothing and home departments. M&S said total sales in its hard-hit clothing and home arm plunged 29.9% in the eight weeks since shops reopened, with store sales tumbling 47.9% and online surging 39.2%. At the height of lockdown, M&S boss Steve Rowe said customers might ""never shop the same way again"" after the coronavirus crisis. And last month the retailer announced 950 store management and head office jobs were at risk because it needed to accelerate its restructuring. Shopping may never be the same again, says M&S M&S extends 30-minute home delivery service John Lewis and Boots to cut 5,300 jobs WH Smith may cut 1,500 jobs after sales plummet Alongside Tuesday's announcement of more job cuts Mr Rowe said: ""In May we outlined our plans to learn from the crisis, accelerate our transformation and deliver a stronger, more agile business in a world in which some customer habits were changed forever. ""Three months on and our 'Never the Same Again' programme is progressing; albeit the outlook is uncertain and we remain cautious. He said the proposals to ""further streamline store operations and management"" were an ""important step in becoming a leaner, faster business set up to serve changing customer needs"". Retail Economics chief executive Richard Lim said the cuts represented a ""massive reduction"" in the M&S workforce. The retailer was ""desperately attempting to reposition the business towards a new-normal emerging in the sector"". ""Retailers were already battling with the pace of structural change facing the sector but the impact of the pandemic has been a step-change for the industry."" He said retailers remained in ""survival mode, preserving cash and hanging on for more sustainable levels of demand to return"". ""But the way we shop has changed on a permanent basis for many parts of the sector almost overnight. ""The reality is that many more retailers will fail and the number of job losses will ramp up as government support is withdrawn. This is the calm before the storm."" In recent weeks, several retailers have announced job cuts, among themJohn Lewis, which warned 1,300 jobs could go, Boots, which said 4,000 were at risk, andWH Smith, which may shed 1,500 jobs. Dave Gill, national officer of the shopworkers' union Usdaw, said Tuesday's announcement was ""yet another devastating blow for M&S staff and yet another bombshell for our High Streets. The government has a clear choice: do they want to see the High Street go to the wall, or do they want to help save it""? Marks and Spencer has been in the throes of a big reorganisation of one sort or another for most of the past two decades. Successive management teams have struggled to come to terms with rapid shifts in consumer behaviour - but none so rapid as what has happened over the past four months. M&S had already begun what looked like it most serious restructuring in years before the pandemic struck, with a big drive to boost online sales - notably with a partnership with Ocado - and to close underperforming stores. But those plans, drawn up by Chairman Archie Norman and Chief Executive Steve Rowe, have been accelerated by the coronavirus. The bigger question now is whether the drastic action now being taken is enough to cope not only with the sudden decline in sales brought about by the pandemic, but the longer-term shifts that have so vexed M&S management in the past. The size of the job cuts suggests that M&S is at least taking those threats seriously. M&S employs almost 78,000 people, most of them in the UK. The bulk of the latest job cuts are expected to come among shop floor workers, with about 12% of customer assistant roles going. Cuts will also be made at head office and in regional management. However, the company is shifting resources and recruiting towards areas that are expanding - online and food. M&S said online clothing and home goods sales had been performing strongly since the beginning of the year, and over the last eight weeks had accounted for 41% of its total clothing and home goods sales. In the last 13 weeks M&S's total food sales increased by 2.5%. On Tuesday, the latest Kantar grocery index showed that as a whole, the market expanded by 14.4% in the 12 weeks to 9 August. Sales at Morrisons increased the most, rising by 16% over that period.

Trump clearly in over his head - Michelle Obama,"This video can not be played Michelle Obama campaigned against Donald Trump in the 2020 election Michelle Obama has launched a stinging attack on US President Donald Trump as Democrats prepared to crown Joe Biden as their White House challenger. ""Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country,"" said the former US first lady in an emotional recorded message to the Democratic convention. Disaffected members of Mr Trump's Republican party also piled in on him at the Democratic party conference. The election takes place on Tuesday 3 November. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, Democrats scrapped plans for a crowded party extravaganza with balloon drops and all the other political razzmatazz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But it is unclear whether the largely virtual schedule of pre-recorded speeches with no live audience can generate the same level of enthusiasm as pre-pandemic gatherings of the party faithful. Republicans will face the same challenge as they make their case for four more years in the White House at a drastically scaled-down convention next week. A really simple guide to the US election What to watch for at the US Democratic convention How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mrs Obama, who recorded her keynote address before Mr Biden announced his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, six days ago, launched a blistering attack on Mr Trump. ""You simply cannot fake your way through this job,"" she said in remarks that closed the first night of the convention on Monday. The headline speaker added: ""Our economy is in shambles because of a virus that this president downplayed for too long."" ""Stating the simple fact that a black life matters is still met with derision from the nation's highest office,"" Mrs Obama continued. ""Because whenever we look to this White House for some leadership, or consolation or any semblance of steadiness, what we get instead is chaos, division and a total and utter lack of empathy."" She said the last four years had been difficult to explain to America's children. ""They see our leaders labelling fellow citizens enemies of the state, while emboldening torch-bearing white supremacists. This video can not be played Democratic National Convention day one: Biden's grandchildren and famous faces ""They watch in horror as children are torn from their families and thrown into cages, and pepper spray and rubber bullets are used on peaceful protests for a photo op."" Mrs Obama continued: ""Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. ""He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is."" She described Mr Biden as a ""profoundly decent man"", touting the Democratic White House candidate's experience as vice-president under her husband, President Barack Obama. ""We have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it,"" she said, wearing a necklace that said ""Vote"". A lot of politicians spoke at the camera during the ""virtual"" Democratic convention on Monday night. The only speaker who landed an emotional punch, however, was Michelle Obama. The truth, she said, was that Donald Trump ""simply cannot be who we need him to be for us"". ""It is what it is,"" she said, employing the same words the president recently used about the coronavirus death toll - a jab that was as subtle as it was devastating. She wasn't trying to convince Republicans to switch sides. That was the job of John Kasich, the Republican ex-governor of Ohio. She wasn't trying to get left-wing progressives to rally to Biden. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders handled that. Mrs Obama was speaking to loyal Democrats, some of whom may have stayed at home or voted for a third party in 2016, some of whom may be dispirited or scared this year. Her goal was to drive home the gravity of the moment and to give them a call to action. The opening night of the convention, a two-hour programme hosted by former Desperate Housewives actress Eva Longoria Baston, was titled by party organisers ""We the People"". John Kasich, who ran against Mr Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, recorded a message calling on Americans to deny the president a second term in office. This video can not be played What happens at the US conventions? Mr Kasich endorsed Mr Biden, saying: ""We can all see what's going on in our country today and all the questions that are facing us, and no one person or party has all the answers. ""But what we do know is that we can do better than what we've been seeing today, for sure."" What does Kamala Harris believe? Where Joe Biden stands on the key issues Bernie Sanders, the left-wing Vermont senator who was Mr Biden's fiercest competitor during the Democratic party's contest to pick a challenger to Mr Trump, also recorded a message. He said: ""My friends, I say to you, and to everyone who supported other candidates in this primary and to those who may have voted for Donald Trump in the last election: The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake."" He added: ""Nero fiddled while Rome burned - Trump golfs."" This video can not be played What do young Democrats think of Joe Biden? Along with Mr Kasich, three other high-profile Republicans recorded messages for the convention's opening night: California businesswoman Meg Whitman, former New Jersey Governor Christine Whitman and former New York congresswoman Susan Molinari. While their inclusion left the Biden team claiming a broad coalition, some Democrats grumbled that the Republicans used up precious time that could have benefited progressive speakers or lesser-known rising stars. But Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and Biden campaign co-chairman, rejected that idea, saying, ""remember tonight's theme is 'We the People,' not 'We the Democrats'"". The opening night also featured pre-recorded messages from everyday Americans, including repentant Trump voters and a woman who blamed her father's death from Covid-19 on the president. On Tuesday morning, Mr Trump responded to Mrs Obama's criticism in a series of tweets. ""[I] would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren't for the job done by your husband,"" he wrote. This video can not be played What does this hat mean to Americans? And on Monday, Mr Trump spoke to the BBC on Air Force One and lashed out at Mr Kasich. ""He was a loser as a Republican, and he'll be a loser as a Democrat,"" the president said. During a campaign speech earlier that day in Mankato, Minnesota, Mr Trump warned that if Mr Biden won in November, news outlets would lose their audiences. ""Nobody's going to want to cover sleepy Joe,"" Mr Trump said. ""We will end up with one very boring socialist country that will go to hell."" Mr Trump also confirmed he would accept the Republican nomination for a second term during a live speech at the White House next week. Democrats and some fellow Republicans have criticised the plan for using the White House as a campaign venue. The four-night jamboree will culminate in Mr Biden's speech on Thursday in a mostly empty ballroom in his home state of Delaware. On Wednesday, his vice-presidential pick, Ms Harris, the daughter of immigrant parents from India and Jamaica, will accept her nomination as the first woman of colour to be a running mate on a major party presidential ticket. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Also speaking on Wednesday are former President Obama, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, and one of Mr Biden's former rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren. Tuesday will hear speeches from former President Bill Clinton and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Verdict due over assassination of Lebanon ex-PM,"The blast near Beirut's seafront killed Hariri and 21 other people A UN-backed court has found a member of the militant group Hezbollah guilty of involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese PM Rafik Hariri.

She described Mr Biden as a ""profoundly decent man"", touting the Democratic White House candidate's experience as vice-president under her husband, President Barack Obama. ""We have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it,"" she said, wearing a necklace that said ""Vote"". A lot of politicians spoke at the camera during the ""virtual"" Democratic convention on Monday night. The only speaker who landed an emotional punch, however, was Michelle Obama. The truth, she said, was that Donald Trump ""simply cannot be who we need him to be for us"". ""It is what it is,"" she said, employing the same words the president recently used about the coronavirus death toll - a jab that was as subtle as it was devastating. She wasn't trying to convince Republicans to switch sides. That was the job of John Kasich, the Republican ex-governor of Ohio. She wasn't trying to get left-wing progressives to rally to Biden. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders handled that. Mrs Obama was speaking to loyal Democrats, some of whom may have stayed at home or voted for a third party in 2016, some of whom may be dispirited or scared this year. Her goal was to drive home the gravity of the moment and to give them a call to action. The opening night of the convention, a two-hour programme hosted by former Desperate Housewives actress Eva Longoria Baston, was titled by party organisers ""We the People"". John Kasich, who ran against Mr Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, recorded a message calling on Americans to deny the president a second term in office.

Mr Kasich endorsed Mr Biden, saying: ""We can all see what's going on in our country today and all the questions that are facing us, and no one person or party has all the answers.

Where Joe Biden stands on the key issues Bernie Sanders, the left-wing Vermont senator who was Mr Biden's fiercest competitor during the Democratic party's contest to pick a challenger to Mr Trump, also recorded a message. He said: ""My friends, I say to you, and to everyone who supported other candidates in this primary and to those who may have voted for Donald Trump in the last election: The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake."" He added: ""Nero fiddled while Rome burned - Trump golfs."" This video can not be played What do young Democrats think of Joe Biden? Along with Mr Kasich, three other high-profile Republicans recorded messages for the convention's opening night: California businesswoman Meg Whitman, former New Jersey Governor Christine Whitman and former New York congresswoman Susan Molinari. While their inclusion left the Biden team claiming a broad coalition, some Democrats grumbled that the Republicans used up precious time that could have benefited progressive speakers or lesser-known rising stars. But Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and Biden campaign co-chairman, rejected that idea, saying, ""remember tonight's theme is 'We the People,' not 'We the Democrats'"". The opening night also featured pre-recorded messages from everyday Americans, including repentant Trump voters and a woman who blamed her father's death from Covid-19 on the president. On Tuesday morning, Mr Trump responded to Mrs Obama's criticism in a series of tweets. ""[I] would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren't for the job done by your husband,"" he wrote. This video can not be played What does this hat mean to Americans? And on Monday, Mr Trump spoke to the BBC on Air Force One and lashed out at Mr Kasich. ""He was a loser as a Republican, and he'll be a loser as a Democrat,"" the president said. During a campaign speech earlier that day in Mankato, Minnesota, Mr Trump warned that if Mr Biden won in November, news outlets would lose their audiences. ""Nobody's going to want to cover sleepy Joe,"" Mr Trump said. ""We will end up with one very boring socialist country that will go to hell."" Mr Trump also confirmed he would accept the Republican nomination for a second term during a live speech at the White House next week. Democrats and some fellow Republicans have criticised the plan for using the White House as a campaign venue. The four-night jamboree will culminate in Mr Biden's speech on Thursday in a mostly empty ballroom in his home state of Delaware.

What US presidential hopeful Joe Biden wants to do,"When he formally announced his entry into the 2020 presidential race, Joe Biden declared that he stood for two things - workers who ""built this country"", and values that can bridge its divisions. As the US faces challenges from coronavirus to racial inequity, his pitch is to create new economic opportunities for workers, restore environmental protections and healthcare rights, and international alliances. With his inauguration less than a day away, here are the president-elect's plans on eight key issues. Mr Biden's approach to tackling coronavirus, the most immediate and obvious challenge facing the country, is to provide free testing for all and hire 100,000 people to set up a national contact-tracing programme. He says he wants to establish at least 10 testing centres in every state, call upon federal agencies to deploy resources and give firmer national guidance through federal experts. He says all governors should mandate wearing masks. Those suspicious of federal authority will see this as overreach, but it lies very much in line with Mr Biden's and Democrats' general view on the role government should play. To address the immediate impact of the coronavirus crisis, Mr Biden has vowed to spend ""whatever it takes"" to extend loans to small businesses and increase direct money payments to families. Among the proposals are an additional $200 in Social Security payments per month, rescinding Trump-era tax cuts and $10,000 of student loan forgiveness for federal loans. Mr Biden's broader economic policies, dubbed his ""Build Back Better"" plan, aim to please two constituencies that traditionally support Democrats - young people and blue collar workers. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour - a measure that is popular among young people and that has become something of a totem figure for the party in 2020, and a sign of its move to the left. He also wants a $2tn investment in green energy, arguing that boosting green manufacturing helps working class union workers, who perform most of those jobs. There is also a $400bn pledge to use federal dollars to buy American goods, alongside a wider commitment to enforce ""Buy American"" laws for new transport projects. Mr Biden was previously criticised for backing the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which critics say shipped jobs overseas. His 2021 plan calls for the federal government to invest $300bn in US-made materials, services, research and technology. In the wake of the race protests that have gripped the US last year, he said he believes that racism exists in the US and must be dealt with through broad economic and social programmes to support minorities. A pillar of his ""build back"" programme is to create business support for minorities through a $30bn investment fund. On criminal justice, he has moved far from his much-criticised ""tough-on-crime"" position of the 1990s. Mr Biden has now proposed policies to reduce incarceration, address race, gender and income-based disparities in the justice system, and rehabilitate released prisoners. He would now create a $20bn grant programme to incentivise states to invest in incarceration reduction efforts, eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, decriminalise marijuana and expunge prior cannabis convictions, and end the death penalty. However, he has rejected calls to defund police, saying resources should instead be tied to maintaining standards. He argues that some funding for police should be redirected to social services like mental health, and calls for a $300m investment into a community policing programme. Mr Biden has called climate change an existential threat, and says he will rally the rest of the world to act more quickly on curbing emissions by rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. The agreement, which Donald Trump withdrew from, committed the US to cutting greenhouse gases up to 28% by 2025, based on 2005 levels. Though he does not embrace the Green New Deal - a climate and jobs package put forward by the left wing of his party - he is proposing a $1.7tn federal investment in green technologies research, some of which overlaps with the funding in his economics plan, to be spent over the next 10 years, and wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050 - a commitment that was made by more than 60 other countries in 2019. China and India, the two other biggest carbon emitters, have yet to join the pledge. The investments dovetail with his economic plan to create jobs in manufacturing ""green energy"" products. Mr Biden wrote that as president, he would focus on national issues first. That said, there is little to suggest that Mr Biden's values on foreign policy have shifted away from multilateralism and engagement on the world stage, in opposition to Mr Trump's unabashedly isolationist one. He has also promised to repair relationships with US allies, particularly with the Nato alliance, which Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to undermine with funding cuts. The former vice-president has said China should be held accountable for unfair environment and trade practices, but instead of unilateral tariffs, he has proposed an international coalition with other democracies that China ""can't afford to ignore"", though he has been vague about what that means. Mr Biden says he will expand the public health insurance scheme passed when he was President Barack Obama's deputy, and implement a plan to insure an estimated 97% of Americans. Though he stops short of the universal health insurance proposal on the wish lists of the more left-wing members of his party, Mr Biden promises to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance option similar to Medicare, which provides medical benefits to the elderly and to lower the age of eligibility for Medicare itself from 65 to 60 years old. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan group, estimates that the total Biden plan would cost $2.25tn over 10 years. In his first 100 days in office, Mr Biden promises to reverse Trump policies that separate parents from their children at the US-Mexican border, rescind limits on the number of applications for asylum and end the bans on travel from several majority-Muslim countries. He also promises to protect the ""Dreamers"" - people brought illegally to the US as children who were permitted to stay under an Obama-era policy - as well as ensure they are eligible for federal student aid. In a notable shift to the left, he has endorsed several big pieces of education policy that have become popular within the party - student loan debt forgiveness, expansion of tuition-free colleges, and universal preschool access. These would be paid using money gained back from withdrawing the Trump-era tax cuts.

Republicans back Biden in Democratic convention,"This video can not be played Michelle Obama campaigned against Donald Trump in the 2020 election Michelle Obama has launched a stinging attack on US President Donald Trump as Democrats prepared to crown Joe Biden as their White House challenger. ""Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country,"" said the former US first lady in an emotional recorded message to the Democratic convention. Disaffected members of Mr Trump's Republican party also piled in on him at the Democratic party conference. The election takes place on Tuesday 3 November. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, Democrats scrapped plans for a crowded party extravaganza with balloon drops and all the other political razzmatazz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But it is unclear whether the largely virtual schedule of pre-recorded speeches with no live audience can generate the same level of enthusiasm as pre-pandemic gatherings of the party faithful. Republicans will face the same challenge as they make their case for four more years in the White House at a drastically scaled-down convention next week. A really simple guide to the US election What to watch for at the US Democratic convention How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mrs Obama, who recorded her keynote address before Mr Biden announced his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, six days ago, launched a blistering attack on Mr Trump. ""You simply cannot fake your way through this job,"" she said in remarks that closed the first night of the convention on Monday. The headline speaker added: ""Our economy is in shambles because of a virus that this president downplayed for too long."" ""Stating the simple fact that a black life matters is still met with derision from the nation's highest office,"" Mrs Obama continued. ""Because whenever we look to this White House for some leadership, or consolation or any semblance of steadiness, what we get instead is chaos, division and a total and utter lack of empathy."" She said the last four years had been difficult to explain to America's children. ""They see our leaders labelling fellow citizens enemies of the state, while emboldening torch-bearing white supremacists. This video can not be played Democratic National Convention day one: Biden's grandchildren and famous faces ""They watch in horror as children are torn from their families and thrown into cages, and pepper spray and rubber bullets are used on peaceful protests for a photo op.""

"U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs as teacher grades usedEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson apologises to students and parents for the ""distress"" caused.","This video can not be played A-level student Nina welcomes the government's U-turn which means she can train to become a vet A-level and GCSE students in England will be given grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm, after a government U-turn. It follows uproar after about 40% of A-level results were downgraded by exams regulator Ofqual, which used a formula based on schools' prior grades. GCSE results in England, Wales and Northern Ireland come out on Thursday. Ofqual chair Roger Taylor and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson apologised for the ""distress"" caused. Teachers' estimates will be awarded to students unless the computer algorithm gave a higher grade. Mr Williamson said the results of mock exams - which critics said can be inconsistent across different schools - will now not be a key part of the appeals process. He said students and parents had been affected by ""significant inconsistencies"" with the grading process. In a statement, he acknowledged the ""extraordinarily difficult"" year for students, after exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the Department for Education had worked with Ofqual to design ""the fairest possible model"" but it had become clear that the process of awarding grades had resulted in ""more significant inconsistencies than can be resolved through an appeals process"". ""I am sorry for the distress this has caused young people and their parents but hope this announcement will now provide the certainty and reassurance they deserve,"" said Mr Williamson. Can I accept a degree place and sit the exam? And other questions How did the A-level algorithm work? A-level results U-turn is 'too late' for students BTec students: 'We've been forgotten about' The education secretary told reporters No 10 does not get ""any of the detailed data before schools do"" but when it saw these ""quite concerning outliers"" they asked questions. Mr Williamson said he hoped BTecs would be subject to teacher-assessed grades, and that the government was working with the ""awarding authorities"" to ensure this happened. He also revealed the temporary cap on the number of places that universities can offer to students would be lifted. In a tweet,external, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had been ""forced into a screeching U-turn after days of confusion"". He criticised Downing Street's handling of students' results as ""a complete fiasco"" and said its about-face was a ""victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week"". A-level students held protests across the UK in response to grades they said were unfairly awarded. For the past decade, Ofqual has held the line against exam grade inflation like a knight of the realm - often using some quite controversial statistical techniques. But in the case of the class of Covid-19, it could be said the government's desire to maintain standards came at too high a price. In commissioning the exams regulator to take out an insurance policy in the form of its ill-fated algorithm, that policy arguably went too far, despite ministers' best intentions. When First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reinstated estimated grades for students in Scotland, it was only a matter of time before the other nations followed suit. Cue Northern Ireland, then Wales and finally England. These students are all competing for the same university places, and in the same jobs market after all. It was only when Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and his deputy Nick Gibb saw how inconsistent the results were that they were forced to relent. However, the crisis is far from resolved, with tens of thousands of students who thought they had lost their university places likely to get the grades they need after all. Universities say they will do their best to accommodate them, but it is going to be a tough ask. After the algorithm - what happens next? Ofqual chair Mr Taylor apologised for the ""difficulty"" caused to students over its grading system. He told the BBC: ""I would like to say sorry. We have recognised the difficulty that young people have faced coping with the receipt of grades that they were unable to understand the basis on which they had been awarded."" This video can not be played Gavin Williamson: ""Incredibly sorry for all those students who have been through this"" He added the regulator realised it had taken ""the wrong road"" and decided to ""change course"" after seeing the ""anxiety"" it had caused to young people and the added ""administrative burden on teachers at a time when they need to be preparing for the new school term"". A-level student Jess Johnson, who stood to lose out on a Â£16,000 scholarship, said she was ""thankful"" and ""excited"" about the change to results. The 18-year-old needed an A in English to earn a place at St Andrews, along with a Â£4,000-a-year scholarship, but she was downgraded from her predicted A to a B and was initially told she had been rejected. That downgrading is now set to be reversed. Ms Johnson, who studied at Ashton Sixth Form College in Greater Manchester, said: ""I think it would have been unfair if (Northern) Ireland, Scotland and Wales made the change and we didn't, so I'm very glad."" However, she questioned why it had taken so long to make the change, after A-level results came out on Thursday, saying ""a lot of stress and anxiety"" had been caused as a result of the wait. Alaa Muhammad faced missing out on her dream of studying medicine after her A-level results were downgraded. On hearing the news of the U-turn, she said: ""I am ecstatic, I am so so happy. I was so hopeless a couple of days ago and now I feel like I can finally breathe again."" Ms Muhammad, from south-east England, had seen her grades fall from a predicted AAB to EED. She said she had paid more than Â£2,000 to take re-sits at a private college after her studies in year 12 and 13 were disrupted. She now hopes she will be able to study medicine at a top university in Pakistan. NI education minister in U-turn on A-level grades Estimated results to be used for Welsh exam grades Scottish school pupils have results upgraded Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), welcomed the decision ""to put an end to the grading fiasco"". He added the move would mean there was grade inflation, but he said this was a ""small price to pay for remedying the manifest injustices"" caused by the algorithm. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said universities were being ""as flexible as possible with applicants"" but that the ""late policy change"" has created ""challenges"". He called on the government to ""step up and support universities"", adding that Universities UK was seeking ""urgent clarification"" on a number of issues. In a statement, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) said about 69% of 18-year old applicants across the UK were currently placed with their first-choice university, which it said was ""higher than at the same point last year"". It said students who did not have places at their first or insurance choice of university did not need to make their decision immediately. Ucas said it would be issuing new advice for students and schools, which would be sent directly to students, as soon as they were able to take a decision. The government's handling of exam results has also been criticised by opposition parties and Conservative MPs. Robert Halfon, the Tory chairman of the commons education select committee, said the government had ""serious questions"" to answer. Speaking to the BBC's PM programme, he said he'd hoped No 10 would have developed with Ofqual a ""clear, easy to understand [and] fair"" system which allowed every pupil to appeal via their head teacher if they believed their grade was unfair. He said he also hoped that Ofqual would explain its standardisation process to schools; but ""none of this had happened"" and there were now ""serious questions about what on earth has gone on"". Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesperson, said that No 10 had been ""dragged, kicking and screaming to this position"" and that Mr Williamson ""must go.""

It was a far from usual convention - taking place online, with at times the feel of a TV special rather than the traditional balloons-and-confetti jamboree. So what happens next? On Tuesday evening the roll call to formally vote for Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee will take place. It'll be a 30-minute event with some live and prerecorded segments from across the country, according to insiders. The theme of the night is ""leadership matters"", and the main speakers include will include Joe Biden's wifeDr Jill Biden, top Senate DemocratChuck Schumer, congresswomanAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezand former US PresidentBill Clinton. You can follow updates to the storyhere. Tonight's live coverage was brought to you by Holly Honderich, Ritu Prasad and Matthew Davis. Thanks for tuning in! For many observers, Michelle Obama's searing keynote address dominated the first night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention. But of course impressions of the former first lady's speech are divided - largely along political lines. On Twitter, several political commentators and journalists applauded Obama for her high-impact lines - ""It is what it is"" and her command of the political arena, despite never running for political office herself. But some conservatives, like commentator Ben Shapiro, rejected Obama's claim that she ""hates politics"", with some calling out alleged hypocrisy by the former first lady. Allow Twitter content?

President Trump has been retweeting conservative criticisms of a number of tonight's speakers. His main target so far has been New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who blasted Trump's pandemic response - but the Republicans who jumped ship to join the Democrats have also been under fire. ""Cuomo, just like his brother Fredo, has not got a very good memory!"" Trump tweeted, reprising a reference to a character from the Godfather series which has already riled the governor. He has also shared posts criticising Cuomo's Covid-19 response as well as clips of him praising Trump's help. His campaign also attacked Congresswoman Susan Molinari for ""lobbying for Russia"" - she had led a US lobby firm that had a contract with Russia regarding energy policy - and hit out at former Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich, who gave a key speech in praise of Biden.

Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Michelle
Obama may hate politics, but sheâs a natural at it. A lot of
politicians spoke at the camera during the âvirtualâ Democratic convention on
Monday night. The only one who landed an emotional punch, however, was Michelle
Obama. She
benefited, of course, from higher production values. While some of the
appearances had the look of a bad Zoom meeting or a television infomercial,
Obama was given a close focus and two camera angles. But it
was more than technical know-how that made her speech resonate. That came in
her bittersweet acknowledgement that her âwhen they go low, we go highâ line
from 2016 may now seem a lot different for Democrats, who feel that âlowâ
proved to be a winning strategy. âGoing
high is the only thing that works, because when we go low, when we use those
same tactics of degrading and dehumanising others, we just become part of the
ugly noise thatâs drowning out everything else,â she said. âWe degrade
ourselves.â Then,
she pivoted. âGoing
high does not mean putting on a smile and saying nice things when confronted by
viciousness and cruelty,â she said. Going high means telling the âcold hard
truthâ. And the
truth, she said, is that Donald Trump âsimply cannot be who we need him to be
for usâ. âIt is
what it is,â she said, employing the same words the president recently used
about the coronavirus death toll - a jab that was a subtle as it was
devastating. She drew
a contrast between Trump, who she says lacks empathy, and Joe Biden, who â
after a lifetime of loss, including the death of a wife, an infant daughter and
adult son â knows âthe anguish of sitting at the table with an empty chairâ. She
reassured Americans who liked her husbandâs presidency and miss it, that Biden
would bring those days back. She warned, however, that it would require hard
work. Victory couldnât be taken for granted, she said, the way some may have
done in 2016. âThis is
who we still are: compassionate, resilient, decent people whose fortunes are
bound up with one another,â she said in conclusion. âAnd it is well past time
for our leaders to once again reflect our truth.â Michelle Obama wraps up her speech by saying Americans are still ""compassionate, resilient, decent people"". ""So, it is up to us to add our voices and our votes to the course of history, echoing heroes like John Lewis who said, 'When you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something.'"" She says that's the truest form of empathy - to not just feel, but do. ""And if we want to keep the possibility of progress alive in our time, if we want to be able to look our children in the eye after this election, we have got to reassert our place in American history. ""And we have got to do everything we can to elect my friend, Joe Biden, as the next president of the United States."" With that, she says goodnight. Allow Twitter content?

""If you take one thing from my words tonight, it is this: if you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can; and they will if we donât make a change in this election,"" says Michelle Obama. ""If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it."" She says Biden knows what it takes to lead, and he will tell the truth and trust science. ""And he will govern as someone whoâs lived a life that the rest of us can recognise."" Obama adds: ""Joe is not perfect...but there is no perfect candidate, no perfect president."" ""His ability to learn and grow - we find in that the kind of humility and maturity that so many of us yearn for right now."" The former first lady turns to voter turnout in the 2016 election - telling tonight's listeners that those ""choices sent someone to the oval office who lost the national popular vote by nearly 3m votes"". ""To the many people who chose to believe their votes didn't matter...in one of the states that determined the outcome, the winning margin averaged out to just two votes per precinct,"" she says. ""We've got to show up."" Michelle Obama says right now, children across the country ""are seeing what happens when we stop requiring empathy of one another"". ""They're looking around wondering if we've been lying to them this whole time about who we are and what we truly value,"" she says. ""They see people shouting in grocery stores unwilling to wear a mask to keep us all safe. they see people calling the police on folks minding their own business just because of the colour of their skin. ""They see an entitlement that says only certain people belong here. That greed is good and winning is everything."" Michelle Obama's begins her prerecorded speech by acknowledging that many people may not want to watch a political convention right now - and she understands. She talks about those who came before us who sacrificed and struggled and moved forward. But ""who we choose as our president in this election will determine whether or not we honour that struggle and chip away at that injustice"" the former US First Lady says.. This video can not be played Sanders: 'Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump golfs.' More from Bernie Sanders' powerful appeal. ""Together we must build a nation that is more equitable, more compassionate and more inclusive,"" Sanders says. Sanders says Biden will make it easier for workers to join unions, have family leave policies, and make child care affordable. ""He will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and fight the threat of climate change by transitioning us to 100% clean electricity over the next 15 years,"" Sanders says. Now on to healthcare, that divisive issue among Democrats. ""While Joe and I disagree on the best path to get universal coverage he has a plan that will greatly expand healthcare and cut the costs of prescription drugs. Further, he will lower the eligibility age of medicare from 65 down to 60."" Sanders also says Biden will help with criminal justice reforms, like ending private prisons. ""My friends I say to you, for everyone who supported other candidates...the future of our democracy is at stake."" First-time voter Chris Badillo lives in Florida, and identifies as a
Democratic socialist and progressive. He hopes the 2020 vote will be a turning
point for the US. âJoe Biden was not my
number one choice in the primary. I was a Bernie Sanders supporter. I think Joe
Biden's policies and the way he has been campaigning is not a representation of
where we need to move the party, or what young democrats and progressive
Democrats actually want our party to represent: A party of the working class
that actually proposes policies that will bring substantive reform. [â¦] âI think this
election in particular - no matter how much I talk about Joe Biden's policies
and the way I don't think he's representative of the Democratic Party - more
than anything, it's a referendum on Trump. I live in the southern part of
Florida with a huge Hispanic community. We used to have the Homestead Detention
Center that was in my congressional district. âJust because we didn't
get the candidate that we wanted in the primary doesn't mean we can sit out for
four more years of the way we've been going now. [â¦] We need to accept the
reality and then move forward with grassroots activism that's going to change
that reality to the country that we want.â Senator Bernie Sanders is up, live from Burlington, Vermont. ""This election is the most important in the modern history
of this country,"" he says. ""In response to the unprecedented set of crises
we face, we need an unprecedented response - a movement, like
never before, of people who are prepared to stand up and fight
for democracy and decency â and against greed, oligarchy and
authoritarianism."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Four
years ago at their national convention, Democrats â from Barack Obama to
Hillary Clinton to Joe Biden â made an appeal for the support of moderate
Republicans who may find Donald Trump distasteful. That November, Republicans
voted for Trump in larger numbers than they did their 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney. This
time around, the Democrats relied on an actual Republican â former Ohio
Governor and 2016 presidential candidate John Kasich - to make that pitch. âThese
are not normal times,â Kasich said of his appearance, in what will perhaps be
the truest statement made this week. He also
offered some words of reassurance for fellow Republicans who may be nervous
about following his lead and supporting a Democrat - that Biden wonât âturn
sharp left and leave them behindâ. He said Biden was âreasonable, faithful and
respectfulâ and âno one pushes Joe aroundâ. A sharp
left turn may be just what many of the Democratic faithful are yearning for,
however â particularly those who voted for another of the eveningâs speaker,
Bernie Sanders. For
them, Kasichâs words may be a painful reminder of what might have been â and a
hint of the fine line Biden will have to walk in the days ahead. In a
nation of 330 million people, both parties usually try to cast wide nets in
order to win elections. Democrats, at least this year, are hoping their party
is big enough for both Kasich and Sanders. John Kasich: ""These are not normal times"" Next topic on the Democratic table: the post office. But why is the US Postal Service making headlines? A slowing down in mail delivery times has raised concerns about how this trusted institution will handle an influx of mail-in ballots for November's election, as more voters avoid casting ballots in-person due to Covid-19. It's up to states to determine how they arrange postal voting and there are mounting fears that some are not ready. Democrats fear that the Trump administration could be trying to sabotage the election; Republicans and Trump counter that the new measures are needed to address the agency's multi-million dollar budget shortfall. Read the full story here. We're just into the second half of tonight's programme - kicked off with the four Republicans who have backed Joe Biden instead of Donald Trump. All the major US networks have opted in to the event now and we're expecting the highest-profile speeches of the night, Senator Bernie Sanders and former First Lady Michelle Obama, in the next 45 minutes. We're now hearing from former Republican Governor of Ohio John Kasich. Now we've got a (prerecorded) address from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has become a familiar face during the Covid-19 crisis. ""Covid is the symptom, not the illness,"" he says, adding that the virus is a metaphor for America's longstanding troubles. Cuomo says a virus attacks when the body is weak, likening that to the US' weaknesses with racism, white supremacy, police brutality. He says Trump made the divisions that already existed worse. ""We have seen in this crisis the truth- that government matters, and leadership matters,"" Cuomo says, calling the Trump government ""dysfunctional and incompetent"". In contrast, he calls Biden ""America-tough, tough in the best way"". ""Joe Biden can restore the soul of America and that's exactly what our country needs today."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At
political conventions in the before times, there were always a few moments when
pre-recorded videos played on the big screens in front of the audience. Usually
they bought time for organisers or served as a transition between speakers.
Sometimes they gave notable people who couldnât attend in person a moment of
face time. For the audience, it was frequently an opportunity to chat with
neighbours or head to the restrooms. This
yearâs Democratic convention, however, is an entire week of those kind of
prepackaged video moments. Such is politics in the age of coronavirus. This
yearâs âvirtualâ Democratic convention opened with a reading of the preamble of
the US Constitution set to a fanfare of trumpets by Aaron Copeland, a recitation
of the Pledge of Allegiance and the singing of the national anthem. Actress Eva
Longoria hosted a conversation with some ârealâ Americans, and the family of
George Floyd led a moment of silence in his memory. The
political heavy-hitters â Republican former Governor John Kasich, Democratic
Socialist Bernie Sanders and former First Lady Michelle Obama â will take the
stage later in the evening. Perhaps they will make it seem more like a
traditional convention, even without the cheering crowds. But for the moment,
the prepackaged convention comes across as very, well, packaged. A surprise, early live appearance from the convention star, Joe Biden himself, as he leads a discussion with lawmakers and officials from across the country about racial injustice. Chicago Mayor, Lori Lightfoot, calls for addressing economic inequalities and ""uplifting quality of life"" to help end systemic racism. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo tells Biden there must be federal action to end excessive use of force issues. He says even police officers have been shocked over the death of George Floyd and that he hopes the US can enact national standards for policing. We also hear from Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner - who was killed in 2014 in a police chokehold. She says ""we can't let things settle down...otherwise the uprisings aren't going to mean a lot"". She asks Biden to make sure there are national and state laws about policing because that has been ""the age old problem"". Biden wraps up the discussion by saying: ""I think people are ready, we just gotta keep pushing."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Pennsylvania The Democratic National Convention is in full swing, and some people in conservative parts of the country are wondering what the Democrats might offer. The ratio of Trump to Biden yard signs in York County, Pennsylvania, is eight to one, at least by my count. But not everyone is a Trump fan. âYeah, he mightâve done a couple good things for us. But look at this coronavirus,â says Betty Whitmer, a longtime resident. âHe said: âOpen things up.â Kids were in school. Now theyâre back out because they got the coronavirus.â Even with all the Trump signs around, she says she does not support him because of the way heâs handled the virus, saying: âPeople are dying.â As the conversation now turns towards racial justice, we first hear from a former Trump voter, who says he's voting for Biden this time around because it's time to truly put ""all Americans first"". Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is up next. She references the controversial incident whereTrump had officers disperse peaceful protestersso he could walk to a nearby historic church. ""If he did this to DC, he would do it to your city or your town,"" Bowser says. ""That's when I said enough. Enough for every black and brown American who has experienced injustice, enough for every American who believes in justice."" Bowser says she wants her two-year-old daughter to grow up in an America ""where she's not afraid to walk to the store...where the president doesn't fan the flames of racism and looks out for all of us"". Boswer also introduces members of George Floyd's family. Floyd's brother, Philonise, leads the nation in a moment of silence. ""For the names we do not know, the faces we will never see ... please join me in a moment of silence to honour George and the many other souls we lost to hate and injustice. and when this moment ends let's make sure we never stop saying their names."" During the moment of silence, we see viewers from across America, bowing their heads in their living rooms, kitchens, dining rooms. Â© 2025 BBC.

Students relieved and annoyed after A-level U-turn,"A-level students in England will be given grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm,after a government U-turn. Here are some reactions from those who, amid the confusion, still don't know if they have lost their university places. Emily Kingdoesn't feel much better about the government's decision, because ""not that much has changed"". The 18-year-old from Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, says being downgraded from a C to a U in A-level biology last week ""really knocked my confidence"" - and meant she was rejected from the University of Lincoln, where she had an offer to study midwifery. Emily has emailed the university since the government announcement, but still doesn't know if she's in or not. She's got no other offers so will face a year out and will apply again next year if Lincoln say no. ""I'd have to re-do that whole interview process again, which takes up a lot of time and a lot of money,"" she says. Emily says she's not found much comfort in the idea of being awarded her predicted grades. ""I'll always know that I was given a U. And I know that I didn't deserve that grade,"" she says. ""I'm pretty happy [about the U-turn] but also a bit annoyed. This should have happened last week. Or even a month ago."" Like Emily,Josh Reidis also repeatedly refreshing his inbox for email confirmation - he says he has been told there will be a place for him to study theology at Oxford University's Regent's Park College - in line with his initial offer - once he's sent over his teacher assessed grades. ""I'm just completely over the moon. It's been just an utterly horrific few days in terms of stress and anxiety, just trying to get this all sorted. Just to finally have confirmation that our grades will be changed - it's such a relief,"" he says. The 19-year-old, from Woking, says it was ""frustrating"" and ""heart-breaking"" to be downgraded last week. ""I was so furious that I was getting these grades that in no way shape or form represented any of the work I had done over the past two years."" Although his place is more or less secure, Josh's anger hasn't abated. He says the government has had months to come up with an alternative way of grading students whose exams were cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""They've had five or six months to do it, and to get it so wrong - it just puts so much stress on students. And [the confusion] really just showed that, for whatever reason, the students weren't the priority."" ""I'm relieved but quite frustrated at the same time. It's too late,"" saysZainab Ali, 18, from London, minutes after hearing about the U-turn. Zainab's predicted grades were an A* in history, an A in psychology, and a C in chemistry. But after she was given an A, B and a D on results day last week, she lost her place to study psychology at Queen Mary University of London - and was told the course had filled up. ""I'm facing the consequences for the indecisiveness of people who are in charge,"" Zainab says. She'd come to terms with the fact that she's going to her second choice, the University of Westminster, instead - but still feels frustrated because she had ""always wanted"" to go to Queen Mary's since being a child. ""It's just a very vibrant environment and I really had admired that. I just automatically fell in love,"" she says. After first speaking to the BBC, Zainab says Queen Mary decided to offer her a place. The university said on Monday evening that it was ""deeply sympathetic"" to all students affected by the U-turn, and that applicants with revised grades will be guaranteed a place if they meet the terms of their original offer. Although she is now likely to get her first choice of university after all, Zainab says the past week has been an ""awful"" and ""confusing"" experience. ""I felt like I've been really let down. Now [after the U-turn] it's a bit different, but I still feel a bit let down after all of that. It was really, really stressful."" Connor Bragger, 18, from Redditch, was given BCD last Thursday, and needed a BBB to get into a journalism course at Sheffield. He was predicted ABB so should, theoretically, be allowed to go now. But tonight, he's disappointed to find the phone lines for the University of Sheffield's admissions office are closed for the day - so despite the announcement, he doesn't yet know if he'll be heading there in September. ""Results day is [supposed to be] when you get answers - not more questions,"" Connor says. His second choice is the University of Gloucestershire, where he has an unconditional offer. But now he's got the grades for Sheffield, he hopes he can go there. Connor is trying to stay positive, and says he's pleased with the U-turn. ""There were two boxes that I was annoyed about not meeting, which was getting into my first choice, and getting grades I felt like I had earned. So even if I'm unable to get into my first choice, I feel as though I've now got results that I earned from my hard work all year. So if it doesn't all go to plan, I can still keep my head up a little bit higher."" This video can not be played A-level student Nina welcomes the government's U-turn which means she can train to become a vet Kath Burbidge's sonSam Thieris working a shift at B&Q near his home in Willsbridge, Bristol. At the same time, the 18-year-old is on the phone waiting his turn to speak to Cardiff University. He wants to see if they'll make space for him on the dentistry course he initially had an offer for, but was rejected last week as his predicted grades of A*AA were downgraded to BBB. ""I cried for 48 hours and didn't sleep after Thursday. I just feel so sorry for him,"" Kath says. ""He's worked so hard on everything."" Sam's A* in chemistry meant Cardiff offered him a place on their chemistry Masters course. He'd just decided to accept it - and therefore handed in his notice at B&Q - when the news came through that his grades would be bumped up. As she receives updates by text from Sam (he's now 20th in the queue), Kath wonders if he might take the chemistry offer instead. ""He's trying to just make the best of an awful, awful job that just never should have happened. Will he think 'I'll go and do chemistry now', just because he's fed up with the whole thing?""

Tate Modern fall boy 'goes home for first time',"The six-year-old boy taken by air ambulance to Royal London Hospital A boy who suffered catastrophic injuries when he was thrown from the balcony of the Tate Modern has been able to visit home, his family said. Last August the boy, aged six at the time and visiting London from France with his family, fell 100ft (30m) and suffered life-changing injuries. Now, the boy's family says he is ""happy to see his toys again"". Jonty Bravery, 18, who threw the boy from the balcony, was convicted of his attempted murder and jailed, in June. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spent time at Royal London Hospital before moving to a hospital in France. This video can not be played Audio recording of Jonty Bravery telling carers in autumn 2018 about his plan to commit murder During Bravery's sentencing, the court was told the boy would require round-the-clock care until at least 2022. His injuries included a bleed to the brain and fractures to his spine and he has been left needing the use of a wheelchair. An update posted on a GoFundMe site, which has raised almost Â£250,000 for the boy's medical care, said his parents were able to bring him home ""just for a weekend"". ""We took him to the sea and he was able to build sandcastles with a friend on the beach,"" the statement said. ""He stays seated in one place, and we bring him what he needs to build. He couldn't swim, of course, mainly because he still can't move around without his splints. ""He also returned at home for the first time and he was super happy to see his house and his toys again, even though he couldn't go upstairs to see his room."" The boy had been visiting London from France with his parents The parents thanked the public for their continued support and said their son's reading, breathing and singing was improving ""little by little"". ""He still spends most of his day in a wheelchair and still cannot walk on his own,"" the statement added. ""But when we give him our hand, we don't need to carry his weight anymore like before - it is mostly about helping him to find his balance. ""He can walk a few metres like that and he now also manages to climb one or two steps, always with our help."" A GoFundMe page has raised more than Â£200,000 for the boy's medical treatment Bravery, of Northolt in west London, who was diagnosed with autism from a young age, was jailed at the Old Bailey for at least 15 years. Hammersmith and Fulham Council has been carrying out a serious case review into Bravery's care as the council was responsible for the handling of it. Tate balcony teen told care workers of plan to kill Teen threw boy from Tate Modern 'to be on TV' Man jailed for throwing boy from Tate balcony In a victim impact statement in February, the boy's parents described to the court how Bravery's actions were ""unspeakable"". ""Words cannot express the horror and fear his actions have brought up on us,"" the couple said. A spokesman for Tate Modern said: ""A full security review was undertaken, as would happen after any major incident, and we continue to follow best practice guidelines to keep the public safe.""

It was a far from usual convention - taking place online, with at times the feel of a TV special rather than the traditional balloons-and-confetti jamboree. So what happens next? On Tuesday evening the roll call to formally vote for Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee will take place. It'll be a 30-minute event with some live and prerecorded segments from across the country, according to insiders. The theme of the night is ""leadership matters"", and the main speakers include will include Joe Biden's wifeDr Jill Biden, top Senate DemocratChuck Schumer, congresswomanAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezand former US PresidentBill Clinton. You can follow updates to the storyhere. Tonight's live coverage was brought to you by Holly Honderich, Ritu Prasad and Matthew Davis. Thanks for tuning in! For many observers, Michelle Obama's searing keynote address dominated the first night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention. But of course impressions of the former first lady's speech are divided - largely along political lines. On Twitter, several political commentators and journalists applauded Obama for her high-impact lines - ""It is what it is"" and her command of the political arena, despite never running for political office herself. But some conservatives, like commentator Ben Shapiro, rejected Obama's claim that she ""hates politics"", with some calling out alleged hypocrisy by the former first lady. Allow Twitter content?

President Trump has been retweeting conservative criticisms of a number of tonight's speakers. His main target so far has been New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who blasted Trump's pandemic response - but the Republicans who jumped ship to join the Democrats have also been under fire. ""Cuomo, just like his brother Fredo, has not got a very good memory!"" Trump tweeted, reprising a reference to a character from the Godfather series which has already riled the governor. He has also shared posts criticising Cuomo's Covid-19 response as well as clips of him praising Trump's help. His campaign also attacked Congresswoman Susan Molinari for ""lobbying for Russia"" - she had led a US lobby firm that had a contract with Russia regarding energy policy - and hit out at former Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich, who gave a key speech in praise of Biden.

Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Michelle
Obama may hate politics, but sheâs a natural at it. A lot of
politicians spoke at the camera during the âvirtualâ Democratic convention on
Monday night. The only one who landed an emotional punch, however, was Michelle
Obama. She
benefited, of course, from higher production values. While some of the
appearances had the look of a bad Zoom meeting or a television infomercial,
Obama was given a close focus and two camera angles. But it
was more than technical know-how that made her speech resonate. That came in
her bittersweet acknowledgement that her âwhen they go low, we go highâ line
from 2016 may now seem a lot different for Democrats, who feel that âlowâ
proved to be a winning strategy. âGoing
high is the only thing that works, because when we go low, when we use those
same tactics of degrading and dehumanising others, we just become part of the
ugly noise thatâs drowning out everything else,â she said. âWe degrade
ourselves.â Then,
she pivoted. âGoing
high does not mean putting on a smile and saying nice things when confronted by
viciousness and cruelty,â she said. Going high means telling the âcold hard
truthâ. And the
truth, she said, is that Donald Trump âsimply cannot be who we need him to be
for usâ. âIt is
what it is,â she said, employing the same words the president recently used
about the coronavirus death toll - a jab that was a subtle as it was
devastating. She drew
a contrast between Trump, who she says lacks empathy, and Joe Biden, who â
after a lifetime of loss, including the death of a wife, an infant daughter and
adult son â knows âthe anguish of sitting at the table with an empty chairâ. She
reassured Americans who liked her husbandâs presidency and miss it, that Biden
would bring those days back. She warned, however, that it would require hard
work. Victory couldnât be taken for granted, she said, the way some may have
done in 2016. âThis is
who we still are: compassionate, resilient, decent people whose fortunes are
bound up with one another,â she said in conclusion. âAnd it is well past time
for our leaders to once again reflect our truth.â Michelle Obama wraps up her speech by saying Americans are still ""compassionate, resilient, decent people"". ""So, it is up to us to add our voices and our votes to the course of history, echoing heroes like John Lewis who said, 'When you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something.'"" She says that's the truest form of empathy - to not just feel, but do. ""And if we want to keep the possibility of progress alive in our time, if we want to be able to look our children in the eye after this election, we have got to reassert our place in American history. ""And we have got to do everything we can to elect my friend, Joe Biden, as the next president of the United States."" With that, she says goodnight. Allow Twitter content?

""If you take one thing from my words tonight, it is this: if you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can; and they will if we donât make a change in this election,"" says Michelle Obama. ""If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it."" She says Biden knows what it takes to lead, and he will tell the truth and trust science. ""And he will govern as someone whoâs lived a life that the rest of us can recognise."" Obama adds: ""Joe is not perfect...but there is no perfect candidate, no perfect president."" ""His ability to learn and grow - we find in that the kind of humility and maturity that so many of us yearn for right now."" The former first lady turns to voter turnout in the 2016 election - telling tonight's listeners that those ""choices sent someone to the oval office who lost the national popular vote by nearly 3m votes"". ""To the many people who chose to believe their votes didn't matter...in one of the states that determined the outcome, the winning margin averaged out to just two votes per precinct,"" she says. ""We've got to show up."" Michelle Obama says right now, children across the country ""are seeing what happens when we stop requiring empathy of one another"". ""They're looking around wondering if we've been lying to them this whole time about who we are and what we truly value,"" she says. ""They see people shouting in grocery stores unwilling to wear a mask to keep us all safe. they see people calling the police on folks minding their own business just because of the colour of their skin. ""They see an entitlement that says only certain people belong here. That greed is good and winning is everything."" Michelle Obama's begins her prerecorded speech by acknowledging that many people may not want to watch a political convention right now - and she understands. She talks about those who came before us who sacrificed and struggled and moved forward. But ""who we choose as our president in this election will determine whether or not we honour that struggle and chip away at that injustice"" the former US First Lady says.. This video can not be played Sanders: 'Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump golfs.' More from Bernie Sanders' powerful appeal. ""Together we must build a nation that is more equitable, more compassionate and more inclusive,"" Sanders says. Sanders says Biden will make it easier for workers to join unions, have family leave policies, and make child care affordable. ""He will rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and fight the threat of climate change by transitioning us to 100% clean electricity over the next 15 years,"" Sanders says. Now on to healthcare, that divisive issue among Democrats. ""While Joe and I disagree on the best path to get universal coverage he has a plan that will greatly expand healthcare and cut the costs of prescription drugs. Further, he will lower the eligibility age of medicare from 65 down to 60."" Sanders also says Biden will help with criminal justice reforms, like ending private prisons. ""My friends I say to you, for everyone who supported other candidates...the future of our democracy is at stake."" First-time voter Chris Badillo lives in Florida, and identifies as a
Democratic socialist and progressive. He hopes the 2020 vote will be a turning
point for the US. âJoe Biden was not my
number one choice in the primary. I was a Bernie Sanders supporter. I think Joe
Biden's policies and the way he has been campaigning is not a representation of
where we need to move the party, or what young democrats and progressive
Democrats actually want our party to represent: A party of the working class
that actually proposes policies that will bring substantive reform. [â¦] âI think this
election in particular - no matter how much I talk about Joe Biden's policies
and the way I don't think he's representative of the Democratic Party - more
than anything, it's a referendum on Trump. I live in the southern part of
Florida with a huge Hispanic community. We used to have the Homestead Detention
Center that was in my congressional district. âJust because we didn't
get the candidate that we wanted in the primary doesn't mean we can sit out for
four more years of the way we've been going now. [â¦] We need to accept the
reality and then move forward with grassroots activism that's going to change
that reality to the country that we want.â Senator Bernie Sanders is up, live from Burlington, Vermont. ""This election is the most important in the modern history
of this country,"" he says. ""In response to the unprecedented set of crises
we face, we need an unprecedented response - a movement, like
never before, of people who are prepared to stand up and fight
for democracy and decency â and against greed, oligarchy and
authoritarianism."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Four
years ago at their national convention, Democrats â from Barack Obama to
Hillary Clinton to Joe Biden â made an appeal for the support of moderate
Republicans who may find Donald Trump distasteful. That November, Republicans
voted for Trump in larger numbers than they did their 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney. This
time around, the Democrats relied on an actual Republican â former Ohio
Governor and 2016 presidential candidate John Kasich - to make that pitch. âThese
are not normal times,â Kasich said of his appearance, in what will perhaps be
the truest statement made this week. He also
offered some words of reassurance for fellow Republicans who may be nervous
about following his lead and supporting a Democrat - that Biden wonât âturn
sharp left and leave them behindâ. He said Biden was âreasonable, faithful and
respectfulâ and âno one pushes Joe aroundâ. A sharp
left turn may be just what many of the Democratic faithful are yearning for,
however â particularly those who voted for another of the eveningâs speaker,
Bernie Sanders. For
them, Kasichâs words may be a painful reminder of what might have been â and a
hint of the fine line Biden will have to walk in the days ahead. In a
nation of 330 million people, both parties usually try to cast wide nets in
order to win elections. Democrats, at least this year, are hoping their party
is big enough for both Kasich and Sanders. John Kasich: ""These are not normal times"" Next topic on the Democratic table: the post office. But why is the US Postal Service making headlines? A slowing down in mail delivery times has raised concerns about how this trusted institution will handle an influx of mail-in ballots for November's election, as more voters avoid casting ballots in-person due to Covid-19. It's up to states to determine how they arrange postal voting and there are mounting fears that some are not ready. Democrats fear that the Trump administration could be trying to sabotage the election; Republicans and Trump counter that the new measures are needed to address the agency's multi-million dollar budget shortfall. Read the full story here. We're just into the second half of tonight's programme - kicked off with the four Republicans who have backed Joe Biden instead of Donald Trump. All the major US networks have opted in to the event now and we're expecting the highest-profile speeches of the night, Senator Bernie Sanders and former First Lady Michelle Obama, in the next 45 minutes. We're now hearing from former Republican Governor of Ohio John Kasich. Now we've got a (prerecorded) address from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has become a familiar face during the Covid-19 crisis. ""Covid is the symptom, not the illness,"" he says, adding that the virus is a metaphor for America's longstanding troubles. Cuomo says a virus attacks when the body is weak, likening that to the US' weaknesses with racism, white supremacy, police brutality. He says Trump made the divisions that already existed worse. ""We have seen in this crisis the truth- that government matters, and leadership matters,"" Cuomo says, calling the Trump government ""dysfunctional and incompetent"". In contrast, he calls Biden ""America-tough, tough in the best way"". ""Joe Biden can restore the soul of America and that's exactly what our country needs today."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At
political conventions in the before times, there were always a few moments when
pre-recorded videos played on the big screens in front of the audience. Usually
they bought time for organisers or served as a transition between speakers.
Sometimes they gave notable people who couldnât attend in person a moment of
face time. For the audience, it was frequently an opportunity to chat with
neighbours or head to the restrooms. This
yearâs Democratic convention, however, is an entire week of those kind of
prepackaged video moments. Such is politics in the age of coronavirus. This
yearâs âvirtualâ Democratic convention opened with a reading of the preamble of
the US Constitution set to a fanfare of trumpets by Aaron Copeland, a recitation
of the Pledge of Allegiance and the singing of the national anthem. Actress Eva
Longoria hosted a conversation with some ârealâ Americans, and the family of
George Floyd led a moment of silence in his memory. The
political heavy-hitters â Republican former Governor John Kasich, Democratic
Socialist Bernie Sanders and former First Lady Michelle Obama â will take the
stage later in the evening. Perhaps they will make it seem more like a
traditional convention, even without the cheering crowds. But for the moment,
the prepackaged convention comes across as very, well, packaged. A surprise, early live appearance from the convention star, Joe Biden himself, as he leads a discussion with lawmakers and officials from across the country about racial injustice. Chicago Mayor, Lori Lightfoot, calls for addressing economic inequalities and ""uplifting quality of life"" to help end systemic racism. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo tells Biden there must be federal action to end excessive use of force issues. He says even police officers have been shocked over the death of George Floyd and that he hopes the US can enact national standards for policing. We also hear from Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner - who was killed in 2014 in a police chokehold. She says ""we can't let things settle down...otherwise the uprisings aren't going to mean a lot"". She asks Biden to make sure there are national and state laws about policing because that has been ""the age old problem"". Biden wraps up the discussion by saying: ""I think people are ready, we just gotta keep pushing."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Pennsylvania The Democratic National Convention is in full swing, and some people in conservative parts of the country are wondering what the Democrats might offer. The ratio of Trump to Biden yard signs in York County, Pennsylvania, is eight to one, at least by my count. But not everyone is a Trump fan. âYeah, he mightâve done a couple good things for us. But look at this coronavirus,â says Betty Whitmer, a longtime resident. âHe said: âOpen things up.â Kids were in school. Now theyâre back out because they got the coronavirus.â Even with all the Trump signs around, she says she does not support him because of the way heâs handled the virus, saying: âPeople are dying.â As the conversation now turns towards racial justice, we first hear from a former Trump voter, who says he's voting for Biden this time around because it's time to truly put ""all Americans first"". Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is up next. She references the controversial incident whereTrump had officers disperse peaceful protestersso he could walk to a nearby historic church. ""If he did this to DC, he would do it to your city or your town,"" Bowser says. ""That's when I said enough. Enough for every black and brown American who has experienced injustice, enough for every American who believes in justice."" Bowser says she wants her two-year-old daughter to grow up in an America ""where she's not afraid to walk to the store...where the president doesn't fan the flames of racism and looks out for all of us"". Boswer also introduces members of George Floyd's family. Floyd's brother, Philonise, leads the nation in a moment of silence. ""For the names we do not know, the faces we will never see ... please join me in a moment of silence to honour George and the many other souls we lost to hate and injustice. and when this moment ends let's make sure we never stop saying their names."" During the moment of silence, we see viewers from across America, bowing their heads in their living rooms, kitchens, dining rooms. Â© 2025 BBC.
