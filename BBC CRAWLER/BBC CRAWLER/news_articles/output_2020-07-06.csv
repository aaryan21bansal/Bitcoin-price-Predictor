Police reach out to sprinter after car stop,"Bianca Williams won European and Commonwealth gold in the 4x100m relay in 2018 Met Police bosses say they want to speak to a Team GB sprinter who is accusing officers of racially profiling her in a stop and search. Bianca Williams and Ricardo dos Santos, a Portuguese 400m runner, were stopped in Maida Vale, west London on Saturday. Ms Williams, whose three-month-old son was in the car at the time, called it an ""awful experience"". Cdr Helen Harper said she was ""really keen"" to speak to the couple ""to discuss... the concerns they have"". The Met had said that officers were patrolling the area in which Ms Williams was stopped because of an increase in youth violence. But the European and Commonwealth Games gold medallist believes the couple were targeted because they are black and were driving a Mercedes. What are my rights if I'm stopped and searched? ""They [the officers] said there's a lot of youth violence and stabbings in the area and that the car looked very suspicious,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""They see a black male driving a nice car, an all-black car, and they assume that he was involved in some sort of gang, drug, violence problem."" This video can not be played Footage of the stop was shared widely on Twitter after being posted by former Olympic 100m champion Linford Christie, who questioned why the vehicle had been targeted In a statement on Sunday evening the Met said the Mercedes was stopped after it was seen driving suspiciously, including being on the wrong side of the road, and that the driver had sped off when asked to stop. But this was rejected by Ms Williams, who said: ""That is false, we were never on the wrong side of the road. We were driving down through single-width roads. ""We only found out about us driving on the wrong side of the road once they tweeted. ""This isn't the first or fourth or fifth time, it must be about the 10th. It's getting ridiculous. ""We are planning on taking it down the legal route. I feel very hurt by their actions, and to witness my partner being taken away and for me to be taken away from my son,my heart hurts."" Mr Dos Santos and Ms Williams say police handcuffed them while their son was in the car The Met said officers from the Directorate of Professional Standards had reviewed footage from social media and officers' bodycams and were satisfied there was no concern around the officers' conduct during the stop and search of the two athletes. ""That does not mean there isn't something to be learnt from every interaction we have with the public,"" Cdr Helen Harper said. ""We want to listen to, and speak with, those who raise concerns, to understand more about the issues raised and what more we can do to explain police actions. ""Where we could have interacted in a better way, we need to consider what we should have done differently and take on that learning for the future."" Social media clips of police incidents must be treated with great care. Often what you see is a short segment of an event that has gone on for some time; background information and context are seldom provided. In this case, there are conflicting accounts as to what happened and why - which only an investigation is likely to resolve. Nevertheless, the incident has reignited claims stop and search is being targeted at black people, particularly young men, and has given rise to concerns that handcuffs are being deployed unnecessarily, despite police guidance saying they should not be. It appears the tactic, which Scotland Yard says has helped to reduce knife violence in London, remains as controversial and divisive as it's always been. Speaking at a remote hearing of the House of Commons Human Rights Committee earlier, Baroness Lawrence said it was ""ludicrous"" that black people could not drive around in expensive cars. ""Stop and search will continue to be an element young people go through on a day-to-day basis,"" said the campaigner, whose murdered son wasfailed by an ""institutionally racist"" Met Police. ""And when they are stopped, it is not just one officer or two officers, you have six or seven officers standing around one individual, a young person who is probably frightened to death because he doesn't know what is going to happen to him. ""So if now people have mobile phones and start recording what is happening to them, we have the issues where police say it is one thing and the individual says it's another, and the authority believes the police over the individual. ""That is something that continues to happen."" This video can not be played The mother of Stephen Lawrence described being stopped by police while driving home after midnight London mayor Sadiq Khan said he took allegations of racial profiling ""extremely seriously"" and he had raised the case with the Met. The Independent Office for Police Complaints said it has not yet received an official complaint. Doreen Lawrence recalls being stopped by police.

Can Rishi Sunak save your job? Five things he may do,"Strawberries and cream, maybe even a glass of rosÃ©: the ""summer update"" has a whiff of end-of term festivities. But the chancellor's summer statement on Wednesday may impact millions of livelihoods - and his own reputation. The grants, subsidies and loans deployed to shield the British economy from the shock of lockdown didn't manage to preserve all jobs. However, they ensured that lay-offs in the first couple of months of lockdown were in the thousands, rather than millions. The real test for Rishi Sunak starts now. As one of his predecessors remarked, everyone loves the chancellor when he's splashing the cash, and those schemes have cost tens of billions - in total he's staring at a Â£300bn deficit this year. With the furlough scheme set to be wound down, it's clear crippling job losses in some sectors are under way. This emergency mini-Budget on Wednesday will attempt to help minimise the pain as the economy convalesces by ""flattening the curve"" - this time of job losses - and to prevent the kind of lingering mass joblessness last seen when the chancellor was a toddler, that risks blighting millions of lives. Here are five areas to bear in mind - we already know some of what he'll look at, but there's more to come. At present, some economists say unemployment could triple to over four million this year. Rishi Sunak is expected to detail the beefing up of job centres, with more work coaches and advisers - underscoring that the government too is getting ready for an onslaught of losses. The rise in joblessness won't be fleeting; the first advisers won't be in place until October. There's more money for careers advice too, and work placements. Learning new skills will be vital - particularly for the youngest workers and lowest paid who've been particularly badly hit. Rishi Sunak has talked of preserving jobs where possible, and that may mean taking different approaches with different industries. A skilled workforce isn't enough; you need the demand for their talents - in other words, flourishing businesses. And some of those are suffering simply because they've not been able to open yet. Lyceum Theatre in London, home to the Lion King, was wrapped in messages of support last week in a campaign calling on the government to prevent the arts industry from collapse The struggling arts and heritage sectorhas been promised a Â£1.6bn bespoke package of loans and grants. That's a shift away from the Treasury's previous reluctance to provide tailored help - and may raise hopes elsewhere. But will those industries that don't have the glamour of showbiz, with high-profile spokespeople, be as lucky? The package for the arts sector may signal that the chancellor remains reluctant to extend the furlough scheme, even for struggling sectors. Some sectors - travel, for example - may fail to ever fully recover in the absence of a vaccine. Rather than prop them up, some argue it would be better to divert resources to supporting growing industries. Rishi Sunak is expected to earmark some cash to support green jobs and to promote environmentally friendly home improvements. Incentives for other ""new"" industries may also feature. Even the future of businesses who have reopened may not be secure, unless customers feel safe coming back, not just physically, but financially. Rishi Sunak has stopped short of a haircut photo opportunity, but he's set the tone with visits to shops, markets and even the pub, despite being teetotal. Johnson sets out 'ambitious' economic recovery plan Rishi Sunak urged by MPs to extend self-employed help What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? And now he may be after our bank accounts. A record amount of money was stashed away in May as the majority of the population saw their incomes untroubled, but their spending reduced. An emergency short-term VAT cut of say, 2% or 3%, targeted at perhaps the hospitality industry may tempt us to part with some cash. A waiter serves drinks to diners in the Soho area of London on Saturday as pubs and bars reopened A similar cut was tried during the financial crisis but its impact was limited. Other ideas that have been touted include state-issued vouchers to spend on holidays, or changes to National Insurance contributions. All would bear a cost of billions. The next annual Budget is due in the autumn, which gives the chancellor time to mull over how the economy is progressing and introduce more measures, alongside the usual forecasts. We may, however, not have to wait that long for rumoured temporary changes to stamp duty. Some now expect that measure, which would boost the fortunes of homebuyers and housebuilders, to come up this Wednesday. At that Budget, we may hear more about how he will pay for all this. At present, the government is able to borrow cheaply via bonds on the financial markets, but there are limits. Mr Sunak may have to find other ways of footing the bill, such as pausing the ""triple lock"" formula used to calculate pension rises, for example. That won't be popular. Five months into the job, Mr Sunak is enjoying popularity ratings far in excess of that of his Cabinet colleagues, thanks to his handling of the economic crisis so far. Hanging on to that pole position over the challenging months - or even years - ahead will be no picnic. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break?

Looking for answers in the place where coronavirus started," Looking for answers in the place where coronavirus started By John SudworthPublication date: 7 July 2020 By John SudworthPublication date: 7 July 2020 In a small room, in a village on the outskirts of Wuhan, an elderly woman is chanting quietly and tapping out time on a table. Opposite her, another woman is crying softly. In early February, her 44-year-old brother died from coronavirus, and she cannot forgive herself. After the ceremony, Ms Wang - she doesn't want to use her full name - says that the shaman received a message from beyond the grave. Her brother, Wang Fei, had absolved her of any blame. “Feifei doesn't hold me responsible,” she says, referring to him by the name the family has used since childhood. “He was trying to comfort me and persuade me to accept his death.” Her brother died on a Covid ward, unable to see visitors; his last days lived out in a series of desperate text messages. “I feel so tired,” he wrote in one of them. “This disease has dragged on for too long.” Ms Wang’s guilt is a product of one of the cruellest aspects of this global pandemic – the enforced isolation of sufferers from their families. “I couldn’t go to the hospital to take care of him,” she tells me. “When I heard he’d died, I just couldn’t accept it. My family’s been broken into pieces.” She wants answers about her brother’s treatment - whether he was given proper care, and whether more could have been done to save him. But Ms Wang has been told by the police not to speak to the foreign media, and her choice to ignore that warning carries some risk. Ms Wang sets fire to papers with prayers written on them in an offering to her brother Ms Wang sets fire to papers with prayers written on them in an offering to her brother One woman we arrange to interview arrives with plain-clothes policemen in pursuit. When she scrambles into our car, they block our way. We meet another man in the darkness on the banks of Wuhan’s East Lake. He tells us he’s been visited twice by the police for speaking out about the death of his father. For victims and journalists alike, asking questions about how and why the outbreak began in Wuhan, and whether it might have been better contained, is not easy. But at the epicentre of this global disaster, the need to ask questions is a necessity, not a choice. The day in mid-January when Wang Fei began to feel unwell, China's official death toll stood at just three. Today, more than 11 million people have been infected worldwide,at least 500,000 have died-  and the virus has forced the lockdown of entire economies. It is here where the virus was first discovered and the first attempts made to contain it. And it is here, too, where the search for its origin must begin, leading to perhaps the biggest question of them all, and one now at the heart of an escalating propaganda war between Washington and Beijing. Did the coronavirus  – as most scientists think – come from nature, or might it have leaked from a lab?  Ms Wang says her brother, who worked as a driver, hardly ever left Wuhan. Over the course of his 44 years, the central Chinese city grew from a declining industrial backwater into a booming international business and transport hub. But if Wang Fei’s life coincided with Wuhan’s extraordinary revival, then his final days ran in parallel with its descent into disaster. In early January, medics had begun to realise that the disease was highly infectious and wereimplementing their own hospital quarantine procedures. But instead of alerting the public, the authorities were silencing health workers. Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to warn colleagues to take precautions against infection, was reprimanded and made tosign a confession by the police. On the weekend of 18 January, with the authorities still insisting thedisease was not contagious, Wang Fei began to feel unwell. He went to hospital where he was given paracetamol for his fever and sent home. “They say there’s no human-to-human transmission, but the doctors are all wearing masks,” he told his sister. She can repeat the exact wording of the official reassurances, even now. “At that time, I was telling him that it is 'controllable and preventable,'” she says. “Only when I look back, I realise the government really didn't give enough warning. Now I know what he really needed was proper medical help. That’s what makes me feel guilty.” Mr Wang cancelled the family’s plans to celebrate the Chinese New Year holiday, which fell the following weekend. Instead he spent his days joining long queues outside hospitals. But with too many patients and not enough beds, he would return home exhausted. “He believed deeply that the country and government loved him,” Ms Wang says, “and that they would protect him.” On 23 January, Wuhan was put into lockdown. It was the world’s first, and became one of the longest and strictest attempts to contain the spread of the virus. But it came too late to prevent an estimated five million people leaving the city in the run-up to the national holiday. A few days later, his condition deteriorated and the family called for an ambulance. They were told there were more than 600 people ahead of them in the queue. Seven hours later he was finally admitted to hospital. Mr Wang found himself in a health system that was now totally overwhelmed. He texted his sister, complaining about the difficulty of getting staff to attend to his basic needs - such as help with drinking water. He continued to get worse. On 7 February Dr Li Wenliang, the doctor censored by the police, died in the same hospital. Mr Wang's spirits sank even lower. “If even a doctor can't survive,” he told his sister by text, “what chance have I got?” They are still silencing medics in Wuhan. Outside one hospital, we speak to a nurse who tells us about her experience on the front lines dealing with Covid-19 patients. Afterwards we exchange contact details and she cycles away. Two plain-clothes policemen, who have been watching us, emerge from the side of the street. They run alongside her with their hands on her handlebars, and bring her bike to a halt. I can see them speaking sternly to her, but by the time I catch up with them, they’ve let her go. She calls a few minutes later and asks us to delete the interview. For her safety we have no choice but to agree. The control of information, of course, has long been central to China’s system of government. In this case, it is central to the story. Wuhan’s lockdown was successful in eventually bringing the city’s outbreak under control, but China faces allegations,including from the US government, that delay and cover-up in the early stages made a global crisis inevitable. In the early stages of any disease outbreak, even days can make a big difference to the speed and scale of the spread. One studyhas suggested that if it had acted a week earlier, the number of cases in China could have been reduced by 66%. The authoritiesdeny the allegations. They insist that, in the face of a previously unknown disease, their response was swift and point out that it has been commended by theWorld Health Organization. The government is now comparing itself favourably to administrations in the West, even overtly mocking them for what it sees asa chaotic and confused response. And it is silencing those who mightchallenge that narrative. While the failings of democratic governments have been comprehensively exposed by a free press, there is no such scrutiny in China. This is a place where even trying to talk openly about your dead brother can bring you to the attention of the police. We put in requests to interview parliamentary delegates, senior health officials, academics and doctors - more than 20 people. None of our requests were granted. We sent questions to China’s health commission and its foreign and science ministries about the release of public information in the early days of the crisis. They went unanswered too. Wang Fei lived a short walk from a large market that became an early focus of the unfolding story. Despite its name, the Huanan Seafood Market is known to have had some trade in wild mammalssold there as delicacies. It is now closed. Initially, it was suspected to be ground zero for the outbreak, the place where the virusmade the leap from animals to humans. Sars-CoV-2 – as it has now been named - belongs to a family of coronaviruses named for their spikey or crown-like surfaces. A vast number of these viruses have been shown to becarried by bats. Some of them are thought to have the potential to infect humans, either when passeddirectly from a bat, or after first infecting another animal species – an intermediate host – that then comes intocontact with people. This is,one theory suggests, what triggered another coronavirus outbreak in China which first appeared in November 2002. The Sars coronavirus, now known as Sars CoV-1, is thought to have jumped from bats to humans via the civet cat - a small furry mammal sold in the markets of southern China. After the authorities failed to acknowledge the outbreak for several months, Sars went on to cause 774 deaths worldwide. Nearly two decades later, the very first cluster of Sars CoV-2 cases appeared in Mr Wang’s Wuhan neighbourhood. One study foundaround half of themhad a connection to the seafood market. It was no surprise then that there was widespread speculation the virus’s intermediate host might have been among theanimals on sale there. But this theory now appears to have beendismissed by China, following the testing of samples taken from various places inside the market. While traces of the virus were found, none were detected on any of the animal samples. Officials have concluded that the outbreak is likely to have begun elsewhere, and that the crowded market simply helped spread the disease from person to person. Most scientists remain convinced, though, that somewhere along the line, whether in a market or elsewhere, Sars-CoV-2 will have passed naturally froman animal to a human. They point to an increasing number ofsuch “spillover” eventsdriven by factors such as population growth and human encroachmenton natural habitats. Dr Yuen Kwok-yung, a microbiologist from Hong Kong University who joined the Chinese National Health Commission fact-finding trip to Wuhan in January, says the “spillover” theory is the most favoured for the origin of this virus. This is not least, he says, because such events have happened so often before, from Sars CoV-1 to other avian-flu pandemics. “H5N1 was the first wake-up, then Sars, then H7N9 in the Yangtze Delta, and now Sars-CoV-2,” he tells me. “So, if you ask me what is the highest possibility – it’s that the virus is coming out from markets, markets that are selling wildlife.” And that’s why, he argues, the trade in wild animals should remain the focus of prevention efforts. “It is not easy to change culture, but we must,” he says. Finding the source of the virus is not just a question of academic interest. If Sars-CoV-2 has come from a reservoir of infection in a particular animal species, then of course, it could continue to pose the risk of new outbreaks. In mid-May, the World Health Organization passed a resolution calling for an international effort to trace the likely intermediate animal host. It has just announced it has been given permission to send ateam of investigators to China for this purpose. But scientists agree it maynot be an easy task. We sent a number of questions to the Chinese National Health Commission and the foreign and science ministries about the work already being done in this regard. We asked if any studies had begun to test various animal species that could have spread the virus. We received no answers to our questions. Outside the shuttered Huanan Seafood Market we’re stopped from filming. “I don’t care where you’re from,” a policeman tells me when I explain that I’m a foreign journalist. “China has done a lot to contain the virus. You need to promote positive energy.” As Wang Fei lay dying in hospital, another location in Wuhan, a 40-minute drive from the Huanan Seafood Market, was already becoming the focus of an altogether different theory. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) was now at the centre of a growing storm of conspiracy theories, suspicions and allegations that the virus might have leaked from a lab. They have continued to this day. The WIV’s modernist, grey concrete and glass structure, set in a leafy campus with a small lake, is clearly visible from the adjacent road. When we arrive there, we are quickly surrounded by security guards who tell us it’s a sensitive area and call the police. The institute is the world’s leading authority in the collection, storage and study of bat coronaviruses. Its researchers are led by star scientist Professor Shi Zhengli – known as “Bat Woman” to her colleagues because of her expertise. They have spent years collecting samples from live bats in remote Chinese caves. Professor Shi Zhengli in her lab Professor Shi Zhengli in her lab One recent paper, co-authored by Professor Shi, gives details about hundreds of bat coronaviruses, many of them previously unpublished, unveiling justhow many have been gathered. The research has included the genetic modification of some of these viruses, including the construction of new, chimeric – or hybrid – viruses, in order to examine their potential to infect humans and, potentially, cause pandemics. It was Professor Shi who discovered and sequenced the genetic code of the nearest known relative of theSars CoV-1 virus, found inside a bat from a cave in China's Yunnan Province. Ever since the Sars CoV-1 outbreak, the fear of an even deadlier, more infectious spillover event has been the driving force behind Wuhan's coronavirus research. On 2 January, just three days after becoming aware of the new virus circulating in Wuhan, she also became the first tosequence Sars-Cov-2. Ironically, it is the genetic make-up of Sars-CoV-2 that has itself helped fuel the lab-leak theory. Some subsequent studies, includingone by Prof Shi, suggest that there is something different about its genome compared to other known coronaviruses of a similar type. Its spike proteins – the pointy bits of the “crown” that latch onto the cells of an infected host – seem to bind extremely well to human cells. While most viruses need time to adapt to a new host, Sars-CoV-2 appears to have been highly infectious from the beginning of the outbreak. One papercompared the new outbreak with the original Sars epidemic. It found that Sars-CoV-2 was already “pre-adapted” for human infection. The virus’ spike proteins also have a feature, unusual in Sars-type coronaviruses, known as a “furin cleavage site”. These arethought likelyto increase the efficiency with which the virus can penetrate the human cells, take them over and replicate inside them. It is this combination of factors – the WIV’s proximity to the outbreak, the kind of scientific work it was involved in, and the seemingly unusual nature of the virus itself – that have led to the highly controversial alternative to the natural “spillover” theory. Claims that the virus leaked from a lab first began to circulate on the Chinese internet in early February. There were unsubstantiated rumours the coronavirus may have passed from a lab-infected animal tothe local community, or that one of the WIV researchers may have themselvesbecome accidentally infected,  either with a natural virus collected from the wild, or a lab-made one. Conspiracy theories soon spread further afield, including claims in some foreign newspapers and websites that the virus may have beenan engineered “bio-weapon”. But none of the lab leak theories – animal virus, man-made virus, deliberate or accidental – have been backed up with any concrete proof, relying instead on conjecture and circumstantial evidence. A group of Indian researchers were some of the first to use the virus’ genome to hint at the possibility ofgenetic modification in a lab. But the paper was quicklydebunked and was withdrawn. However unusual the virus appeared to be, there was nothing to prove that its notable features could not have come directly from nature. In early February, Shi Zhengli herself took to social media in response. “I, Shi Zhengli, swear on my life that it has nothing to do with our laboratory,” she wrote, adding that those who spread rumours should“shut their stinking mouths”. Meanwhile, Mr Wang was succumbing to some of the same notable qualities of the virus on which such theories were partly based. It was a pattern of decline now all too familiar to medics everywhere. His lungs were being ravaged by the pathogen, filling with fluid and white blood cells, and the oxygen in his blood was plummeting. “My heartbeat rate is 160 per min. My blood oxygen saturation is only 70. It’s killing me,” he texted his sister. The following day, on 8 February, he sent one last message. “Please save me,” it read, “I can see stars.” He died a few hours later.  On 30 April, the US president waded into the controversy. He was asked by a reporter: “Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?” “Yes, I have. Yes, I have,”Donald Trump replied. Other administration officials have weighed in, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blaming what he claimed was China’s“history of running sub-standard laboratories”. But despite the US saying to have “enormous evidence” for a lab leak, none has been provided. With the theory now central to an escalating geopolitical dispute between the US and China, critics of President Trump’s handling of the response at home see it as a sensationalist smokescreen todeflect domestic blame. Mindful that they could be drawn into a quagmire of conspiracy and propaganda, some scientists, however, believe that the lab leak question should not be dismissed out-of-hand. It relates, they say, to one of the major scientific debates of our time and it has implications not just for China but for the US government too. The work of the WIV, in collecting large numbers of bat coronaviruses and experimenting on them, has not been a lone venture. It has been part of a majorinternational effortfocused on the growing risk of spillover events and the threat of new, human pandemics. Some of Wuhan’s research has involved collaborations withUS scientistsand the backing of generous amounts ofUS funding. And its creation of chimeric viruses - the stitching together of parts of the genomes of different viruses to make new ones - uses an easily accessible technique commonplace in labs around the world. Such research has  been the subject of an intense disagreement between scientists about the benefits andrisks of such research. Supporters say it can help us to anticipate how viruses might emerge in the wild and has the potential to help with the development of medicines and vaccines. Those against, say it risks doing the exact opposite. Manipulating viruses – to make them more infectious or more deadly – could, they say, spark off a man-made pandemic with a lab-made virus. The risks might include lab workers becoming infected – perhaps unknowingly – when collecting virus samples from animals in the field, when handling animals kept in the lab, or when experimenting with live viruses. Since the Sars CoV-1 coronavirus outbreak, for example, there have been four separate leaks from labs studying that disease. Two of the incidents were at the National Institute of Virology inBeijing in 2004. During one of them, a researcher caught Sars after spending two weeks at the lab. She went on to infect her mother, who died, as well as a nurse, who in turn infected several other people. The coincidence of a new pandemic coronavirus appearing in the same city as a laboratory devoted to studying them is something that Prof Shi Zhengli appeared to initially acknowledge. When she learned of the outbreak at the end of December, her thoughts turned to the viruses stored in the institute's freezers. In an interview with Scientific American, she says she remembers thinking that if coronaviruses had sparked the pandemic:“Could they have come from our lab?” While the lab leak theory has smouldered away both online and in Washington political circles, it has largely beendismissed by scientists. It is a scientific consensus that has, in turn, fed into mainstream media coverage, with now wide acceptance that a natural, spillover event is the most probablecause of Sars-CoV-2. The dismissal is based not just on the fact that such spillovers have happened before, but on a key piece of evidence that has come from Prof Shi Zhengli herself. Concerned to rule out her lab’s involvement in the outbreak, according to the Scientific American interview, she began “frantically” searching the experimental records and samples already stored in her lab. HerFebruary paperreported what she said was the closest match she was able to find. A virus, which she named RaTG13, collected from a bat in 2013, showed a 96.2% similarity to Sars-CoV-2. Although that sounds close, the 3.8% genetic difference between the two would, estimates suggest, take decades of evolutionary change tooccur in nature. If Sars-CoV-2 had leaked from her collection of coronaviruses, the lab would have contained either Sars-CoV-2 itself, or something much, much closer related. “That really took a load off my mind,” Prof Shi told Scientific American. “I had not slept a wink for days.” But the evidence that has undoubtedly had the most bearing on the discussion about a possible lab leak was contained in a paper published in March in the medical journal,Nature Medicine. It has become widely accepted as proof that the virus was not made in a lab. The unusual features of the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein discussed earlier – its high binding affinity to human cells and its furin cleavage site – must have, the authors argue, come from nature. Their evidence is partly based on the use of sophisticated computer modelling. If a scientist had used such models in advance, they argue, to analyse how strongly the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein might bind to human cells, the results would predict a far weaker bond than actually turns out to be the case. In other words, a computer would be unable to foresee the binding strength of the virus. Therefore, they argue, no scientist is likely to have set out to create it in a lab. Furthermore, they imply, to create Sars-CoV-2 in a lab, you’d need to start with a virus with a much closer genetic match than RaTG13, the distant ancestor found in the Wuhan freezer. A new virus cannot be made from a virus that does not exist. Far more likely, they say, that the virus picked up its notable features while circulating, undetected, in humans or animals for months or years before the outbreak. “We very carefully considered a potential link to the lab - we did not dismiss this possibility out of hand,” the paper’s lead author Kristian Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the Scripps Research Institute in the US tells me. “And it is clear - all the available data is fully consistent with a natural history of Sars-CoV-2. There is no scientific data showing any link to the lab. “Most theories considering a link to the lab are conspiracy theories,” he adds. “They are exceptionally disruptive to the efforts of getting Covid-19 under control and result in unnecessary human suffering.” Despite the wide acceptance of the conclusions reached by the Nature Medicine Paper, there are stillsome scientistswho refuse to see it as conclusive proof that the virus wasn’t manipulated in some way. Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor of medicine at Flinders University in Adelaide and Chairman and Research Director of Vaxine, a company leading Australia's search for a Covid-19 vaccine, believes that laboratory manipulation has to remain under consideration for being behind a possible explanation for Sars-CoV-2’s“surprising”ability to bind to human cells. And he rejects the argument that if it wasn’t pre-planned by a computer model, it didn’t happen. “In science a lot of things are done on the basis of give-it-a-go, and a lot of things happen completely by accident,” he tells me. “You know, a lot of Nobel prizes have been won on the basis of accidents.” Others referto Wuhan’spast experimentsin which genome segments from different viruses have been stitched together to investigate how spike proteins bind to human cells. And they point out that there is no way of knowing whether or not Wuhan does in fact have, among the hundreds of coronaviruses it has collected, anything closer in genetic make-up to Sars-CoV-2 than RaTG13. What’s more, RaTG13 is itself the subject of some speculation. The BBC has had it confirmed, from the researchers running a respectedChinese database, that it is the same virus as one that the WIV previously referred to as RaBatCov/4991inthis paper. There is no explanation for the change of name, but that 2016 paper makes it clear that the virus appears to be a new strain of Sars-type coronavirus. Professor Petrovsky says it would be odd if the WIV, given its interest in such viruses, hadn’t continued to work on it. But there is no more mention of it at all until this year, when RaBatCov/4991 re-emerged under its new name RaTG13 as the closest known relative of Sars-CoV-2. Professor Richard Ebright, a microbiologist and biosafety expert at Rutgers University in the US, says there is only one way to conclusively rule out any form of a lab leak. “A credible investigation would need unrestricted access by investigators to facilities, samples, records, and personnel, as well as unrestricted environmental sampling of facilities and serological sampling of personnel,” he tells me. The US government said in a statement in April that the intelligence community does not believe the virus was modified or created, but the government continues “to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of anaccident at a laboratory in Wuhan”. We put in a request to speak to Professor Shi Zhengli but it was turned down. We sent questions to the WIV asking whether any investigation had been carried out and, if not, whether they’d be willing to allow one. Again, there was no response. Wuhan’s lockdown lasted 76 days. Afraid that she might be infected, Ms Wang was too worried to join her mother at home, so stuck it out in the office, surviving on simple meals. She was joined by her brother’s 13-year-old daughter, while his widow, also infected with coronavirus, recovered in hospital. “I kept writing down memories of my brother,” Ms Wang tells me, “and then posted them on social media in order to ease my empty feelings and hopelessness.” After the lockdown was lifted on 8 April she emerged into a city that had, through an extraordinary collective effort and the forced ordeal of lockdown, vanquished the virus. Today, Wuhan is returning to life. But the signs of the lingering economic impact can still be seen. In one of the usually vibrant night-markets people are eating and socialising again, but many of the tables are empty. “Customer numbers are down by two-thirds,” one woman selling boiled frogs tells me. There are signs of something else here too. Early in the lockdown, in the chaos and confusion of that moment, the censorship controls appeared to briefly vanish. People vented their anger on social media about the perceived official failings, and their grief, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang. Today though, a different narrative has taken hold. “China united together to prevent the epidemic,” says another trader, selling yellow-croaker fish on sticks. “But you foreigners don’t know how to protect yourselves.” And the market customers appear to have absorbed yet another origin theory which has been promoted by Chinese state media andsome senior officials. “I think the virus came from the US,” one woman tells me. “In the early stage of the outbreak, US soldiers were visiting Wuhan. They left early in a chartered plane.” In the absence of independent evidence, politics and propaganda are filling the vacuum with both the US and China continuing to trade unsubstantiated allegations. And without it, it is impossible to answer the big questions. How might a spillover event be better contained next time? And how do we properly balance the benefits of the study of pandemic viruses, in a growing number ofvirology labs, against the risks? Scientists who support such work are convinced that Sars-CoV-2 is an incentive to redouble their efforts. “The mission must go on,” Professor Shi Zhengli says, with a plan to sample bat viruses on a much bigger scale. Something Professor Richard Ebright, from Rutgers, calls the“definition of insanity”. China has, under some diplomatic pressure, agreed to anindependent investigationinto the international response to the virus, although it is unclear what the remit will be, who will take part, and when it might happen. President Xi Jinping has stressed that it will have to wait until thepandemic is over. Meanwhile Ms Wang says she intends to continue to fight for answers about her brother’s death. She insists the warnings from the police to keep quiet won’t stop her. “I’m a law abiding citizen,” she says. She does not want us to publish her full name simply to minimise the risk of online abuse, not because she is trying to hide from the authorities. Sometimes it is in the individual stories that the true, global impact of the virus really hits home. Four months after Wang Fei died, Ms Wang has only just told her mother what really happened. The family, fearing she would be unable to bear the news, allowed her to believe her son was still in quarantine. In the end, they could hide it no longer. “For several days my mum couldn’t fall asleep,” Ms Wang tells me. “A woman born before the founding of our country can’t understand why such a tragedy can happen in modern times.”   "
Camilla: 'I can't wait to hug my grandchildren',"This video can not be played The Duchess of Cornwall says the âworst bitâ of lockdown has been not seeing her family The Duchess of Cornwall says she ""can't wait to hug her grandchildren"" after only seeing them on internet calls and at a social distance since the start of lockdown. The duchess said missing her grandchildren was ""the worst"" and she had needed to resist her instinct to give them a hug when she saw them for the first time in more than three months. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett, Camilla also talked about her husband Prince Charles' recovery from Covid-19. The Prince of Walescontracted coronavirus in March, experiencing mild symptoms. He has since said he ""got away with it quite lightly"". The duchess, 72, who tested negative for the virus, said Prince Charles did suffer from a loss of taste and smell, from which she said he has ""nearly"" recovered. ""It sort of comes and goes a bit,"" she added. Is coronavirus changing the royals? Charles: I got away lightly with coronavirus Camilla's conversation at the royal couple's official residence, Clarence House in London, will be broadcast as part of The Emma Barnett show being guest edited by the duchess on BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday 7 July, starting at 10:00 BST. She has been involved in the process of organising the show, helping to frame it with her perspective on issues that matter to her. Camilla spoke about something which will be very familiar to families across the UK - the use of video calls to keep in touch. She said that before lockdown, she ""really hated the internet... I didn't understand it, and I thought what's the point of this wretched thing?"" However, she said she has been using it to communicate with friends and family, and it's been ""brilliant"". She even played a game of Trivial Pursuit with her daughter, Laura Lopes, and grandchildren over the Houseparty app. ""And I won,"" she noted. The duchess did admit she had not gone so far as to try aJoe Wicks PE class online,for fear of an injury. ""I would put something out straight away,"" she said. And she also revealed she has been ""very, very happy"" wearing her jeans for Zoom calls. ""You get into a way of life, don't you?"" she said. ""Lockdown Zoom fashion is very interesting because everybody can look very smart on the top but I think if somebody took a camera underneath, they'd find some very interesting sights."" The duchess said missing her grandchildren was ""the worst"", and even though she has been able to see them at a social distance, that in itself was hard. ""You eventually get to meet them, you're so excited because you haven't seen them for three-and-a-half months and your first reaction is to run up and hug them, and you have to sort of put up your hands. ""It's a very odd feeling, I shall look forward to the day when I can give them a huge hug again."" The Duchess of Cornwall will edit the Emma Barnett Show for one day only By Daniela Relph, BBC royal correspondent Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, is using her guest edit of the Emma Barnett Show to highlight the issues she really cares about. The informality of the radio programme means you get something more intimate too. On the big issues that matter to her the scale of domestic abuse during lockdown is an obvious concern alongside loneliness and literacy levels. But there are also personal insights. Before her royal marriage, the Duchess of Cornwall's life was not one of palaces and public engagements and sometimes that more normal experience shows. She was recently reunited with her grandchildren after three months apart but social distancing rules meant she couldn't give them the huge hug she said she'd missed. She told Emma Barnett she'd enjoyed not dressing up and living in a pair of jeans during lockdown and she described her husband, the Prince of Wales, as the fittest man of his age that I know. For the whole Royal Family, usual duties and visits have been replaced by online calls. But as the lockdown eases, things are getting closer to normal, withPrince Charles and Camilla recently visiting Gloucestershire Royal Hospitalto speak to NHS workers. The Duchess of Cornwall carrying out socially-distanced royal duties at the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital ""I wanted to go up to them and shake their hand and say you've done such a wonderful job,"" she said. ""But it didn't feel quite the same standing in my little circle, don't move left or right - you had to shout 'thank you' and it's very different."" Meetings are not the same when they happen remotely, she said. ""It is about connecting and you know, it's lovely talking to people, I like talking to people and sitting and looking at people's faces, and you can't really on screens. You don't get the animated look that you get looking at a real person."" She revealed that during lockdown she had two calls with a 90-year-old woman, Betty, via the over-65s helpline The Silver Line. ""I saw a picture of her and she looked much younger than me, she looked incredible,"" she said, adding that the pair spoke about Betty's teenage days working on a farm at the end of World War Two, alongside the Women's Land Army. The duchess urgedany older people who are feeling lonely to call the helpline,external, adding: ""There's so many people out there wanting to talk to you. You're not alone, you're not by yourself."" The Duchess of Cornwall also talked about staying fit - both before lockdown and during it. She has recently taken up ballet after a visit to the Royal Academy of Dance, where she is a patron. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall with their rescue dogs, Beth and Bluebell She saw a ""silver swan"" class of older people dancing, and got a group of her friends together - who she called the ""creaky crew"" -  to try it. She said ""they all howled with laughter and said 'you must be joking'"" but gave it a go, and it is something she has carried on doing remotely every morning during lockdown. ""I don't do it in front of a mirror, which you should do, because the shock might be too great,"" she joked. ""I will get the rather creaky crew back together again. I think we'll have to go back to the beginning. We were progressing a bit but no doubt through lockdown we've all gone backwards."" Camilla said Prince Charles had not been tempted to join in, but he will ""walk and walk and walkâ¦ he's like a mountain goat and leaves everybody miles behind"". She said the prince, who is 71, is ""probably the fittest man of his age"". The duchess has two dogs, Beth and Bluebell, who came from Battersea Dogs Home, an animal rescue shelter in London. ""Along I went to Battersea, and Beth appeared and she had just been moved from pillar to post and dumped. ""We thought it would be nice for her to have a friend. They found [Bluebell] two or three weeks later wandering about in woods, no hair on her, covered in sores, virtually dead. ""And they nursed her back to life and her hair grew again. She's very sweet, but a tiny bit neurotic, shall we say."" She said both of the dogs love children, and while they are allowed ""nearly everywhere"" including the sofa, they are ""not allowed to sleep on the bed"". In February, the duchesshosted an event for the charity SafeLives at Clarence House in London,and domestic violence is one of the issues she discusses with Emma Barnett in the programme. Camilla said she was inspired to get involved after an earlier meeting where people shared their own experiences, and one person told a story about a woman who had been killed in front of her children as a result of domestic violence. ""I don't think any of us could believe what we were hearing,"" the duchess said. ""I could feel the tears starting to drip down my face and I looked left or right and everyone was trying to cover their faces or blow their noses. ""It was so moving and so horrific."" The duchess held a reception in Clarence House to celebrate the 15th anniversary of SafeLives Camilla said she was worried about theimpact the coronavirus lockdown would have had on domestic violencevictims. ""You can't run out of your house and go to your neighbours because you're on lockdown and nobody's allowed in and it's a lot more difficult to get to the SafeLives or the refuges and all the wonderful charities that help. ""I've said I think we've just seen the tip of the iceberg. I think after lockdown the numbers are going to be so horrific."" You can hear the full programme with the Duchess of Cornwall on BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday 7 July from 10:00 BST orcatch up on BBC Sounds.

How the toxic legacy of empire still affects us,"This video can not be played BBC News presenter Clive Myrie visits Bristol and explores its colonial legacy There is no shortage of websites that, for the right fee, will help you trace your ancestry. Some even offer step-by-step instructions on how to complete a DNA test to pinpoint the global region you may belong to. Just pop a small sample of saliva into a container in a prepaid envelope, send it off to be analysed against hundreds of thousands of genetic markers, and a couple of months later, voila. I know I'm Afro-Caribbean, born in Bolton to parents who came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s. I know my grandmother on my mum's side spent a few years in Panama as a child, when her father, my great-grandad, worked on the building of the Panama Canal. Beyond that, I have no clue who I am. That's because, like virtually all British West Indians, my lineage extends back to Africa and the transatlantic slave trade. I know I'm likely to have come from somewhere in West Africa, but which country? I haven't the foggiest. Does this matter to me? Yes, it does. We all want to feel rooted with a clear connection to the past. Deep roots help steady us, give us confidence, hold us upright. When those roots aren't there, when the branches of the family tree are broken, there's a sadness and a sense you're almost floating through life, untethered to the ground. This is one of the toxic legacies of empire, and part of the debate currently raging about the veneration of men - and they're overwhelmingly men - whose likenesses in statues dot the British landscape in towns and city centres. 'Talking to my white friend about race - for the first time' The town divided by Black Lives Matter 'My 30-year struggle with racism in the Metropolitan Police' These are people whose lives and achievements were - shall we say - complicated, and the people who raised the money to erect their statues chose to focus on the ""good"" they did in life, not the bad. Take Edward Colston, 17th Century Bristol merchant and deputy governor of the Royal African Company, which held a monopoly on the English trade in African slaves. He made a fortune out of human bondage, but you wouldn't know it to read the words at the base of his statue in Bristol city centre - ""Erected by citizens of Bristol as a memorial of one of the most virtuous and wise sonsâ¦ AD 1895."" On the west-facing relief, Colston is depicted dispensing charity to poor children; on the north he is shown at the harbour; on the east is a scene with marine horses, mermaids, and anchors. But nowhere to be seen is any depiction of the more than 80,000 slaves he helped to put in chains and send to the plantations of the British Caribbean territories - that's if they managed to survive the terrible Atlantic voyage at all. The people who erected Colston's statue in the late 19th Century decided their version of this man's history was more palatable and more valid. It was his philanthropy that won the day, not his slave trading. But a new generation isn't willing to absolve Colston any longer. His statue was pulled down by a large crowd of people in front of the world's media, and now an updated city-wide school curriculum for primary and secondary pupils is due to come into force in Bristol in September. That curriculum will provide a more comprehensive analysis of Bristol's role in the Atlantic slave trade, and context for the life of men like Edward Colston. A protester kneels on the neck of the bronze statue of Colston Asha Craig is the deputy mayor of Bristol and the descendant of Jamaican immigrants. She's one of the driving forces behind the new curriculum and she told me it had been a key objective of councillors to look at the legacy of the city, because we all have to know our own history. ""Education,"" she says, ""is what will help eliminate racism."" Children need to understand early on that history has many perspectives, that memory can be multidimensional. Yes, the UK had a great empire, but there was a dark side to that supremacy, and racism was the rocket fuel of conquest. In the weeks since the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, there has been a global soul-searching over racism and its causes. There has been much discussion of the ""othering"" of individuals and whole peoples, and how to tackle discrimination and unequal treatment of some in society. Greater knowledge and awareness of history is a good first step. The protesters in Bristol, after pulling down the statue of Edward Colston, dragged him through the city centre and dumped him in the harbour, near where his ships set sail for West Africa with goods that would be traded for slaves. I managed to track down where the statue eventually ended up, in a warehouse covered in mud after having been fished from the water. Council conservation workers are now trying to preserve the various pieces of graffiti that the protesters spray-painted on Colston in red. I peered down on Colston's oversized face and reflected on the irony of me, a second-generation immigrant of Jamaican parents, now looking down on the man who may even have helped ship my ancestors into slavery, having branded into their backs the letters RAC - for Royal African Company. He was beneath my gaze, not the other way round. At some point, he'll be placed back on his plinth, probably in a museum with a plaque outlining not just his philanthropy, but also his slave trading. A reminder that, ultimately, history and memory belong to us all, not just the victors.

Pubs close after drinkers test positive for virus,"This video can not be played Jess Green from Lighthouse Kitchen: ""We could have opened today but chose not to as I think that's the right thing"" A number of pubs in England have shut after customers tested positive for coronavirus. At least three establishments announced they had shut their doors again just days after reopening at the weekend. They were among hundreds of venues that welcomed customers after three months as lockdown measures were eased - most apparently with no problem. But crowds descending in some towns and cities prompted fearssocial distancing was being disregarded. The Lighthouse Kitchen and Carvery in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, said it was ""slowly"" working through a list of customers,externalwho had left details at the weekend and that all staff had tested negative for the virus. This video can not be played The closures come after large crowds of people visited pubs across England, including London's Soho district In Batley, West Yorkshire, the Fox and Hounds said a customer had phoned tosay they had tested positive for coronavirus,external. Meanwhile the landlord of the Village Home Pub in Alverstoke, Hampshire, said his team were awaiting test results after someone in a member of staff's ""family bubble"" tested positive. What are the new rules for pubs? Jess Green, manager of the Lighthouse Kitchen, told BBC Points West she decided to close to ""put everyone's health and safety first"". ""I felt I had to keep my customers and my staff safe which is why I chose to shut the pub. I'm gutted, but safety comes first. ""We could have opened today but chose not to as I think that's the right thing to do."" The Fox and Hounds in Batley, West Yorkshire, said a customer phoned to say they had tested positive for coronavirus Saagar takeaway in Burnham will be closed until Friday Indian takeaway Saagar, also in Burnham, said itwould be closing until Friday to undergo a deep clean,externalafter one of its drivers had been to the Lighthouse Kitchen, along with bar the Vape Escape, which has also closed for a full clean after a customer's positive test. Leanne Underhill, owner of the Vape Escape, told burnham-on-sea.com,externalall staff tests had been negative and customers in the bar on Saturday have been contacted, in accordance with government advice. Somerset County Council said it was not treating the case as an ""outbreak"" and asked people to keep to social distancing guidelines and to regularly wash their hands. The Fox and Hounds said staff had taken tests and the venue would be deep-cleaned prior to reopening. The Batley pub said it had taken a number of measures ahead of Saturday's reopening, including limiting numbers allowed inside, a one-way system around the building and a one-in one-out policy on use of toilets. Georgia Gosling visited the Fox and Hounds over the weekend and said it had ""all the right procedures in place"" but called the news a ""wake-up call"". ""We were told to get a test and luckily everyone I know has come back negative,"" she said. Despite saying she was ""a bit scared to go out now"", Ms Gosling said she would return to the pub once it reopened. ""I've been going there for years and once they've done a deep clean it's not like it's contagious forever. I'll definitely will go back."" The Lighthouse Kitchen and Carvery in Burnham said it was contacting customers Customers of the Village Home who had visited at the weekend,externalhave been told there was ""no need to isolate"" unless they showed symptoms or were contacted by tracers. Landlord Robby Roberts said: ""A member of staff, one of my barmaids, has someone in her family bubble who has tested positive."" He said she was on shift on Saturday when the pub was open for 11-and-a-half hours and about 150 customers visited. ""All five staff who were on shift on Saturday have now been tested and we are waiting for the results,"" he said. ""The pub is being deep cleaned and I have contacted the council. I am awaiting advice from them."" Friends embrace 'Super Saturday' as pubs and bars reopen 'Crystal clear' drunk people will not keep distance 'It feels good to be free and have fun again' 'Why pictures of crowded pubs made me feel unsafe' A second pub in Alverstoke, The Fighting Cocks, has announced it will also close temporarily despite ""having no suspected or confirmed cases"". The pub said on Facebook it ""cannot guarantee that someone who has been in contact with a confirmed case has not been in the pub, nor will they come in over the coming days"". The Village Home Pub in Alverstoke hopes to reopen on Saturday but the decision will depend on advice from the council Crowds were seen across England on ""Super Saturday"", as thousands flocked to enjoy a pint. There were reports of arrests and early venue closures around the country, but police said a majority of people had acted responsibly. UK pub and hospitality trade bodies have published guidance for bars and restaurants onhow to operate contact tracing. Contact details only need to be taken from one person in a group and must be kept for 21 days. Owners are also asked to note the arrival times of customers and how long they stay. People can refuse to give information, but owners can choose not to serve them. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented?

UK imposes sanctions against human rights abusers,"The UK is imposing sanctions on 49 people and organisations behind the most ""notorious"" human rights abuses of recent years. Individuals implicated in the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in 2009 will have their UK assets frozen and banned from entering the country. And Saudi Arabian officials involved in the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi are also being targeted. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the move sent a ""clear message"". Speaking in the Commons, the foreign secretary said the UK was taking action against the ""thugs of despots and henchmen of dictators"" as well as stopping those trying to launder their ""blood-drenched ill-gotten gains"". Russia has threatened to retaliate with reciprocal measures and said the sanctions were ""pointless"". ""Russia reserves the right to respond to today's unfriendly decision by the UK on the basis of reciprocity,""the Russian embassy in London said,externalin a statement, adding that the move ""will not improve Russian-British relations"". What are sanctions and why do countries use them? Dead Russian lawyer wins 10-year rights battle UK draws up post-Brexit sanctions plan The sanctions are the first taken,externalindependently by the UK outside the auspices of the UN and EU. Those individuals and organisations subject to immediate sanctions are: 25 Russian nationals involved in the mistreatment and death of lawyerSergei Magnitsky, who uncovered widespread corruption by a group of Russian tax and police officials 20 Saudi nationals involved in the death of journalistJamal Khashoggiin the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Two high-ranking Myanmar military generals involved in the systematic and brutal violence against the Rohingya people and other ethnic minorities Two organisations involved in forced labour, torture and murder in North Korea's gulags Mr Raab said those targeted had been involved in extra-judicial killings, including political assassinations, torture, degrading treatment, forced labour and servitude. Those on the list, which includes a former minister in the Russian interior department and the former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence services, will be stopped from entering the UK, channelling money into the country or profiting from the British economy, through property or other assets they own. ""Today this government and this house sends a very clear message on behalf of the British people that those with blood on their hands, the thugs of despots, the henchman of dictators will not be free to waltz into this country,"" Mr Raab told Parliament. ""The powers enable us to target a wider network of perpetrators including those who facilitate, incite, promote or support any of these crimes and this extends beyond state officials to non-state actors as well."" The UK's new sanctions' regime is significant. It marks the first time Britain has had its own independent scheme focused entirely on tackling human rights abuses. Until now, it has almost always had to act in concert with the EU. The government wants the UK to be seen as a leading defender of international rules and human rights. These sanctions are a central part of that policy. One key test will be whether it can get support from other countries. The United States and Canada have similar schemes, the EU is working on its own version. Sanctions are always more powerful if imposed collectively. What was announced today was merely the first wave of UK sanctions. More are to come and MPs are keen to see some Chinese names on the list. The sanctions may well come at a cost to trade and investment if countries object to seeing their nationals targeted. What is also unclear is how effective they will be in actually deterring human rights abuses. Many of those 47 individuals and two organisations named in the first listing are already subject to US sanctions. We don't know what assets they actually have in London or how often they have come to the UK. But London is a hub of international travel and finance, and officials hope the restrictions will have an impact in the long term. Mr Raab told the BBC the list would be kept under ""constant review"", and the government was ""working already on the on further designations that can be made in due course"". Asked about if it could damage the UK's trading relationship with Saudi Arabia, the foreign secretary said it was ""a matter of moral duty"", adding: ""We can't turn a blind eye to gross violations of human rights. ""We will apply these designations in the countries which we've designated todayâ¦ for countries where we have a relationship, whether it's an ally or other countries that we need to engage with, because that's the world we live in."" But asked if he was avoiding another clash with China by excluding them for the list, Mr Raab said: ""It's pretty clearâ¦  that we are willing to stand up for our vital national interests. But the regime that we have set out is evidence based. ""If we want a positive relationship with Chinaâ¦ the real issue here is one of trust and whether China can be trusted to live up to its international obligations, and its international responsibilities. ""And that's a message that we're telegraphing, along with many of our allies and indeed, many international partners around the world to Beijing,particularly in relation to what we've seen in Hong Kong."" Magnitsky's widow and mother took up the human rights case initially filed by him in Strasbourg Many MPs have long been pushing for a tougher domestic sanctions regime against foreign states accused of human rights abuses, based on the 2013 US Magnitsky Act. Magnitsky, a Moscow lawyer and auditor, died in police custody after accusing Russian tax officials of defrauding Hermitage Capital Management, a British investment firm he was advising. Magnitsky spent 11 months in police custody, during which he sustained injuries which human rights campaigners say were consistent with him being beaten and tortured. His maltreatment has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights, which found in 2019 that he had been deprived of important medical care and the authorities had not complied with their duty to protect life. Dead Russian lawyer wins 10-year rights battle Russian officials subject to sanctions include Aleksey Vasilyevich Anichin, a former interior minister and Oleg Silchenko, a member of the ministry's investigative team who was involved in questioning Magnitsky and who is accused of forced him to retract his allegations of corruption. Mr Raab said he would be meeting Magnitsky's widow Natalia and two children later on Monday to express the UK's ""solidarity"" with them and the nightmare they had been through. Bill Browder, co-founder and chief executive of Hermitage Capital, said the action represented ""a huge milestone in our 10 year campaign for justice"". Saudi officials involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi are among those targeted Mr Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was killed by a team of Saudi agents in what the Saudi authorities described as a ""rogue operation"" that went wrong. In December 2019, a court in Saudi Arabia sentenced five people to death and jailed three others but the process was condemned by foreign governments and the UN, which said it represented ""the antithesis of justice"". What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? Among those targeted by the UK, include Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Al Asiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence services and Saud Abdullah Al Qahtani, a former advisor to Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud, who is said to have ""planned and directed the killing"". Also on the list is Salah Muhammed Al Tubaigy, a government doctor present at the time of the killing and a number of intelligence officers also present in Istanbul said to have concealed evidence about the killing. Labour, which has been critical of the UK's relationship with Saudi Arabia, particularly in relation to the war in Yemen, said it welcomed action against those responsible for the ""appalling"" murder. The UK is also taking action against two senior generals in the Myanmar army, over the state's suppression of the minority Muslim Rohingya population in Rakhine state, a campaign of violence in 2017 and 2019 that campaigners have said amounts to attempted genocide. They are Min Aung Hlaing, Commander in Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces and his deputy Soe Win, who the UK says carry ultimate responsibility for unlawful killings, torture, forced labour and systematic rape. The North Korea organisations targeted are the Ministry of State Security Bureau 7 and the Ministry of People's Security Correctional Bureau, which have responsibility for running prison camps. The Foreign Office said its new sanctions regime, underpinned by legislation passed in 2018, could be extended in future to encompass individuals and governments guilty of corruption. The UK is required by law to enforce existing EU sanctions it is a party to until the end of the transition period on 1 January 2021. The government has said it will maintain these after that date and also existing UN sanctions.

Starkey apologises for 'clumsy' slavery comments,"Historian David Starkey has said using comments denounced as racist during a discussion about slavery were ""a bad mistake"" for which he is ""very sorry"". He apologised ""unreservedly"" for the offence his ""deplorably inflammatory"" words had caused, saying he had spoken ""with awful clumsiness"". The academic and author told an online show that slavery was not genocide as ""so many damn blacks"" had survived. His comments were widely condemned and saw him lose several university posts. Cambridge University's Fitzwilliam College, Canterbury Christ Church University and The Mary Rose Trust were among the organisations to cut ties with him. Starkey made the offensive remarks in an episode of Darren Grimes's Reasoned, entitled ""Dr David Starkey: Black Lives Matter Aims To Delegitimate British History."" Grimes, a conservative commentator, also distanced himself from his guest's remarks, saying he rejected what Starkey said on his YouTube show ""in the strongest possible terms"". In a statement released on Monday, Starkey said he had ""paid a heavy price for one offensive word with the loss of every distinction and honour acquired in a long career"". Speaking about his use of the phrase ""so many damn blacks"", he said: ""It was intended to emphasise, in hindsight with awful clumsiness, the numbers who survived the horrors of the slave trade. Instead, it came across as a term of racial abuse. ""This, in the present atmosphere, where passions are high and feelings raw, was deplorably inflammatory. It was a bad mistake."" Former chancellor Sajid Javid condemned Starkey's remarks He added: ""I am very sorry for it and I apologise unreservedly for the offence it caused. ""Moreover, this misunderstanding of my words in no way reflects my views or practice on race. ""I have lived and worked happily and without conflict in multicultural London for almost 50 years and I spent much of the podcast discussing bi-culturalism as a key to the success of Britain's multicultural society."" Starkey quits university role over slavery comment David Starkey criticised over slavery comments Starkey's original interview sparked a backlash, including from former chancellor Sajid Javid, who said Starkey's ""racist"" comments were a ""reminder of the appalling views that still exist"". Publisher HarperCollins said he had expressed ""abhorrent,external"" views and added it would no longer publish any of his books. During the original discussion, Starkey said slavery ""was not genocide"" because ""otherwise there wouldn't be so many damn blacks in Africa or Britain would there? An awful lot of them survived."" Starkey said he had spoken ""with awful clumsiness"" He also claimed that the Black Lives Matter protests, following the death of George Floyd, had been characterised by ""violence"", ""victimhood"" and the ""deranged"" pulling down of statues. He continued: ""As for the idea that slavery is this kind of terrible disease that dare not speak its name, it only dare not speak its name, Darren, because we settled it nearly 200 years ago. ""We don't normally go on about the fact that Roman Catholics once upon a time didn't have the vote and weren't allowed to have their own churches because we had Catholic emancipation."" In his statement, Starkey said free speech was ""central"" to British history and that he feared his ""blundering use of language"" would ""restrict the opportunities for proper debate"". ""For it is only open debate that will heal the divisions in our society that the Black Lives Matter movement has both exposed and expressed,"" he concluded.

Beer gardens reopen after 15 weeks in lockdown,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Scotland's beer gardens reopen People in Scotland are now able to return to beer gardens and pavement cafes after they opened for the first time in 15 weeks. But customers are being warned that al fresco eating and drinking will not be the same as it was before the lockdown. As well as following strict distancing and hygiene rules, they will have to leave their contact details so they can be traced in the event of an outbreak. Pubs and restaurants should be able to welcome customers indoors from 15 July. That will be part of phase three of theScottish government's route map out of lockdown,external, which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is expected to confirm on Thursday. Business owners warned that their biggest hurdle could be persuading customers that it was safe to go out to eat and drink. Which lockdown rules will change next - and when? Coronavirus in Scotland: How many cases are there? Ms Sturgeon said she had been ""impressed"" with safety precautions that had been put in place at an Edinburgh beer garden she visited, thanking businesses for ""working hard"" to prepare for re-opening. This video can not be played Coronavirus: FM says beer gardens âshould not feel normalâ But she said her ""biggest worry"" was ""complacency"" about coronavirus setting in, and warned: ""This virus has not gone away."" She said: ""If you're out somewhere and there are no clear safety measures in place, you should consider leaving or not going in in the first place. ""If it feels exactly like it was before this pandemic, then something is wrong and measures are not being properly implemented."" Diners will be asked to use their smartphone to scan the QR code to see a menu At the Cold Town House in Edinburgh's Grassmarket, customers must make a reservation to secure a table in their outdoor dining area. Party sizes are limited to six people from two households and they can spend a maximum of one hour and 45 minutes at their table. On arrival, staff will take the contact details of everyone in the group and explain various additional health and safety measures. They will ask them how they want to be served - perhaps by someone wearing a face guard, or at a distance from the table. Nic Wood spoke to the first minister at his venue in the Grassmarket And they will be able to view the menu on their smartphones after accessing it via a QR code. Nic Wood, the managing director of parent company Signature Pubs, said it was important to show customers that they were open and safe. But he said they were facing a ""huge hurdle"" in convincing people to return to the hospitality industry. ""It's very worrying how quiet Edinburgh city centre, the Grassmarket, is at the moment,"" he added. ""Trying to persuade people to come back when they have been told to stay at home and not to socialise is the biggest job by far to overcome."" The opening of beer gardens and outdoor cafes comes after a series of lockdown measures were lifted, including thefive mile recreational travel rule for all but part of Dumfries and Galloway. Children under 11 no longer have to physically distance from each other or from adults,meaning they can now hug their grandparents. Non-essential shops have also reopened but from Friday it will be mandatory for almost everyone to wear aface covering in stores. The first minister has also outlined plans to reduce the 2m distancing rule to 1m in certain circumstances and with safeguards. She told BBC Scotland she was keen to restart the economy but nervous about relaxing restrictions. ""All of us want to see the economy moving again, all of us want to see life return to as close to normal as is possible, but that will only be possible if we all act in a way that keeps the virus at bay,"" she said. ""Because if it starts to run out of control again, then we have to go back to square one."" Ms Sturgeon said the outbreak in the area around Annan and Gretna in Dumfries and Galloway showed how infectious the virus was. She said people should look out for the new safety measures in beer gardens and cafes and follow theFACTS safety guidance,externalwhen out in the community. Staff wore protective visors as they served pints at the SWG3 beer garden in Glasgow Tables were filling up at the Outhouse in Edinburgh on Monday Emma McLarkin of the Scottish Beer and Pub Association said Monday marked an important milestone, but said most pubs will be waiting until the reopening of indoor areas on 15 July. ""Things will be a little different with added mitigation measures to help protect customers and ensure they feel safe, but they will still be the same places we all know and love,"" she said. ""We all have a shared interest in continuing to suppress the virus and the pub sector is definitely ready to play our part in welcoming our customers back responsibly."" Meanwhile planning regulations are being temporarily relaxed to allow pubs, restaurants and cafes to use areas such as public footpaths for seating and structures like open-sided gazebos. Planning minister Kevin Stewart said the government wanted to ensure the industry could comply with distancing measures and provide a safe and pleasant environment for customers.

Johnson criticised over care homes comments,"This video can not be played PM: ""Too many care homes didn't follow procedures"" Boris Johnson has been accused of trying to shift the blame for coronavirus deaths onto care homes. The prime minister said on Monday that ""too many care homes didn't really follow the procedures"". His words sparked fury in the care home sector, with one charity boss calling them ""clumsy and cowardly"". Health secretary Matt Hancock said care homes had done ""amazing work"" during the crisis and rejected Labour calls to apologise for the PM's remark. ""The PM was explaining that because asymptomatic transmission was not known about, the correct procedures were therefore not known,"" Mr Hancock said in the House of Commons. He said the government had been been ""constantly learning about this virus from the start and improving procedures all the way through"". Appearing in the House of Lords, Communities Minister Lord Greenhalgh admitted that the guidance given to care homes during the early stages of the pandemic was ""not as clear as it could have been"". What guidance did care homes get? Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss When did care homes go into lockdown? And a No 10 spokesman said the PM would not be apologising for his remarks, and said the government had ""put in place rigorous testing and additional funding"". But Mark Adams, who runs the charity Community Integrated Care, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister's comments were ""cowardly"" and a ""travesty of leadership"". He added: ""If this is genuinely his view, I think we're almost entering a Kafkaesque alternative reality where the government sets the rules, we follow them, they don't like the results, they then deny setting the rules and blame the people that were trying to do their best."" Nearly20,000 people are confirmed to have died of coronavirusin care homes in England and Wales since the beginning of the outbreak. The National Care Forum said Mr Johnson's remarks were ""frankly hugely insulting"" to care workers. Vic Rayner, executive director of the forum which represents 120 social care charities, told BBC Newsnight that care homes followed the guidance ""to the letter"" but the government's attention was focused on hospitals. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to apologise for the prime minister's ""crass remarks"". ""Care providers were sent conflicting guidance throughout this outbreak, staff could not access testing until mid-April and are still not tested routinely, PPE supplies have been inadequate, thousands of families have lost their loved ones in care homes to this disease, care workers themselves have died on the front line,"" he said during an urgent question to Mr Hancock in the Commons. ""Can he understand why people are so insulted by the PM's remarks when he said too many care homes didn't really follow the procedures?"" Behind the scenes in the government, there is a frustration the care sector has escaped largely blame free from the crisis. Care homes are not government-run. On the whole they are owned and operated by private firms. As you would expert in a network of more than 14,000 homes there is a variation in performances and practices. Not all care homes have seen outbreaks - and that, of course, means questions should be asked. But the sector is right to complain that guidance, certainly at the start, was changing all the time. The big national effort on PPE was focused on the NHS, leaving some homes severely lacking in equipment as their supply chains dried up or could not cope. The roll-out of testing was slow - it is only now that residents and staff are to get regular testing, vital if those who are infected but don't show symptoms are to be spotted. This virus is very tricky to contain and the UK is not alone in struggling to protect care homes. But no debate would be complete without mention of funding. The overhaul of the system has been talked about for years, but nothing has been done, leaving some services in a precarious position. The virus has certainly exploited that. It comes as the Care England, the largest body representing independent care homes, accused the government of dragging its feet over issuing new guidance for visitors to care homes. Chief executive Martin Green said: ""We are at a loss to know why the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is incapable of making swift decisions at a time of crisis. ""As the country unlocks, care providers are in the dark as to what is permissible in terms of visitors to their residents, or indeed residents leaving their homes on visits. ""This should have been a priority for the DHSC given that care homes are central to fighting this dreadful pandemic"". Imelda Redmond - the national director of Healthwatch England which champions health and social care users - told BBC Radio 4 that ""the issues that underlie all of this have been there for a long time"". ""There has been underinvestment in social care for many years - and there needs to be quite significant amounts of reform - all those fault lines have been laid bare in this pandemic. ""We need to get a grip to this before we enter winter and perhaps a second wave."" NHS England head Sir Simon Stevens told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sundaythat coronavirus had shone a ""very harsh spotlight"" on the ""resilience"" of the care system. Asked on Monday about Sir Simon's comments, Mr Johnson said: ""One of the things the crisis has shown is we need to think about how we organise our social care package better and how we make sure we look after people better who are in social care. ""We discovered too many care homes didn't really follow the procedures in the way that they could have but we're learning lessons the whole time."" Ahead of December's election, the Conservatives pledged an extra Â£1bn per year for social care in England over the next five years. The government has given an extra Â£3.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funds to English councils, which can be put towards helping with social care costs. Ministers have also promised an additional Â£600m for care homes to help with controlling infections. How do you think care homes have handled the coronavirus crisis?

He said the government had been been ""constantly learning about this virus from the start and improving procedures all the way through"". Appearing in the House of Lords, Communities Minister Lord Greenhalgh admitted that the guidance given to care homes during the early stages of the pandemic was ""not as clear as it could have been"". What guidance did care homes get? Social care reform needed within a year - NHS boss When did care homes go into lockdown? And a No 10 spokesman said the PM would not be apologising for his remarks, and said the government had ""put in place rigorous testing and additional funding"". But Mark Adams, who runs the charity Community Integrated Care, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the prime minister's comments were ""cowardly"" and a ""travesty of leadership"". He added: ""If this is genuinely his view, I think we're almost entering a Kafkaesque alternative reality where the government sets the rules, we follow them, they don't like the results, they then deny setting the rules and blame the people that were trying to do their best."" Nearly20,000 people are confirmed to have died of coronavirusin care homes in England and Wales since the beginning of the outbreak. The National Care Forum said Mr Johnson's remarks were ""frankly hugely insulting"" to care workers. Vic Rayner, executive director of the forum which represents 120 social care charities, told BBC Newsnight that care homes followed the guidance ""to the letter"" but the government's attention was focused on hospitals. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the government to apologise for the prime minister's ""crass remarks"". ""Care providers were sent conflicting guidance throughout this outbreak, staff could not access testing until mid-April and are still not tested routinely, PPE supplies have been inadequate, thousands of families have lost their loved ones in care homes to this disease, care workers themselves have died on the front line,"" he said during an urgent question to Mr Hancock in the Commons. ""Can he understand why people are so insulted by the PM's remarks when he said too many care homes didn't really follow the procedures?"" Behind the scenes in the government, there is a frustration the care sector has escaped largely blame free from the crisis. Care homes are not government-run. On the whole they are owned and operated by private firms. As you would expert in a network of more than 14,000 homes there is a variation in performances and practices. Not all care homes have seen outbreaks - and that, of course, means questions should be asked. But the sector is right to complain that guidance, certainly at the start, was changing all the time. The big national effort on PPE was focused on the NHS, leaving some homes severely lacking in equipment as their supply chains dried up or could not cope. The roll-out of testing was slow - it is only now that residents and staff are to get regular testing, vital if those who are infected but don't show symptoms are to be spotted. This virus is very tricky to contain and the UK is not alone in struggling to protect care homes. But no debate would be complete without mention of funding. The overhaul of the system has been talked about for years, but nothing has been done, leaving some services in a precarious position. The virus has certainly exploited that. It comes as the Care England, the largest body representing independent care homes, accused the government of dragging its feet over issuing new guidance for visitors to care homes. Chief executive Martin Green said: ""We are at a loss to know why the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is incapable of making swift decisions at a time of crisis. ""As the country unlocks, care providers are in the dark as to what is permissible in terms of visitors to their residents, or indeed residents leaving their homes on visits. ""This should have been a priority for the DHSC given that care homes are central to fighting this dreadful pandemic"". Imelda Redmond - the national director of Healthwatch England which champions health and social care users - told BBC Radio 4 that ""the issues that underlie all of this have been there for a long time"". ""There has been underinvestment in social care for many years - and there needs to be quite significant amounts of reform - all those fault lines have been laid bare in this pandemic. ""We need to get a grip to this before we enter winter and perhaps a second wave."" NHS England head Sir Simon Stevens told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sundaythat coronavirus had shone a ""very harsh spotlight"" on the ""resilience"" of the care system. Asked on Monday about Sir Simon's comments, Mr Johnson said: ""One of the things the crisis has shown is we need to think about how we organise our social care package better and how we make sure we look after people better who are in social care. ""We discovered too many care homes didn't really follow the procedures in the way that they could have but we're learning lessons the whole time."" Ahead of December's election, the Conservatives pledged an extra Â£1bn per year for social care in England over the next five years. The government has given an extra Â£3.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funds to English councils, which can be put towards helping with social care costs. Ministers have also promised an additional Â£600m for care homes to help with controlling infections. How do you think care homes have handled the coronavirus crisis?

We're pausing now until tomorrow morning - but before we go, here's a summary of the day's global headlines. Our live coverage on coronavirus today will soon come to a close, do join us again tomorrow. On our team today were: Vicky Baker, Owen Amos, Yvette Tan, Krutika
Pathi, Max Matza, Gareth Evans, Mary OâConnor, Ashitha Nagesh, Alice Evans
and Claire Heald. It was all smiles as people enjoyed a newly-reopened beer garden in Glasgow Here's a summary of the UK headlines as we wind down our coronavirus live page coverage for the evening:   There have been 12 rounds of testing in the Premier League There were no positive results in the latest round of testing for coronavirus in the Premier League. Some 1,973 players and club staff were tested for Covid-19 between 29 June and 5 July. There have now been 12 rounds of testing carried out in the English top flight, with 19 positive results so far. The Premier League season resumed on 17 June after being suspended for 100 days because of the pandemic. As coronavirus spread rapidly around the world, time stood still for the residents of a tiny village in Buckinghamshire. For the miniature inhabitants of Bekonscot model village, life in the 1930s time warp continued as normal, largely unaffected by the pandemic that had gripped the world. It has now welcomed its first visitors since the lockdown was announced in March. You canread more about the openingof the outdoor attraction here. More than 130,000 people have now died of Covid-19 in the US, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. The grim milestone now means that more than twice as many people have died in the US than in Brazil, which has the second-highest death toll. The US has an estimated population of 328m, against Brazil's of around 210m. The US also has almost 2.9 million confirmed cases of coronavirus. New York has the highest death toll of the states, with more than 32,000 deaths - but confirmed cases are now surging in southern states too. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The factmore than a fifth of coronavirus tests done â around 2.5 millionâ have not yet been processed is not as
worrying as it necessarily sounds. Certainly some have had to be
voided, because of a problem in how they were carried out or difficulties in
labs. It is not clear how many this
has affected. But the majority are thought to
be not yet recorded for other, less concerning reasons. A large chunk are kits that have
been posted out, but not yet returned. Some of them will be, but it is
accepted many may not. People could be stockpiling them
or may have requested them and then gone to a testing centre instead. This may seem wasteful, but is
perhaps a price that has to be paid for trying to make tests as easy as
possible to get hold of. A number will be tests that are
still working their way through the system - tests can take 48 hours before
results are recorded. There are also a few hundred
thousand that have been sent out as part of the governmentâs surveillance
programme run by the Office for National Statistics that have not be returned
by participants. Harvard University has announced that it will allow some students to return to campus in autumn. The plan calls for 40% of the student body to return to the Cambridge, Massachusetts campus, and for all first-year pupils to return. All courses will be available online only. Harvard University is one of the top academic institutions in the US and charges tuition fees of over $46,000 (Â£36,000) per year. It's going online has raised questions about whether families are willing to pay such high fees for virtual lessons. Several parents have already filed lawsuits against universities in the US, which closed in March as the country went into lockdown, claiming that their children were denied the education that they had paid for. Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring A viral post on Twitter claims
that Ghislaine Maxwell â a British former girlfriend of convicted paedophile
Jeffrey Epstein â has been diagnosed with coronavirus in a prison in New
Hampshire where she was taken after her arrest. One post has been shared over
72,000 times and it cites, as evidence for its claim, a story from a US
satirical news website - the Brown Valley Observer. The site published a story about
Ms Maxwell and Covid-19 but on the websiteâs âabout usâ page â it says âall
news stories contained within are fictional in natureâ. The idea that she might encounter
some calamity while in custody feeds into existing conspiracy theories about
Jeffrey Epsteinâs death while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Fake news can spread widely on
social media and chat platforms, particularly when people donât click through
to the story after seeing a sensational headline, or stop to consider whether
it is truthful or not. The BBCâs anti-disinformation unitoffers tips on how to spot a fake. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The âsingle biggestâ problem hurdle facing the UK in keeping
the virus suppressed is identifying people who are infected but not coming
forward for testing, the head of NHS Test and Trace in England says. Baroness Dido Harding told the House of Lordsâ Science and
Technology Committee that it's clear there are more cases out there than are
being picked up â although she said this was an issue across the world, because
the nature of the virus means some people have it without showing symptoms. Currently an average of just over 600 cases a day are being
found by the UK's testing programme, but the governmentâs surveillance programme
run by the Office for National Statistics suggests there could actually be over 3,000 a
day. Baroness Harding said NHS Test and Trace was looking at ways to find more
cases, including backward contact tracing. Currently when a person is infected
the contact tracing system focuses on who they may have passed the virus on to - backward tracing looks at whom they may have got it from. Work is also continuing on the app, she said. The BBC
understands one option being pursued is to build features into the app that
alert people to when they have been in areas with high rates of infection, as
well as telling them how they are doing with social distancing by giving them a
daily tally showing the number of close contacts they have had. The hope is
initiatives like these will encourage them to download the app when it is
launched. No date has been given for launch. Millions of coronavirus tests are not being recorded, according
to new data from the UK government. Some 10.5 million tests have been ""made available"" since testing began, but only eight million of those have been ""processed"", the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says. More than two
million tests, or about one in every five tests, are either not being sent back to laboratories or are being voided. ""Some members of the public may order a test and
then for whatever reason they choose not to return that test,"" the prime minister's official spokesman told reporters. He said he had not seen a ""verified number
on this"" when the DHSC figures were put to him. It comes as Downing Street defends its decision to stop publishing daily figures on the number of people being tested - in favour of the number of tests being done. ""DHSC will no longer publish the number of people tested daily anymore and will instead publish the number of daily tests processed,"" the PM's spokesman said. ""This is because the daily people tested statistic only counts new people being tested. For example, someone who is tested in February and then tested again this month will only be counted once."" The testing system in England has been criticised in recent days, after figures showedmany people are still waiting more than 24 hours to get their results- despite the prime minister pledging to make this happen by the end of June. Andan investigation by BBC Panoramalast week found thousands of contact tracers in England failed to trace a single contact in the first three weeks of the test and trace system. Socially-distanced rehearsal at London's Old Vic Now for some reaction to one of the big stories coming from the UK today - the announcement ofa Â£1.57bn support packageto protect the arts during the coronavirus epidemic. The decision followed several weeks of lobbying from theatres, music venues, art galleries and other cultural institutions - many of which said they were on the brink of collapse. And a string of theatres have already announced plans to make staff redundant, after being closed since the virus took hold. While the funding has been warmly welcomed, venues are sounding a note of caution as they await further details on how the money will be allocated and news of when venues will be allowed to reopen. From world-famous composers to local theatre owners, and galleries in London to culture event organisers in Leeds,here's some reaction from across the creative industry. A generous doctor who's been working with Covid-19 patients in New York has reportedly treated A&E nurses in Newcastle to lunch. Dr William Predun, who works in Cold Spring Harbor in Long Island, had spent a year at Newcastle University in 2014 when he was studying for his medical degree. ""He wanted to donate some money for [nurses at Royal Victoria Infirmary] to have lunches because theyâre working so hard, and he asked if I could coordinate it,"" Frank Spence, who owns Frankie and Tony's cafe,told the Newcastle Chronicle.,external âHe gave us $200, which worked out to 50 lunches, and we threw in some free brownies as well.â The nurses, Frank says, were ""really chuffed"".

BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live has been hearing today from people with ongoing problems after having coronavirus. Matt, a 40-year-old teacher from Altrincham, caught Covid-19 in March. Fifteen weeks later, he is still dealing with symptoms. âItâs been a rollercoaster journey,â he said. âThe last 100 days Iâve been trapped in my own home, unable to walk more than 100m. âIâve had a never-ending cycle of symptoms ranging from breathing difficulties to a racing heart rate brought on by tiny amounts of exertion. âItâs not only physically tiring and challenging.  Mentally, itâs been extremely difficult coping with the isolation.â Matt has a two-year-old son and a four-year-old daughter. He says not being able to read his daughter has been difficult. âIâve been unable to speak more than a few words so things like reading bedtime stories just havenât been an option. Itâs been difficult losing that contact with her. âShe knows Iâve been ill. Iâve told her so many times Iâm getting better only to be back in bed 20 minutes later. Itâs been really tough on the whole family.â Vietnam has reported 14 new cases of the virus - a very small increase compared to many countries, but it is significant in a country with its track record. More than 80 days have passed since there was a domestically transmitted infection in Vietnam and the country has reported no deaths. Experts say its swift response and subsequent lockdown proved extremely effective. But that doesn't mean there aren't still dangers. All the latest cases were Vietnamese citizens who were in quarantine after returning from abroad. As is the case around the world, health officials are wary that any lapse in the quarantine system could see a new outbreak quickly develop. You can read more about Vietnam's response to Covid-19 here. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News Some of the NHS workers who have died with coronavirus One in 10 Covid-19
infections in England between 26 April and 7 June were among health and social care staff working directly with patients and
residents,an investigation by the Royal Society has concluded,external. One in 10 in-patients acquired their infections in hospitals, the report also says. A lack of protective
equipment at the early stages of the outbreak meant that infection rates in
hospitals were bound to be high. The availability of PPE now means that the spread of
the virus to health and social care workers has decreased. But, according to
the Royal Societyâs expert group, thereâs much more to be done. Their report
highlights a lack of co-ordination and surveillance of the spread of infection
in hospitals in England.  In particular, it calls for
better data collection to understand why ethnic minority staff have been
disproportionately hit by Covid-19. Other recommendations include faster
identification of cases in hospitals, sharing of information with the care
sector and more research to investigate how to drive down infection rates still
further. According to newly released data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Latino and African-Americans are three times more likely to become infected with the coronavirus than white Americans. The data, which tracks640,000 infections detected in nearly 1,000 US counties,external, was released to the New York Times after they filed a freedom-of-information request to the US government for access to the racial statistics. Black and Latino Americans are also twice as likely to die from the virus. There are currently 2.8m people infected with Covid-19 in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University. A US-Canada border checkpoint shown in April, the month after it was first closed More than eight in ten Canadians say the border with the US should remain closed to non-essential travel while their neighbours struggle to contain a growing surge in coronavirus cases. The survey was conducted by Ottawa-based Nanos Research for the Globe and Mail newspaper. Travel between the US and Canada (as well as the US and Mexico) was halted on 21 March. The survey found that 81% of Canadians want the border to stay shut indefinitely, while another 14% said it should reopen, but only in places were infections remain low. Canada has recorded more than 105,000 coronavirus cases as of Sunday, compared to the more than 2.8m in the US. Serbian authorities have brought back restrictions in a number of cities Greece has banned all but essential travel from Serbia as infection numbers steadily rise in the Balkan country. From today, all entry points are closed to Serbian travellers for a week, Greek officials said. It comes days after the Serbian authorities reimposed lockdown restrictions in the capital, Belgrade. In the last 24 hours there have been another 302 infections reported in Serbia, with more than 16,000 total cases and a death toll of 311. For context, in May there were about 50 new cases reported daily. You can read more here. Latest UK government figures show,externala further 16 people have

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Staff at SWG3 are wearing protective visors Drivetime host John Beattie and Aberdeen reporter Davy Shanks have been tasting the atmosphere at Scotland's newly opened beer gardens and finding they have been packed out even on a Monday afternoon. At SWG3 in Glasgow, customers have to book a table on the venue's new mobile app and, when they arrive, have their temperatures checked by thermal body scanners to check for a fever before sitting at their socially distanced table ""bubble"". The extra safety measures have not deterred about 700 people booking into the venue near the River Clyde and its the same story in the Granite City. A queue formed 100m down Union Street from the entrance to Soul Bar, which has built a marquee across the road to accommodate more customers, who have to register in case they need to be contacted following an outbreak.

Staff wore protective visors as they served pints at the SWG3 beer garden in Glasgow Ms Sturgeon has said the public must act responsibly when visiting beer gardens. The first minister told journalists at the daily briefing people must follow guidelines if going to a bar, cafe or restaurant:  The first minister also said people should follow theFACTS safety guidance,externalwhen out in the community. Quarantine checks on people returning to Scotland from abroad are to begin tomorrow. Passengers are supposed to quarantine for 14 days but it emerged at the weekend no one had been contacted to check whether they were actually doing so. Nicola Sturgeon confirmed at the lunchtime briefing the checks would start on Tuesday and said âin an ideal worldâ they would have started before earlier. The first minister also told journalists the Scottish government would announce its decision on air bridge countries as soon as it can with a view to implementing them on 10 July. Derek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports which owns and manages Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports, said since the quarantine policy was put in place ""thousands of jobs within our aviation and tourism sectors have been lost"". The the fact the policy has not even been enforced means recovery plans have been stifled unnecessarily, Mr Provan added and he called for clarity on air bridges urgently. Glasgow's King's Theatre vows to re-enter the world stage A Â£1.57bn emergency support package to help protect the future of theatres, galleries and museums will not be enough to save every job, the culture secretary says. Oliver Dowden said grants and loans would aim to preserve ""crown jewels"" in the arts sector, and many local venues. It follows several weeks of pressure, with industry leaders warning that many venues were on the brink of collapse. Independent cinemas, heritage sites and music venues will also be eligible.

However, she stressed this was ""about public health"", not ""whether people in England are welcome in Scotland"". There are currently no plans to impose quarantine or any other kind of restrictions on travellers from the rest of the UK into Scotland, and there has been no formal discussion on whether they should be introduced.

The academic and author told an online show that slavery was not genocide as ""so many damn blacks"" had survived. His comments were widely condemned and saw him lose several university posts. Cambridge University's Fitzwilliam College, Canterbury Christ Church University and The Mary Rose Trust were among the organisations to cut ties with him. Starkey made the offensive remarks in an episode of Darren Grimes's Reasoned, entitled ""Dr David Starkey: Black Lives Matter Aims To Delegitimate British History."" Grimes, a conservative commentator, also distanced himself from his guest's remarks, saying he rejected what Starkey said on his YouTube show ""in the strongest possible terms"". In a statement released on Monday, Starkey said he had ""paid a heavy price for one offensive word with the loss of every distinction and honour acquired in a long career"". Speaking about his use of the phrase ""so many damn blacks"", he said: ""It was intended to emphasise, in hindsight with awful clumsiness, the numbers who survived the horrors of the slave trade. Instead, it came across as a term of racial abuse. ""This, in the present atmosphere, where passions are high and feelings raw, was deplorably inflammatory. It was a bad mistake."" Former chancellor Sajid Javid condemned Starkey's remarks He added: ""I am very sorry for it and I apologise unreservedly for the offence it caused. ""Moreover, this misunderstanding of my words in no way reflects my views or practice on race. ""I have lived and worked happily and without conflict in multicultural London for almost 50 years and I spent much of the podcast discussing bi-culturalism as a key to the success of Britain's multicultural society."" Starkey quits university role over slavery comment David Starkey criticised over slavery comments Starkey's original interview sparked a backlash, including from former chancellor Sajid Javid, who said Starkey's ""racist"" comments were a ""reminder of the appalling views that still exist"". Publisher HarperCollins said he had expressed ""abhorrent,external"" views and added it would no longer publish any of his books. During the original discussion, Starkey said slavery ""was not genocide"" because ""otherwise there wouldn't be so many damn blacks in Africa or Britain would there? An awful lot of them survived."" Starkey said he had spoken ""with awful clumsiness"" He also claimed that the Black Lives Matter protests, following the death of George Floyd, had been characterised by ""violence"", ""victimhood"" and the ""deranged"" pulling down of statues. He continued: ""As for the idea that slavery is this kind of terrible disease that dare not speak its name, it only dare not speak its name, Darren, because we settled it nearly 200 years ago. ""We don't normally go on about the fact that Roman Catholics once upon a time didn't have the vote and weren't allowed to have their own churches because we had Catholic emancipation."" In his statement, Starkey said free speech was ""central"" to British history and that he feared his ""blundering use of language"" would ""restrict the opportunities for proper debate"". ""For it is only open debate that will heal the divisions in our society that the Black Lives Matter movement has both exposed and expressed,"" he concluded.

Sprinter considers suing police over car stop,"Bianca Williams won European and Commonwealth gold in the 4x100m relay in 2018 Met Police bosses say they want to speak to a Team GB sprinter who is accusing officers of racially profiling her in a stop and search. Bianca Williams and Ricardo dos Santos, a Portuguese 400m runner, were stopped in Maida Vale, west London on Saturday. Ms Williams, whose three-month-old son was in the car at the time, called it an ""awful experience"". Cdr Helen Harper said she was ""really keen"" to speak to the couple ""to discuss... the concerns they have"". The Met had said that officers were patrolling the area in which Ms Williams was stopped because of an increase in youth violence. But the European and Commonwealth Games gold medallist believes the couple were targeted because they are black and were driving a Mercedes. What are my rights if I'm stopped and searched? ""They [the officers] said there's a lot of youth violence and stabbings in the area and that the car looked very suspicious,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""They see a black male driving a nice car, an all-black car, and they assume that he was involved in some sort of gang, drug, violence problem."" This video can not be played Footage of the stop was shared widely on Twitter after being posted by former Olympic 100m champion Linford Christie, who questioned why the vehicle had been targeted In a statement on Sunday evening the Met said the Mercedes was stopped after it was seen driving suspiciously, including being on the wrong side of the road, and that the driver had sped off when asked to stop. But this was rejected by Ms Williams, who said: ""That is false, we were never on the wrong side of the road. We were driving down through single-width roads. ""We only found out about us driving on the wrong side of the road once they tweeted. ""This isn't the first or fourth or fifth time, it must be about the 10th. It's getting ridiculous. ""We are planning on taking it down the legal route. I feel very hurt by their actions, and to witness my partner being taken away and for me to be taken away from my son,my heart hurts."" Mr Dos Santos and Ms Williams say police handcuffed them while their son was in the car The Met said officers from the Directorate of Professional Standards had reviewed footage from social media and officers' bodycams and were satisfied there was no concern around the officers' conduct during the stop and search of the two athletes. ""That does not mean there isn't something to be learnt from every interaction we have with the public,"" Cdr Helen Harper said. ""We want to listen to, and speak with, those who raise concerns, to understand more about the issues raised and what more we can do to explain police actions. ""Where we could have interacted in a better way, we need to consider what we should have done differently and take on that learning for the future."" Social media clips of police incidents must be treated with great care. Often what you see is a short segment of an event that has gone on for some time; background information and context are seldom provided. In this case, there are conflicting accounts as to what happened and why - which only an investigation is likely to resolve. Nevertheless, the incident has reignited claims stop and search is being targeted at black people, particularly young men, and has given rise to concerns that handcuffs are being deployed unnecessarily, despite police guidance saying they should not be. It appears the tactic, which Scotland Yard says has helped to reduce knife violence in London, remains as controversial and divisive as it's always been. Speaking at a remote hearing of the House of Commons Human Rights Committee earlier, Baroness Lawrence said it was ""ludicrous"" that black people could not drive around in expensive cars. ""Stop and search will continue to be an element young people go through on a day-to-day basis,"" said the campaigner, whose murdered son wasfailed by an ""institutionally racist"" Met Police. ""And when they are stopped, it is not just one officer or two officers, you have six or seven officers standing around one individual, a young person who is probably frightened to death because he doesn't know what is going to happen to him. ""So if now people have mobile phones and start recording what is happening to them, we have the issues where police say it is one thing and the individual says it's another, and the authority believes the police over the individual. ""That is something that continues to happen."" This video can not be played The mother of Stephen Lawrence described being stopped by police while driving home after midnight London mayor Sadiq Khan said he took allegations of racial profiling ""extremely seriously"" and he had raised the case with the Met. The Independent Office for Police Complaints said it has not yet received an official complaint. Doreen Lawrence recalls being stopped by police.

"Pret A Manger to shut 30 shops and cut 1,000 jobsThe sandwich chain said the coronavirus downturn in trading meant it had to take a ""difficult decision"".BusinessComments","Sandwich chain Pret A Manger is to close 30 outlets and is expected to cut at least 1,000 jobs at other shops as part of a post-pandemic restructuring. The company said the impact of coronavirus on trading meant it had to make a ""difficult decision"". Pret said it needed to reduce headcount across its UK shops to ""reflect lower footfall, rental costs and new safety measures"". It did not say how many jobs would go, but a source confirmed more than 1,000. About 330 jobs will be lost with the closure of the 30 shops. Pret said 339 of its 410 shops have so far reopened following the easing of lockdown restrictions. But trading remains slow, with sales down 74% from a year earlier, the company said. Pret is thought to be losing about Â£20m a month. Chief executive Pano Christou said: ""It's a sad day for the whole Pret family, and I'm devastated that we will be losing so many employees. But we must make these changes to adapt to the new retail environment. ""Our goal now is to bring Pret to more people, through different channels and in new ways, enabling us to grow once more in the medium term."" Restaurants are 'hurting', says Deliveroo boss UK firms slash more than 12,000 jobs in two days Fears of job cuts at Pret a Manger as sales plunge Is your job at risk?Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Pret is reliant on sales from commuters and lunchtime office workers, which are sources of revenue acutely affected by the lockdown. The company is broadening its sales with a retail coffee initiative with Amazon and a delivery partnership with Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats. There are also click and collect trials in five shops in London. Pret said sales across these digital channels have already grown 480% year-on-year, and now represent over 8% of total UK sales. The company is in talks with landlords about reducing its rent bill. In May, it appointed advisory firms to help restructure the business, and in April it raised â¬100m (Â£90m) in emergency funding from its banks. Pret, which owns 550 outlets globally employing 13,000 staff, including 8,000 in the UK, is the latest High Street food chain to announce cuts. Last week, SSP Group, which runs Upper Crust and Ritazza,said it would cut 5,000 staff, more than half its UK workforce. In addition, The Restaurant Group, which runs Frankie & Benny's and Wagamama, and Cafe Rouge-owner Casual Dining Group, have announced more than 4,500 job cuts between them.

"Emergency money for culture 'won't save every job'Oliver Dowden says the aid for theatres, gig venues and museums aims to preserve culture's ""crown jewels"".","This video can not be played How theatre can reopen during the pandemic A Â£1.57bn emergency support package to help protect the future of theatres, galleries and museums will not be enough to save every job, the culture secretary says. Oliver Dowden said grants and loans would aim to preserve ""crown jewels"" in the arts sector, and many local venues. It follows several weeks of pressure, with industry leaders warning that many venues were on the brink of collapse. Independent cinemas, heritage sites and music venues will also be eligible. Mr Dowden said the grants and loans were all ""new money"" and were ""designed to last through this financial year"". He said the two broad aims of the package were to preserve ""crown jewel"" venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and national galleries, while also helping local institutions across the UK. The culture secretary said institutions would have to apply through industry bodies and would be asked to prove how they contributed to wider economic growth. He said the government was confident the emergency package would protect the majority of jobs in the culture sector - but not all. ""Sadly, not everyone is going to be able to survive and not every job is going to be protected and sadly, I will have to be honest with you, of course we will see further redundancies."" Oliver Dowden said the new funding would not be enough to safeguard every job in the culture sector A string of theatres have announced plans to make staff redundant in recent weeks, after being closed since the coronavirus pandemic took hold earlier this year. Adrian Vinken, the chief executive of the Theatre Royal in Plymouth, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""impossible to say"" if the announcement would be enough to prevent up to 100 job losses there until more detail was released. NI to receive Â£33m from UK arts support package Â£59m arts support for Wales 'will protect jobs' The announcement of the new funding comes just two days after theatres across the UK were covered in colourful messages of support. Guidance for a phased return of the performing arts, starting with performances behind closed doors and rehearsals, is expected to be published by the government shortly. The rescue package has been warmly welcomed by many arts leaders, some of whom said they thought it to be at the upper end of what had been hoped for.  Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who has been under pressure from the arts and heritage sector to deliver a meaningful funding solution to a crisis brought about by Covid-19, feels vindicated that his behind-closed-doors approach to negotiations with the Treasury has paid off. As always, the devil will be in the detail. The government has not specified how the money will be divided between competing art forms or regions, nor how the application process will work. There will be winners and losers. And then there's the elephant in the auditorium: when will the rules around social distancing in performing arts venues be relaxed to allow the show to go on? Many theatre producers are baffled by what they see as 'one rule for them, and one rule for us', approach by government, particularly when it comes to travel. Why is it OK for people to sit side-by-side on a train or plane for hours but not in a theatre, which they argue is a much more controllable environment? As far as they are concerned, that is the billion dollar question. The Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester was among those wrapped in messages of support The Â£1.15bn support pot for cultural organisations in England is made up of Â£880m in grants and Â£270m of repayable loans. The government said the loans would be ""issued on generous terms"". Funding will also go to the devolved administrations - Â£33m to Northern Ireland, Â£97m to Scotland and Â£59m to Wales. How have the arts reacted to the govt package? Closed theatres wrapped in messages of support Theatres are 'clinging on' but face precarious future A further Â£100m will be earmarked for national cultural institutions in England and the English Heritage Trust. There will also be Â£120m to restart construction on cultural infrastructure and for heritage construction projects in England that were paused due to the pandemic. The government said decisions on who will get the funding would be made ""alongside expert independent figures from the sector"". 'Challenging' performances like pantomimes may not take place this winter, the culture secretary said Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the money ""will help safeguard the sector for future generations, ensuring arts groups and venues across the UK can stay afloat"". The government described the package as ""the biggest ever one-off investment in UK culture"". Asked if pantomimes will be performed at theatres later this year, Mr Dowden told the Today programme the performances present unique challenges. ""First of all you've got from granny to grandchild - you've got kids screaming [he's behind you] - and all the things we love doing,"" he said. ""It's highly interactive."" ""If we can do it we will - but it looks challenging.""  Â£1.28bnAnnual ticket revenue 290,000Workers employed 34mAnnual visitors Â£133mAnnual VAT payments 70%Jobs at risk He also pointed out the latest funding adds to government schemes including the furlough scheme to safeguard the jobs of workers and VAT deferral and business rate relief to help those running venues. Julian Knight, Conservative chairman of the House of Commons culture select committee, said more action would be needed ""possibly involving more generous tax breaks"". Labour's shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said while she welcomed the ""much-needed"" package, it was ""too little, too late"" for many and urged the government to act quickly to help struggling organisations. Arts Council England, the Royal Opera House, the Music Venue Trust, the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre were among those to welcome the funding. Arts Council chairman Sir Nicholas Serota told BBC News the funding was ""a very good result"".

This announcement gives us the tools to help build a recovery."" Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn govt support package Music Venue Trust chief executive Mark Davyd said it ""warmly welcomes this unprecedented intervention into Britain's world class live music scene"". He added: ""This fund provides the opportunity to stabilise and protect our vibrant and vital network of venues and gives us the time we need to create a plan to safely reopen live music."" Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said it ""hugely welcomed"" the funding. The UK's theatre industry alone employs tens of thousands of people, Oliver Dowden said The chief executives of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris and Lisa Burger, said they ""feel very positive that this major investment will reach and sustain the vital talent and infrastructure"". Simon Rattle, director of the London Symphony Orchestra, called for the money to be ""distributed as fast as possible"". Philippa Childs, head of the Bectu union which supports workers across the media and entertainment industry, said the support package was overdue. She added: ""At long last the government have woken up to our warnings and those of the whole creative sector, that without support, we stood to lose a huge amount of our world-beating creative industries. ""We will now be scrutinising the details of this package to make sure it lives up to the real needs of our sector."" Julia Fawcett, chief executive of the Lowry in Salford, said: ""The announcement of Â£1.57bn of emergency investment in the UK's culture sector is welcome news, but we are fast running out of time. ""This lifeline will come too late for some organisations who have already been forced to close their doors for good or made valued employees redundant."" Some comedians have said the government funding had not taken into account the small comedy clubs on which they rely for their performances. ""I don't think there will be an industry to go back to. The people giving this money don't understand how this industry works,"" said comedian Kiri Pritchard-McClean on BBC Breakfast, ""We have one of the best comedy circuits in the world because we have so many brilliant clubs and you can gig several nights and get good at what you do.

"Emergency money for culture 'won't save every job'Oliver Dowden says the aid for theatres, gig venues and museums aims to preserve culture's ""crown jewels"".Entertainment & Arts","This video can not be played How theatre can reopen during the pandemic A Â£1.57bn emergency support package to help protect the future of theatres, galleries and museums will not be enough to save every job, the culture secretary says. Oliver Dowden said grants and loans would aim to preserve ""crown jewels"" in the arts sector, and many local venues. It follows several weeks of pressure, with industry leaders warning that many venues were on the brink of collapse. Independent cinemas, heritage sites and music venues will also be eligible. Mr Dowden said the grants and loans were all ""new money"" and were ""designed to last through this financial year"". He said the two broad aims of the package were to preserve ""crown jewel"" venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and national galleries, while also helping local institutions across the UK. The culture secretary said institutions would have to apply through industry bodies and would be asked to prove how they contributed to wider economic growth. He said the government was confident the emergency package would protect the majority of jobs in the culture sector - but not all. ""Sadly, not everyone is going to be able to survive and not every job is going to be protected and sadly, I will have to be honest with you, of course we will see further redundancies."" Oliver Dowden said the new funding would not be enough to safeguard every job in the culture sector A string of theatres have announced plans to make staff redundant in recent weeks, after being closed since the coronavirus pandemic took hold earlier this year. Adrian Vinken, the chief executive of the Theatre Royal in Plymouth, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""impossible to say"" if the announcement would be enough to prevent up to 100 job losses there until more detail was released. NI to receive Â£33m from UK arts support package Â£59m arts support for Wales 'will protect jobs' The announcement of the new funding comes just two days after theatres across the UK were covered in colourful messages of support. Guidance for a phased return of the performing arts, starting with performances behind closed doors and rehearsals, is expected to be published by the government shortly. The rescue package has been warmly welcomed by many arts leaders, some of whom said they thought it to be at the upper end of what had been hoped for.  Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who has been under pressure from the arts and heritage sector to deliver a meaningful funding solution to a crisis brought about by Covid-19, feels vindicated that his behind-closed-doors approach to negotiations with the Treasury has paid off. As always, the devil will be in the detail. The government has not specified how the money will be divided between competing art forms or regions, nor how the application process will work. There will be winners and losers. And then there's the elephant in the auditorium: when will the rules around social distancing in performing arts venues be relaxed to allow the show to go on? Many theatre producers are baffled by what they see as 'one rule for them, and one rule for us', approach by government, particularly when it comes to travel. Why is it OK for people to sit side-by-side on a train or plane for hours but not in a theatre, which they argue is a much more controllable environment? As far as they are concerned, that is the billion dollar question. The Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester was among those wrapped in messages of support The Â£1.15bn support pot for cultural organisations in England is made up of Â£880m in grants and Â£270m of repayable loans. The government said the loans would be ""issued on generous terms"". Funding will also go to the devolved administrations - Â£33m to Northern Ireland, Â£97m to Scotland and Â£59m to Wales. How have the arts reacted to the govt package? Closed theatres wrapped in messages of support Theatres are 'clinging on' but face precarious future A further Â£100m will be earmarked for national cultural institutions in England and the English Heritage Trust. There will also be Â£120m to restart construction on cultural infrastructure and for heritage construction projects in England that were paused due to the pandemic. The government said decisions on who will get the funding would be made ""alongside expert independent figures from the sector"". 'Challenging' performances like pantomimes may not take place this winter, the culture secretary said Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the money ""will help safeguard the sector for future generations, ensuring arts groups and venues across the UK can stay afloat"". The government described the package as ""the biggest ever one-off investment in UK culture"". Asked if pantomimes will be performed at theatres later this year, Mr Dowden told the Today programme the performances present unique challenges. ""First of all you've got from granny to grandchild - you've got kids screaming [he's behind you] - and all the things we love doing,"" he said. ""It's highly interactive."" ""If we can do it we will - but it looks challenging.""  Â£1.28bnAnnual ticket revenue 290,000Workers employed 34mAnnual visitors Â£133mAnnual VAT payments 70%Jobs at risk He also pointed out the latest funding adds to government schemes including the furlough scheme to safeguard the jobs of workers and VAT deferral and business rate relief to help those running venues. Julian Knight, Conservative chairman of the House of Commons culture select committee, said more action would be needed ""possibly involving more generous tax breaks"". Labour's shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said while she welcomed the ""much-needed"" package, it was ""too little, too late"" for many and urged the government to act quickly to help struggling organisations. Arts Council England, the Royal Opera House, the Music Venue Trust, the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre were among those to welcome the funding. Arts Council chairman Sir Nicholas Serota told BBC News the funding was ""a very good result"". He said: ""Now it's up to the arts organisations and the Arts Council to make best use of this money and bring the arts back into communities across the county. This announcement gives us the tools to help build a recovery."" Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn govt support package Music Venue Trust chief executive Mark Davyd said it ""warmly welcomes this unprecedented intervention into Britain's world class live music scene"". He added: ""This fund provides the opportunity to stabilise and protect our vibrant and vital network of venues and gives us the time we need to create a plan to safely reopen live music."" Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said it ""hugely welcomed"" the funding. The UK's theatre industry alone employs tens of thousands of people, Oliver Dowden said The chief executives of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris and Lisa Burger, said they ""feel very positive that this major investment will reach and sustain the vital talent and infrastructure"". Simon Rattle, director of the London Symphony Orchestra, called for the money to be ""distributed as fast as possible"". Philippa Childs, head of the Bectu union which supports workers across the media and entertainment industry, said the support package was overdue. She added: ""At long last the government have woken up to our warnings and those of the whole creative sector, that without support, we stood to lose a huge amount of our world-beating creative industries. ""We will now be scrutinising the details of this package to make sure it lives up to the real needs of our sector."" Julia Fawcett, chief executive of the Lowry in Salford, said: ""The announcement of Â£1.57bn of emergency investment in the UK's culture sector is welcome news, but we are fast running out of time. ""This lifeline will come too late for some organisations who have already been forced to close their doors for good or made valued employees redundant."" Some comedians have said the government funding had not taken into account the small comedy clubs on which they rely for their performances. ""I don't think there will be an industry to go back to. The people giving this money don't understand how this industry works,"" said comedian Kiri Pritchard-McClean on BBC Breakfast, ""We have one of the best comedy circuits in the world because we have so many brilliant clubs and you can gig several nights and get good at what you do.

"UK imposes sanctions against human rights abusersNearly 50 people implicated in the most ""notorious"" human rights abuses are to have their assets frozen.UK Politics","The UK is imposing sanctions on 49 people and organisations behind the most ""notorious"" human rights abuses of recent years. Individuals implicated in the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in 2009 will have their UK assets frozen and banned from entering the country. And Saudi Arabian officials involved in the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi are also being targeted. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the move sent a ""clear message"". Speaking in the Commons, the foreign secretary said the UK was taking action against the ""thugs of despots and henchmen of dictators"" as well as stopping those trying to launder their ""blood-drenched ill-gotten gains"". Russia has threatened to retaliate with reciprocal measures and said the sanctions were ""pointless"". ""Russia reserves the right to respond to today's unfriendly decision by the UK on the basis of reciprocity,""the Russian embassy in London said,externalin a statement, adding that the move ""will not improve Russian-British relations"". What are sanctions and why do countries use them? Dead Russian lawyer wins 10-year rights battle UK draws up post-Brexit sanctions plan The sanctions are the first taken,externalindependently by the UK outside the auspices of the UN and EU. Those individuals and organisations subject to immediate sanctions are: 25 Russian nationals involved in the mistreatment and death of lawyerSergei Magnitsky, who uncovered widespread corruption by a group of Russian tax and police officials 20 Saudi nationals involved in the death of journalistJamal Khashoggiin the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Two high-ranking Myanmar military generals involved in the systematic and brutal violence against the Rohingya people and other ethnic minorities Two organisations involved in forced labour, torture and murder in North Korea's gulags Mr Raab said those targeted had been involved in extra-judicial killings, including political assassinations, torture, degrading treatment, forced labour and servitude. Those on the list, which includes a former minister in the Russian interior department and the former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence services, will be stopped from entering the UK, channelling money into the country or profiting from the British economy, through property or other assets they own. ""Today this government and this house sends a very clear message on behalf of the British people that those with blood on their hands, the thugs of despots, the henchman of dictators will not be free to waltz into this country,"" Mr Raab told Parliament. ""The powers enable us to target a wider network of perpetrators including those who facilitate, incite, promote or support any of these crimes and this extends beyond state officials to non-state actors as well."" The UK's new sanctions' regime is significant. It marks the first time Britain has had its own independent scheme focused entirely on tackling human rights abuses. Until now, it has almost always had to act in concert with the EU. The government wants the UK to be seen as a leading defender of international rules and human rights. These sanctions are a central part of that policy. One key test will be whether it can get support from other countries. The United States and Canada have similar schemes, the EU is working on its own version. Sanctions are always more powerful if imposed collectively. What was announced today was merely the first wave of UK sanctions. More are to come and MPs are keen to see some Chinese names on the list. The sanctions may well come at a cost to trade and investment if countries object to seeing their nationals targeted. What is also unclear is how effective they will be in actually deterring human rights abuses. Many of those 47 individuals and two organisations named in the first listing are already subject to US sanctions. We don't know what assets they actually have in London or how often they have come to the UK. But London is a hub of international travel and finance, and officials hope the restrictions will have an impact in the long term. Mr Raab told the BBC the list would be kept under ""constant review"", and the government was ""working already on the on further designations that can be made in due course"". Asked about if it could damage the UK's trading relationship with Saudi Arabia, the foreign secretary said it was ""a matter of moral duty"", adding: ""We can't turn a blind eye to gross violations of human rights. ""We will apply these designations in the countries which we've designated todayâ¦ for countries where we have a relationship, whether it's an ally or other countries that we need to engage with, because that's the world we live in."" But asked if he was avoiding another clash with China by excluding them for the list, Mr Raab said: ""It's pretty clearâ¦  that we are willing to stand up for our vital national interests. But the regime that we have set out is evidence based. ""If we want a positive relationship with Chinaâ¦ the real issue here is one of trust and whether China can be trusted to live up to its international obligations, and its international responsibilities. ""And that's a message that we're telegraphing, along with many of our allies and indeed, many international partners around the world to Beijing,particularly in relation to what we've seen in Hong Kong."" Magnitsky's widow and mother took up the human rights case initially filed by him in Strasbourg Many MPs have long been pushing for a tougher domestic sanctions regime against foreign states accused of human rights abuses, based on the 2013 US Magnitsky Act. Magnitsky, a Moscow lawyer and auditor, died in police custody after accusing Russian tax officials of defrauding Hermitage Capital Management, a British investment firm he was advising. Magnitsky spent 11 months in police custody, during which he sustained injuries which human rights campaigners say were consistent with him being beaten and tortured. His maltreatment has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights, which found in 2019 that he had been deprived of important medical care and the authorities had not complied with their duty to protect life. Dead Russian lawyer wins 10-year rights battle Russian officials subject to sanctions include Aleksey Vasilyevich Anichin, a former interior minister and Oleg Silchenko, a member of the ministry's investigative team who was involved in questioning Magnitsky and who is accused of forced him to retract his allegations of corruption. Mr Raab said he would be meeting Magnitsky's widow Natalia and two children later on Monday to express the UK's ""solidarity"" with them and the nightmare they had been through. Bill Browder, co-founder and chief executive of Hermitage Capital, said the action represented ""a huge milestone in our 10 year campaign for justice"". Saudi officials involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi are among those targeted Mr Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was killed by a team of Saudi agents in what the Saudi authorities described as a ""rogue operation"" that went wrong. In December 2019, a court in Saudi Arabia sentenced five people to death and jailed three others but the process was condemned by foreign governments and the UN, which said it represented ""the antithesis of justice"". What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? Among those targeted by the UK, include Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Al Asiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence services and Saud Abdullah Al Qahtani, a former advisor to Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud, who is said to have ""planned and directed the killing"". Also on the list is Salah Muhammed Al Tubaigy, a government doctor present at the time of the killing and a number of intelligence officers also present in Istanbul said to have concealed evidence about the killing. Labour, which has been critical of the UK's relationship with Saudi Arabia, particularly in relation to the war in Yemen, said it welcomed action against those responsible for the ""appalling"" murder. The UK is also taking action against two senior generals in the Myanmar army, over the state's suppression of the minority Muslim Rohingya population in Rakhine state, a campaign of violence in 2017 and 2019 that campaigners have said amounts to attempted genocide. They are Min Aung Hlaing, Commander in Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces and his deputy Soe Win, who the UK says carry ultimate responsibility for unlawful killings, torture, forced labour and systematic rape. The North Korea organisations targeted are the Ministry of State Security Bureau 7 and the Ministry of People's Security Correctional Bureau, which have responsibility for running prison camps. The Foreign Office said its new sanctions regime, underpinned by legislation passed in 2018, could be extended in future to encompass individuals and governments guilty of corruption. The UK is required by law to enforce existing EU sanctions it is a party to until the end of the transition period on 1 January 2021. The government has said it will maintain these after that date and also existing UN sanctions.

"Emergency money for culture 'won't save every job'Oliver Dowden says the aid for theatres, gig venues and museums aims to preserve culture's ""crown jewels"".Entertainment & ArtsComments","This video can not be played How theatre can reopen during the pandemic A Â£1.57bn emergency support package to help protect the future of theatres, galleries and museums will not be enough to save every job, the culture secretary says. Oliver Dowden said grants and loans would aim to preserve ""crown jewels"" in the arts sector, and many local venues. It follows several weeks of pressure, with industry leaders warning that many venues were on the brink of collapse. Independent cinemas, heritage sites and music venues will also be eligible. Mr Dowden said the grants and loans were all ""new money"" and were ""designed to last through this financial year"". He said the two broad aims of the package were to preserve ""crown jewel"" venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and national galleries, while also helping local institutions across the UK. The culture secretary said institutions would have to apply through industry bodies and would be asked to prove how they contributed to wider economic growth. He said the government was confident the emergency package would protect the majority of jobs in the culture sector - but not all. ""Sadly, not everyone is going to be able to survive and not every job is going to be protected and sadly, I will have to be honest with you, of course we will see further redundancies."" Oliver Dowden said the new funding would not be enough to safeguard every job in the culture sector A string of theatres have announced plans to make staff redundant in recent weeks, after being closed since the coronavirus pandemic took hold earlier this year. Adrian Vinken, the chief executive of the Theatre Royal in Plymouth, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""impossible to say"" if the announcement would be enough to prevent up to 100 job losses there until more detail was released. NI to receive Â£33m from UK arts support package Â£59m arts support for Wales 'will protect jobs' The announcement of the new funding comes just two days after theatres across the UK were covered in colourful messages of support. Guidance for a phased return of the performing arts, starting with performances behind closed doors and rehearsals, is expected to be published by the government shortly. The rescue package has been warmly welcomed by many arts leaders, some of whom said they thought it to be at the upper end of what had been hoped for.  Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who has been under pressure from the arts and heritage sector to deliver a meaningful funding solution to a crisis brought about by Covid-19, feels vindicated that his behind-closed-doors approach to negotiations with the Treasury has paid off. As always, the devil will be in the detail. The government has not specified how the money will be divided between competing art forms or regions, nor how the application process will work. There will be winners and losers. And then there's the elephant in the auditorium: when will the rules around social distancing in performing arts venues be relaxed to allow the show to go on? Many theatre producers are baffled by what they see as 'one rule for them, and one rule for us', approach by government, particularly when it comes to travel. Why is it OK for people to sit side-by-side on a train or plane for hours but not in a theatre, which they argue is a much more controllable environment? As far as they are concerned, that is the billion dollar question. The Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester was among those wrapped in messages of support The Â£1.15bn support pot for cultural organisations in England is made up of Â£880m in grants and Â£270m of repayable loans. The government said the loans would be ""issued on generous terms"". Funding will also go to the devolved administrations - Â£33m to Northern Ireland, Â£97m to Scotland and Â£59m to Wales. How have the arts reacted to the govt package? Closed theatres wrapped in messages of support Theatres are 'clinging on' but face precarious future A further Â£100m will be earmarked for national cultural institutions in England and the English Heritage Trust. There will also be Â£120m to restart construction on cultural infrastructure and for heritage construction projects in England that were paused due to the pandemic. The government said decisions on who will get the funding would be made ""alongside expert independent figures from the sector"". 'Challenging' performances like pantomimes may not take place this winter, the culture secretary said Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the money ""will help safeguard the sector for future generations, ensuring arts groups and venues across the UK can stay afloat"". The government described the package as ""the biggest ever one-off investment in UK culture"". Asked if pantomimes will be performed at theatres later this year, Mr Dowden told the Today programme the performances present unique challenges. ""First of all you've got from granny to grandchild - you've got kids screaming [he's behind you] - and all the things we love doing,"" he said. ""It's highly interactive."" ""If we can do it we will - but it looks challenging.""  Â£1.28bnAnnual ticket revenue 290,000Workers employed 34mAnnual visitors Â£133mAnnual VAT payments 70%Jobs at risk He also pointed out the latest funding adds to government schemes including the furlough scheme to safeguard the jobs of workers and VAT deferral and business rate relief to help those running venues. Julian Knight, Conservative chairman of the House of Commons culture select committee, said more action would be needed ""possibly involving more generous tax breaks"". Labour's shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said while she welcomed the ""much-needed"" package, it was ""too little, too late"" for many and urged the government to act quickly to help struggling organisations. Arts Council England, the Royal Opera House, the Music Venue Trust, the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre were among those to welcome the funding. Arts Council chairman Sir Nicholas Serota told BBC News the funding was ""a very good result"". He said: ""Now it's up to the arts organisations and the Arts Council to make best use of this money and bring the arts back into communities across the county. This announcement gives us the tools to help build a recovery."" Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn govt support package Music Venue Trust chief executive Mark Davyd said it ""warmly welcomes this unprecedented intervention into Britain's world class live music scene"". He added: ""This fund provides the opportunity to stabilise and protect our vibrant and vital network of venues and gives us the time we need to create a plan to safely reopen live music."" Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said it ""hugely welcomed"" the funding. The UK's theatre industry alone employs tens of thousands of people, Oliver Dowden said The chief executives of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris and Lisa Burger, said they ""feel very positive that this major investment will reach and sustain the vital talent and infrastructure"". Simon Rattle, director of the London Symphony Orchestra, called for the money to be ""distributed as fast as possible"". Philippa Childs, head of the Bectu union which supports workers across the media and entertainment industry, said the support package was overdue. She added: ""At long last the government have woken up to our warnings and those of the whole creative sector, that without support, we stood to lose a huge amount of our world-beating creative industries. ""We will now be scrutinising the details of this package to make sure it lives up to the real needs of our sector."" Julia Fawcett, chief executive of the Lowry in Salford, said: ""The announcement of Â£1.57bn of emergency investment in the UK's culture sector is welcome news, but we are fast running out of time. ""This lifeline will come too late for some organisations who have already been forced to close their doors for good or made valued employees redundant."" Some comedians have said the government funding had not taken into account the small comedy clubs on which they rely for their performances. ""I don't think there will be an industry to go back to. The people giving this money don't understand how this industry works,"" said comedian Kiri Pritchard-McClean on BBC Breakfast, ""We have one of the best comedy circuits in the world because we have so many brilliant clubs and you can gig several nights and get good at what you do. But these institutions are not being helped.""

UK sanctions regime to target human rights abusers,"The UK is imposing sanctions on 49 people and organisations behind the most ""notorious"" human rights abuses of recent years. Individuals implicated in the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in 2009 will have their UK assets frozen and banned from entering the country. And Saudi Arabian officials involved in the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi are also being targeted. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the move sent a ""clear message"". Speaking in the Commons, the foreign secretary said the UK was taking action against the ""thugs of despots and henchmen of dictators"" as well as stopping those trying to launder their ""blood-drenched ill-gotten gains"". Russia has threatened to retaliate with reciprocal measures and said the sanctions were ""pointless"". ""Russia reserves the right to respond to today's unfriendly decision by the UK on the basis of reciprocity,""the Russian embassy in London said,externalin a statement, adding that the move ""will not improve Russian-British relations"". What are sanctions and why do countries use them? Dead Russian lawyer wins 10-year rights battle UK draws up post-Brexit sanctions plan The sanctions are the first taken,externalindependently by the UK outside the auspices of the UN and EU. Those individuals and organisations subject to immediate sanctions are: 25 Russian nationals involved in the mistreatment and death of lawyerSergei Magnitsky, who uncovered widespread corruption by a group of Russian tax and police officials 20 Saudi nationals involved in the death of journalistJamal Khashoggiin the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Two high-ranking Myanmar military generals involved in the systematic and brutal violence against the Rohingya people and other ethnic minorities Two organisations involved in forced labour, torture and murder in North Korea's gulags Mr Raab said those targeted had been involved in extra-judicial killings, including political assassinations, torture, degrading treatment, forced labour and servitude. Those on the list, which includes a former minister in the Russian interior department and the former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence services, will be stopped from entering the UK, channelling money into the country or profiting from the British economy, through property or other assets they own. ""Today this government and this house sends a very clear message on behalf of the British people that those with blood on their hands, the thugs of despots, the henchman of dictators will not be free to waltz into this country,"" Mr Raab told Parliament. ""The powers enable us to target a wider network of perpetrators including those who facilitate, incite, promote or support any of these crimes and this extends beyond state officials to non-state actors as well."" The UK's new sanctions' regime is significant. It marks the first time Britain has had its own independent scheme focused entirely on tackling human rights abuses. Until now, it has almost always had to act in concert with the EU. The government wants the UK to be seen as a leading defender of international rules and human rights. These sanctions are a central part of that policy. One key test will be whether it can get support from other countries. The United States and Canada have similar schemes, the EU is working on its own version. Sanctions are always more powerful if imposed collectively. What was announced today was merely the first wave of UK sanctions. More are to come and MPs are keen to see some Chinese names on the list. The sanctions may well come at a cost to trade and investment if countries object to seeing their nationals targeted. What is also unclear is how effective they will be in actually deterring human rights abuses. Many of those 47 individuals and two organisations named in the first listing are already subject to US sanctions. We don't know what assets they actually have in London or how often they have come to the UK. But London is a hub of international travel and finance, and officials hope the restrictions will have an impact in the long term. Mr Raab told the BBC the list would be kept under ""constant review"", and the government was ""working already on the on further designations that can be made in due course"". Asked about if it could damage the UK's trading relationship with Saudi Arabia, the foreign secretary said it was ""a matter of moral duty"", adding: ""We can't turn a blind eye to gross violations of human rights. ""We will apply these designations in the countries which we've designated todayâ¦ for countries where we have a relationship, whether it's an ally or other countries that we need to engage with, because that's the world we live in."" But asked if he was avoiding another clash with China by excluding them for the list, Mr Raab said: ""It's pretty clearâ¦  that we are willing to stand up for our vital national interests. But the regime that we have set out is evidence based. ""If we want a positive relationship with Chinaâ¦ the real issue here is one of trust and whether China can be trusted to live up to its international obligations, and its international responsibilities. ""And that's a message that we're telegraphing, along with many of our allies and indeed, many international partners around the world to Beijing,particularly in relation to what we've seen in Hong Kong."" Magnitsky's widow and mother took up the human rights case initially filed by him in Strasbourg Many MPs have long been pushing for a tougher domestic sanctions regime against foreign states accused of human rights abuses, based on the 2013 US Magnitsky Act. Magnitsky, a Moscow lawyer and auditor, died in police custody after accusing Russian tax officials of defrauding Hermitage Capital Management, a British investment firm he was advising. Magnitsky spent 11 months in police custody, during which he sustained injuries which human rights campaigners say were consistent with him being beaten and tortured. His maltreatment has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights, which found in 2019 that he had been deprived of important medical care and the authorities had not complied with their duty to protect life. Dead Russian lawyer wins 10-year rights battle Russian officials subject to sanctions include Aleksey Vasilyevich Anichin, a former interior minister and Oleg Silchenko, a member of the ministry's investigative team who was involved in questioning Magnitsky and who is accused of forced him to retract his allegations of corruption. Mr Raab said he would be meeting Magnitsky's widow Natalia and two children later on Monday to express the UK's ""solidarity"" with them and the nightmare they had been through. Bill Browder, co-founder and chief executive of Hermitage Capital, said the action represented ""a huge milestone in our 10 year campaign for justice"". Saudi officials involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi are among those targeted Mr Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was killed by a team of Saudi agents in what the Saudi authorities described as a ""rogue operation"" that went wrong. In December 2019, a court in Saudi Arabia sentenced five people to death and jailed three others but the process was condemned by foreign governments and the UN, which said it represented ""the antithesis of justice"". What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? Among those targeted by the UK, include Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Al Asiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence services and Saud Abdullah Al Qahtani, a former advisor to Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud, who is said to have ""planned and directed the killing"". Also on the list is Salah Muhammed Al Tubaigy, a government doctor present at the time of the killing and a number of intelligence officers also present in Istanbul said to have concealed evidence about the killing. Labour, which has been critical of the UK's relationship with Saudi Arabia, particularly in relation to the war in Yemen, said it welcomed action against those responsible for the ""appalling"" murder. The UK is also taking action against two senior generals in the Myanmar army, over the state's suppression of the minority Muslim Rohingya population in Rakhine state, a campaign of violence in 2017 and 2019 that campaigners have said amounts to attempted genocide. They are Min Aung Hlaing, Commander in Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces and his deputy Soe Win, who the UK says carry ultimate responsibility for unlawful killings, torture, forced labour and systematic rape. The North Korea organisations targeted are the Ministry of State Security Bureau 7 and the Ministry of People's Security Correctional Bureau, which have responsibility for running prison camps. The Foreign Office said its new sanctions regime, underpinned by legislation passed in 2018, could be extended in future to encompass individuals and governments guilty of corruption. The UK is required by law to enforce existing EU sanctions it is a party to until the end of the transition period on 1 January 2021. The government has said it will maintain these after that date and also existing UN sanctions.

"Pret A Manger to shut 30 shops and cut 1,000 jobs","Sandwich chain Pret A Manger is to close 30 outlets and is expected to cut at least 1,000 jobs at other shops as part of a post-pandemic restructuring. The company said the impact of coronavirus on trading meant it had to make a ""difficult decision"". Pret said it needed to reduce headcount across its UK shops to ""reflect lower footfall, rental costs and new safety measures"". It did not say how many jobs would go, but a source confirmed more than 1,000. About 330 jobs will be lost with the closure of the 30 shops. Pret said 339 of its 410 shops have so far reopened following the easing of lockdown restrictions. But trading remains slow, with sales down 74% from a year earlier, the company said. Pret is thought to be losing about Â£20m a month. Chief executive Pano Christou said: ""It's a sad day for the whole Pret family, and I'm devastated that we will be losing so many employees. But we must make these changes to adapt to the new retail environment. ""Our goal now is to bring Pret to more people, through different channels and in new ways, enabling us to grow once more in the medium term."" Restaurants are 'hurting', says Deliveroo boss UK firms slash more than 12,000 jobs in two days Fears of job cuts at Pret a Manger as sales plunge Is your job at risk?Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Pret is reliant on sales from commuters and lunchtime office workers, which are sources of revenue acutely affected by the lockdown. The company is broadening its sales with a retail coffee initiative with Amazon and a delivery partnership with Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats. There are also click and collect trials in five shops in London. Pret said sales across these digital channels have already grown 480% year-on-year, and now represent over 8% of total UK sales. The company is in talks with landlords about reducing its rent bill. In May, it appointed advisory firms to help restructure the business, and in April it raised â¬100m (Â£90m) in emergency funding from its banks. Pret, which owns 550 outlets globally employing 13,000 staff, including 8,000 in the UK, is the latest High Street food chain to announce cuts. Last week, SSP Group, which runs Upper Crust and Ritazza,said it would cut 5,000 staff, more than half its UK workforce. In addition, The Restaurant Group, which runs Frankie & Benny's and Wagamama, and Cafe Rouge-owner Casual Dining Group, have announced more than 4,500 job cuts between them.

Boohoo vows to investigate exploitation claims,"Boohoo has said it will investigate one of its suppliers following reports that staff are earning less than the minimum wage amid unsafe working conditions. The Sunday Times reported,externalthat workers at a factory in Leicester making clothes for Boohoo's Nasty Gal brand could expect to be paid Â£3.50 an hour. It also saw little evidence of measures to stop the spread of coronavirus at a time whenLeicester is in lockdown. Boohoo said if the report is true, conditions were ""totally unacceptable"". Leicester: A city fighting fast-fashion sweatshops It comes as the National Crime Agency confirmed it was investigating Leicester's textiles industry over allegations of exploitation, although it did not comment on Boohoo specifically. An NCA spokesman said: ""Within the last few days NCA officers, along with Leicestershire Police and other partner agencies, attended a number of business premises in the Leicester area to assess concerns of modern slavery and human trafficking."" The factory at the centre of the Sunday Times allegations displayed the sign Jaswal Fashions. However, that firm said it had ceased trading in 2018 and was not a supplier to Boohoo. Boohoo also said that Jaswal was not one of its declared suppliers and it appeared that a different firm was using Jaswal's former premises. ""We are currently trying to establish the identity of this company,"" Boohoo said. ""We are taking immediate action to thoroughly investigate how our garments were in their hands, will ensure that our suppliers immediately cease working with this company, and we will urgently review our relationship with any suppliers who have sub-contracted work to the manufacturer in question."" Jaswal Fashions has made clothes for Nasty Gal, which is owned by Boohoo An undercover reporter for the Sunday Times, who got a job at Jaswal Fashions, was told to expect pay of between Â£3.50 and Â£4.00 an hour. The national minimum wage,externalfor people over 25 years-old is Â£8.72 an hour. Few workers at the factory - which was operating during the localised lockdown in Leicester - were found to be wearing face masks to guard against the transmission of the coronavirus. There was also no evidence that social distancing measures had been implemented. Boohoo said that earlier this year it had begun a review of all its garment-makers, including ""a full audit of all of our suppliers' manufacturing facilities"". But former MP Mary Creagh, who investigated the UK's fast-fashion garment industry as chairwoman of the Commons' environmental audit committee, said policing the sector was difficult. Shein apologises for selling Muslim prayer mats ""When you think there are 10,000 workers, there are hundreds of factories and the tendency is when one factory is shut down it just springs up again in a sort of phoenix factory approach,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""They are shut down by authorities on Friday and they start up in a different building with a different name on Monday morning and this is the problem. It is a really difficult issue to tackle, the problem is the system not just the enforcement."" Boohoo's share price tumbled by more than 16% on Monday following the expose. The firm is already under fire after Labour Behind the Label, a workers' rights group, claimed that some employees at factories in Leicester that supply the fast fashion firm were ""being forced to come into work while sick with Covid-19"". At the time Boohoo said it would ""not tolerate any incidence of non-compliance especially in relation to the treatment of workers within our supply chain"". Leicester is currently under local lockdown following a spike in Covid-19 cases. At the weekend,Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidhe was ""very worried about the employment practices in some factories"" in the city. Sales at Boohoo, which trades exclusively online, has surged during the coronavirus lockdown with particular demand for loungewear and so-called athleisure gear. The company recently bought the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse and earlier this year acquired MissPap, Karen Millen and Coast. Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, sales for the year to February rose by 44% to Â£1.2bn and pre-tax profits grew 54% to Â£92.2m. Boohoo's co-founders Mahmud Kamani and Carole Kane were both paid more than Â£1.3m each for the last financial year. They could also share in a bonus of up to Â£150m if certain performance goals are met by 2023. Hancock 'worried' over Leicester factory practices Boohoo 'putting workers at risk of coronavirus' Boohoo swoops again to snap up High Street rivals 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff has welcomed a Â£1.57bn coronavirus
support package for the arts across the UK. The venue, which has warned that 250 jobs are at risk, says it hopes extra funding will ""help us build a more radical and inclusive arts sector once we're able to reopen safely"". The UK government saida total of
Â£59m will come to Wales,with the Welsh Government deciding how the money
is spent. Prime Minister
Boris Johnson said the money will ""help safeguard the sector for future
generations"". But First Minister
Mark Drakeford cast doubt on whether Wales would receive extra funding. He said he would
""wait until Wednesday"" when Chancellor Rishi Sunak sets out
his summer statement, in case any extra cash resulting from the arts announcement is outweighed by money being cut elsewhere. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Owain ClarkeBBC Wales Health Correspondent It is certainly very encouraging news that, for the first time since the middle of March, the daily update from Public Health Wales (PHW) has recorded no newly reported deaths of people with coronavirus. However, given the way the figures are compiled - tagged on to the actual date of death once reported -  there have been previous days where the statistics show no Covid-19 deaths had occurred in Wales. PHW stats - based on those who tested positive - retrospectively show no deaths occurred on 18 June and also on 3, 4, and 5 July, although any deaths reported in coming days may be added to those most recent dates. And the more complete Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures - based on death registration - also show no deaths occurred on 18 June. With very small numbers, the statistics are always likely to bounce around a bit. But the key point will be when the figures show no new deaths here over a longer period of time. No new deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported by Public Health Wales for the first time since March. This graph shows the number of deaths according to the day they happened rather than the day they were announced. No new deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported by Public Health Wales (PHW) for the first time since March. The official total shows 1,531 people in Wales have died with the virus. This map shows the number of deaths reported by each of Wales' health boards. Daytrippers have been making a return to outdoor attractions across Wales, as the ""stay local"" restrictions are lifted. The National Botanic Garden in Carmarthenshire opened its doors for the first time since March, to welcome a steady stream of people to the 230 hectare site. ""Huge thanks to all our members, visitors, staff, volunteers, friends and
 everyone for sticking with us through these strange and difficult times,"" said garden officials. No new deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported by Public Health Wales (PHW) for the first time since March. In total 1,531 people in Wales have been officially confirmed as having died with the virus. PHW's figures published on Monday also showed there were eight new cases reported, meaning 15,898 people have tested positive for Covid-19. It publishes daily statistics of deaths, mostly occurring in hospitals, but only when the virus has been confirmed by laboratories. They do not include deaths of residents from Powys in hospitals over the border in England. The figures for deaths are revised and numbers are added to the correct date retrospectively. The Office for National Statistics also publishes figures but on a weekly basis.These include all
registered deaths, including those in care homes and at home, where Covid-19 is suspected, as well as laboratory-confirmed cases. The Welsh Government is ""not a police force"" making spot checks on who should be following quarantine rules, says the first minister. Travellers returning from several countries, including the United States and Portugal, are asked to self-isolate for 14 days. But Mark Drakeford said it was not their role to enforce the restrictions. ""We are not a police force in the Welsh Government, none of that is devolved to us,"" he told the daily briefing. It follows comments from Scotland's health minister,confirming they had not carried out quarantine checks on passengers arriving there.,external ""Our responsibility is to make sure that those people coming to Wales for
 quarantine purposes get the best public health information we can 
provide to them, so they know what they need to do if they fall ill,"" said Mr Drakeford.  A plan for schools returning after the summer holiday will be published by the end of this term, says Mark Drakeford. The first minister told the daily briefing that ""uniquely in the UK we have children back at school
 in Wales"" and ""we are going to learn the lessons of the last few weeks 
to plan for September"". He said the reports he had read about schools reopening in Wales last 
week showed ""it was a very successful week here in Wales with 
headteachers and teachers learning a lot"" and this ""practical 
experience"" would help inform the return to school plan for September. Just 3.5% of coronavirus tests are coming back positive in Wales, says the first minister. At the peak of the pandemic, 45% of the tests were returned as positive for Covid-19. Mark Drakeford said there remains ""room to do more testing where that is required"". He added: ""We remain in conversations with the BMA [British Medical Association] and others to make sure we make the very best use of the capacity we have.""  Scenes in Soho, London, as pubs opened for Super Saturday The 
First Minister Mark Drakeford says he âhopesâ he won't see scenes of 
large crowds gathering on streets when bars, pubs and restaurants open 
outdoors in Wales next Monday. Mr Drakeford was responding to a question about whether he would 
change his plan to open parts of the outdoors hospitality sector in 
Wales, after large crowds gathered in London's Soho over the 
weekend, when pubs reopened outdoors there. Mr Drakeford said he
 would look âvery carefullyâ at the experience in England over the 
weekend and would draw a ârounded lessonâ from it. He added: âWe want people to have a good time, we want people to be 
able to use the hospitality industry again, but we need us all to do it 
in a way that doesn't cause risks to a rise [in coronavirus] for you and for everybody 
else.â A decision on whether Â£59m from the UK government will be spent on the arts sector in Wales will not be taken before Wednesday, and further announcements from the chancellor, says Wales' first minister. Mark Drakeford said his cabinet would look at the ""whole package made available to Wales"". The arts cash is part of a UK Â£1.5bn package for the creative industries. But the decision on how and where its share is spent in Wales rests with the Welsh Government. Referring to Boris Johnson's announcement last week on Â£5bn in funding for UK infrastructure, Mr Drakeford said ""not a single penny came our way as a result of that"".  First Minister Mark Drakeford says everyone in Wales needs to follow ""the five golden rules"" to tackle coronavirus.  He also set out what he called the ""key dates"" for week ahead:  Wales' first minister says people want to know when beauty salons can 
reopen and when sports such as swimming and junior football can restart
 but he doesn't want to offer anyone ""false hope or the false security 
of far off dates in the future"". Mark Drakeford said he'd taken part in a ""fast and furious Facebook 
Live session"" last week in which people wanted dates for when they could
 go swimming again, when  cricket clubs could play competitive matches, 
when young footballers ""could join their team mates on the pitch"" and 
when business owners could reopen beauty salons and nail bars. He said he hoped provide some answers to those questions this coming Friday. Mr Drakeford said he understood people wanted certainty but added: ""I do not want to offer anyone false hope or the false security of far 
off dates in the future, which may be snatched away at the last moment 
by a virus which could suddenly change course â as we have seen it do 
elsewhere in the world."" ""We must remain hopeful that we are over the worst but we must all 
be realistic that we could yet see a further resurgence of coronavirus 
later in the year, which is why it is so important that we all continue 
to take measures to protect ourselves and our loved ones."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government had ""learned a lot from 
reopening shops"" and this information was being shared with other 
sectors which operate indoors. He said the period of having all children back at school to ""check 
in, catch up and prepare for summer"" will help the government work with 
local authorities and schools to plan for September. He added: ""And, if the conditions allow hairdressers to open by 
appointment following this weekâs review of the regulations, we will to 
use what we learn to extend opening to other parts of the beauty 
sector."" Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford says he is keen to ""restore freedoms"" as soon as possible but only ""cautiously and progressively"". Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said the 
Welsh Government was taking the advice it receives from the World Health
 Organisation (WHO) and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) ""very 
seriously"". He said both organisations have ""underlined the importance of taking a step-by-step approach"" to easing restrictions. The fifth review on the coronavirus regulations will be carried out this week - this needs to be done every 21 days. Mr Drakeford said his government had introduced changes to the 
restrictions ""cautiously and progressively â learning from what we have 
done to enable us to go further, as the conditions allow"". He added: ""On 22 June shops re-opened, on 29 June all pupils returned
 to school ahead of the summer holidays and today, the requirement to 
stay local has been lifted."" Singer Charlotte Church is among those saying there is ""no time to waste"" to save the arts The Â£59m pledged for the arts in Wales from the UK government must be spent on the sector, a letter backed by singer Charlotte Church and scores of others in the creative sector demands. The letter from Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price and culture spokewoman Sian Gwenllian calls on the Welsh Government to use the money ""in full"" on arts in Wales. The money comes to Wales aspart of a Â£1.5bn package for the industry from the UK government, to help organisations decimated by coronavirus restrictions. The Welsh Government has welcomed the announcement, but said it does not commit 
extra cash arising from new spending in England until it has been 
considered by cabinet. Harpist Catrin Finch, comedian Kiri Pritchard-Mclean and the national poet of Wales Ifor ap Glyn are among 70 artists to have signed the letter. ""There is really no time to waste,"" it stated. ""If no action is taken immediately the industry is likely to collapse within a month. ""Thousands of jobs will be lost and the fallout will be irreversible."" Plaid Cymru said it wanted to see an emergency taskforce established to advise the Welsh Government, investment in the economy, and a ""clear plan to recovery"". First Minister Mark Drakeford will deliver the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus update shortly. The 12:30 BST briefing comes asthe ""stay local"" travel guidance is liftedfor the first time since lockdown began in March. People from two separate households are also able to meet indoors and stay overnight with each other as one ""extended household"" from today.

UK government weighs up Huawei ban,"The government has received a report into Huawei that is likely to change its policy over the Chinese firm's role in the UK's telecoms networks. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre had delivered its findings. NCSC is believed to have said it can no longer assure the security of Huawei's products because of new US sanctions. ""We're now examining it and understanding the implications of it,"" Mr Dowden told BBC Radio 4's Today. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has yet to deliver its conclusions to the prime minister, but Boris Johnson said on Monday afternoon that he did not want the country to be ""vulnerable to a high-risk state vendor"". Huawei has said it remains ""open to discussions"". But one of the company's spokesmen took a tougher line over the weekend, following newspaper reports that the government might ban the purchase of new Huawei 5G equipment by the end of the year. ""UK policy is being dictated by [the] Trump administration... shouldn't the US respect a United Kingdom in the post-Brexit era being in a position to chose its own telecommunication strategy?""tweeted Paul Harrison, Huawei's head of international media, UK,external. China's ambassador to the UK has warned that if the country got rid of Huawei, it would send out a wider message about its openness to foreign investment. Huawei's role in the UKseemed to have been settled in January, when the government placed a cap on its market share in mobile and full-fibre fixed-line broadband networks, and excluded its involvement in the most sensitive parts of 5G known as the ""core""'. However, the USsubsequently announced fresh sanctions,externalthat forbid the Chinese firm and the third parties that make its chips from using ""US technology and software to design and manufacture"" its products. Washington claims Huawei is backed by the Chinese military and poses a national security risk, claims the company denies. NCSC has examined the impact of the sanctions, including the fact that they effectively prevent the company from being able to usecritical software to design and simulate chipsbefore their fabrication, as well as stopping third-party manufacturers from being able to use equipment needed to produce some of Huawei's most advanced processors. Why Huawei's days in the UK could be numbered Ministers signal switch in Huawei 5G policy What would happen if the UK ditched Huawei? The risk is that as a consequence Huawei would have to start sourcing chips from elsewhere, which UK security officials might not be able to properly vet. ""Clearly the US sanctions will present challenges and that is what that advice is about,"" Mr Dowden told the BBC. He said a final decision had yet to be taken, but added: ""We want to diversify away from these so called high-risk vendors, of which Huawei is is the principal one... we want to be in a position where we don't have high-risk vendors in our networks at all."" Mr Dowden said he aimed to tell Parliament of any policy change before MPs rose for the summer recess on 22 July. It remains unclear how far the government will go. The Sunday Times reported thatBT and Vodafone had asked to be given until 2030,externalto remove Huawei's equipment from their existing 5G infrastructure. But ex-Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC: ""The government now must act and make sure that Huawei or any other untrusted vendor is never to be in our telecom system."" And one of his allies, Bob Seely MP,told the Telegraph,external: ""2029 is going to be too long for some colleagues, who want to see Huawei out of the system by the end of this parliament."" In theory, the Prime Minister could decide to go further, ordering Huawei's kit to be removed from 3G and 4G networks, and even the tens of thousands of roadside cabinets it is currently sits in providing broadband connectivity. But experts have warned that the cost of this would run into ""billions of pounds"" and would cause major delays to the rollout of full-fibre internet. When asked about this, Mr Johnson said: ""We have to come up with the right technological solutions, but also we will have to make sure that we can continue to deliver the broadband that the UK needs."" A spokesman for the prime minister added that there was ""no change to [the] broadband 2025 target"". Ambassador Liu Xiaoming said a rejection of Huawei would send a ""very bad message"" China's introduction of a controversial security law giving it new powers over Hong Kong, and thesubsequent arrest of some pro-democracy protestersmay put the prime minister under further pressure to take a tough stance. Former Labour business minister Peter Mandelson said the forthcoming US sanctions - which are due to come into effect in September - provided ""a cover"" for the UK to change its position. ""President Trump has undoubtedly succeeded in overturning the government's original decision about Huawei equipment in Britain's 5G network,"" he added. ""This is fundamentally not a question of security. It's a commercial war between the US and China. ""President Trump said he wanted to demolish Huawei, and he's doing so through very draconian sanctions."" But Nigel Inkster, the former director of operations at MI6, told the BBC that the UK needed to avoid becoming ""collateral damage"" of a clash between the two superpowers. ""It's going to be very important for the UK to manoeuvre adroitly to ensure that we don't get forced into making a binary choice in this area, in ways that could be very detrimental to our long-term interest,"" he said. When questioned about the issue, China's ambassador to the UK said the wider Chinese business community was watching to see how the UK handled the case. ""We want to be your friend. We want to be your partner,"" added Liu Xiaoming. ""But if you want to make China a hostile country, you will have to bear the consequences."" On Thursday,MPs will discuss the issue further at the House of Commons science and technology committee,externalwhen it questions Huawei, Vodafone and BT about the implications of a potential ban.

Scottish beer gardens reopen after 15 weeks in lockdown,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Scotland's beer gardens reopen People in Scotland are now able to return to beer gardens and pavement cafes after they opened for the first time in 15 weeks. But customers are being warned that al fresco eating and drinking will not be the same as it was before the lockdown. As well as following strict distancing and hygiene rules, they will have to leave their contact details so they can be traced in the event of an outbreak. Pubs and restaurants should be able to welcome customers indoors from 15 July. That will be part of phase three of theScottish government's route map out of lockdown,external, which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is expected to confirm on Thursday. Business owners warned that their biggest hurdle could be persuading customers that it was safe to go out to eat and drink. Which lockdown rules will change next - and when? Coronavirus in Scotland: How many cases are there? Ms Sturgeon said she had been ""impressed"" with safety precautions that had been put in place at an Edinburgh beer garden she visited, thanking businesses for ""working hard"" to prepare for re-opening. This video can not be played Coronavirus: FM says beer gardens âshould not feel normalâ But she said her ""biggest worry"" was ""complacency"" about coronavirus setting in, and warned: ""This virus has not gone away."" She said: ""If you're out somewhere and there are no clear safety measures in place, you should consider leaving or not going in in the first place. ""If it feels exactly like it was before this pandemic, then something is wrong and measures are not being properly implemented."" Diners will be asked to use their smartphone to scan the QR code to see a menu At the Cold Town House in Edinburgh's Grassmarket, customers must make a reservation to secure a table in their outdoor dining area. Party sizes are limited to six people from two households and they can spend a maximum of one hour and 45 minutes at their table. On arrival, staff will take the contact details of everyone in the group and explain various additional health and safety measures. They will ask them how they want to be served - perhaps by someone wearing a face guard, or at a distance from the table. Nic Wood spoke to the first minister at his venue in the Grassmarket And they will be able to view the menu on their smartphones after accessing it via a QR code. Nic Wood, the managing director of parent company Signature Pubs, said it was important to show customers that they were open and safe. But he said they were facing a ""huge hurdle"" in convincing people to return to the hospitality industry. ""It's very worrying how quiet Edinburgh city centre, the Grassmarket, is at the moment,"" he added. ""Trying to persuade people to come back when they have been told to stay at home and not to socialise is the biggest job by far to overcome."" The opening of beer gardens and outdoor cafes comes after a series of lockdown measures were lifted, including thefive mile recreational travel rule for all but part of Dumfries and Galloway. Children under 11 no longer have to physically distance from each other or from adults,meaning they can now hug their grandparents. Non-essential shops have also reopened but from Friday it will be mandatory for almost everyone to wear aface covering in stores. The first minister has also outlined plans to reduce the 2m distancing rule to 1m in certain circumstances and with safeguards. She told BBC Scotland she was keen to restart the economy but nervous about relaxing restrictions. ""All of us want to see the economy moving again, all of us want to see life return to as close to normal as is possible, but that will only be possible if we all act in a way that keeps the virus at bay,"" she said. ""Because if it starts to run out of control again, then we have to go back to square one."" Ms Sturgeon said the outbreak in the area around Annan and Gretna in Dumfries and Galloway showed how infectious the virus was. She said people should look out for the new safety measures in beer gardens and cafes and follow theFACTS safety guidance,externalwhen out in the community. Staff wore protective visors as they served pints at the SWG3 beer garden in Glasgow Tables were filling up at the Outhouse in Edinburgh on Monday Emma McLarkin of the Scottish Beer and Pub Association said Monday marked an important milestone, but said most pubs will be waiting until the reopening of indoor areas on 15 July. ""Things will be a little different with added mitigation measures to help protect customers and ensure they feel safe, but they will still be the same places we all know and love,"" she said. ""We all have a shared interest in continuing to suppress the virus and the pub sector is definitely ready to play our part in welcoming our customers back responsibly."" Meanwhile planning regulations are being temporarily relaxed to allow pubs, restaurants and cafes to use areas such as public footpaths for seating and structures like open-sided gazebos. Planning minister Kevin Stewart said the government wanted to ensure the industry could comply with distancing measures and provide a safe and pleasant environment for customers.

How have the arts reacted to the govt package?,"Theatres have been unable to open since the UK went into lockdown in March The arts industry has largely welcomed the government's announcement ofwith a Â£1.57bn support package. It followed several weeks of lobbying from theatres, music venues, art galleries and other cultural institutions, many of which said they were on the brink of collapse. While the funding has been warmly welcomed, many venues are sounding a note of caution as they await further details on how the money will be allocated and news of when venues will be allowed to re-open. Culture secretary Oliver Dowden said the package is all ""new money"" and has two broad aims - to preserve ""crown jewel"" venues like the Royal Albert Hall and national galleries, while also helping local institutions across the UK. Here's how the arts sector has reacted to the government's support package. Socially distanced rehearsal at London's Old Vic Freelance theatre directorIan Ricksonsaid: ""First and foremost, we must ensure that this package helps the freelance community. This isn't just famous actors, but stage managers, set builders, wig makers, in fact all the teams who put together the shows. Artists in the theatre need safe ground in order to take risks. ""What people don't know is that a high proportion of these freelancers live below the poverty line or at least with very unstable incomes. Before the pandemic this was difficult enough but freelancers can't be furloughed and a significant proportion don't qualify for SSEIS (the self-employed income support scheme)."" The funding was well-received by composerLord Lloyd-Webber, who said the news is ""truly welcome at a time when so many theatres, orchestras, entertainment venues and other arts organisations face such a bleak future"". Theatre impresarioCameron Mackintoshsaid the news ""was most welcome"" but ""it is now critical that we are given immediate guidance when social distancing will be phased out so we can make firm plans to re-open as soon as practical."" Dame Judi Denchtold BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We all have been anxiously waiting for something and it has come and it is wonderful. ""It will probably be spread very thinly, but nevertheless we are all incredibly grateful that it has come at this time. ""Now we have got to hope that things don't go to the wall."" The Royal Albert Hall's chief executive Craig Hassall described the news as ""an absolute life saver for all of us"". A string of theatres have already announced plans to make staff redundant in recent weeks, after being closed since the coronavirus pandemic took hold earlier this year. This video can not be played How theatre can reopen during the pandemic Adrian Vinken, the chief executive of theTheatre Royal in Plymouthtold BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""impossible to say"" if the announcement would be enough to prevent up to 100 job losses there until more detail is released. ""Until the whole sector knows when we can reopen without social distancing and start trading again... there is no security in the sector whatsoever but hopefully what the government is doing here is giving us that lifeline to keep going until that point is discernible."" NI to receive Â£33m from UK arts support package Â£59m arts support for Wales 'will protect jobs' Nicholas Hytner, former director of the National Theatre and the founder of London's Bridge Theatre, said: ""It's a much better plan than anyone expected. It's the result of joined up, tenacious and detailed lobbying going on under the radar which was listened to with great attention. ""The only proper response is to congratulate them and thank them for the size of the package."" Gavin Barlow, chief executive and artistic director of the Albany performing arts centre in Deptford, London, said: ""As an arts centre with deep roots in our local community in south east London, we see first-hand the difference arts and creativity make to people's lives. ""Although this financial support is welcome, our future remains far from certain. As we emerge from this crisis we believe we have a big part to play in aiding the recovery of the sector as well as supporting people's wellbeing and hope to see more details on how this announcement will support the vital work of arts centres such as the Albany.""  Â£1.28bnAnnual ticket revenue 290,000Workers employed 34mAnnual visitors Â£133mAnnual VAT payments 70%Jobs at risk Equity, the performers' union, welcomed the support but its general secretary, Christine Payne, said it was important that the funding didn't just prop up venues. ""If this investment does not reach creative workers - the actors, dancers, stage management, singers, variety artists, directors, designers, choreographers and many other highly skilled workers in our talent base, we risk the diversity and success of the wider creative industries - worth Â£112bn to the economy. ""These workers have campaigned for this deal; they can't be left behind."" This was echoed by the fears of a freelance worker on Twitter: Allow Twitter content?

Philippa Childs, head of theBectu unionwhich supports workers across the media and entertainment industry, said the support package was overdue. She added: ""At long last the government have woken up to our warnings and those of the whole creative sector, that without support, we stood to lose a huge amount of our world-beating creative industries. ""We will now be scrutinising the details of this package to make sure it lives up to the real needs of our sector."" Julian Bird, chief executive ofThe Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said it ""hugely welcomed"" the funding. The chief executives ofThe National Theatre, Rufus Norris and Lisa Burger, said they ""feel very positive that this major investment will reach and sustain the vital talent and infrastructure"". Kwame Kwei-Armah says he feels ""relieved"". Kwame Kwei-Armah, artistic director ofThe Young Vic, told Times Radio that he and his colleagues are ""relieved"". Julia Fawcett, chief executive ofThe Lowry in Salford, said: ""The announcement of Â£1.57bn of emergency investment in the UK's culture sector is welcome news, but we are fast running out of time. ""This lifeline will come too late for some organisations who have already been forced to close their doors for good or made valued employees redundant."" Jon Morgan ofThe Theatres Trustsaid: ""It remains to be seen whether this amount will be sufficient to replace the furlough scheme, as it begins to taper from August and ends in October, at a time when we still do not have timescales for theatres reopening."" Neil Constable, CEO ofShakespeare's Globe, said the news meant they ""now have the opportunity to plan to reopen fully by early 2021. We will of course be taking opportunities, if social distancing allows, to reopen earlier"". Fiona Allan, president of UK Theatres and the artistic director ofThe Birmingham Hippodrome, said the venue ""was overjoyed"" at the investment. ""We are now able to turn our focus to rebuilding what we have lost and planning for the future."" Museums are starting to re-open after lockdown but some - like Birmingham's Museum and Art Gallery remain closed. Arts Councilchairman Sir Nicholas Serota told BBC News the funding was ""a very good result"". He said: ""Now it's up to the arts organisations and the Arts Council to make best use of this money and bring the arts back into communities across the county. This announcement gives us the tools to help build a recovery."" The chief executive of theArts Council of Walessaid he was ""absolutely delighted"" by the announcement, adding the funding was ""an absolute lifeline"". Andy Eagle, chief executive ofCardiff's Chapter Arts Centre, said: ""It provides enormous security, enormous hope for the sector."" The Arts Council of Northern Irelandsaid it was ""delighted"" with the ""lifeline support"" The Tate, The Science Museum Group, The Natural History MuseumandThe National Gallerywere among those who also welcomed the funding. Sir Ian Blatchford, chair of theNational Museums Directors Councilsaid: ""This is welcome news for the museum sector, both in the scale of funding and as a strategic commitment to our role in the life of the country."" Kully Thiarai, creative director & CEO ofLeeds 2023, said: ""Across Leeds and West Yorkshire, the workers and performers in our region's great cultural institutions and the independent artists and venues embedded in communities, are waking up to some positive news.  After months of anxiety and uncertainty, the Government has thrown a much needed life-line that will help many stay afloat and plan for the future. The Royal Opera House said the funding announcement was ""a catalyst"". Music Venue Trustchief executive Mark Davyd said it ""warmly welcomes this unprecedented intervention into Britain's world class live music scene"". He added: ""This fund provides the opportunity to stabilise and protect our vibrant and vital network of venues and gives us the time we need to create a plan to safely reopen live music."" Geoff Taylor, chief executive of theBPI & Brit Awards, said: ""We are delighted that the government has recognised the special importance of the arts and creativity to our national life. ""We look forward to further details on how the funds will be allocated, but naturally warmly welcome specific references from the PM and the Chancellor to a lifeline for our cherished music venues, and to support for the arts, which should assist our classical music sector."" Sir Simon Rattle, director of theLondon Symphony Orchestra, called for the money to be ""distributed as fast as possible"". The Royal Opera Housesaid in a statement that ""the package of support will be a catalyst for unlocking the extraordinary creativity embedded in the UK's world-renowned creative industries"". Stephen Gilchrist, who runsBrixton Hill Studios, a music rehearsal and recording facility in south London, said the support was ""very important"", but that it doesn't mention companies that support the music industry. ""The nearest thing that would come to what we would do says 'basement venues',"" he said. ""So that shows that really important grassroots venues are covered, but it doesn't cover the parts of the sector that may look, on the outside, like they are commercial - the hire companies and the touring travel companies and people like us, the rehearsal and recording studios.

"Covid 'risk of up to 35,000 extra cancer deaths'","Delays to cancer diagnosis and treatment due to coronavirus could cause thousands of excess deaths in the UK within a year, research suggests. Scientists suggest there could be at least 7,000 additional deaths - but in a worst case scenario that number could be as high as 35,000. There are concerns routine screenings, urgent referrals and treatments have been delayed or cancelled. NHS England said it was working hard to restore services. Scientists examined data from eight hospital trusts and shared their findings exclusively with BBC Panorama. The study, conducted by DATA-CAN, the Health Care Research Hub (HDR UK) for Cancer, modelled different outcomes depending on how long services take to get back to normal levels. In a worst case scenario, if delays continue, there could be 35,000 additional cancer deaths within a year. Prof Mark Lawler, Scientific Lead of DATA-CAN, told BBC Panorama: ""Initial data that we got was very worrying to us. Coronavirus 'wreaks havoc' on cancer services 'More than two million in UK wait for cancer care' 'Thousands missing out on cancer diagnosis' ""Anecdotally, people have been telling us there were problems, but I think the critical thing was being able to actually have routine data from hospital trusts. ""Obviously scientists like to be right in terms of their analysis, but I hope I'm wrong in relation to that,"" he said. It was the job of Peter Johnson, the National Clinical Director for Cancer NHS England, to draw up the guidelines on cancer treatment during Covid-19. ""We're working as fast as we can to put the services back together again, to restore the capacity and indeed to build more, so that we can deal with the people that have not been diagnosed during the time when the services have been running below 100%,"" he told BBC Panorama. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? ""I'm hoping that we will get back to where we need to be by the end of the year."" NHS figures show there was a 60% drop in people visiting their GP and being referred for tests in April. ""There is a significant cohort of people who are very worried about coming anywhere near the NHS, because coming near the NHS means 'I'm going to get Covid, and therefore I'm going to get very, very ill,'"" said NHS GP Dr Gary Marlowe. The rates of urgent cancer referrals were 45% below pre-emergency levels at the end of May, the most recent HDR UK research, shared with Panorama, showed. ""The guidelines for radiotherapy and Covid-19 advised people to delay and avoid radiotherapy in some circumstances,"" clinical oncologist Prof Pat Price told BBC Panorama. ""I think it was a very high risk strategy,"" she said. Prof Price said there were radiotherapy machines in some hospitals ""lying idle which could have saved lives"". ""It has been safe to give radiotherapy during Covid-19, we know that now,"" she said. ""The machines are here but we haven't been allowed to switch them on properly. Professor Pat Price with Deborah Mr Johnson, from NHS England said: ""What we were concerned to do, when the virus was increasing very rapidly in the population, was to make sure that we could get the right balance between the risk of catching the virus, and the risk of having people's cancer get worse. ""And in particular, the risks and benefits of things like chemotherapy where, if the chemotherapy isn't absolutely crucial but it might be dangerous in terms of increasing your risk of coronavirus. ""This wasn't a kind of attempt to police who should have treatment and who shouldn't, it was more an attempt to try and help people think very clearly.""

"Sunak to give firms Â£1,000 'bonus' to hire trainees","The government is pledging to provide 30,000 new traineeships to get young people in England into work, as fears about mounting unemployment increase. Traineeships provide classroom-based lessons in maths, English and CV writing, as well as up to 90 hours of unpaid work experience. Under the Â£111m scheme, firms in England will be given Â£1,000 for each new work experience place they offer. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive Â£21m for similar schemes. The additional funding for traineeships is set to be announced by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday when he will unveil an economic plan to deal with the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis. A traineeship is a course that includes a work placement It can last from six weeks up to six months Traineeships are aimed at 16 to 24-year-olds in England Trainees may complete a maximum of 240 hours of work experience over six months Providers should offer an interview for an apprenticeship or job, if available at the end of the scheme Employers are not required to pay trainees for a work placement, unlike apprenticeships where theminimum wage rate is Â£4.15 per hour.,external On an apprenticeship, a person is employed to do work while studying for a formal qualification, usually for one day a week, either at a college or training centre over a number of years. Source:Gov.uk website,external Businesses have been hit hard since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March, and even though restrictions are gradually being eased, consumer demand remains depressed. As a result, companies with a presence across the UK have revealed thousands of staff cuts in the past week. ""Young people's employment prospects are expected to be disproportionately affected by the economic fallout of coronavirus,"" the Treasury said in a statement announcing plans to expand the traineeship programme. Traineeships are intended to get people into their first job after education. They last from six weeks to six months and they are open to people aged between 16 and 24. The struggle to contain Covid-19's economic hit UK businesses cut more than 12,000 jobs in two days Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact ""Expanding traineeships will be part of a wider package to support young people and to ensure they have the skills and training to go on to high quality, secure and fulfilling employment,"" the Treasury said. Employers must currently offer a minimum of 100 hours of work experience. But the Treasury statement refers to ""a high-quality work placement of 60 to 90 hours"", which could suggest a new, lesser, commitment for providers. The expanded scheme will be in place in England from September 2020. The Treasury said that three quarters of young people who completed a traineeship moved on to employment or further study within a year. In contrast, three quarters of 18-24 year-olds who are not in education, employment or training for three months will continue to be out of work and out of education for a full 12 months, according to government figures. The number of people starting traineeships has, however, been declining gradually, from a high of 24,100 in 2015-16 down to 14,900 in 2018,according to figures from the Department for Education.,external David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, told the BBC's Today programme: ""We know that young people get treated very badly in recessions and will be at the back of the queue for jobs. ""What we want is a whole range of actions that the government can take: put money into colleges to give them a chance, incentivise employers to take on trainees, but also take on apprenticeships as well.""

UK sanctions regime to target human rights abusersThose set to be punished could include Russian officials implicated in the death of Sergei Magnitsky.,"The UK is imposing sanctions on 49 people and organisations behind the most ""notorious"" human rights abuses of recent years. Individuals implicated in the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in 2009 will have their UK assets frozen and banned from entering the country. And Saudi Arabian officials involved in the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi are also being targeted. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the move sent a ""clear message"". Speaking in the Commons, the foreign secretary said the UK was taking action against the ""thugs of despots and henchmen of dictators"" as well as stopping those trying to launder their ""blood-drenched ill-gotten gains"". Russia has threatened to retaliate with reciprocal measures and said the sanctions were ""pointless"". ""Russia reserves the right to respond to today's unfriendly decision by the UK on the basis of reciprocity,""the Russian embassy in London said,externalin a statement, adding that the move ""will not improve Russian-British relations"". What are sanctions and why do countries use them? Dead Russian lawyer wins 10-year rights battle UK draws up post-Brexit sanctions plan The sanctions are the first taken,externalindependently by the UK outside the auspices of the UN and EU. Those individuals and organisations subject to immediate sanctions are: 25 Russian nationals involved in the mistreatment and death of lawyerSergei Magnitsky, who uncovered widespread corruption by a group of Russian tax and police officials 20 Saudi nationals involved in the death of journalistJamal Khashoggiin the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Two high-ranking Myanmar military generals involved in the systematic and brutal violence against the Rohingya people and other ethnic minorities Two organisations involved in forced labour, torture and murder in North Korea's gulags Mr Raab said those targeted had been involved in extra-judicial killings, including political assassinations, torture, degrading treatment, forced labour and servitude. Those on the list, which includes a former minister in the Russian interior department and the former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence services, will be stopped from entering the UK, channelling money into the country or profiting from the British economy, through property or other assets they own. ""Today this government and this house sends a very clear message on behalf of the British people that those with blood on their hands, the thugs of despots, the henchman of dictators will not be free to waltz into this country,"" Mr Raab told Parliament. ""The powers enable us to target a wider network of perpetrators including those who facilitate, incite, promote or support any of these crimes and this extends beyond state officials to non-state actors as well."" The UK's new sanctions' regime is significant. It marks the first time Britain has had its own independent scheme focused entirely on tackling human rights abuses. Until now, it has almost always had to act in concert with the EU. The government wants the UK to be seen as a leading defender of international rules and human rights. These sanctions are a central part of that policy. One key test will be whether it can get support from other countries. The United States and Canada have similar schemes, the EU is working on its own version. Sanctions are always more powerful if imposed collectively. What was announced today was merely the first wave of UK sanctions. More are to come and MPs are keen to see some Chinese names on the list. The sanctions may well come at a cost to trade and investment if countries object to seeing their nationals targeted. What is also unclear is how effective they will be in actually deterring human rights abuses. Many of those 47 individuals and two organisations named in the first listing are already subject to US sanctions. We don't know what assets they actually have in London or how often they have come to the UK. But London is a hub of international travel and finance, and officials hope the restrictions will have an impact in the long term. Mr Raab told the BBC the list would be kept under ""constant review"", and the government was ""working already on the on further designations that can be made in due course"". Asked about if it could damage the UK's trading relationship with Saudi Arabia, the foreign secretary said it was ""a matter of moral duty"", adding: ""We can't turn a blind eye to gross violations of human rights. ""We will apply these designations in the countries which we've designated todayâ¦ for countries where we have a relationship, whether it's an ally or other countries that we need to engage with, because that's the world we live in."" But asked if he was avoiding another clash with China by excluding them for the list, Mr Raab said: ""It's pretty clearâ¦  that we are willing to stand up for our vital national interests. But the regime that we have set out is evidence based. ""If we want a positive relationship with Chinaâ¦ the real issue here is one of trust and whether China can be trusted to live up to its international obligations, and its international responsibilities. ""And that's a message that we're telegraphing, along with many of our allies and indeed, many international partners around the world to Beijing,particularly in relation to what we've seen in Hong Kong."" Magnitsky's widow and mother took up the human rights case initially filed by him in Strasbourg Many MPs have long been pushing for a tougher domestic sanctions regime against foreign states accused of human rights abuses, based on the 2013 US Magnitsky Act. Magnitsky, a Moscow lawyer and auditor, died in police custody after accusing Russian tax officials of defrauding Hermitage Capital Management, a British investment firm he was advising. Magnitsky spent 11 months in police custody, during which he sustained injuries which human rights campaigners say were consistent with him being beaten and tortured. His maltreatment has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights, which found in 2019 that he had been deprived of important medical care and the authorities had not complied with their duty to protect life. Dead Russian lawyer wins 10-year rights battle Russian officials subject to sanctions include Aleksey Vasilyevich Anichin, a former interior minister and Oleg Silchenko, a member of the ministry's investigative team who was involved in questioning Magnitsky and who is accused of forced him to retract his allegations of corruption. Mr Raab said he would be meeting Magnitsky's widow Natalia and two children later on Monday to express the UK's ""solidarity"" with them and the nightmare they had been through. Bill Browder, co-founder and chief executive of Hermitage Capital, said the action represented ""a huge milestone in our 10 year campaign for justice"". Saudi officials involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi are among those targeted Mr Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was killed by a team of Saudi agents in what the Saudi authorities described as a ""rogue operation"" that went wrong. In December 2019, a court in Saudi Arabia sentenced five people to death and jailed three others but the process was condemned by foreign governments and the UN, which said it represented ""the antithesis of justice"". What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? Among those targeted by the UK, include Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Al Asiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence services and Saud Abdullah Al Qahtani, a former advisor to Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud, who is said to have ""planned and directed the killing"". Also on the list is Salah Muhammed Al Tubaigy, a government doctor present at the time of the killing and a number of intelligence officers also present in Istanbul said to have concealed evidence about the killing. Labour, which has been critical of the UK's relationship with Saudi Arabia, particularly in relation to the war in Yemen, said it welcomed action against those responsible for the ""appalling"" murder. The UK is also taking action against two senior generals in the Myanmar army, over the state's suppression of the minority Muslim Rohingya population in Rakhine state, a campaign of violence in 2017 and 2019 that campaigners have said amounts to attempted genocide. They are Min Aung Hlaing, Commander in Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces and his deputy Soe Win, who the UK says carry ultimate responsibility for unlawful killings, torture, forced labour and systematic rape. The North Korea organisations targeted are the Ministry of State Security Bureau 7 and the Ministry of People's Security Correctional Bureau, which have responsibility for running prison camps. The Foreign Office said its new sanctions regime, underpinned by legislation passed in 2018, could be extended in future to encompass individuals and governments guilty of corruption. The UK is required by law to enforce existing EU sanctions it is a party to until the end of the transition period on 1 January 2021. The government has said it will maintain these after that date and also existing UN sanctions.

Boohoo investigates supplier over poor conditions,"Boohoo has said it will investigate one of its suppliers following reports that staff are earning less than the minimum wage amid unsafe working conditions. The Sunday Times reported,externalthat workers at a factory in Leicester making clothes for Boohoo's Nasty Gal brand could expect to be paid Â£3.50 an hour. It also saw little evidence of measures to stop the spread of coronavirus at a time whenLeicester is in lockdown. Boohoo said if the report is true, conditions were ""totally unacceptable"". Leicester: A city fighting fast-fashion sweatshops It comes as the National Crime Agency confirmed it was investigating Leicester's textiles industry over allegations of exploitation, although it did not comment on Boohoo specifically. An NCA spokesman said: ""Within the last few days NCA officers, along with Leicestershire Police and other partner agencies, attended a number of business premises in the Leicester area to assess concerns of modern slavery and human trafficking."" The factory at the centre of the Sunday Times allegations displayed the sign Jaswal Fashions. However, that firm said it had ceased trading in 2018 and was not a supplier to Boohoo. Boohoo also said that Jaswal was not one of its declared suppliers and it appeared that a different firm was using Jaswal's former premises. ""We are currently trying to establish the identity of this company,"" Boohoo said. ""We are taking immediate action to thoroughly investigate how our garments were in their hands, will ensure that our suppliers immediately cease working with this company, and we will urgently review our relationship with any suppliers who have sub-contracted work to the manufacturer in question."" Jaswal Fashions has made clothes for Nasty Gal, which is owned by Boohoo An undercover reporter for the Sunday Times, who got a job at Jaswal Fashions, was told to expect pay of between Â£3.50 and Â£4.00 an hour. The national minimum wage,externalfor people over 25 years-old is Â£8.72 an hour. Few workers at the factory - which was operating during the localised lockdown in Leicester - were found to be wearing face masks to guard against the transmission of the coronavirus. There was also no evidence that social distancing measures had been implemented. Boohoo said that earlier this year it had begun a review of all its garment-makers, including ""a full audit of all of our suppliers' manufacturing facilities"". But former MP Mary Creagh, who investigated the UK's fast-fashion garment industry as chairwoman of the Commons' environmental audit committee, said policing the sector was difficult. Shein apologises for selling Muslim prayer mats ""When you think there are 10,000 workers, there are hundreds of factories and the tendency is when one factory is shut down it just springs up again in a sort of phoenix factory approach,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""They are shut down by authorities on Friday and they start up in a different building with a different name on Monday morning and this is the problem. It is a really difficult issue to tackle, the problem is the system not just the enforcement."" Boohoo's share price tumbled by more than 16% on Monday following the expose. The firm is already under fire after Labour Behind the Label, a workers' rights group, claimed that some employees at factories in Leicester that supply the fast fashion firm were ""being forced to come into work while sick with Covid-19"". At the time Boohoo said it would ""not tolerate any incidence of non-compliance especially in relation to the treatment of workers within our supply chain"". Leicester is currently under local lockdown following a spike in Covid-19 cases. At the weekend,Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidhe was ""very worried about the employment practices in some factories"" in the city. Sales at Boohoo, which trades exclusively online, has surged during the coronavirus lockdown with particular demand for loungewear and so-called athleisure gear. The company recently bought the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse and earlier this year acquired MissPap, Karen Millen and Coast. Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, sales for the year to February rose by 44% to Â£1.2bn and pre-tax profits grew 54% to Â£92.2m. Boohoo's co-founders Mahmud Kamani and Carole Kane were both paid more than Â£1.3m each for the last financial year. They could also share in a bonus of up to Â£150m if certain performance goals are met by 2023.

Pret A Manger to shut 30 outlets as job cuts loom,"Sandwich chain Pret A Manger is to close 30 outlets and is expected to cut at least 1,000 jobs at other shops as part of a post-pandemic restructuring. The company said the impact of coronavirus on trading meant it had to make a ""difficult decision"". Pret said it needed to reduce headcount across its UK shops to ""reflect lower footfall, rental costs and new safety measures"". It did not say how many jobs would go, but a source confirmed more than 1,000. About 330 jobs will be lost with the closure of the 30 shops. Pret said 339 of its 410 shops have so far reopened following the easing of lockdown restrictions. But trading remains slow, with sales down 74% from a year earlier, the company said. Pret is thought to be losing about Â£20m a month. Chief executive Pano Christou said: ""It's a sad day for the whole Pret family, and I'm devastated that we will be losing so many employees. But we must make these changes to adapt to the new retail environment. ""Our goal now is to bring Pret to more people, through different channels and in new ways, enabling us to grow once more in the medium term."" Restaurants are 'hurting', says Deliveroo boss UK firms slash more than 12,000 jobs in two days Fears of job cuts at Pret a Manger as sales plunge Is your job at risk?Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Pret is reliant on sales from commuters and lunchtime office workers, which are sources of revenue acutely affected by the lockdown. The company is broadening its sales with a retail coffee initiative with Amazon and a delivery partnership with Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats. There are also click and collect trials in five shops in London. Pret said sales across these digital channels have already grown 480% year-on-year, and now represent over 8% of total UK sales. The company is in talks with landlords about reducing its rent bill. In May, it appointed advisory firms to help restructure the business, and in April it raised â¬100m (Â£90m) in emergency funding from its banks. Pret, which owns 550 outlets globally employing 13,000 staff, including 8,000 in the UK, is the latest High Street food chain to announce cuts. Last week, SSP Group, which runs Upper Crust and Ritazza,said it would cut 5,000 staff, more than half its UK workforce. In addition, The Restaurant Group, which runs Frankie & Benny's and Wagamama, and Cafe Rouge-owner Casual Dining Group, have announced more than 4,500 job cuts between them.

"Â£1.57bn lifeline for gig venues and theatresGrants will aim to help places that host live entertainment, as well as museums and galleries.Entertainment & Arts","This video can not be played How theatre can reopen during the pandemic A Â£1.57bn emergency support package to help protect the future of theatres, galleries and museums will not be enough to save every job, the culture secretary says. Oliver Dowden said grants and loans would aim to preserve ""crown jewels"" in the arts sector, and many local venues. It follows several weeks of pressure, with industry leaders warning that many venues were on the brink of collapse. Independent cinemas, heritage sites and music venues will also be eligible. Mr Dowden said the grants and loans were all ""new money"" and were ""designed to last through this financial year"". He said the two broad aims of the package were to preserve ""crown jewel"" venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and national galleries, while also helping local institutions across the UK. The culture secretary said institutions would have to apply through industry bodies and would be asked to prove how they contributed to wider economic growth. He said the government was confident the emergency package would protect the majority of jobs in the culture sector - but not all. ""Sadly, not everyone is going to be able to survive and not every job is going to be protected and sadly, I will have to be honest with you, of course we will see further redundancies."" Oliver Dowden said the new funding would not be enough to safeguard every job in the culture sector A string of theatres have announced plans to make staff redundant in recent weeks, after being closed since the coronavirus pandemic took hold earlier this year. Adrian Vinken, the chief executive of the Theatre Royal in Plymouth, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""impossible to say"" if the announcement would be enough to prevent up to 100 job losses there until more detail was released. NI to receive Â£33m from UK arts support package Â£59m arts support for Wales 'will protect jobs' The announcement of the new funding comes just two days after theatres across the UK were covered in colourful messages of support. Guidance for a phased return of the performing arts, starting with performances behind closed doors and rehearsals, is expected to be published by the government shortly. The rescue package has been warmly welcomed by many arts leaders, some of whom said they thought it to be at the upper end of what had been hoped for.  Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who has been under pressure from the arts and heritage sector to deliver a meaningful funding solution to a crisis brought about by Covid-19, feels vindicated that his behind-closed-doors approach to negotiations with the Treasury has paid off. As always, the devil will be in the detail. The government has not specified how the money will be divided between competing art forms or regions, nor how the application process will work. There will be winners and losers. And then there's the elephant in the auditorium: when will the rules around social distancing in performing arts venues be relaxed to allow the show to go on? Many theatre producers are baffled by what they see as 'one rule for them, and one rule for us', approach by government, particularly when it comes to travel. Why is it OK for people to sit side-by-side on a train or plane for hours but not in a theatre, which they argue is a much more controllable environment? As far as they are concerned, that is the billion dollar question. The Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester was among those wrapped in messages of support The Â£1.15bn support pot for cultural organisations in England is made up of Â£880m in grants and Â£270m of repayable loans. The government said the loans would be ""issued on generous terms"". Funding will also go to the devolved administrations - Â£33m to Northern Ireland, Â£97m to Scotland and Â£59m to Wales. How have the arts reacted to the govt package? Closed theatres wrapped in messages of support Theatres are 'clinging on' but face precarious future A further Â£100m will be earmarked for national cultural institutions in England and the English Heritage Trust. There will also be Â£120m to restart construction on cultural infrastructure and for heritage construction projects in England that were paused due to the pandemic. The government said decisions on who will get the funding would be made ""alongside expert independent figures from the sector"". 'Challenging' performances like pantomimes may not take place this winter, the culture secretary said Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the money ""will help safeguard the sector for future generations, ensuring arts groups and venues across the UK can stay afloat"". The government described the package as ""the biggest ever one-off investment in UK culture"". Asked if pantomimes will be performed at theatres later this year, Mr Dowden told the Today programme the performances present unique challenges. ""First of all you've got from granny to grandchild - you've got kids screaming [he's behind you] - and all the things we love doing,"" he said. ""It's highly interactive."" ""If we can do it we will - but it looks challenging.""  Â£1.28bnAnnual ticket revenue 290,000Workers employed 34mAnnual visitors Â£133mAnnual VAT payments 70%Jobs at risk He also pointed out the latest funding adds to government schemes including the furlough scheme to safeguard the jobs of workers and VAT deferral and business rate relief to help those running venues. Julian Knight, Conservative chairman of the House of Commons culture select committee, said more action would be needed ""possibly involving more generous tax breaks"". Labour's shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said while she welcomed the ""much-needed"" package, it was ""too little, too late"" for many and urged the government to act quickly to help struggling organisations. Arts Council England, the Royal Opera House, the Music Venue Trust, the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre were among those to welcome the funding. Arts Council chairman Sir Nicholas Serota told BBC News the funding was ""a very good result"". He said: ""Now it's up to the arts organisations and the Arts Council to make best use of this money and bring the arts back into communities across the county. This announcement gives us the tools to help build a recovery."" Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn govt support package Music Venue Trust chief executive Mark Davyd said it ""warmly welcomes this unprecedented intervention into Britain's world class live music scene"". He added: ""This fund provides the opportunity to stabilise and protect our vibrant and vital network of venues and gives us the time we need to create a plan to safely reopen live music."" Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said it ""hugely welcomed"" the funding. The UK's theatre industry alone employs tens of thousands of people, Oliver Dowden said The chief executives of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris and Lisa Burger, said they ""feel very positive that this major investment will reach and sustain the vital talent and infrastructure"". Simon Rattle, director of the London Symphony Orchestra, called for the money to be ""distributed as fast as possible"". Philippa Childs, head of the Bectu union which supports workers across the media and entertainment industry, said the support package was overdue. She added: ""At long last the government have woken up to our warnings and those of the whole creative sector, that without support, we stood to lose a huge amount of our world-beating creative industries. ""We will now be scrutinising the details of this package to make sure it lives up to the real needs of our sector."" Julia Fawcett, chief executive of the Lowry in Salford, said: ""The announcement of Â£1.57bn of emergency investment in the UK's culture sector is welcome news, but we are fast running out of time. ""This lifeline will come too late for some organisations who have already been forced to close their doors for good or made valued employees redundant."" Some comedians have said the government funding had not taken into account the small comedy clubs on which they rely for their performances. ""I don't think there will be an industry to go back to. The people giving this money don't understand how this industry works,"" said comedian Kiri Pritchard-McClean on BBC Breakfast, ""We have one of the best comedy circuits in the world because we have so many brilliant clubs and you can gig several nights and get good at what you do. But these institutions are not being helped.""

UK to impose sanctions alone for first time,"The UK is imposing sanctions on 49 people and organisations behind the most ""notorious"" human rights abuses of recent years. Individuals implicated in the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in 2009 will have their UK assets frozen and banned from entering the country. And Saudi Arabian officials involved in the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi are also being targeted. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the move sent a ""clear message"". Speaking in the Commons, the foreign secretary said the UK was taking action against the ""thugs of despots and henchmen of dictators"" as well as stopping those trying to launder their ""blood-drenched ill-gotten gains"". Russia has threatened to retaliate with reciprocal measures and said the sanctions were ""pointless"". ""Russia reserves the right to respond to today's unfriendly decision by the UK on the basis of reciprocity,""the Russian embassy in London said,externalin a statement, adding that the move ""will not improve Russian-British relations"". What are sanctions and why do countries use them? Dead Russian lawyer wins 10-year rights battle UK draws up post-Brexit sanctions plan The sanctions are the first taken,externalindependently by the UK outside the auspices of the UN and EU. Those individuals and organisations subject to immediate sanctions are: 25 Russian nationals involved in the mistreatment and death of lawyerSergei Magnitsky, who uncovered widespread corruption by a group of Russian tax and police officials 20 Saudi nationals involved in the death of journalistJamal Khashoggiin the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Two high-ranking Myanmar military generals involved in the systematic and brutal violence against the Rohingya people and other ethnic minorities Two organisations involved in forced labour, torture and murder in North Korea's gulags Mr Raab said those targeted had been involved in extra-judicial killings, including political assassinations, torture, degrading treatment, forced labour and servitude. Those on the list, which includes a former minister in the Russian interior department and the former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence services, will be stopped from entering the UK, channelling money into the country or profiting from the British economy, through property or other assets they own. ""Today this government and this house sends a very clear message on behalf of the British people that those with blood on their hands, the thugs of despots, the henchman of dictators will not be free to waltz into this country,"" Mr Raab told Parliament. ""The powers enable us to target a wider network of perpetrators including those who facilitate, incite, promote or support any of these crimes and this extends beyond state officials to non-state actors as well."" The UK's new sanctions' regime is significant. It marks the first time Britain has had its own independent scheme focused entirely on tackling human rights abuses. Until now, it has almost always had to act in concert with the EU. The government wants the UK to be seen as a leading defender of international rules and human rights. These sanctions are a central part of that policy. One key test will be whether it can get support from other countries. The United States and Canada have similar schemes, the EU is working on its own version. Sanctions are always more powerful if imposed collectively. What was announced today was merely the first wave of UK sanctions. More are to come and MPs are keen to see some Chinese names on the list. The sanctions may well come at a cost to trade and investment if countries object to seeing their nationals targeted. What is also unclear is how effective they will be in actually deterring human rights abuses. Many of those 47 individuals and two organisations named in the first listing are already subject to US sanctions. We don't know what assets they actually have in London or how often they have come to the UK. But London is a hub of international travel and finance, and officials hope the restrictions will have an impact in the long term. Mr Raab told the BBC the list would be kept under ""constant review"", and the government was ""working already on the on further designations that can be made in due course"". Asked about if it could damage the UK's trading relationship with Saudi Arabia, the foreign secretary said it was ""a matter of moral duty"", adding: ""We can't turn a blind eye to gross violations of human rights. ""We will apply these designations in the countries which we've designated todayâ¦ for countries where we have a relationship, whether it's an ally or other countries that we need to engage with, because that's the world we live in."" But asked if he was avoiding another clash with China by excluding them for the list, Mr Raab said: ""It's pretty clearâ¦  that we are willing to stand up for our vital national interests. But the regime that we have set out is evidence based. ""If we want a positive relationship with Chinaâ¦ the real issue here is one of trust and whether China can be trusted to live up to its international obligations, and its international responsibilities. ""And that's a message that we're telegraphing, along with many of our allies and indeed, many international partners around the world to Beijing,particularly in relation to what we've seen in Hong Kong."" Magnitsky's widow and mother took up the human rights case initially filed by him in Strasbourg Many MPs have long been pushing for a tougher domestic sanctions regime against foreign states accused of human rights abuses, based on the 2013 US Magnitsky Act. Magnitsky, a Moscow lawyer and auditor, died in police custody after accusing Russian tax officials of defrauding Hermitage Capital Management, a British investment firm he was advising. Magnitsky spent 11 months in police custody, during which he sustained injuries which human rights campaigners say were consistent with him being beaten and tortured. His maltreatment has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights, which found in 2019 that he had been deprived of important medical care and the authorities had not complied with their duty to protect life. Dead Russian lawyer wins 10-year rights battle Russian officials subject to sanctions include Aleksey Vasilyevich Anichin, a former interior minister and Oleg Silchenko, a member of the ministry's investigative team who was involved in questioning Magnitsky and who is accused of forced him to retract his allegations of corruption. Mr Raab said he would be meeting Magnitsky's widow Natalia and two children later on Monday to express the UK's ""solidarity"" with them and the nightmare they had been through. Bill Browder, co-founder and chief executive of Hermitage Capital, said the action represented ""a huge milestone in our 10 year campaign for justice"". Saudi officials involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi are among those targeted Mr Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was killed by a team of Saudi agents in what the Saudi authorities described as a ""rogue operation"" that went wrong. In December 2019, a court in Saudi Arabia sentenced five people to death and jailed three others but the process was condemned by foreign governments and the UN, which said it represented ""the antithesis of justice"". What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? Among those targeted by the UK, include Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Al Asiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence services and Saud Abdullah Al Qahtani, a former advisor to Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud, who is said to have ""planned and directed the killing"". Also on the list is Salah Muhammed Al Tubaigy, a government doctor present at the time of the killing and a number of intelligence officers also present in Istanbul said to have concealed evidence about the killing. Labour, which has been critical of the UK's relationship with Saudi Arabia, particularly in relation to the war in Yemen, said it welcomed action against those responsible for the ""appalling"" murder. The UK is also taking action against two senior generals in the Myanmar army, over the state's suppression of the minority Muslim Rohingya population in Rakhine state, a campaign of violence in 2017 and 2019 that campaigners have said amounts to attempted genocide. They are Min Aung Hlaing, Commander in Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces and his deputy Soe Win, who the UK says carry ultimate responsibility for unlawful killings, torture, forced labour and systematic rape. The North Korea organisations targeted are the Ministry of State Security Bureau 7 and the Ministry of People's Security Correctional Bureau, which have responsibility for running prison camps. The Foreign Office said its new sanctions regime, underpinned by legislation passed in 2018, could be extended in future to encompass individuals and governments guilty of corruption. The UK is required by law to enforce existing EU sanctions it is a party to until the end of the transition period on 1 January 2021. The government has said it will maintain these after that date and also existing UN sanctions.

Scottish beer gardens reopen after 15 weeks in lockdownBusiness owners have warned their biggest hurdle could be persuading customers that it is safe to go out.Scotland,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Scotland's beer gardens reopen People in Scotland are now able to return to beer gardens and pavement cafes after they opened for the first time in 15 weeks. But customers are being warned that al fresco eating and drinking will not be the same as it was before the lockdown. As well as following strict distancing and hygiene rules, they will have to leave their contact details so they can be traced in the event of an outbreak. Pubs and restaurants should be able to welcome customers indoors from 15 July. That will be part of phase three of theScottish government's route map out of lockdown,external, which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is expected to confirm on Thursday. Business owners warned that their biggest hurdle could be persuading customers that it was safe to go out to eat and drink. Which lockdown rules will change next - and when? Coronavirus in Scotland: How many cases are there? Ms Sturgeon said she had been ""impressed"" with safety precautions that had been put in place at an Edinburgh beer garden she visited, thanking businesses for ""working hard"" to prepare for re-opening. This video can not be played Coronavirus: FM says beer gardens âshould not feel normalâ But she said her ""biggest worry"" was ""complacency"" about coronavirus setting in, and warned: ""This virus has not gone away."" She said: ""If you're out somewhere and there are no clear safety measures in place, you should consider leaving or not going in in the first place. ""If it feels exactly like it was before this pandemic, then something is wrong and measures are not being properly implemented."" Diners will be asked to use their smartphone to scan the QR code to see a menu At the Cold Town House in Edinburgh's Grassmarket, customers must make a reservation to secure a table in their outdoor dining area. Party sizes are limited to six people from two households and they can spend a maximum of one hour and 45 minutes at their table. On arrival, staff will take the contact details of everyone in the group and explain various additional health and safety measures. They will ask them how they want to be served - perhaps by someone wearing a face guard, or at a distance from the table. Nic Wood spoke to the first minister at his venue in the Grassmarket And they will be able to view the menu on their smartphones after accessing it via a QR code. Nic Wood, the managing director of parent company Signature Pubs, said it was important to show customers that they were open and safe. But he said they were facing a ""huge hurdle"" in convincing people to return to the hospitality industry. ""It's very worrying how quiet Edinburgh city centre, the Grassmarket, is at the moment,"" he added. ""Trying to persuade people to come back when they have been told to stay at home and not to socialise is the biggest job by far to overcome."" The opening of beer gardens and outdoor cafes comes after a series of lockdown measures were lifted, including thefive mile recreational travel rule for all but part of Dumfries and Galloway. Children under 11 no longer have to physically distance from each other or from adults,meaning they can now hug their grandparents. Non-essential shops have also reopened but from Friday it will be mandatory for almost everyone to wear aface covering in stores. The first minister has also outlined plans to reduce the 2m distancing rule to 1m in certain circumstances and with safeguards. She told BBC Scotland she was keen to restart the economy but nervous about relaxing restrictions. ""All of us want to see the economy moving again, all of us want to see life return to as close to normal as is possible, but that will only be possible if we all act in a way that keeps the virus at bay,"" she said. ""Because if it starts to run out of control again, then we have to go back to square one."" Ms Sturgeon said the outbreak in the area around Annan and Gretna in Dumfries and Galloway showed how infectious the virus was. She said people should look out for the new safety measures in beer gardens and cafes and follow theFACTS safety guidance,externalwhen out in the community. Staff wore protective visors as they served pints at the SWG3 beer garden in Glasgow Tables were filling up at the Outhouse in Edinburgh on Monday Emma McLarkin of the Scottish Beer and Pub Association said Monday marked an important milestone, but said most pubs will be waiting until the reopening of indoor areas on 15 July. ""Things will be a little different with added mitigation measures to help protect customers and ensure they feel safe, but they will still be the same places we all know and love,"" she said. ""We all have a shared interest in continuing to suppress the virus and the pub sector is definitely ready to play our part in welcoming our customers back responsibly."" Meanwhile planning regulations are being temporarily relaxed to allow pubs, restaurants and cafes to use areas such as public footpaths for seating and structures like open-sided gazebos. Planning minister Kevin Stewart said the government wanted to ensure the industry could comply with distancing measures and provide a safe and pleasant environment for customers.

Jonathan MorrisBBC News Online A couple say the lockdown has opened their eyes to holidaying in the UK. Katie Taylor and her fiancÃ© Sam Gabriel, from Fleet, Hampshire, are camping near Salcombe, which they say âis perfect for social distancing and the dog can run around as wellâ. Katie said: âWe would have got on a plane if not for the lockdown but itâs lovely here and itâs given us the opportunity to explore places in the UK. âI donât see us going to Europe any time soon, but the sun is out so this is perfect.â People, particularly in rural areas, should look out for the signs of ""dangerous"" illegal gatherings, policehave said,external. Hertfordshire Police said large gatherings were still not permitted under current lockdown measures, in order to curb the spread of coronavirus. Ch Insp Chris Treadwell said ""unlicensed raves"" were ""dangerous for attendees"" as there was often no crowd-control measures, medical staff or security nearby. ""These unlicensed gatherings also pose difficulties for emergency services who, if in the event they are needed on the site, could struggle to access those who need help if no pre-planning has been undertaken by organisers,"" he added. The force has asked any suspicious activity which could indicate a gathering was happening to be reported. More than Â£1.5bn of support for arts venues in the UK will stop the industry ""sliding into the sea"",the boss of Birmingham's Rep theatre has said. The government money will help secure the future of venues, but it was too early to tell if it would save jobs, Artistic Director Sean Foley said. Meanwhile, without support, the city's Hippodrome theatre would close in February, chief executive Fiona Allan said on Monday. The emergency support packagewill include grants and loans. The Â£1.15bn support pot for cultural organisations in England is made up of Â£880m in grants and Â£270m of repayable loans. BBC Radio Devon Police are supporting rangers at Dartmoor National Park after an illegal gathering of people on Friday. Devon and Cornwall Police said the group of nearly 200 people had been breaking local by-laws and was in breach of social distancing rules. A road block was set up to stop more people arriving, but the park authority said it could not stop people walking on to the site. Park authority chief executive Kevin Bishop said the gathering was ""totally irresponsible"". We're still not out of a global pandemic. To actually have this little gathering, and it's brought people from across the UK, [it seems] from those who did speak to our rangers and the police, is just totally irresponsible."" Kevin Bishop, Chief Executive, Dartmoor National Park Authority A pub billed as the oldest in Englandhas reopened for the first time since March. Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem in Nottingham was boarded up after lockdown measures were introduced by the government to halt the spread of coronavirus. The inn dates back to 1189, although its claim to be the oldest in the country has been disputed. Owners Greene King said a new layout had been put in place to maintain social distancing. Sandwich chain Pret A Manger is to close 30 outlets and is expected to cut at least 1,000 jobs at other shops as part of a post-pandemic restructuring. The company said the impact of coronavirus on trading meant it had to make a ""difficult decision"". Pret said it needed to reduce headcount across its UK shops to ""reflect lower footfall, rental costs and new safety measures"". It did not say how many jobs would go, but a source confirmed more than 1,000. Reality Check Reality Check's Shruti Menon takes a look at some of the misleading coronavirus health claims that keep appearing online. This video can not be played When Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced certain businesses in England could reopen, there was some surprise that ""model villages"" appeared on a list alongside the expected pubs and restaurants. BBC News went to Bekonscot in Buckinghamshire, the oldest model village in the country, to see what the fuss was all about. Unless you are a key worker, you probably haven't used your car much over the past four months. Due to coronavirus, in March the government allowed drivers who were scheduled for a MOT test to delay it for up to six months. But now, mandatory MOTs for vehicles in England, Scotland and Wales are being reintroduced from 1 August. Here are five tips to help you get your car out of lockdown.

Northampton's Royal and Derngate said it had been losing Â£1m a month since closing on 18 March for lockdown. Chief executive Jo Gordon said there was ""no sense yet how it will be distributed"" but it was a ""very vital step in the right direction"". ""Theatre has a huge part to play when life restarts,"" she said. Ms Gordon said there was ""lots to still work through"" and not enough detail to knowwhen the theatre could reopen. Johanna CarrBBC News Online One business owner in St Ives who opened for the first time on Monday said he had seen about 10% of his normal takings, which was ""a worry"". David Hosking, from the Beachcomber Cafe, said they had decided not to open on Saturday because the weather was not good. He said opening was very âstrangeâ but customers seemed to know what to expect and were friendly. âThere are not as many people here as people hoped for,â he said.
âThis [outside the cafe] would normally be very busy. âOne thing we have all noticed is there are more young people here than there normally would be. The older generation are not here in as many numbers.â A doctor in Bradford, the area with the second highest rate of new coronavirus infections, says he isn't surprised the city could be next in line for a local lockdown, although this hasn't been confirmed. Dr John Wright described the areas with the highest rates of infection as a ""league table of inequality"". Ciaran DugganLocal Democracy Reporter Council officials in Kent have brandeda government cash boost for local authorities,externalstruggling financially amid the
coronavirus crisis  ""inadequate"". Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick announced that Â£500m of additional
funding would be offered to Englandâs 343 councils - this comes on top of Â£3.2bn of national emergency support. But Kent
County Councilâs deputy leader Peter Oakford said the support ""would not come close"" to compensating councils for the extra costs and loss of income during the crisis. In June, a BBC investigation found some of the largest UK councilsmay have to declare themselves effectively bankruptunless the government agreed to further financial support. BBC Radio 5 Live Today BBC Radio 5 Live's Your Call programme heard from listeners who were still suffering from the long-term effects of coronavirus. Yesterday NHS England said it waslaunching a new servicefor people with ongoing health problems after catching Covid-19. Jo from Stroud, 37, said she and her husband had both been struggling, which has been difficult while trying to look after two young children. âThe biggest thing for me is fatigue â itâs debilitating,â she said. âIn a situation where there is zero childcare and zero information on what is going on with us, it has been really stressful. Weâve had some really tough conversations in our house about how to just make life work.â Listen again to this morning's Your Call on BBC Sounds. Johanna CarrBBC News Online In south-west England our reporters have been speaking to holidaymakers about their concerns over coronavirus after lockdown restrictions were eased further at the weekend. A couple on a day trip to St Ives, Cornwall - from up the road in Camborne - said they were anxious about the possibility of a second spike in coronavirus cases. Andy and Jackie Bray said they did not normally come to St Ives in the summer as it was so busy, but said it seemed fine on Monday. Mr Bray, who has been furloughed, said: âPart of us wishes people didnât come down on holiday to keep the virus at bay and to keep people safe, but, on the other hand Cornwall businesses need tourism. âAs long as everyone is sensible and keeps their distance [it should be OK].â Rob EnglandBBC News Here's a round-up of the coronavirus stories we've been discussing today: We'll be with you until 17:00 with all the latest updates. If you have a story you think we should be looking atplease email us. One of the first British people to be diagnosed with coronavirus has spoken about the ""bizarre"" experience. Margaret Francis, from Derbyshire, tested positive on 26 February, resulting in her son's school being closed and a media scrum in Buxton. Four ambulances and medics in protective gear meant her home ""looked like a scene from ET"". While fully recovered, she says she is not looking forward to ""back to normal"" and feels nervous about crowds. More clarity is needed for theatres on reopening dates a theatre boss has said following the government's funding announcement. AÂ£1.57bn support packagehas been created after several weeks of pressure, with industry leaders warning that many venues were on the brink of collapse. But Stephen Crocker, from Norwich Theatre, said he was still concerned about when performances would resume. The venue had to cancel its Christmas panto because of a shortage of funds during the pandemic. Whilst I hugely welcome this announcement, we are still waiting on the details of reopening times for venues and for a lot of us the two things go hand in hand...what we want to do is to get back to what we usually do."" Stephen Crocker, Theatre Royal (Norwich) The vast majority of children will no longer need to shield from the end of this month, England's deputy chief medical officer has said. Dr Jenny Harrieshas backed guidance from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health,external(RCPCH) which says that most young people with conditions such as asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, and kidney disease do not need to continue to shield and could, for example, go back to school. The government has now said the majority of children in England who are currently considered extremely clinical vulnerable to Covid-19 will be able to be removed from the shielded patient list over the summer. Data from NHS Digital shows 92,633 children under the age of 18 were on the shielded list. Dr Harries said: ""As our understanding of this novel virus has developed, evidence shows most children and young people are at low risk of serious illness and will no longer be advised to shield after July.""

"Covid 'could cause 35,000 extra UK cancer deaths'","Delays to cancer diagnosis and treatment due to coronavirus could cause thousands of excess deaths in the UK within a year, research suggests. Scientists suggest there could be at least 7,000 additional deaths - but in a worst case scenario that number could be as high as 35,000. There are concerns routine screenings, urgent referrals and treatments have been delayed or cancelled. NHS England said it was working hard to restore services. Scientists examined data from eight hospital trusts and shared their findings exclusively with BBC Panorama. The study, conducted by DATA-CAN, the Health Care Research Hub (HDR UK) for Cancer, modelled different outcomes depending on how long services take to get back to normal levels. In a worst case scenario, if delays continue, there could be 35,000 additional cancer deaths within a year. Prof Mark Lawler, Scientific Lead of DATA-CAN, told BBC Panorama: ""Initial data that we got was very worrying to us. Coronavirus 'wreaks havoc' on cancer services 'More than two million in UK wait for cancer care' 'Thousands missing out on cancer diagnosis' ""Anecdotally, people have been telling us there were problems, but I think the critical thing was being able to actually have routine data from hospital trusts. ""Obviously scientists like to be right in terms of their analysis, but I hope I'm wrong in relation to that,"" he said. It was the job of Peter Johnson, the National Clinical Director for Cancer NHS England, to draw up the guidelines on cancer treatment during Covid-19. ""We're working as fast as we can to put the services back together again, to restore the capacity and indeed to build more, so that we can deal with the people that have not been diagnosed during the time when the services have been running below 100%,"" he told BBC Panorama. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? ""I'm hoping that we will get back to where we need to be by the end of the year."" NHS figures show there was a 60% drop in people visiting their GP and being referred for tests in April. ""There is a significant cohort of people who are very worried about coming anywhere near the NHS, because coming near the NHS means 'I'm going to get Covid, and therefore I'm going to get very, very ill,'"" said NHS GP Dr Gary Marlowe. The rates of urgent cancer referrals were 45% below pre-emergency levels at the end of May, the most recent HDR UK research, shared with Panorama, showed. ""The guidelines for radiotherapy and Covid-19 advised people to delay and avoid radiotherapy in some circumstances,"" clinical oncologist Prof Pat Price told BBC Panorama. ""I think it was a very high risk strategy,"" she said. Prof Price said there were radiotherapy machines in some hospitals ""lying idle which could have saved lives"". ""It has been safe to give radiotherapy during Covid-19, we know that now,"" she said. ""The machines are here but we haven't been allowed to switch them on properly. Professor Pat Price with Deborah Mr Johnson, from NHS England said: ""What we were concerned to do, when the virus was increasing very rapidly in the population, was to make sure that we could get the right balance between the risk of catching the virus, and the risk of having people's cancer get worse. ""And in particular, the risks and benefits of things like chemotherapy where, if the chemotherapy isn't absolutely crucial but it might be dangerous in terms of increasing your risk of coronavirus. ""This wasn't a kind of attempt to police who should have treatment and who shouldn't, it was more an attempt to try and help people think very clearly.""

Â£1.5bn government lifeline for venues,"This video can not be played How theatre can reopen during the pandemic A Â£1.57bn emergency support package to help protect the future of theatres, galleries and museums will not be enough to save every job, the culture secretary says. Oliver Dowden said grants and loans would aim to preserve ""crown jewels"" in the arts sector, and many local venues. It follows several weeks of pressure, with industry leaders warning that many venues were on the brink of collapse. Independent cinemas, heritage sites and music venues will also be eligible. Mr Dowden said the grants and loans were all ""new money"" and were ""designed to last through this financial year"". He said the two broad aims of the package were to preserve ""crown jewel"" venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and national galleries, while also helping local institutions across the UK. The culture secretary said institutions would have to apply through industry bodies and would be asked to prove how they contributed to wider economic growth. He said the government was confident the emergency package would protect the majority of jobs in the culture sector - but not all. ""Sadly, not everyone is going to be able to survive and not every job is going to be protected and sadly, I will have to be honest with you, of course we will see further redundancies."" Oliver Dowden said the new funding would not be enough to safeguard every job in the culture sector A string of theatres have announced plans to make staff redundant in recent weeks, after being closed since the coronavirus pandemic took hold earlier this year. Adrian Vinken, the chief executive of the Theatre Royal in Plymouth, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""impossible to say"" if the announcement would be enough to prevent up to 100 job losses there until more detail was released. NI to receive Â£33m from UK arts support package Â£59m arts support for Wales 'will protect jobs' The announcement of the new funding comes just two days after theatres across the UK were covered in colourful messages of support. Guidance for a phased return of the performing arts, starting with performances behind closed doors and rehearsals, is expected to be published by the government shortly. The rescue package has been warmly welcomed by many arts leaders, some of whom said they thought it to be at the upper end of what had been hoped for.  Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who has been under pressure from the arts and heritage sector to deliver a meaningful funding solution to a crisis brought about by Covid-19, feels vindicated that his behind-closed-doors approach to negotiations with the Treasury has paid off. As always, the devil will be in the detail. The government has not specified how the money will be divided between competing art forms or regions, nor how the application process will work. There will be winners and losers. And then there's the elephant in the auditorium: when will the rules around social distancing in performing arts venues be relaxed to allow the show to go on? Many theatre producers are baffled by what they see as 'one rule for them, and one rule for us', approach by government, particularly when it comes to travel. Why is it OK for people to sit side-by-side on a train or plane for hours but not in a theatre, which they argue is a much more controllable environment? As far as they are concerned, that is the billion dollar question. The Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester was among those wrapped in messages of support The Â£1.15bn support pot for cultural organisations in England is made up of Â£880m in grants and Â£270m of repayable loans. The government said the loans would be ""issued on generous terms"". Funding will also go to the devolved administrations - Â£33m to Northern Ireland, Â£97m to Scotland and Â£59m to Wales. How have the arts reacted to the govt package? Closed theatres wrapped in messages of support Theatres are 'clinging on' but face precarious future A further Â£100m will be earmarked for national cultural institutions in England and the English Heritage Trust. There will also be Â£120m to restart construction on cultural infrastructure and for heritage construction projects in England that were paused due to the pandemic. The government said decisions on who will get the funding would be made ""alongside expert independent figures from the sector"". 'Challenging' performances like pantomimes may not take place this winter, the culture secretary said Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the money ""will help safeguard the sector for future generations, ensuring arts groups and venues across the UK can stay afloat"". The government described the package as ""the biggest ever one-off investment in UK culture"". Asked if pantomimes will be performed at theatres later this year, Mr Dowden told the Today programme the performances present unique challenges. ""First of all you've got from granny to grandchild - you've got kids screaming [he's behind you] - and all the things we love doing,"" he said. ""It's highly interactive."" ""If we can do it we will - but it looks challenging.""  Â£1.28bnAnnual ticket revenue 290,000Workers employed 34mAnnual visitors Â£133mAnnual VAT payments 70%Jobs at risk He also pointed out the latest funding adds to government schemes including the furlough scheme to safeguard the jobs of workers and VAT deferral and business rate relief to help those running venues. Julian Knight, Conservative chairman of the House of Commons culture select committee, said more action would be needed ""possibly involving more generous tax breaks"". Labour's shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens said while she welcomed the ""much-needed"" package, it was ""too little, too late"" for many and urged the government to act quickly to help struggling organisations. Arts Council England, the Royal Opera House, the Music Venue Trust, the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre were among those to welcome the funding. Arts Council chairman Sir Nicholas Serota told BBC News the funding was ""a very good result"". He said: ""Now it's up to the arts organisations and the Arts Council to make best use of this money and bring the arts back into communities across the county. This announcement gives us the tools to help build a recovery."" Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn govt support package Music Venue Trust chief executive Mark Davyd said it ""warmly welcomes this unprecedented intervention into Britain's world class live music scene"". He added: ""This fund provides the opportunity to stabilise and protect our vibrant and vital network of venues and gives us the time we need to create a plan to safely reopen live music."" Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, said it ""hugely welcomed"" the funding. The UK's theatre industry alone employs tens of thousands of people, Oliver Dowden said The chief executives of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris and Lisa Burger, said they ""feel very positive that this major investment will reach and sustain the vital talent and infrastructure"". Simon Rattle, director of the London Symphony Orchestra, called for the money to be ""distributed as fast as possible"". Philippa Childs, head of the Bectu union which supports workers across the media and entertainment industry, said the support package was overdue. She added: ""At long last the government have woken up to our warnings and those of the whole creative sector, that without support, we stood to lose a huge amount of our world-beating creative industries. ""We will now be scrutinising the details of this package to make sure it lives up to the real needs of our sector."" Julia Fawcett, chief executive of the Lowry in Salford, said: ""The announcement of Â£1.57bn of emergency investment in the UK's culture sector is welcome news, but we are fast running out of time. ""This lifeline will come too late for some organisations who have already been forced to close their doors for good or made valued employees redundant."" Some comedians have said the government funding had not taken into account the small comedy clubs on which they rely for their performances. ""I don't think there will be an industry to go back to. The people giving this money don't understand how this industry works,"" said comedian Kiri Pritchard-McClean on BBC Breakfast, ""We have one of the best comedy circuits in the world because we have so many brilliant clubs and you can gig several nights and get good at what you do. But these institutions are not being helped.""

"Number of renters in arrears doubles, says charity","The number of private tenants in England who have fallen behind on rent has doubled during the coronavirus pandemic, new research suggests. Polling for housing charity Shelter estimated 226,785 are now in arrears despite having been up to date in March, out of a total of 442,403. It said the figures showed the need for action before a ban on new evictions ends next month. The government said those hit hardest would get ""appropriate protection"". A ban on new evictions of social or private tenants in England and Wales has beenextended for two monthsand is currently due to end on 23 August. But the charity Shelter is warning that the winding down of the government's furlough scheme could leave people even more exposed to eviction if they lose their jobs. Covid costs hit private renters hard, says report Coronavirus ban on evicting renters extended People facing eviction threats 'should stay put' A Shelter poll of 1,058 private renters in England conducted by YouGov estimated 442,403 of the country's 8.7m renters - roughly 5% - were in arrears in early June. Of them, 226,785 said they were up to date with payments in March, before the height of the pandemic. Of those who had contact with their landlord or letting agent since March, around 6% of those surveyed said they had been threatened with eviction. Around a third of respondents said they feel more depressed and anxious about their housing situation, with 30% also experiencing sleepless nights. The charity's chief executive Polly Neate said thousands of renters were at risk of homelessness unless the government changed the law on evictions. ""We know people have been doing whatever they can to pay their rent and keep their home safe,"" she said. ""Despite this, the minute the evictions ban lifts, the 230,000 already behind with their rent could be up for automatic eviction if they've built up eight weeks-worth of arrears,"" she added. She called on ministers to make ""small changes"" to eviction law to ensure no renter is automatically evicted, and the impact of Covid-19 is ""always considered"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TWO METRES:Is less than 2m safe? The Scottish government has amendedlegislation to prevent new evictions for up to six months for those struggling with arrears. In Northern Ireland,a requirement for a 12 week notice to quit period for all tenancies became law in May. Responding to Shelter's polling, Labour said emergency legislation was needed to protect renters from eviction. Shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said: ""The government seems to be more interested in protecting landlords' incomes than preventing families from losing their homes in the middle of a deadly pandemic. ""Rough sleeping had more than doubled under the Tories before coronavirus. ""If we go back to business as usual, many thousands of people will find themselves sleeping on the streets this winter."" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it had taken ""unprecedented action to support renters during the pandemic"". ""We have introduced the furlough scheme to protect jobs, provided over Â£6.5bn to strengthen the welfare safety-net,"" a spokesperson said. They added the government had also made the housing benefit system more generous by increasing it to cover 30% of the average market rent in each area. ""We're working with the judiciary to provide appropriate protection to those who have been particularly affected by coronavirus when proceedings start again."" The National Residential Landlords Association said it had produced guidance for tenants and landlords on how to best address rent arrears. Its policy director Chris Norris said eviction ""should not be seen as the inevitable outcome of getting behind with rent payments"". ""Our surveys show that the vast majority of landlords have been doing all they can to keep people in their homes,"" he added.

Exotic frog found among supermarket bananas,"The frog has been nicknamed ""Asda"" after he was found among bananas in the store in Llanelli A stowaway exotic frog has ended up in a supermarket in Carmarthenshire after a 5,000-mile trip from South America. Staff at Asda in Llanelli spotted the thumb-sized amphibian among bunches of bananas and called the RSPCA. It is thought the frog, nicknamed Asda, arrived from Colombia, where hundreds of thousands of tonnes of the fruit are produced and sent to the UK each year. It is being cared for by specialists in Pembrokeshire where he is feasting on crickets and flies, rescuers say. RSPCA Cymru was alerted after an eagle-eyed member of staff spotted the frog while on shift at the Murray Street store on 29 June. Amphibians are capable of slowing down their metabolism under different environmental conditions, which is thought to be how the frog survived the long journey without food or water into a cooler climate. The RSPCA has thanked Asda staff for spotting and caring for the frog Asda has now been transferred to Silent World Zoo To You, a marine life specialist centre in Haverfordwest where he will now live in a planted, humid environment. Staff at Silent World believe he is a banana tree frog. Frog from Ecuador found in bananas in Tesco Costa Rica tree frog found in bananas at Lidl 'Deadly spiders' in banana force family from home ""I thought I'd seen everything working for the RSPCA - but this banana-drama was a new one for me,"" said RSPCA inspector Gemma Cooper. ""This adventurous frog has travelled more than 5,000 miles amid a bunch of bananas, splitting from his native Colombia before ending up at a Llanelli superstore. ""It's certainly a long old journey for the weekly shop."" 'Asda' is now settling into his new home at a specialist centre in Pembrokeshire Ms Cooper thanked staff at the Asda store for spotting the frog and caring for him until he could be rescued. Finding frogs among bananas is not a rare occurrence, according to Ginny Spenceley, from Silent World. ""With fruit deliveries no longer sprayed or treated, it isn't uncommon for a frog or spider to hitch a ride,"" she said. ""Fortunately, he's doing really well and, funnily enough, got very comfortable in a banana skin as we helped settle him into his new, less familiar surroundings."" There are about 800 different species of tree frog, with more than 600 living in Central and South America Tree frogs can be found in a variety of colours and some change colour to blend into the background as camouflage Most tree frogs are so small they can sit comfortably on the tip of your finger Tree frogs use their eyes to help swallow their food. They close their eyes very firmly which pushes the food item down their throat Some tree frog species secrete substances on their skin that are used by indigenous peoples as a hallucinogenic drug Source: Animals Network Frog from Ecuador found in Tesco bananas Costa Rica tree frog found in Lidl bananas 'Deadly spiders' force family from home Silent World Zoo To You 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?
