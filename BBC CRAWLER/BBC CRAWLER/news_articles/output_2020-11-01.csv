'North worth less than South' mayor claims,"Liverpool has the third highest number of infections in England Increased furlough payments for the national Covid lockdown shows the government ""believes the North is worth less than the South"", Liverpool's metro mayor has claimed. Boris Johnson announced workers would receive 80% of their wages if businesses closeduring a four-week lockdown in England from Thursday. Only 67% of pay was offered during tier three closures in the north of England. The government has yet to respond to the mayor's accusation. However, the Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: ""The announcement about furlough that was made yesterday was about the extension of a scheme, that would have expired last night, throughout the rest of this month. ""The chancellor and his team are looking at every aspect of economic support and more will be said in the days ahead about how we provide it."" Labour's Steve Rotheram said the government was ""unequivocal"" it would not consider changes to the local scheme offered in the north west. The Liverpool City Region mayor added: ""This morning millions of people woke up knowing the prime minister of this country believes the North is worth less than the South."" Andy Burnham was in a high profile battle with the government over furlough support In October, a row broke out between leaders in north-west England and the government over the level of compensation offered to workers and businesses when much of the region was placed into tier three, the highest level of restrictions. At a press conference earlier, Mr Rotheram said: ""Apparently all votes count equally, but all voters demonstrably don't to this government and the support you get from the chancellor of the exchequer depends on a horizontal line drawn across the country and on which side of it you sit."" ""I can assure the government that the people of the North won't easily forget that they were judged to be worth less than their southern counterparts."" Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said people in the region had ""just completed three months of morale-sapping restrictions and now they are waking up to the prospect of a month of even tougher restrictions"". He called for work to be done on a ""substantial localisation"" of the test and trace system, for self-employed people to be financially supported and for schools to close for two weeks for a ""true circuit break"". Mayor Joe Anderson said there is a crisis of confidence in the government Liverpool city mayor Joe Anderson accused the government of showing ""contempt"" for northern workers by offering more aid for the national lockdown than to regions placed in tier three restrictions. He said it was ""interesting... all of a sudden"" the money has been found. Mr Anderson said he welcomed the national lockdown but added: ""So, relief that it's finally been done but real contempt has been shown by this government for the people who advised for it [another lockdown], Sage, and also leaders like me and others that were calling for it six, seven weeks ago. ""I think there's now a crisis of confidence in relation to this government and their ability to actually manage this."" The government has been approached for a response.

Biden campaign begins major Pennsylvania blitzJoe Biden and Kamala Harris will be barnstorming the battleground state on Sunday and Monday.US Election 2020,"Donald Trump speaks at rallies in five key battleground states on Sunday on the penultimate day of campaigning His Democratic rival for the US presidency, Joe Biden, will campaign in Pennsylvania, another crucial state in the 3 November poll Some 90 million people have already voted ahead of election day on Tuesday The country is on course for its highest electoral turnout rate in more than a century Edited by Jessica Murphy People wait in line for a 1 November Trump rally in Hickory, North Carolina We're taking a break from our live coverage of the US election. We'll be back on Monday - the eve of the presidential election - so don't go too far. For now, here's a review of today's highlights.  Tomorrow is the final day of campaigning for Joe Biden and Donald Trump before the 3 November election. We'll be here for minute-to-minute coverage of their final hours on the trail. Today's live coverage has been brought to you by: Jessica Murphy, Tom Spender and Holly Honderich The Trump campaign has responded to Joe Biden's announcement of popstar Lady Gaga as a campaign guest in Pennsylvania on Monday by describing her as an ""anti-fracking activist"". Thousands of people in the key swing state are employed in fracking. Lady Gaga has expressed support in the past for Yoko Ono's Artists Against Fracking project. The Trump campaign said the singer's appearance would be a ""sharp stick in the eye"" for Pennsylvanians who work in the sector. Earlier this month Mr Trump seized on Mr Biden's remark during a presidential debate that he would ""transition from the oil industry"". ""I think he lost five or six states with that one,"" Mr Trump later said. Fracking allows drilling firms to access difficult-to-reach resources of oil and gas. In the US it has significantly boosted domestic oil production and driven down gas prices but has prompted concern from environmentalists who want investment to focus on renewable sources of energy. Earlier in the campaign cycle Mr Biden had suggested to voters that he favoured ending fracking, but since becoming the Democratic White House nominee he has said his policy is more limited - to end fracking leases on federal land. The US presidential election takes place on Tuesday. But it's possible the candidate with the most votes from the public won't be the winner. This is because the president is not chosen directly by the voters, but by what's known as the electoral college. The number of electors from each state is roughly in line with the size of its population. Each state gets as many electors as it has lawmakers in the US Congress (representatives in the House and senators). California has the most electors - 55 - while a handful of sparsely populated states like Wyoming, Alaska and North Dakota (and Washington DC) have the minimum of three. There are 538 electors in total. Each elector represents one electoral vote, and a candidate needs to gain a majority of the votes - 270 or more - to win the presidency. Read more here At a rally in the Pennsylvania city, Joe Biden addressed black Philadelphians, urging them to vote and emphasising Pennsylvania's status as one of the swing states that could decide the election. He also slammed President Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected black communities in the US. ""It's almost criminal the way he's handled it,"" he said, vowing a stronger test and trace operation and ""full, fair and free distribution of therapeutics"". ""It's a mass casualty event in the black community and it's totally unnecessary,"" he added. He vowed to address ""systemic racism"" in the US and said George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other black people killed by the police, sparking protests across the world, would not be forgotten. ""The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself and thatâs exactly what Trump has been trying to do,"" he said. ""Itâs wrong, itâs not who we are. We choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction and yes truth over lies, the multiple lies he repeats,"" he said. Mr Trump narrowly won the state in 2016 but polls indicate it's competitive this election. Secure borders, judicial appointments, patriotic education and the first woman on the moon - Donald Trump promised it all at his rally in Dubuque, Iowa on Sunday afternoon. Addressing Covid-19, he told supporters they had a choice between a ""deadly Biden lockdown"" or ""a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic"" - similar to comments he makes frequently on the campaign trail. He promised the most secure border in American history and more conservative judges. The rally featured appearances from several high-profile Trump supporters including his daughter, Ivanka Trump, aide Hope Hicks and former White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The visit to Iowa comes hours after a new state poll from the Des Moines Register and Mediacom suggests the president has a lead on his Democratic challenger in the state. It's just the second of five rallies Trump has scheduled for the day. At an earlier appearance in Michigan, Trump mentioned refugees an ""issue"" in the state, quipping that the cold weather there would turn prospective immigrants away. ""With this weather, you don't have to worry about it. They'll never come,"" he said to laughs from the crowd. ""It's freezing up there! I want to go back immediately to Syria,"" Trump said. ""Syria never looked so good.""  Joe Straus - the former Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives and a longtime Trump critic - has described a legal bid by state Republicans to have more than 100,000 votes cast at drive-through polling stations thrown out as ""patently wrong"". The moderate Republican said more voting should be welcomed rather than opposed. ""The Republican party needs to return to a place where we win with ideas and persuasion rather than trying to intimidate and silence,"" Straus said. Earlier today the Texas Supreme Court denied the bid, but a parallel complaint by Republicans in a federal court will be heard on Monday. The complaint alleges that voting at drive-through polling stations violate the US constitution and state election rules. Harris County, where the drive-through polling stations were set up, encompasses much of Houston and leans Democratic. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If there's one thing that Joe Biden and Donald Trump can agree on, it's this: this election is a big one. And with the influx of postal voting this year, it's also a confusing one. Different states have different rules for how - and when - to count postal ballots, meaning there will be large gaps between them in terms of reporting results. Here's your guide on what to look for on 3 Novemberas an unpredictable election night unfolds, and the results roll in. White House coronavirus adviser Scott Atlas has apologised for an interview on RT - Russian state television - during the election campaign. Atlas said he was ""unaware"" that RT was a registered foreign agent. ""I regret doing the interview and apologise for allowing myself to be taken advantage of,"" he said on Twitter. ""I especially apologise to the national security community who is working hard to defend us."" In the interview, the Trump adviser criticised virus shutdowns and downplayed the ongoing outbreak. Top US doctor Anthony Fauci this weekend said in an interview he had ""real problems"" with Atlas, ""who's talking about things that I believe he doesn't have any real insight or knowledge or experience in"". The White House has critiised Fauci for those and other remarks made to the Washington Post. Lady Gaga will join Mr Biden in Pittsburgh on Monday The Biden campaign is bringing in popstars Lady Gaga and John Legend as it throws resources at the key swing state of Pennsylvania. Joe and Jill Biden and Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff will ""fan out"" to ""all four corners"" of the state on Monday, the campaign said. Lady Gaga will join Mr Biden in Pittsburgh and John Legend will join Ms Harris in Philadelphia. Mr Biden is due to address voters in Philadelphia shortly. Pennsylvania was narrowly won by Mr Trump in 2016 and polls indicate the state is competitive this election. This video can not be played Just ahead of the presidential election, the US is seeing what could be the largest outbreak of the pandemic so far.
How will that affect how Americans vote? Top virus expert Anthony Fauci has sharply criticised the White House handling of the pandemic, telling the Washington Post newspaper that the country is ""in for a whole lot of hurt. It's not a good situation"". ""All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors,â he went on. âYou could not possibly be positioned more poorly."" In the interview, Dr Fauci contrasted the two presidential candidates' approach to the pandemic. He told the newspaper that Mr Biden was ""taking it seriously from a public health perspectiveâ, while President Trump had a different perspective and was focusing on âthe economy and reopening the countryâ. The White House has accused Dr Fauci of ""playing politics"" ahead of the election. On Saturday the US confirmed more than 99,000 new infections, a daily record. White House spokesman Judd Deere said Dr Fauci's comments were ""unacceptable"". âAs a member of the Task Force, Dr Fauci has a duty to express concerns or push for a change in strategy, but heâs not done that, instead choosing to criticise the President in the media and make his political leanings known by praising the Presidentâs opponent,"" he said. Dr Fauci also said he had less access to Mr Trump than previously, last spoke to him at the beginning of the month, when Mr Trump was recovering from the virus, and said the White House no longer wanted to hear his message because ""it wasnât what they wanted to do anymore"". âHe insists heâs not somebody whoâs pushing for herd immunity... everything is geared toward the concept of âit doesnât make any difference if people get infected. Itâs a waste of time. Masks donât work. Who cares.ââ Harris County, which covers much of Houston, leans Democratic The Texas Supreme Court has denied a request by Republicans to end drive-through voting in the state's most populous county and throw out more than 100,000 votes already cast. The court did not give a reason for its ruling. Republicans wanted the court to end the practice in Democratic-leaning Harris County, which covers much of Houston, arguing that it violated the US constitution and state election rules. However the same Republicans have lodged a parallel complaint in a federal court, which is due to make a ruling on the issue on Monday. Polls show a tightening race in Texas, with President Trump holding a 2.3% lead, according to Real Clear Politics Trump braved ""freezing"" four-degree temperatures in Michigan If you're just joining us, welcome to our coverage of the penultimate day of campaigning before the election - here's what's been happening:    Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate Kamala Harris is in Gwinnett County, Georgia today, telling supporters that they will decide the next president of the United States. And two days out from the election, Georgia is still in play. The state went for Trump in 2016 by 5 percentage points, but the Biden/Harris ticket are making a big push to bring it back to the Democrats. ""This is not
the time to let up,"" Harris tells the crowd, noting the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis. ""Everything
is at stake,"" she says. Donad Trump and Joe Biden are in the final leg of their race to the White House. In the US election system, it's the state-level results that count in picking the president. Each state has a number of electoral votes, based on population, and many reliably vote the same way each time. But in a few key battleground states, votes are still up for grabs. But who will win them? You decide. Take our quiz and predict the next president of the United States. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The massive surge of early in-person and mail voting in the 2020 general election is tangible evidence that interest and enthusiasm in the presidential race has translated into actual ballots cast. That should come as good news for Democrats, who may have wondered whether a supposed lack of excitement over Joe Bidenâs candidacy would damp down turnout on their side. Whether the Delaware Democrat has surprising devotion from his partyâs faithful or the prospect of four more years of a Trump presidency is too abhorrent for them to contemplate, the end result is the same â registered Democrats voted early in record-breaking numbers. Four years ago, Hillary Clintonâs campaign celebrated encouraging early voting numbers as well, particularly in Florida. On election day, however, an unexpected wave of support for Donald Trump erased that advantage. This time around, that phenomenon could be even more pronounced, given the presidentâs calls for his side to vote in-person instead of by mail. That would create its own set of problems if the race is close and overwhelmingly Democratic postal ballots take longer to count than in-person Republican ones. For the moment, however, higher civic involvement is something both sides can celebrate.   Shrai PopatBBC News, Florida This video can not be played US election: 'It just makes me feel like a nobody' Davion Hampton from Florida wants to vote in this US election. But he can't. Former prisoners like him had their voting rights restored in 2018, when Florida voters passed Amendment Four. But Republican lawmakers decided that a jail sentence was only complete when all prison fines and fees had been paid. Eight years after leaving prison for a drugs offence, Davion still owes more than $50,000. While state officials feel it's part of his punishment, campaigners believe thousands like Davion are being denied a say in what could be a pivotal state in the US election. Barack Obama is known for his political savvy, but he's earning praise for a slick three-pointer at Flint Northwestern High School in Michigan on Saturday, where he campaigned with Democratic candidate Joe Biden. ""That's what I do!"" Obama says, walking off the court, coffee in hand. The clip of the 44th president's basketball skills has gone viral, picking up nearly 40 million views on Instagram alone. He's even caught the eye of NBA All-Star LeBron James, who took to Twitter, calling the smooth shot ""all cash"". Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, says she expects to see a Republican surge on Tuesday that will put President Trump back in the White House. She told CBS that the pandemic had led many Democratic voters to vote by post but said surveys of Republican voters showed that they were planning to vote in person. ""The margins are going to be based on that Election Day turnout, and Republicans will have a surge that day. We're going to have that, and that's why we're going to win,"" Ms McDaniel told CBS Face the Nation. ""They want to make sure that their vote counts,"" she added. ""They're not completely trusting of the mail-ballot system, and so they've made that clear."" Joe Biden has been ahead of Donald Trump in most national polls since the start of the year - but there are tight races in key battleground states, and the election could go either way.

Government agrees Â£1.8bn London transport bailout,"The funding will enable Transport for London (TfL) to continue to support the capital for the remainder of the financial year Transport for London (TfL) has secured a Â£1.8bn government bailout, to keep Tube and bus services running until March 2021. The funding will ensure TfL can address its financial shortfall due to the loss of passengers as a result of Covid-19. The exact amount of money involved is subject to passenger revenue in the coming months. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the deal was ""not ideal"" but the government said it was ""proof of our commitment"". Covid and Crossrail - why TfL's finances are precarious Mr Khan said he fought hard against the ""very worst"" proposals, adding: ""The only reason TfL needs government support is because its fares income has almost dried up since March."" Without a bailout the network would be forced to issue a Section 114 order, the equivalent of bankruptcy for a public company. Discussions on longer-term sustainable funding continue, TfL said. TfL said it had not seen such rapidly reducing passenger numbers in 100 years Amendments to the Congestion Charge introduced in June as part of a previous bailout - a 30% increase in the fee and longer operating hours - will remain in place due to the new deal. Mr Khan said last month the government wanted TfL to extend the charging zone to the North and South Circular roads, covering around four million more Londoners. Is that the sound of a can getting kicked down the road? Both sides are declaring an element of victory in a negotiation that went down to the wire. The mayor is pleased he has seen off an extension to the congestion charging zone but - and this is crucial - the government is pleased concessions for over 60s and under 18s will have to be paid for in the future by City Hall. That could mean an increase in council tax. And don't forget fares will now be going up in January by inflation plus 1%. The timing of this is also very interesting - it puts the renegotiations around a new deal right slap bang in the middle of a mayoral election campaign. TfL Commissioner Andy Byford said: ""The agreement will enable TfL to continue to support the capital for the remainder of the financial year as discussions on longer-term sustainable funding continue. ""Reaching this agreement with the government allows us to help London through this next phase of the pandemic."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""This deal is proof of our commitment to supporting London and the transport network on which it depends. ""The mayor has pledged that national taxpayers will not pay for benefits for Londoners that they do not get themselves elsewhere in the country."" Mr Shapps said he was looking ""forward to working with London's representatives to achieve a long-term settlement, with London given more control over key taxes so it can pay more costs of the transport network itself"". TfL said it would receive a ""core amount of Â£1bn"", consisting of a Â£905m grant and Â£95m of borrowing. TfL has had to significantly reduce Tube services because of coronavirus Last month Boris Johnson claimed TfL was ""effectively bankrupted"" beforecoronavirus, and proposals to hike charges were ""entirely the responsibility"" of Mr Khan. Mr Khan previously said TfL  was spending Â£600m a month with hardly any income to cover those costs.

Australia records zero Covid-19 cases,"Traders have been reopening their businesses in Melbourne Australia has recorded its first day of no local cases of Covid-19 in almost five months. Zero cases were reported in the 24 hours between 20:00 on Friday and 20:00 on Saturday - the first time this has happened since 9 June. The state of Victoria - epicentre of Australia's second wave - recorded zero cases for the second day in a row after a 112-day lockdown. Health officials say more restrictions may be eased in the coming days.

"Calls for clarity over furlough extensionThe scheme, which pays up to 80% of wages, has been extended until December as England goes into a national lockdown.Scotland","Nicola Sturgeon urged people to stick to the rules to avoid a tighter lockdown The Treasury has been asked to provide clarity over the furlough scheme extension following the announcement of a four-week lockdown in England. The scheme, which pays up to 80% of wages of people unable to work, will now run until December. Both First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said support should be available if Scotland goes into a full lockdown later on. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said such a move could not be ruled out. Douglas Fraser analysis: Furlough's final furlong England gets ready for four-week lockdown Who is elegible to go back on furlough? Latest figures,externalreveal there were 1,148 new Covid cases - 7% of those tested - and a further six deaths in the last 24 hours. Of the total, 443 cases were recorded by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, 253 by NHS Lanarkshire and 140 by NHS Lothian. Scotland is currently adopting a regional approach to restrictions, with a new five-level system coming into effect on Monday. Ms Sturgeon said she believed tougher measures introduced in late September were starting to have an impact. However, she added: ""We are monitoring the spread of the virus in all parts of Scotland on a daily basis to assess if, to what extent and at what speed the slowdown is continuing. We will not hesitate to increase the level of protection either locally or nationally if required."" The four-week lockdown in England, which begins on Thursday, will see the closure of pubs, restaurants, gyms, non-essential shops and places of worship although schools, colleges and universities can stay open. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the measures, despite his previous opposition to a new national lockdown, after modelling suggested the spread of the infection could overwhelm the NHS and see the number ofdeaths rise possibly as high as 4,000 a day across the UK. Nicola Sturgeon is unlikely to be bounced into an immediate lockdown for Scotland because Boris Johnson's decided there will be one in England. Aside from the political optics, the first minister has already imposed weeks of tough restrictions in Scotland and there are signs they are working. Banning visits to other people in their own homes and shutting pubs and restaurants across the central belt seems to be slowing the growth in coronavirus cases. The new levels system, which only takes effect from 06:00 on Monday, will ease hospitality restrictions in much of the country, with the notable exception of Dundee. It would be odd to confirm the details of that system one week and switch to lockdown the next. The Scottish government wants to carefully monitor the spread of the virus and adjust the protection level for each local authority as required, rather than rushing to new national action. However, Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly made clear that if that doesn't work, she is prepared to consider another lockdown. What she wants is maximum flexibility to decide if and when that's needed. That means securing a guarantee from the Treasury that the furlough extension made available UK-wide during the lockdown for England would also be there if Scotland locked down at a later date. She's backed in that call by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross. Without that assurance, the Scottish government would face a serious dilemma - to stick with its current plan and hope it works or impose more restrictions than it was planning, in case it cannot access the financial support to do so in future. While the furlough scheme is UK-wide, Ms Sturgeon said there would be discussions on the details of how it would work in Scotland. ""A crucial point for us is whether support on the scale announced for English businesses is available for Scottish businesses now or if we needed to impose further restrictions later - or if it is only available if Scotland has a full lockdown at the same time as a lockdown in England,"" she said. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross tweeted that the same level of UK government job support must be available if Scotland needs to impose a national lockdown in future. Allow Twitter content?

In a speech tomorrow, he will argue the furlough scheme is a ""tangible reminder of the economic security of the Union"". ""Now that the scheme has been extended to cover the impact of a second lockdown in England, how could a Unionist government not restart the scheme if a second lockdown is required in Scotland?"" he is expected to say. Deputy First Minister John Swinney told BBC'sPolitics Scotlandthat household and hospitality restrictions have put the country in a ""stronger position"" than England. But Mr Swinney told the programme: ""I cannot rule out the possibility of further measures or indeed a national lockdown being required should the circumstances arise."" The deputy first minister said he had ""high confidence"" in the new level system. He continued: ""The time that we have taken to bear down on the virus over the course of the last two months has put us into, in general, a stronger position compared to the situation that prevails in England today."" This video can not be played Deputy First Minister John Swinney says another national lockdown cannot be ruled out Mr Swinney added that there is also ""significant differential"" in the virus in different parts of the country and also early signs that it may be ""flattening out"". On the issues of furlough, the deputy first minister said ""urgent clarity"" was needed on the circumstances in which it will be made available. He said: ""Are they only going to be available when England has got a problem? Or are they only going to be available at all times, in all parts of the United Kingdom when we all, at different stages, face difficulties and have to apply restrictions?"" Talks will take place on Sunday between the Scottish government and the Treasury to determine how the scheme will work. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Scotland was right to stick with the new five level system for now. He told Politics Scotland: ""Of course, we should never rule out a lockdown on a national basis but I hope we can avoid that because I think it is so restricting in terms of peoples' freedoms, opportunities and jobs."" Mr Rennie also welcomed the furlough scheme but urged the Treasury to be flexible and allow businesses to ""pick and choose"" when they use it. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer argued the lockdown should apply across the whole of the UK. Asked about the prospect on BBC One'sAndrew Marr Showhe said: ""Ideally, yes, and I have said for months that it ought to be a four nations approach. ""It is for the prime minister to lead on that and get people round the table."" Ms Sturgeon has repeated her advice toavoid non-essential travel to and from England,as well as other parts of the UK. She also urged people follow the new rules that come into force in Scotland at 06:00 on Monday. What level has your area been put in? She said: ""I encourage everyone to find out what level their local authority is in and to stick to the rules in their area. ""I also urge everyone to follow two key national restrictions by not mixing with other households inside our homes, and not travelling to or from any part of the country in level 3 unless it is absolutely essential.""

Johnson's nuclear option,"Nuclear weapon. Misery. Disaster. That's what he called it. And yet that is what he has done. Boris Johnson made absolutely no bones about his reluctance to act to instruct England to close its doors again in recent weeks. On Saturday evening, he was at pains to claim that lockdown 2.0 in England will be not nearly as restrictive as first time round. But again, the prime minister stood at the lectern and told us to ""stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"". Again, he warned the public that if the government didn't take draconian action then the health service would have to turn patients who need care away. Again, he and his top scientists presented evidence that the country could face an intolerable number of deaths during a wave of the pandemic that has turned our lives upside down in the last eight months. The prime minister's defence to the country, just squeezing a televised public briefing into the Halloween prime time TV schedules after a few hours of delay, was a well-worn political standby - when the facts change, it is the right thing to change course. It is true that data shared by the government on Saturday points to a prognosis that has worsened. One key document shows several UK daily death projections by different modellers, compared with the first wave and the government's ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" - which was seen in a report in August The UK is not the only country that has seen the progress of the disease go the wrong way, with France and Germany acting in recent days. But it is also true that Mr Johnson cannot say for a second that he was not warned. More than six weeks ago, not just the opposition, but some of Mr Johnson's own ministers, and some of his own advisers were pushing for another limited lockdown to try to slow the spread of the disease. Conversations were active in government by the third week in September about the possibility of taking national action as the second wave was developing, potentially in a more serious way than the scale of the pandemic in the spring. The PM decided at that point to plump instead for a local lockdown system, in the hope of controlling the spread without taking a hammer to the whole of the fragile economy only starting to get back to life. He chose to side with the Treasury and many newly assertive Tory backbenchers. As that tier system stuttered into life, complete with clashes with the local leaders around the country, conversations continued on and off about the possibility of a short, sharp, limited lockdown, or ""circuit-breaker"". Still, publicly, while those discussions continued, day after day ministers insisted the tier plan could and would work. The decisions were never simple. There was a logic to trying to resist taking more draconian action like this to try to limit the damage to the economy, the other terrible effects of lockdown. But Mr Johnson's original judgement now seems like it was a political accident just waiting to happen. Lockdown 2.0 is not an exact replica of first time round. There are notable differences - with schools, colleges and universities staying open, a fixed time limit of a month and, perhaps the most vital of all, the hope of a rapid acceleration of mass testing to make life with the virus more liveable. The picture is also different in different corners of the UK. Scotland is sticking to its new tiered approach for now, where there have been tighter regional restrictions for a while. Northern Ireland and Wales are also both already in forms of a second lockdown, with plans already for their exit. But something is very familiar. Having waited until this moment, the PM has again, just like in the spring, left himself open to the accusation that he delayed the inevitable, and the timing of his decisions is costly, perhaps to lives, and likely the government's own reputation.

Can I still go on holiday?,"From Thursday, holidays both inside England and abroad will be banned until 2 December, as the government tries to stop a second wave of coronavirus from spreading. The government has also said people must not travel to second homes either in the UK or abroad. ""Sadly... our message is people should stay at home,"" Cabinet Minister Michael Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. However, people travelling for work or education are exempt from the new rules. If you've booked a package holiday that includes flights and accommodation abroad, then you are entitled to a full refund. However if you booked flights yourself and your airline chooses not to cancel them, you could lose your money, according to the consumer group Which?. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of EasyJet, said ""it is likely"" that much of EasyJet's UK schedule will be cancelled during lockdown, with flying set to resume in early December. British Airways said all passengers booked to travel during lockdown can change the date of their flights without being charged. Alternatively, they can cancel the booking and take a voucher that can be put towards future flights. Many airlines urge customers not to try to contact them - they say passengers will be notified about changes to their bookings once more detail is made available from the government. Meanwhile, TUI advised that customers will be refunded in full or offered a credit note for holidays or flights that can't take place. Which? has warned that not all travel companies met their promises to refund passengers after the first lockdown began. ""Millions of people were left struggling to get refunds for cancelled flights and holidays when the government banned international travel back in March. Many still haven't been refunded,"" said Rory Boland, Which? travel editor. Virgin Holidays 'must pay refunds or face court' ""As travel restrictions are re-introduced in England, the government and regulator must do a better job of ensuring customers aren't again left to bail out companies through refunds being unlawfully withheld,"" he said. The government is not requiring people already on holiday to cut short their trips. ""British nationals currently abroad do not need to return home immediately,"" said a government statement. Last month the government added the Canary Islands to a list of quarantine-free travel destinations Those on domestic holidays in England don't need to rush home either. But the government warns that - because of the new coronavirus restrictions - restaurants and leisure venues will be closed from Thursday. A government statement said: ""Those currently on a domestic holiday will be allowed to finish their holidays, but are still subject to the requirements in England not to go out without a reasonable excuse"". Foreign nationals planning to arrive in the UK from abroad between 5 November - 2 December may still do so, however they will need to follow the appropriate lockdown rules in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Anyone arriving in England from abroad will need to quarantine for two weeks if they are coming from a country that isn't on the officialtravel corridor list.,external The ban on upcoming holidays comes just days after the government added the Canary Islands to the travel corridor list, meaning holidaymakers could travel there without having to self-isolate on their return - a move that was regarded by some as a lifeline for airlines and tour firms already struggling from the pandemic. ""The UK Government should surely have seen a week ago that it shouldn't have been reopening travel corridors if there was a possibility that it would need to then completely reverse that decision and implement a lockdown,"" said Emma Coulthurst from the holiday price comparison site TravelSupermarket. Winter breaks in England are banned until 2 December The first wave of coronavirus - and the travel restrictions that followed - have already caused huge financial damage to companies that rely on tourism. Industry groups representing airlines and airports say financial support from the state is vital for their members' survival. ""Aviation has been devastated by the pandemic, and has essentially never had the opportunity to recover,"" said a joint statement by Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade and the boss of the Airport Operators Association, Karen Dee. ""A ban on international travel means airlines and airports, already hamstrung by quarantine, are closed businesses and will require financial support now - which other sectors like hospitality have received - alongside a comprehensive restart package."" EasyJet boss John Lundgren echoed those calls: ""The government's own statistics show that activity in aviation is already 90% down on pre-pandemic levels, yet to date the government has still failed to provide any sector specific support,"" he said. ""A government financial support package for UK aviation companies must be provided now."" Last month, EasyJet warned it faces losses of more than Â£800m this year - the annual loss will be the first in EasyJet's 25-year history. Virgin Holidays 'must pay refunds or face court' Canary Islands added to UK's safe travel list EasyJet to make first annual loss in its history California's fire death toll doubles as chaos grips LA What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Furlough extension backlash after Welsh snub,"What will the new rules for Wales be when the firebreak ends? The way Wales has been treated over cash for jobs during its firebreak compared to England is ""not fair at all"", says its first minister. Mark Drakeford said requests to boost wage subsidies when a national lockdown was introduced in Wales were repeatedly turned down by the UK Treasury. In October, the UK government paid up to 60% of furlough pay - including in the first week of the Wales firebreak. It will now rise back to 80% across the UK asEngland's lockdown begins. ""When things change in England they change their minds about the furlough plan. And that's not fair,"" said Mr Drakeford. While welcoming the extension of furlough, he added: ""When we were asking it was impossible to do it. Now when they have made new decisions in England it is possible."" He said written requests to Chancellor Rishi Sunak prior to the all-Wales lockdown for additional job support measures were rebuffed. It included a request to bring forward the planned replacement for furlough in Wales - the new Job Support Scheme - to cover the Wales firebreak. ""I got an answer quickly to say that was not possible for a number of technical reasons and so no,"" Mr Drakeford toldBBC Radio Cymru. England faces a new lockdown from Thursday for a month. Eligible people in Wales will also benefit form the furlough extension - as well as from a decision toextend mortgage payment holidays. The Treasury said Wales was not being treated differently to England. A spokesman added: ""It is now clear that much broader restrictions are needed right across the country to contain the virus, so we have extended our financial support across the UK to help millions of people continue to provide for their families."" Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Firebreak to end regardless of new England lockdown Has devolution helped or hampered Covid response? Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the Welsh Government did not ask for a furlough extension, instead the request was related to the Job Support Scheme - which was due to replace furlough. Hetweeted, attaching a copy of the first minister's letter to the chancellor,external: ""They asked for a different scheme to be brought forward having already been told that it was impossible."" In a response to the comments, fired back on social media,external, the Welsh Government said Mr Hart ""has his facts wrong"". ""We have repeatedly asked and called for furlough to be extended to support workers and businesses in Wales,"" said Welsh Government officials. Mr Drakeford's cabinet has been meeting on Sunday to discuss the impact of the month-long lockdown in England. Wales' firebreak will end on 9 November - and the date will not change as a result of the prime minister's announcement on Saturday night, he said. But the English lockdown ""creates a new context"", Mr Drakeford said. He used the example of pubs in Wrexham serving until 22:00 GMT after the firebreak while pubs in Chester are still closed. If that attracts people over the border ""is that going to create problems for the police in Wales?"" he said. Mr Drakeford said he raised the issue with UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove on Saturday. ""He said it would be illegal for people in England to travel outside England during the lockdown period they will have,"" said Mr Drakeford. Health Minister Vaughan Gething toldBBC Breakfastthat England's restrictions, as he understood them, meant ""normal travel won't be possible into England because of their four week decision"". A new set of ""national rules"" across Wales is due to be announced on Monday. Non-essential shops have been closed in Wales, as well as pubs, restaurants and hotels The furlough extension has been a bone of contention between the Welsh and UK governments. It was due to end on Saturday and be replaced with the new, less generous Job Support Scheme. Mr Drakeford previously asked the Treasury to extend furlough for one week to coincide with the Welsh firebreak but his requests were turned down. Mr Sunak also declined a request for the new Job Support Scheme (JSS) - which will cover 67% of wages when it replaces furlough - to be brought forward. The Welsh Government said it had offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, which a minister estimated was Â£11m. Allow Twitter content?

But on Saturday, the furlough scheme was extended until England's lockdown ends on 2 December, which will include a return to the previous 80% level. Under the scheme, the government pays 80% of the salaries of staff who were kept on by their employer while unable to work, covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month. The furlough extension and the English lockdown has to be approved by MPs - they will vote on the measures on Wednesday. Ian Price, Wales' director of business group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said a lot of businesses had already made decisions in terms of redundancies, ahead of the furlough extension announcement. ""It won't have stopped those decisions being made but I think it'll ensure that not more people are made redundant during the month of November,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement. Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake said: ""I welcome the chancellor's swift action to support businesses in England, but it is regrettable that Welsh workers were not prioritised in the same way. ""People across Wales have been made redundant in recent days due to the UK government's dithering."" Meanwhile, Conservativemember of the Senedd (MS), Andrew RT Davies, said society needed to learn to live with coronavirus and avoid lockdowns that harm the economy. ""I still don't believe that a lockdown is the solution,"" he told theBBC's Politics Wales. ""Actually a lockdown is only introduced when governments have lost control of the situation and we have to accept that."" No go: Guests from England won't be able to travel to this Carmarthenshire holiday site for the next month Mark Hadley says the England announcement - even with furlough - will hit his family's holiday accommodation business hard. They run a self-catering and guesthouse site in Llandovery in Carmarthenshire. He said cancelledÂ bookings at Llanerchindda Farm will now top Â£250,000 this year, due to Covid restrictions. He said that was on an annual turnover of Â£340,000 - so it amounts to almost 75% of his business. ""Ninety-nine per cent plus of our business comes from England,"" he said. ""Now that people will not be able to travel from England, it really means that we will be remaining pretty much closed right until the beginning of December at the very least. ""It's a worst case scenario. We lost out the half-term weeks, which we cancelled over Â£20,000 of bookings over those two weeks and three weekends.Â ""We missed out on that and now we'll miss out again because we can't get anyone coming from over the border. It's a double whammy for us."" Covid cancellations have cost the family business Â£250,000 this year, says Mark Hadley, on the right with Martin and Lynn Hadley He said the problems he faces are being mirrored across the tourism and hospitality sector in Wales, but he understood governments both in Wales and the UK were under pressure to act. ""It's such a difficult situation isn't it? I can see there is a massive health agenda and a massive potential problem for the NHS. I would not like to be in their boat,"" he said. ""Could it have been handled better? Well, maybe."" Mr Hadley said he welcomed the extension to the furlough scheme during the England lockdown, as it meant his staff were ""secure for now"". But he added: ""Support for business, although they make it out to beÂ massive, it is minimal. ""For our compensation for the firebreak we're guarenteed hopefully a Â£1,000 - possibly Â£3,000 if we get the discretionary top-up - but nobody in our local authority can tell me how they work that discretionary amount out. ""We will be out of pocket, there are no two ways about it."" People have been urged to stay at home and many shops and businesses have been closed in Wales' firebreak Non-essential shops and hospitality will have to close in England for four weeks, until 2 December. But unlike the restrictions in spring, schools, colleges and universities will be allowed to stay open. After 2 December, the restrictions would be eased and regions would go back to the tiered system, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. Elsewhere,Scotland's new tiered system of restrictions,externalwill come into force at 06:00 on Monday. In Northern Ireland,external, pubs and restaurants were closed for four weeks on 16 October with the exception of takeaways and deliveries. Schools were closed for two weeks.

Who is eligible to go back on to furlough?,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs.

From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

Lockdown 'a devastating blow',"Restrictions are due to come into force on Thursday With another lockdown looming in England, everyone is facing further disruption to their lives and livelihoods. Pubs, gyms and non-essential shops will close, but schools, colleges and universities can stay open. The month-long measures are due to come into force on Thursday until 2 December,but may last longer. BBC News has spoken to people across England about how they will cope with the second lockdown. Some say they are better prepared, others will continue to diversify their business and several are hoping for more financial support from the government. Richard Strongman owns a wholesale food business Food wholesale owner Richard Strongman said the announcement was ""a bit of a devastating blow"". Mr Strongman, who is based in Lymington, Hampshire, said: ""I think we saw it coming, but [it's] a bit of a body blow for the hospitality industry and in turn that affects us at the wholesaler. ""We depend on hospitality for about 80% of our trade, the other 20% is care homes, hospitals, schools and we need the hospitality trade to help balance the cost base."" He said he welcomes the extension of the furlough scheme, but said it needs to be extended further to give businesses ""a fighting chance"". ""It's been incredibly hard, when the first lockdown came around, we lost 85% of our trade overnight, we pivoted very quickly to offer a home delivery service which helped a little bit. ""We were just getting back up to speed now and now we've been dealt another side swipe and it's just so hard to plan."" The couple were due to get married on Friday Ian Arrowsmith and Gemma Peake, were due to get married on Friday at a registry office in Crewe, having already changed their wedding plans and deciding on a smaller, local ceremony. Under the new restrictions, weddings and civil partnership ceremonies will not be able to take place except in exceptional circumstances. ""We don't want to have to wait again, you build yourself up to the moment,"" Mr Arrowsmith said. ""We just want to get married."" ""It's how they decide, elite sport can continue, schools are open, you can have wakes of up to 30 people, manufacturing and construction are being encouraged to stay open, but no weddings, it seems crazy to me,"" the sales manager said. ""There are people who have invested more expense, for a lot of people it will be a big emotional struggle."" Jon Best is hoping for a Christmas rush Jon Best, who owns a B&B close to Gatwick Airport in Crawley, West Sussex, said the announcement had provided some much-needed certainty. Like many businesses in the area, he was struggling to stay afloat due to a sharp drop in airline passenger numbers. ""It's been dire, we had no customers, but at least with the lockdown we know where we stand,"" the 54-year-old said. ""If anything it was a relief yesterday,"" he added. He is hopeful the lockdown will reduce the spread of the virus, allowing people to travel again when restrictions are due to be eased in early-December. ""Let's hope for a Christmas rush,"" he said. ""One good month could clear a lot of debt."" Andrew Carter owns a brewers as well as running two bars in Cumbria Andrew Carter, co-founder of artisan brewers Fell, in Flookburgh, Cumbria, said they had been preparing for such an announcement, but things were ""obviously going to be difficult"". ""The main thing is finding out what additional support we'll be getting, until we see that I'm not sure where we are at."" As well as the brewing side, the company runs two bars in Kendal and Penrith. He said: ""Our business model for these relies on late night weekend trade and that's been cut short, and we have also been unable to run music events, so it's been very hard for us to adapt to and absorb that. ""We're hanging on there, but we have been struggling a bit."" Mr Carter said he was concerned about a paragraph in the guidance which said hospitality venues could provide takeaways and delivery services, but ""takeaways of alcohol will not be allowed"". ""I'm not sure the brewery will survive if we cannot offer a takeout and delivery service - it's how we survived last time."" Dave Gray will offer a pizza and cocktail delivery service Dave Gray, owner of Plant vegan restaurant in Sadler Gate, Derby, had been gearing up to celebrate the first anniversary of its opening on 23 November. ""It's definitely been a rocky first year,"" he said. ""I don't think many businesses would have lasted. We've had to be quite flexible and we've got a lot of loyal customers, which has been a massive help. ""We've felt another national lockdown has been inevitable for a while so had already started working on some projects for if it did happen."" Mr Gray said he will start a pizza and cocktail delivery service and will continue to produce a range of gin liqueurs. ""But it's not ideal at all. I'm waiting to see if the government will help out hospitality businesses like last time. ""We only had one month rent free last time around so the hospitality grant only went so far."" ""We've followed the rules,"" says Lorraine Arnold, who runs Paignton Pier Chippy Lorraine Arnold, who runs Paignton Pier Chippy, said she was ""devastated"" at the news of having to close. ""I really thought we'd been so well behaved down here in the south west,"" she said. ""We've followed the rules, we've behaved."" ""Everything has gone as it should have and now we've been slapped in the face and here we are, back to square one."" She said she had bought a different business in Torquay in March, which was then unable to open until July. Mrs Arnold said explained she is due to begin a ""seven figure refurbishment"" this week, but this was now ""all up in the air, in jeopardy"". ""We've just got to sit down and work out exactly where we go next."" She added she was not sure it would be viable to keep on all of her 65 staff from the summer, despite the extension of the furlough scheme. Lou Wellman said his main goal is to ""take care"" of his staff Lou Wellman co-owns Boheme Coffee Lounge & Bar in Poole, like others he said the second lockdown has come ""as no great surprise"" saying he ""felt better prepared to deal with it this time"". ""I think it's preferable to the uncertainty of the tier system and it perhaps has a better chance of controlling the number of cases, but I have serious doubts about its effectiveness while schools and universities stay open as they seem to be the main source of positive tests. ""Thanks to the furlough scheme, we were able to retain all of our staff and with the idle time, managed to take a good look at our business and learn where we could be more efficient to help cope with the downturn in business when we reopened in July."" Mr Wellman said his main goal is ""take care of our staff"" and keep them employed. Christian Clark hopes December will bring ""some sort of stability"" Christian Clark, works in theatre lighting in London's West End, he said the announcement from a theatre perspective is ""disappointing and frustrating"". ""Shows affected will have to be postponed or cancelled once again and freelancers with work booked for November are suddenly at another loss of income."" He said with self-employed scheme not matching the rate of the furlough extension, many will feel ""incredibly let down"". ""Like other affected industries, theatre cannot be turned off and on like a tap,"" Mr Clark said. ""Hopefully December can bring a return to some sort of stability again."" Sam Gough says with correct restrictions in place, gyms should be allowed to stay open Sam Gough is a freelance personal trainer in Dorchester, Dorset, and firmly believes gyms should remain open. He said: ""I think gyms should have been classed as an essential business because of the great impact on mental and physical health it will cause when they're shut. ""I am positive that gyms are a safe place to be in during this time, with the correct restrictions in place, alongside a strict cleaning schedule. Vaani Kaur says for people's mental health gyms should remain open ""I really hope that the decision of closing the gyms changes soon,"" he added. Vaani Kaur, a 29-year-old teacher from Harrow, agrees with Mr Gough's stance, she said: ""Having a full lockdown isn't a good idea right now - the winter months are extra challenging on everyone's mental health. ""The full closure of gyms is wrong, it's a key factor in battling things like anxiety and depression and is needed in a year when these are at all-time high. They have been operating safely and no data has shown it has caused a spike in cases."" English lockdown may last beyond 2 Dec, says Gove Who can you have in your bubble?

Can my son still get married? And other questions,"A new lockdown in England is due to come into effect on Thursday 5 November, lasting until at least 2 December. Here are some of your questions about what the regulations will mean for you. You can meet one other person from another householdin an outdoor public place,external- those places include parks, beaches, the countryside, public gardens and playgrounds, but not private gardens. Children under school age, as well as those who need round-the-clock-care, do not count towards the total. So yes, two adults with babies can meet in a park. Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies cannot be held under the new lockdown rules, due to be in place until 2 December, unfortunately. That's whether they are at a church or elsewhere. There are very limited exceptions to this rule and the government is due to outline what these are on Monday when the full regulations are published. Support bubbles,externalare still in place during the new lockdown. Anyone who lives alone can join up with one other household, which can be of any number of people. It's advised that you form a bubble with someone who lives nearby to avoid unnecessary travel. Bubbles can also be formed with another household if a single adult lives with children who were under the age of 18 on 12 June 2020. And if someone shares custody of their child or children with someone they do not live with, they can have a bubble with the child's other parent in addition to their chosen support bubble. So, as long as your neighbour lives alone or with children under 18 and is not already in a bubble, other than for shared custody purposes, the answer is yes. Places like hotels and hostels are only going to be open for people who have to travel for work purposes. There are going to be a ""limited number of other exemptions"" set in law, the government has said. Also if you were planning a holiday rather than a business trip, you should bear in mind that the new rules state ""you should avoid all non-essential travel by private or public transport"". The government has said that certain businesses will have to close during the lockdown, with only those offering what are deemed essential services staying open. Those having to shut include what it called ""personal care facilities"", which are places like hairdressers and barbers, beauty and nail salons and spas. That was also the case during the first lockdown, earlier this year. In addition, mixing of households indoors is only allowed for very limited purposes - like childcare or providing other care - which would mean a mobile hairdresser could not visit your home. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has said that people will still be able to move house,whether they are renting or buying.,externalRemoval firms and estate agents can also carry on working but must follow Covid safety guidance. Places of worship are to be closed apart from in limited circumstances. This is for funerals, individual prayer, for broadcasts of acts of worship, formal childcare, voluntary and public services like blood donation or food banks, or for some support groups. They won't be open for normal services. And all indoor and outdoor leisure facilities - including gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools - will have to shut. People are being encouraged to exercise outside during the lockdown, in places like local parks. The new rules come into force at 00:01 GMT Thursday. From that point, overnight stays and holidays away from primary residences won't be allowed - in the UK or abroad. If you own a second home, you cannot stay in it. There are some specific exemptions, including if you have to stay away for work purposes or for education. It does depend where you are going however as, for example, no one is allowed to travel into Wales during the nation's current ""firebreak"" restrictions. And quarantine measures are in place for many overseas countries. Anyone currently abroad does not have to return home immediately, however, the government has said. Mortgage payment holidays are being extendedfor homeowners financially affected by the pandemic. Borrowers who have not yet had a mortgage holiday can request from their lender a pause in repayments, and that can last up to six months. Those who have had their payments deferred already can extend their mortgage holiday until they reach the six-month limit.

Government resists calls to shut England's schools,"Mayors of some of the areas hardest-hit by Covid-19 have called for England's schools and colleges to close during the lockdown. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said that education institutions should close to reduce the spread of the virus more quickly. Scientists have also warned Covid-19 is spreading fast in secondary schools. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said: ""We want to keep schools open."" Mr Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the government was taking the necessary measures to keep schools open. He rejected the suggestion that it would mean a longer period of lockdown because schools staying open would contribute to the continued transmission of coronavirus. Schools may need to shut to some years - scientist Emergency powers to require schools to teach online What happens if someone at school tests positive? Infection rates among secondary school children ""appear to be steeply increasing"", according tothe latest survey by the Office for National Statistics,external. An estimated 2% of children in Year 7 to Year 11 tested positive for the virus in the most recent week of testing, the highest positivity rate of any age group except sixth-formers and young adults. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told the Andrew Marr Show that keeping schools open was the ""big difference"" between the new restrictions and the lockdown in spring. ""Because we have delayed the onset of this lockdown it does make keeping schools open harder,"" he said. ""We know that transmission, particularly in secondary schools, is high."" He said that closing schools ""may have to be revisited"" over the next four weeks if the transmission of the virus continues to rise. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What do chancellor's plans mean for wages? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? The Manchester and Liverpool mayors said at a joint press conference that they wanted to see a period of two weeks' closure towards the second half of November, giving schools some time to prepare online learning. Mr Burnham said: ""That would create the conditions for the biggest drop in cases that we could achieve and it would then create the conditions for some kind of Christmas for more families, because they need it right now."" Without this, the mayors said they feared their regions would simply be back in the restrictive tier three measures. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he supports keeping schools open, but said ""we've got to manage the risk"". The National Education Union has called for schools and colleges to close, saying that if they stay open the restrictions will be less effective. Joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said the lockdown was ""another half measure and, without school closures as part of it, it is unlikely to have the effect that the prime minister wants"". Different parts of the UK have taken a different approach to schools during the second wave of the pandemic. In Northern Ireland,schools are due to reopen on Mondayafter an extended two-week half-term holiday, as part of a four-week period of additional restrictions. And in Wales, Years 9 and above in secondary schools will only return whenthe nation's ""firebreak"" lockdownends on 9 November.

'North worth less than South' mayor claimsNorth-west England politicians are angry at differences between local and national furlough rates.England,"Liverpool has the third highest number of infections in England Increased furlough payments for the national Covid lockdown shows the government ""believes the North is worth less than the South"", Liverpool's metro mayor has claimed. Boris Johnson announced workers would receive 80% of their wages if businesses closeduring a four-week lockdown in England from Thursday. Only 67% of pay was offered during tier three closures in the north of England. The government has yet to respond to the mayor's accusation. However, the Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: ""The announcement about furlough that was made yesterday was about the extension of a scheme, that would have expired last night, throughout the rest of this month. ""The chancellor and his team are looking at every aspect of economic support and more will be said in the days ahead about how we provide it."" Labour's Steve Rotheram said the government was ""unequivocal"" it would not consider changes to the local scheme offered in the north west. The Liverpool City Region mayor added: ""This morning millions of people woke up knowing the prime minister of this country believes the North is worth less than the South."" Andy Burnham was in a high profile battle with the government over furlough support In October, a row broke out between leaders in north-west England and the government over the level of compensation offered to workers and businesses when much of the region was placed into tier three, the highest level of restrictions. At a press conference earlier, Mr Rotheram said: ""Apparently all votes count equally, but all voters demonstrably don't to this government and the support you get from the chancellor of the exchequer depends on a horizontal line drawn across the country and on which side of it you sit."" ""I can assure the government that the people of the North won't easily forget that they were judged to be worth less than their southern counterparts."" Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said people in the region had ""just completed three months of morale-sapping restrictions and now they are waking up to the prospect of a month of even tougher restrictions"". He called for work to be done on a ""substantial localisation"" of the test and trace system, for self-employed people to be financially supported and for schools to close for two weeks for a ""true circuit break"". Mayor Joe Anderson said there is a crisis of confidence in the government Liverpool city mayor Joe Anderson accused the government of showing ""contempt"" for northern workers by offering more aid for the national lockdown than to regions placed in tier three restrictions. He said it was ""interesting... all of a sudden"" the money has been found. Mr Anderson said he welcomed the national lockdown but added: ""So, relief that it's finally been done but real contempt has been shown by this government for the people who advised for it [another lockdown], Sage, and also leaders like me and others that were calling for it six, seven weeks ago. ""I think there's now a crisis of confidence in relation to this government and their ability to actually manage this."" The government has been approached for a response.

"Furlough extension backlash after Welsh snubExtending furlough mid-way through Wales's firebreak is ""not fair at all"", first minister says.Wales","What will the new rules for Wales be when the firebreak ends? The way Wales has been treated over cash for jobs during its firebreak compared to England is ""not fair at all"", says its first minister. Mark Drakeford said requests to boost wage subsidies when a national lockdown was introduced in Wales were repeatedly turned down by the UK Treasury. In October, the UK government paid up to 60% of furlough pay - including in the first week of the Wales firebreak. It will now rise back to 80% across the UK asEngland's lockdown begins. ""When things change in England they change their minds about the furlough plan. And that's not fair,"" said Mr Drakeford. While welcoming the extension of furlough, he added: ""When we were asking it was impossible to do it. Now when they have made new decisions in England it is possible."" He said written requests to Chancellor Rishi Sunak prior to the all-Wales lockdown for additional job support measures were rebuffed. It included a request to bring forward the planned replacement for furlough in Wales - the new Job Support Scheme - to cover the Wales firebreak. ""I got an answer quickly to say that was not possible for a number of technical reasons and so no,"" Mr Drakeford toldBBC Radio Cymru. England faces a new lockdown from Thursday for a month. Eligible people in Wales will also benefit form the furlough extension - as well as from a decision toextend mortgage payment holidays. The Treasury said Wales was not being treated differently to England. A spokesman added: ""It is now clear that much broader restrictions are needed right across the country to contain the virus, so we have extended our financial support across the UK to help millions of people continue to provide for their families."" Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Firebreak to end regardless of new England lockdown Has devolution helped or hampered Covid response? Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the Welsh Government did not ask for a furlough extension, instead the request was related to the Job Support Scheme - which was due to replace furlough. Hetweeted, attaching a copy of the first minister's letter to the chancellor,external: ""They asked for a different scheme to be brought forward having already been told that it was impossible."" In a response to the comments, fired back on social media,external, the Welsh Government said Mr Hart ""has his facts wrong"". ""We have repeatedly asked and called for furlough to be extended to support workers and businesses in Wales,"" said Welsh Government officials. Mr Drakeford's cabinet has been meeting on Sunday to discuss the impact of the month-long lockdown in England. Wales' firebreak will end on 9 November - and the date will not change as a result of the prime minister's announcement on Saturday night, he said. But the English lockdown ""creates a new context"", Mr Drakeford said. He used the example of pubs in Wrexham serving until 22:00 GMT after the firebreak while pubs in Chester are still closed. If that attracts people over the border ""is that going to create problems for the police in Wales?"" he said. Mr Drakeford said he raised the issue with UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove on Saturday. ""He said it would be illegal for people in England to travel outside England during the lockdown period they will have,"" said Mr Drakeford. Health Minister Vaughan Gething toldBBC Breakfastthat England's restrictions, as he understood them, meant ""normal travel won't be possible into England because of their four week decision"". A new set of ""national rules"" across Wales is due to be announced on Monday. Non-essential shops have been closed in Wales, as well as pubs, restaurants and hotels The furlough extension has been a bone of contention between the Welsh and UK governments. It was due to end on Saturday and be replaced with the new, less generous Job Support Scheme. Mr Drakeford previously asked the Treasury to extend furlough for one week to coincide with the Welsh firebreak but his requests were turned down. Mr Sunak also declined a request for the new Job Support Scheme (JSS) - which will cover 67% of wages when it replaces furlough - to be brought forward. The Welsh Government said it had offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, which a minister estimated was Â£11m. Allow Twitter content?

But on Saturday, the furlough scheme was extended until England's lockdown ends on 2 December, which will include a return to the previous 80% level. Under the scheme, the government pays 80% of the salaries of staff who were kept on by their employer while unable to work, covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month. The furlough extension and the English lockdown has to be approved by MPs - they will vote on the measures on Wednesday. Ian Price, Wales' director of business group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said a lot of businesses had already made decisions in terms of redundancies, ahead of the furlough extension announcement. ""It won't have stopped those decisions being made but I think it'll ensure that not more people are made redundant during the month of November,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement. Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake said: ""I welcome the chancellor's swift action to support businesses in England, but it is regrettable that Welsh workers were not prioritised in the same way. ""People across Wales have been made redundant in recent days due to the UK government's dithering."" Meanwhile, Conservativemember of the Senedd (MS), Andrew RT Davies, said society needed to learn to live with coronavirus and avoid lockdowns that harm the economy. ""I still don't believe that a lockdown is the solution,"" he told theBBC's Politics Wales. ""Actually a lockdown is only introduced when governments have lost control of the situation and we have to accept that."" No go: Guests from England won't be able to travel to this Carmarthenshire holiday site for the next month Mark Hadley says the England announcement - even with furlough - will hit his family's holiday accommodation business hard. They run a self-catering and guesthouse site in Llandovery in Carmarthenshire. He said cancelledÂ bookings at Llanerchindda Farm will now top Â£250,000 this year, due to Covid restrictions. He said that was on an annual turnover of Â£340,000 - so it amounts to almost 75% of his business. ""Ninety-nine per cent plus of our business comes from England,"" he said. ""Now that people will not be able to travel from England, it really means that we will be remaining pretty much closed right until the beginning of December at the very least. ""It's a worst case scenario. We lost out the half-term weeks, which we cancelled over Â£20,000 of bookings over those two weeks and three weekends.Â ""We missed out on that and now we'll miss out again because we can't get anyone coming from over the border. It's a double whammy for us."" Covid cancellations have cost the family business Â£250,000 this year, says Mark Hadley, on the right with Martin and Lynn Hadley He said the problems he faces are being mirrored across the tourism and hospitality sector in Wales, but he understood governments both in Wales and the UK were under pressure to act. ""It's such a difficult situation isn't it? I can see there is a massive health agenda and a massive potential problem for the NHS. I would not like to be in their boat,"" he said. ""Could it have been handled better? Well, maybe."" Mr Hadley said he welcomed the extension to the furlough scheme during the England lockdown, as it meant his staff were ""secure for now"". But he added: ""Support for business, although they make it out to beÂ massive, it is minimal. ""For our compensation for the firebreak we're guarenteed hopefully a Â£1,000 - possibly Â£3,000 if we get the discretionary top-up - but nobody in our local authority can tell me how they work that discretionary amount out. ""We will be out of pocket, there are no two ways about it."" People have been urged to stay at home and many shops and businesses have been closed in Wales' firebreak Non-essential shops and hospitality will have to close in England for four weeks, until 2 December. But unlike the restrictions in spring, schools, colleges and universities will be allowed to stay open. After 2 December, the restrictions would be eased and regions would go back to the tiered system, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. Elsewhere,Scotland's new tiered system of restrictions,externalwill come into force at 06:00 on Monday. In Northern Ireland,external, pubs and restaurants were closed for four weeks on 16 October with the exception of takeaways and deliveries. Schools were closed for two weeks.

Government agrees Â£1.8bn London transport bailoutTransport for London has secured a six-month deal to keep services running until March 2021.London,"The funding will enable Transport for London (TfL) to continue to support the capital for the remainder of the financial year Transport for London (TfL) has secured a Â£1.8bn government bailout, to keep Tube and bus services running until March 2021. The funding will ensure TfL can address its financial shortfall due to the loss of passengers as a result of Covid-19. The exact amount of money involved is subject to passenger revenue in the coming months. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the deal was ""not ideal"" but the government said it was ""proof of our commitment"". Covid and Crossrail - why TfL's finances are precarious Mr Khan said he fought hard against the ""very worst"" proposals, adding: ""The only reason TfL needs government support is because its fares income has almost dried up since March."" Without a bailout the network would be forced to issue a Section 114 order, the equivalent of bankruptcy for a public company. Discussions on longer-term sustainable funding continue, TfL said. TfL said it had not seen such rapidly reducing passenger numbers in 100 years Amendments to the Congestion Charge introduced in June as part of a previous bailout - a 30% increase in the fee and longer operating hours - will remain in place due to the new deal. Mr Khan said last month the government wanted TfL to extend the charging zone to the North and South Circular roads, covering around four million more Londoners. Is that the sound of a can getting kicked down the road? Both sides are declaring an element of victory in a negotiation that went down to the wire. The mayor is pleased he has seen off an extension to the congestion charging zone but - and this is crucial - the government is pleased concessions for over 60s and under 18s will have to be paid for in the future by City Hall. That could mean an increase in council tax. And don't forget fares will now be going up in January by inflation plus 1%. The timing of this is also very interesting - it puts the renegotiations around a new deal right slap bang in the middle of a mayoral election campaign. TfL Commissioner Andy Byford said: ""The agreement will enable TfL to continue to support the capital for the remainder of the financial year as discussions on longer-term sustainable funding continue. ""Reaching this agreement with the government allows us to help London through this next phase of the pandemic."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""This deal is proof of our commitment to supporting London and the transport network on which it depends. ""The mayor has pledged that national taxpayers will not pay for benefits for Londoners that they do not get themselves elsewhere in the country."" Mr Shapps said he was looking ""forward to working with London's representatives to achieve a long-term settlement, with London given more control over key taxes so it can pay more costs of the transport network itself"". TfL said it would receive a ""core amount of Â£1bn"", consisting of a Â£905m grant and Â£95m of borrowing. TfL has had to significantly reduce Tube services because of coronavirus Last month Boris Johnson claimed TfL was ""effectively bankrupted"" beforecoronavirus, and proposals to hike charges were ""entirely the responsibility"" of Mr Khan. Mr Khan previously said TfL  was spending Â£600m a month with hardly any income to cover those costs.

Charlie Hebdo suspect tests positive for Covid-19The trial of the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack is suspended after the main suspect catches the virus.Europe,"Fourteen people are currently on trial in France over the 2015 attack The main suspect in the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack in France has tested positive for Covid-19 and his trial has been suspended, lawyers say. Ali Reza Polat is accused of helping the militant Islamist attackers who killed 12 people at the satirical magazine four years ago. The presiding judge says 10 accused accomplices must be tested for the virus before the trial can resume. The suspension is likely to delay the trial's conclusion later this month. Ali Reza Polat, 35, was sick and seen by a doctor, prompting the judge to suspend court for several days. Judge Regis de Jorna said 10 other suspects must be tested, and ""the resumption of the trial will depend on the results of these tests and the development of the health of the people concerned"". The defence lawyers were due to give their final submissions in the coming days, and verdicts were expected in two weeks' time. Fourteen people in total are on trial over the attack on the magazine, as well as related attacks on a police woman and Jewish supermarket that left 17 people dead in total over three days. Three of the 14 are being tried in absentia. The three gunmen in the two attacks were shot dead by police. Two gunmen killed 12 people in an attack on the magazine's office in 2015 Ali Reza Polat is seen as the main link between the attacks and is believed to have had a key role in obtaining the weapons used.

Calls for clarity over furlough extension,"Nicola Sturgeon urged people to stick to the rules to avoid a tighter lockdown The Treasury has been asked to provide clarity over the furlough scheme extension following the announcement of a four-week lockdown in England. The scheme, which pays up to 80% of wages of people unable to work, will now run until December. Both First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said support should be available if Scotland goes into a full lockdown later on. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said such a move could not be ruled out. Douglas Fraser analysis: Furlough's final furlong England gets ready for four-week lockdown Who is elegible to go back on furlough? Latest figures,externalreveal there were 1,148 new Covid cases - 7% of those tested - and a further six deaths in the last 24 hours. Of the total, 443 cases were recorded by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, 253 by NHS Lanarkshire and 140 by NHS Lothian. Scotland is currently adopting a regional approach to restrictions, with a new five-level system coming into effect on Monday. Ms Sturgeon said she believed tougher measures introduced in late September were starting to have an impact. However, she added: ""We are monitoring the spread of the virus in all parts of Scotland on a daily basis to assess if, to what extent and at what speed the slowdown is continuing. We will not hesitate to increase the level of protection either locally or nationally if required."" The four-week lockdown in England, which begins on Thursday, will see the closure of pubs, restaurants, gyms, non-essential shops and places of worship although schools, colleges and universities can stay open. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the measures, despite his previous opposition to a new national lockdown, after modelling suggested the spread of the infection could overwhelm the NHS and see the number ofdeaths rise possibly as high as 4,000 a day across the UK. Nicola Sturgeon is unlikely to be bounced into an immediate lockdown for Scotland because Boris Johnson's decided there will be one in England. Aside from the political optics, the first minister has already imposed weeks of tough restrictions in Scotland and there are signs they are working. Banning visits to other people in their own homes and shutting pubs and restaurants across the central belt seems to be slowing the growth in coronavirus cases. The new levels system, which only takes effect from 06:00 on Monday, will ease hospitality restrictions in much of the country, with the notable exception of Dundee. It would be odd to confirm the details of that system one week and switch to lockdown the next. The Scottish government wants to carefully monitor the spread of the virus and adjust the protection level for each local authority as required, rather than rushing to new national action. However, Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly made clear that if that doesn't work, she is prepared to consider another lockdown. What she wants is maximum flexibility to decide if and when that's needed. That means securing a guarantee from the Treasury that the furlough extension made available UK-wide during the lockdown for England would also be there if Scotland locked down at a later date. She's backed in that call by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross. Without that assurance, the Scottish government would face a serious dilemma - to stick with its current plan and hope it works or impose more restrictions than it was planning, in case it cannot access the financial support to do so in future. While the furlough scheme is UK-wide, Ms Sturgeon said there would be discussions on the details of how it would work in Scotland. ""A crucial point for us is whether support on the scale announced for English businesses is available for Scottish businesses now or if we needed to impose further restrictions later - or if it is only available if Scotland has a full lockdown at the same time as a lockdown in England,"" she said. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross tweeted that the same level of UK government job support must be available if Scotland needs to impose a national lockdown in future. Allow Twitter content?

In a speech tomorrow, he will argue the furlough scheme is a ""tangible reminder of the economic security of the Union"". ""Now that the scheme has been extended to cover the impact of a second lockdown in England, how could a Unionist government not restart the scheme if a second lockdown is required in Scotland?"" he is expected to say. Deputy First Minister John Swinney told BBC'sPolitics Scotlandthat household and hospitality restrictions have put the country in a ""stronger position"" than England. But Mr Swinney told the programme: ""I cannot rule out the possibility of further measures or indeed a national lockdown being required should the circumstances arise."" The deputy first minister said he had ""high confidence"" in the new level system. He continued: ""The time that we have taken to bear down on the virus over the course of the last two months has put us into, in general, a stronger position compared to the situation that prevails in England today."" This video can not be played Deputy First Minister John Swinney says another national lockdown cannot be ruled out Mr Swinney added that there is also ""significant differential"" in the virus in different parts of the country and also early signs that it may be ""flattening out"". On the issues of furlough, the deputy first minister said ""urgent clarity"" was needed on the circumstances in which it will be made available. He said: ""Are they only going to be available when England has got a problem? Or are they only going to be available at all times, in all parts of the United Kingdom when we all, at different stages, face difficulties and have to apply restrictions?"" Talks will take place on Sunday between the Scottish government and the Treasury to determine how the scheme will work. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Scotland was right to stick with the new five level system for now. He told Politics Scotland: ""Of course, we should never rule out a lockdown on a national basis but I hope we can avoid that because I think it is so restricting in terms of peoples' freedoms, opportunities and jobs."" Mr Rennie also welcomed the furlough scheme but urged the Treasury to be flexible and allow businesses to ""pick and choose"" when they use it. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer argued the lockdown should apply across the whole of the UK. Asked about the prospect on BBC One'sAndrew Marr Showhe said: ""Ideally, yes, and I have said for months that it ought to be a four nations approach. ""It is for the prime minister to lead on that and get people round the table."" Ms Sturgeon has repeated her advice toavoid non-essential travel to and from England,as well as other parts of the UK. She also urged people follow the new rules that come into force in Scotland at 06:00 on Monday. What level has your area been put in? She said: ""I encourage everyone to find out what level their local authority is in and to stick to the rules in their area. ""I also urge everyone to follow two key national restrictions by not mixing with other households inside our homes, and not travelling to or from any part of the country in level 3 unless it is absolutely essential.""

We'll be back on Monday - the eve of the presidential election - so don't go too far. For now, here's a review of today's highlights.  Tomorrow is the final day of campaigning for Joe Biden and Donald Trump before the 3 November election. We'll be here for minute-to-minute coverage of their final hours on the trail. Today's live coverage has been brought to you by: Jessica Murphy, Tom Spender and Holly Honderich The Trump campaign has responded to Joe Biden's announcement of popstar Lady Gaga as a campaign guest in Pennsylvania on Monday by describing her as an ""anti-fracking activist"". Thousands of people in the key swing state are employed in fracking. Lady Gaga has expressed support in the past for Yoko Ono's Artists Against Fracking project. The Trump campaign said the singer's appearance would be a ""sharp stick in the eye"" for Pennsylvanians who work in the sector. Earlier this month Mr Trump seized on Mr Biden's remark during a presidential debate that he would ""transition from the oil industry"". ""I think he lost five or six states with that one,"" Mr Trump later said. Fracking allows drilling firms to access difficult-to-reach resources of oil and gas. In the US it has significantly boosted domestic oil production and driven down gas prices but has prompted concern from environmentalists who want investment to focus on renewable sources of energy. Earlier in the campaign cycle Mr Biden had suggested to voters that he favoured ending fracking, but since becoming the Democratic White House nominee he has said his policy is more limited - to end fracking leases on federal land. The US presidential election takes place on Tuesday. But it's possible the candidate with the most votes from the public won't be the winner. This is because the president is not chosen directly by the voters, but by what's known as the electoral college. The number of electors from each state is roughly in line with the size of its population. Each state gets as many electors as it has lawmakers in the US Congress (representatives in the House and senators). California has the most electors - 55 - while a handful of sparsely populated states like Wyoming, Alaska and North Dakota (and Washington DC) have the minimum of three. There are 538 electors in total. Each elector represents one electoral vote, and a candidate needs to gain a majority of the votes - 270 or more - to win the presidency. Read more here At a rally in the Pennsylvania city, Joe Biden addressed black Philadelphians, urging them to vote and emphasising Pennsylvania's status as one of the swing states that could decide the election. He also slammed President Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected black communities in the US. ""It's almost criminal the way he's handled it,"" he said, vowing a stronger test and trace operation and ""full, fair and free distribution of therapeutics"". ""It's a mass casualty event in the black community and it's totally unnecessary,"" he added. He vowed to address ""systemic racism"" in the US and said George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other black people killed by the police, sparking protests across the world, would not be forgotten. ""The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself and thatâs exactly what Trump has been trying to do,"" he said. ""Itâs wrong, itâs not who we are. We choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction and yes truth over lies, the multiple lies he repeats,"" he said. Mr Trump narrowly won the state in 2016 but polls indicate it's competitive this election. Secure borders, judicial appointments, patriotic education and the first woman on the moon - Donald Trump promised it all at his rally in Dubuque, Iowa on Sunday afternoon. Addressing Covid-19, he told supporters they had a choice between a ""deadly Biden lockdown"" or ""a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic"" - similar to comments he makes frequently on the campaign trail. He promised the most secure border in American history and more conservative judges. The rally featured appearances from several high-profile Trump supporters including his daughter, Ivanka Trump, aide Hope Hicks and former White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The visit to Iowa comes hours after a new state poll from the Des Moines Register and Mediacom suggests the president has a lead on his Democratic challenger in the state. It's just the second of five rallies Trump has scheduled for the day. At an earlier appearance in Michigan, Trump mentioned refugees an ""issue"" in the state, quipping that the cold weather there would turn prospective immigrants away. ""With this weather, you don't have to worry about it. They'll never come,"" he said to laughs from the crowd. ""It's freezing up there! I want to go back immediately to Syria,"" Trump said. ""Syria never looked so good.""  Joe Straus - the former Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives and a longtime Trump critic - has described a legal bid by state Republicans to have more than 100,000 votes cast at drive-through polling stations thrown out as ""patently wrong"". The moderate Republican said more voting should be welcomed rather than opposed. ""The Republican party needs to return to a place where we win with ideas and persuasion rather than trying to intimidate and silence,"" Straus said. Earlier today the Texas Supreme Court denied the bid, but a parallel complaint by Republicans in a federal court will be heard on Monday. The complaint alleges that voting at drive-through polling stations violate the US constitution and state election rules. Harris County, where the drive-through polling stations were set up, encompasses much of Houston and leans Democratic. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If there's one thing that Joe Biden and Donald Trump can agree on, it's this: this election is a big one. And with the influx of postal voting this year, it's also a confusing one. Different states have different rules for how - and when - to count postal ballots, meaning there will be large gaps between them in terms of reporting results. Here's your guide on what to look for on 3 Novemberas an unpredictable election night unfolds, and the results roll in. White House coronavirus adviser Scott Atlas has apologised for an interview on RT - Russian state television - during the election campaign. Atlas said he was ""unaware"" that RT was a registered foreign agent. ""I regret doing the interview and apologise for allowing myself to be taken advantage of,"" he said on Twitter. ""I especially apologise to the national security community who is working hard to defend us."" In the interview, the Trump adviser criticised virus shutdowns and downplayed the ongoing outbreak. Top US doctor Anthony Fauci this weekend said in an interview he had ""real problems"" with Atlas, ""who's talking about things that I believe he doesn't have any real insight or knowledge or experience in"". The White House has critiised Fauci for those and other remarks made to the Washington Post. Lady Gaga will join Mr Biden in Pittsburgh on Monday The Biden campaign is bringing in popstars Lady Gaga and John Legend as it throws resources at the key swing state of Pennsylvania. Joe and Jill Biden and Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff will ""fan out"" to ""all four corners"" of the state on Monday, the campaign said. Lady Gaga will join Mr Biden in Pittsburgh and John Legend will join Ms Harris in Philadelphia. Mr Biden is due to address voters in Philadelphia shortly. Pennsylvania was narrowly won by Mr Trump in 2016 and polls indicate the state is competitive this election. This video can not be played Just ahead of the presidential election, the US is seeing what could be the largest outbreak of the pandemic so far.
How will that affect how Americans vote? Top virus expert Anthony Fauci has sharply criticised the White House handling of the pandemic, telling the Washington Post newspaper that the country is ""in for a whole lot of hurt. It's not a good situation"". ""All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors,â he went on. âYou could not possibly be positioned more poorly."" In the interview, Dr Fauci contrasted the two presidential candidates' approach to the pandemic. He told the newspaper that Mr Biden was ""taking it seriously from a public health perspectiveâ, while President Trump had a different perspective and was focusing on âthe economy and reopening the countryâ. The White House has accused Dr Fauci of ""playing politics"" ahead of the election. On Saturday the US confirmed more than 99,000 new infections, a daily record. White House spokesman Judd Deere said Dr Fauci's comments were ""unacceptable"". âAs a member of the Task Force, Dr Fauci has a duty to express concerns or push for a change in strategy, but heâs not done that, instead choosing to criticise the President in the media and make his political leanings known by praising the Presidentâs opponent,"" he said. Dr Fauci also said he had less access to Mr Trump than previously, last spoke to him at the beginning of the month, when Mr Trump was recovering from the virus, and said the White House no longer wanted to hear his message because ""it wasnât what they wanted to do anymore"". âHe insists heâs not somebody whoâs pushing for herd immunity... everything is geared toward the concept of âit doesnât make any difference if people get infected. Itâs a waste of time. Masks donât work. Who cares.ââ Harris County, which covers much of Houston, leans Democratic The Texas Supreme Court has denied a request by Republicans to end drive-through voting in the state's most populous county and throw out more than 100,000 votes already cast. The court did not give a reason for its ruling. Republicans wanted the court to end the practice in Democratic-leaning Harris County, which covers much of Houston, arguing that it violated the US constitution and state election rules. However the same Republicans have lodged a parallel complaint in a federal court, which is due to make a ruling on the issue on Monday. Polls show a tightening race in Texas, with President Trump holding a 2.3% lead, according to Real Clear Politics Trump braved ""freezing"" four-degree temperatures in Michigan If you're just joining us, welcome to our coverage of the penultimate day of campaigning before the election - here's what's been happening:    Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate Kamala Harris is in Gwinnett County, Georgia today, telling supporters that they will decide the next president of the United States. And two days out from the election, Georgia is still in play. The state went for Trump in 2016 by 5 percentage points, but the Biden/Harris ticket are making a big push to bring it back to the Democrats. ""This is not
the time to let up,"" Harris tells the crowd, noting the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis. ""Everything
is at stake,"" she says. Donad Trump and Joe Biden are in the final leg of their race to the White House. In the US election system, it's the state-level results that count in picking the president. Each state has a number of electoral votes, based on population, and many reliably vote the same way each time. But in a few key battleground states, votes are still up for grabs. But who will win them? You decide. Take our quiz and predict the next president of the United States. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The massive surge of early in-person and mail voting in the 2020 general election is tangible evidence that interest and enthusiasm in the presidential race has translated into actual ballots cast. That should come as good news for Democrats, who may have wondered whether a supposed lack of excitement over Joe Bidenâs candidacy would damp down turnout on their side. Whether the Delaware Democrat has surprising devotion from his partyâs faithful or the prospect of four more years of a Trump presidency is too abhorrent for them to contemplate, the end result is the same â registered Democrats voted early in record-breaking numbers. Four years ago, Hillary Clintonâs campaign celebrated encouraging early voting numbers as well, particularly in Florida. On election day, however, an unexpected wave of support for Donald Trump erased that advantage. This time around, that phenomenon could be even more pronounced, given the presidentâs calls for his side to vote in-person instead of by mail. That would create its own set of problems if the race is close and overwhelmingly Democratic postal ballots take longer to count than in-person Republican ones. For the moment, however, higher civic involvement is something both sides can celebrate.   Shrai PopatBBC News, Florida This video can not be played US election: 'It just makes me feel like a nobody' Davion Hampton from Florida wants to vote in this US election. But he can't. Former prisoners like him had their voting rights restored in 2018, when Florida voters passed Amendment Four. But Republican lawmakers decided that a jail sentence was only complete when all prison fines and fees had been paid. Eight years after leaving prison for a drugs offence, Davion still owes more than $50,000. While state officials feel it's part of his punishment, campaigners believe thousands like Davion are being denied a say in what could be a pivotal state in the US election. Barack Obama is known for his political savvy, but he's earning praise for a slick three-pointer at Flint Northwestern High School in Michigan on Saturday, where he campaigned with Democratic candidate Joe Biden. ""That's what I do!"" Obama says, walking off the court, coffee in hand. The clip of the 44th president's basketball skills has gone viral, picking up nearly 40 million views on Instagram alone. He's even caught the eye of NBA All-Star LeBron James, who took to Twitter, calling the smooth shot ""all cash"". Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, says she expects to see a Republican surge on Tuesday that will put President Trump back in the White House. She told CBS that the pandemic had led many Democratic voters to vote by post but said surveys of Republican voters showed that they were planning to vote in person. ""The margins are going to be based on that Election Day turnout, and Republicans will have a surge that day. We're going to have that, and that's why we're going to win,"" Ms McDaniel told CBS Face the Nation. ""They want to make sure that their vote counts,"" she added. ""They're not completely trusting of the mail-ballot system, and so they've made that clear.""

Second England lockdown 'a devastating blow',"Restrictions are due to come into force on Thursday With another lockdown looming in England, everyone is facing further disruption to their lives and livelihoods. Pubs, gyms and non-essential shops will close, but schools, colleges and universities can stay open. The month-long measures are due to come into force on Thursday until 2 December,but may last longer. BBC News has spoken to people across England about how they will cope with the second lockdown. Some say they are better prepared, others will continue to diversify their business and several are hoping for more financial support from the government. Richard Strongman owns a wholesale food business Food wholesale owner Richard Strongman said the announcement was ""a bit of a devastating blow"". Mr Strongman, who is based in Lymington, Hampshire, said: ""I think we saw it coming, but [it's] a bit of a body blow for the hospitality industry and in turn that affects us at the wholesaler. ""We depend on hospitality for about 80% of our trade, the other 20% is care homes, hospitals, schools and we need the hospitality trade to help balance the cost base."" He said he welcomes the extension of the furlough scheme, but said it needs to be extended further to give businesses ""a fighting chance"". ""It's been incredibly hard, when the first lockdown came around, we lost 85% of our trade overnight, we pivoted very quickly to offer a home delivery service which helped a little bit. ""We were just getting back up to speed now and now we've been dealt another side swipe and it's just so hard to plan."" The couple were due to get married on Friday Ian Arrowsmith and Gemma Peake, were due to get married on Friday at a registry office in Crewe, having already changed their wedding plans and deciding on a smaller, local ceremony. Under the new restrictions, weddings and civil partnership ceremonies will not be able to take place except in exceptional circumstances. ""We don't want to have to wait again, you build yourself up to the moment,"" Mr Arrowsmith said. ""We just want to get married."" ""It's how they decide, elite sport can continue, schools are open, you can have wakes of up to 30 people, manufacturing and construction are being encouraged to stay open, but no weddings, it seems crazy to me,"" the sales manager said. ""There are people who have invested more expense, for a lot of people it will be a big emotional struggle."" Jon Best is hoping for a Christmas rush Jon Best, who owns a B&B close to Gatwick Airport in Crawley, West Sussex, said the announcement had provided some much-needed certainty. Like many businesses in the area, he was struggling to stay afloat due to a sharp drop in airline passenger numbers. ""It's been dire, we had no customers, but at least with the lockdown we know where we stand,"" the 54-year-old said. ""If anything it was a relief yesterday,"" he added. He is hopeful the lockdown will reduce the spread of the virus, allowing people to travel again when restrictions are due to be eased in early-December. ""Let's hope for a Christmas rush,"" he said. ""One good month could clear a lot of debt."" Andrew Carter owns a brewers as well as running two bars in Cumbria Andrew Carter, co-founder of artisan brewers Fell, in Flookburgh, Cumbria, said they had been preparing for such an announcement, but things were ""obviously going to be difficult"". ""The main thing is finding out what additional support we'll be getting, until we see that I'm not sure where we are at."" As well as the brewing side, the company runs two bars in Kendal and Penrith. He said: ""Our business model for these relies on late night weekend trade and that's been cut short, and we have also been unable to run music events, so it's been very hard for us to adapt to and absorb that. ""We're hanging on there, but we have been struggling a bit."" Mr Carter said he was concerned about a paragraph in the guidance which said hospitality venues could provide takeaways and delivery services, but ""takeaways of alcohol will not be allowed"". ""I'm not sure the brewery will survive if we cannot offer a takeout and delivery service - it's how we survived last time."" Dave Gray will offer a pizza and cocktail delivery service Dave Gray, owner of Plant vegan restaurant in Sadler Gate, Derby, had been gearing up to celebrate the first anniversary of its opening on 23 November. ""It's definitely been a rocky first year,"" he said. ""I don't think many businesses would have lasted. We've had to be quite flexible and we've got a lot of loyal customers, which has been a massive help. ""We've felt another national lockdown has been inevitable for a while so had already started working on some projects for if it did happen."" Mr Gray said he will start a pizza and cocktail delivery service and will continue to produce a range of gin liqueurs. ""But it's not ideal at all. I'm waiting to see if the government will help out hospitality businesses like last time. ""We only had one month rent free last time around so the hospitality grant only went so far."" ""We've followed the rules,"" says Lorraine Arnold, who runs Paignton Pier Chippy Lorraine Arnold, who runs Paignton Pier Chippy, said she was ""devastated"" at the news of having to close. ""I really thought we'd been so well behaved down here in the south west,"" she said. ""We've followed the rules, we've behaved."" ""Everything has gone as it should have and now we've been slapped in the face and here we are, back to square one."" She said she had bought a different business in Torquay in March, which was then unable to open until July. Mrs Arnold said explained she is due to begin a ""seven figure refurbishment"" this week, but this was now ""all up in the air, in jeopardy"". ""We've just got to sit down and work out exactly where we go next."" She added she was not sure it would be viable to keep on all of her 65 staff from the summer, despite the extension of the furlough scheme. Lou Wellman said his main goal is to ""take care"" of his staff Lou Wellman co-owns Boheme Coffee Lounge & Bar in Poole, like others he said the second lockdown has come ""as no great surprise"" saying he ""felt better prepared to deal with it this time"". ""I think it's preferable to the uncertainty of the tier system and it perhaps has a better chance of controlling the number of cases, but I have serious doubts about its effectiveness while schools and universities stay open as they seem to be the main source of positive tests. ""Thanks to the furlough scheme, we were able to retain all of our staff and with the idle time, managed to take a good look at our business and learn where we could be more efficient to help cope with the downturn in business when we reopened in July."" Mr Wellman said his main goal is ""take care of our staff"" and keep them employed. Christian Clark hopes December will bring ""some sort of stability"" Christian Clark, works in theatre lighting in London's West End, he said the announcement from a theatre perspective is ""disappointing and frustrating"". ""Shows affected will have to be postponed or cancelled once again and freelancers with work booked for November are suddenly at another loss of income."" He said with self-employed scheme not matching the rate of the furlough extension, many will feel ""incredibly let down"". ""Like other affected industries, theatre cannot be turned off and on like a tap,"" Mr Clark said. ""Hopefully December can bring a return to some sort of stability again."" Sam Gough says with correct restrictions in place, gyms should be allowed to stay open Sam Gough is a freelance personal trainer in Dorchester, Dorset, and firmly believes gyms should remain open. He said: ""I think gyms should have been classed as an essential business because of the great impact on mental and physical health it will cause when they're shut. ""I am positive that gyms are a safe place to be in during this time, with the correct restrictions in place, alongside a strict cleaning schedule. Vaani Kaur says for people's mental health gyms should remain open ""I really hope that the decision of closing the gyms changes soon,"" he added. Vaani Kaur, a 29-year-old teacher from Harrow, agrees with Mr Gough's stance, she said: ""Having a full lockdown isn't a good idea right now - the winter months are extra challenging on everyone's mental health. ""The full closure of gyms is wrong, it's a key factor in battling things like anxiety and depression and is needed in a year when these are at all-time high. They have been operating safely and no data has shown it has caused a spike in cases."" English lockdown may last beyond 2 Dec, says Gove Who can you have in your bubble?

Man armed with sword kills two in Quebec,"Police arrested the suspect in the early hours of Sunday morning At least two people have been stabbed to death in the Canadian city of Quebec by a man armed with a sword and dressed in medieval clothing, police say. Five others were wounded in the Halloween night attack. A man in his mid-20s was arrested shortly before 01:00 (06:00 GMT) on Sunday. Police said an initial probe found the suspect was not affiliated with any extremist groups. The attack took place in the historic Old Quebec neighbourhood. Prime Minister Justin Trudeausaid on Twitter,external: ""My heart breaks for the loved ones of the two killed in last night's horrific attack in Quebec City. ""I'm also wishing a full recovery to the injured. We're keeping you in our thoughts and will be there for all of you."" He also thanked first responders for their critical work. The identity of the suspect has not been made public. At a news conference on Sunday, Quebec City Police Chief Robert Pigeon said it was believed that the attack was premeditated, adding that the suspect, from the Montreal suburbs, came to Quebec City with ""the intention of doing the most damage possible"". ""Dressed in medieval costume and armed with a Japanese sword, everything leads us to believe he chose his victims at random,"" Mr Pigeon added. The suspect had spoken of conducting an attack ""in a medical context"" five years ago but was not known to police and did not have a criminal record, police said. âFirst reports of the incident near the French-speaking city's national assembly came through shortly before 22:30 local time on Saturday. The suspect was arrested near the Espace 400e business park. Quebec's Le Soleil newspaper reported that he was lying on the ground, barefoot and hypothermic, when he was arrested. He surrendered to police without any resistance, it said. Following his arrest, the suspect was taken to hospital for ""evaluation"". The five wounded are also being treated in hospital, with varying levels of injury, according to police. Police have not released details of the victims' identities or ages. Reporters at the scene have tweeted photos of a police command post outside Quebec's Parliament Building. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

What has Trump said about your country?A look at how Donald Trump's direct approach has changed US relations around the world.,"Donald Trump is a man who prefers plain speaking to the language of diplomacy. During his four years in office, the US president has upended relationships with previously solid US allies, forged surprising new friendships and tweeted about it all - a lot. We've taken a look at the countries he's mentioned most on Twitter to pick out his most notable statements and give an overview of where US relations stand as we approach the election on 3 November. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. Before he became president, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, hetweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!"" But in September 2017, he agreedto send 3,000 extra troopsto bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. That same year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat,killing dozens of militantsfrom the so-called Islamic State group (IS) near the border with Pakistan. More recently though, President Trump talked of peace in the country and in February this year the USsigned an agreement with the Talibanto lift sanctions on the group and oversee a prisoner swap with the Afghan government in return for a ceasefire. Talks between the Taliban and the Afghan governmentremain ongoing, but President Trump is keen to push ahead with the withdrawal of US troops despiterecent violence. In early October, hetweetedthat the remaining troops ""should"" be home by Christmas - but thatwasn't endorsed by his top general. President Trump has dealt with two leaders of Argentina in his first term. The first, Mauricio Macri, is a man whose relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York. That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory. According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Mr Trump welcomed Mr Macri to the White House in April 2017 and his only trip to Latin America as president was to take part in the G20 summit hosted by the Argentine in 2018. But Mr Macri was defeated in 2019 by Alberto FernÃ¡ndez, a centre-left politician who in 2016 described Mr Trump's election win as a victory for the ""worst reactionary politics"". Unsurprisingly, Mr Trump's relationship with Mr FernÃ¡ndez has been less positive than it was with his predecessor. Just days before Mr FernÃ¡ndez entered office in December 2019, Mr Trump said he wasrestoring tariffs on steel and aluminium importsfrom Argentina - a threat that turned out to be empty but signalled a shift in the relationship. There has been less tension between the two countries this year, mostly because both have had to focus their attention on dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January 2017, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Postreportsaid the president abruptly ended the call after calling it ""the worst deal ever"". Mr Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation. Later in 2017,footageleaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart but officials in both countries dismissed it as harmless fun. Still, on the face of it neither episode appeared to affect the relationship much, with President Trump saying it was ""terrific"" and ""probably stronger now than ever before"". That continued when Scott Morrison replaced Mr Turnbull in 2018. He was given the full red-carpet treatment on a visit to the US in 2019 and was only the second person to have been givena state dinnerby President Trump - the other being French President Emmanuel Macron. The pair have lavished praise on one another, with Mr Trump a particular fan of Prime Minister Morrison's immigration policies. Hetweetedabout a controversial ad campaign in Australia last year, saying that ""much can be learned"" from the approach. In return, Mr Morrison haspraisedthe American president as ""a strong leader who says what he's going to do and then goes and does it"". On the campaign trail in 2016, Donald Trump referred to Belgium's capital Brussels as a ""hellhole"" and said it was no longer beautiful or safe after being attacked by terrorists earlier that year. Still, everything appeared to be amicable when he was welcomed to the country by King Philippe and Queen Mathilde in May 2017 before a Nato summit in the country. Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"". He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" andto meet Nato spending commitments- a topic Mr Trump has raised again and again during his time as president. But his most memorable moment in Belgium was when heappeared to shoveDusko Markovic, the prime minister of Montenegro, out of the way before a Nato family photo - putting his campaign slogan of ""America First"" firmly into action. President Trump has not had much to say about Brazil, South American's most influential country - a sign, perhaps, of his more isolationist approach to foreign policy. He had few public dealings with Michel Temer, while the latter was Brazil's president, but he's had a much more vocal relationship with Jair Bolsonaro, since he took over in January 2019. The Brazilian's first trip overseas after becoming president was to the US, where he swapped football shirts with Mr Trump andtold him: ""I've always admired the USA and this sense of admiration has only increased since you took office."" That high praise wouldn't have shocked many back home in Brazil, where he was dubbed the ""Trump of the Tropics"" by some parts of the media in the run-up to his election victory. President Trump has been equally lavish in his praise of Mr Bolsonaro and even said he would help Brazil join Nato - a suggestionruled outby the head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But the White House did designate Brazil as a ""major non-NATO ally"" in 2019, giving the country preferential access to US military equipment and training. Also notable is that Mr Trump and Mr Bolsonaro have shared a similar view of the coronavirus pandemic with both downplaying the seriousness of the threat it posed. They are also among a handful of world leaders to have caught the virus themselves, with both recovering fully. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language. As the African Union expressed ""shock, dismay and outrage"" and demanded an apology, Botswanasummoned the US ambassadorand asked the envoy ""to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US."" According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and he will have been pleased with how it went. Not only did he deal with President Trump'sfierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. But the relationship between the two leaders became strained not long after that first meeting with those tensions surfacing in public in June 2018 at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Most of the animosity was generated by President Trump's desire to replace Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement signed in 1994 by the US, Mexico and Canada. He used tariffs to encourage both nations torenegotiate a deal, which was eventually agreed in October 2018. After theannouncement, Mr Trumptweeted: ""Mexico, Canada and the United States are a great partnership and will be a very formidable trading force. We will now, because of the USMCA, work very well together. Great Spirit!"" Mr Trudeau, who has been in office since November 2015, has certainly had a slightly different relationship with Mr Trump to the ""bromance"" he had with former President Barack Obama. Describing Mr Trump's style, the Canadian PMsaid in 2018: ""The president prides himself on a level of disruption and unpredictability that is challenging certain aspects of global systems that we've perhaps taken for granted. And, it does keep me on my toes."" President Trump was quick to congratulate SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, a conservative like himself, when he was voted into office in January 2018,sayinghe looked forward to working together on ""issues of mutual interest"". Since then, the two billionaire presidents - Mr PiÃ±era's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (£2bn) - have had few dealings in public. But when the country was rocked by protests over inequality in late 2019, President Trumpbackedhis Chilean counterpart despite accusations from Amnesty International and others that the security forces were using excessive force on demonstrators. More recently, President PiÃ±era has tried to use his good relationship with Mr Trump to put Chile in ""pole position"" to get early access to a vaccine for coronavirus should the US develop one. Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail in 2016 that it turned intoa meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. After entering the White House, he antagonised Beijing again by breaking with diplomatic norms and accepting a call from the president of Taiwan, which is considered a breakaway province by China. When China raised objections, however, President Trump spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping on the phone andagreed to followthe so-called ""One China"" policy, which states that there is only one Chinese government. After that initial tension, Mr Trump changed tack and in April 2017 hosted his Chinese counterpart at Mar-a-Lago, his retreat on the Florida coast,sayingtheir relationship was ""outstanding"" and that ""tremendous progress"" had been made in their talks. President Xi then welcomed Mr Trump to Beijing in November that year, with the Americandescribingthe ceremony as a ""truly memorable and impressive display"". At a joint press conference afterwards, Mr Trumptoldthe Chinese president: ""You are a very special man."" The two countries spent a lot of 2018 discussing a trade deal, with President Trump complaining that previous negotiations had been ""so one sided in favour of China"". But despite the talks, no agreement emerged and the two countries engaged in a trade war that carried over into 2019. A ""phase one"" deal was eventually signed at the beginning of 2020, with Mr Trump modestlydeclaring it""one of the greatest trade deals ever made!"" Analysts were split over how good a deal it was, but both leaders were able topresent themselves as winners. Not long after celebrating the deal, President Trumptweetedabout a little known virus in China that was beginning to look concerning: ""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!"" Two months later, more than 1,000 people infected with the virus had died in the US and the number of confirmed cases was fast approaching 100,000. Mr Trumpdescribedhaving had a ""good conversation"" with President Xi and said: ""We are working closely together. Much respect!"" But by the summer of 2020 though, his tone had changed. Mr Trump began referring to coronavirus as the ""China virus"" andtweeted: ""China has caused great damage to the United States and the rest of the World!"" And as the election has neared, he's upped his anti-China rhetoric,accusing themof working to replace him with his Democratic rival Joe Biden ""so they can continue to rip-off the United States"". Donald Trump's relationship with the two Colombian presidents he's dealt with - first Juan Manuel Santos and then IvÃ¡n Duque - has concentrated on drug cartels and Venezuela. He has hosted both men at the White House and held talks with them on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. President Duque visited the White House in February 2019, mainly to discuss the situation in Colombia's neighbour Venezuela, which has been engulfed ina political crisisfor several years now. In a joint press conference after the meeting, the US president was asked if he would be visiting Colombia, to which hereplied: ""I'll be visiting. I really want to. I want to visit Colombia. I look forward to visiting."" He's yet to make the trip. Later that year, President Trumpsaidof US-Colombia ties: ""We have a great relationship. They're not doing badly. They have a problem because of Venezuela a lot of people are pouring in. But Colombia, we've had a great relationship with Colombia."" One of Donald Trump's many campaign promises was that he would roll back on President Obama's historic move in 2014 to restore full diplomatic relations with Cuba. Once in office, Mr Trump did indeedsayhe was ""cancelling"" the deal with Cuba and he re-imposed certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor. But the president's approach has not scrapped all of the Obama-era policy regarding the island nation. Both countries will keep their embassies open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and US tourists can still visit the country, albeit under stricter conditions. During a speech in 2017 in Miami's Little Havana neighbourhood, where Mr Trump signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted President Obama's deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government as ""terrible and misguided"". He said the US would not lift sanctions on Cuba until ""all political prisoners are freed"" and vowed to ""help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives"". Later that year, the US withdrew most staff from its embassy in Havana after several people there came down with mysterious health issues, including hearing loss, nausea and dizziness. US officials said the incident was an acoustic attack, but it remainsa bit of a mystery. As the election approaches, President Trump has sought to win over the large population of Cuban-Americans in the swing state of Florida by tightening the sanctions on the country. Talking at a ceremony in September honoring veterans of the failed Bay of Pigs operation in 1961, Mr Trump described his predecessors' policy as ""weak"" and ""pathetic"" andboasted: ""I canceled the Obama-Biden sellout to the Castro regime."" President Trump has had a bumpy relationship with Denmark's leaders. Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House. Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence. But the meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" However, things got a little bizarre in August 2019 when it emerged that President Trump haddiscussed buying Greenland, the autonomous Danish territory. Mr Rasmussen, who had been replaced as PM a couple of months earlier,tweetedhis response to the story: ""It must be an April Fool's Day joke ... but totally out of season!"" But it wasn't a joke and Mr Trump promptly cancelled a planned trip to Denmark after Mette Frederiksen, the new Danish prime minister, described the suggested sale as ""absurd"" - a comment Mr Trumpcalled""nasty"". Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship continued once Mr Trump was in office and President Sisi visited the White House in April 2017 for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, criticised Mr Trump for meeting a man accused of a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead. But officials said the US was seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because President Trump saw a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against terrorism. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East. The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstances"". An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands ona glowing orbat the meeting set social media abuzz. The US did withhold $195 million in military aid to Egypt in 2017 amid concerns about the country's human rights record - butthe funds were releasedthe following year. Mr Trump has not visited Egypt as president but his wife has been there while first lady. The most memorable moment of Melania Trump's visit, which was part of a whistle-stop tour of Africa in October 2018, was a tour of the Giza pyramids she didsporting a Panama hat. President Trump's relationship with El Salvador got off to a bumpy start when he was reported to have made a controversial remark during a meeting with US lawmakers about a new immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language. Mr Trump's administrationannouncedin January 2018 that it would cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US. They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001. Salvadoreans were originally given until January 2020 to leave, face deportation, or find a legal way to stay. But that deadlinewas extendedto January 2021. President Trump met Salvadorean President Nayib Bukele on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September 2019, wherehe told reportersthat the relationship between the two men ""has been excellent"". In April this year, Mr Trumptweetedthat the US would be helping El Salvador get ventilators amid the coronavirus pandemic, saying: ""They have worked well with us on immigration at the Southern Border!"" Ethiopia hasn't featured on Mr Trump's agenda for much of his presidency, but he has caused some controversy in the capital Addis Ababa this year. In January, President Trump said he deserved a Nobel Peace Prize because he had ""made a deal"" that ""saved a country"" - seemingly a reference to negotiations between Ethiopia and Eritrea that ended in a peace deal between the two countries. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won the prestigious prize for his part in the process, which appeared to upset Mr Trump somewhat. Speaking at a campaign rally in Ohio, the presidentsaid: ""I made a deal, I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country... As long as we know, that's all that matters... I saved a big war."" While not integral to the talks between Ethiopia and Eritrea, Mr Trump did play a role in discussions over water resources in the region between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan. Ethiopia is building a huge dam on part of the River Nile within its borders, but this has upset neighbouring Sudan and Egypt who are concerned about water shortages further up the river. In Addis Ababa, the US is seenas having sided with Egypton the dispute. The US announced in September that it would cut some aid to Ethiopia after it began filling the reservoir behind the dam in July, while discussions with Egypt and Sudan were still under way. In October, while on a call with the leaders of Sudan and Israel, Mr Trump said the issue of the dam was a ""very dangerous situation because Egypt is not going to be able to live that way,"" adding: ""I say it loud and clear - they'll blow up that dam. And they have to do something."" In response, PM Abiy Ahmedsaid: ""Ethiopia will not cave in to aggression of any kind."" He added that threats of any kind over the issue were ""misguided, unproductive and clear violations of international law"". Finland's President Sauli NiinistÃ¶ was invited to the White House in October 2019 but his relationship with Donald Trump has been fairly low-key. In fact, his visit was overshadowed by questions surrounding Mr Trump's impending impeachment and much of the leaders' joint press conference was taken up byan angry exchangebetween the American president and a reporter. Another notable moment in the relationship came in 2018 amid bad wildfires in California, when Mr Trump said poor management was to blame and pointed towards Finland as a country that managed the risk better. ""I was with the president of Finland,"" Mr Trumptold reporters, ""and he said: 'We're a forest nation' and they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don't have any problem."" President Niinisto, however, said he could not remember talking about raking when the two met. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president. After the first meeting between the two men in Brussels in May 2017, Mr Macron described his white-knuckledhandshakewith Mr Trump as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day event as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". Although there was an awkward moment during the trip, when Mr Trumptold President Macron and his wifethat she was ""in such good shape"". President Macron visited the White House in April 2018 and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite their differences on policy, they appear to get on well. There have been several moments of tension though. In November 2019, President MacrondescribedNato as ""brain dead"" because of a waning commitment to the alliance by the US. Mr Trumphit backby saying the French leader had been ""nasty"" and ""very disrespectful"". He also called Mr Macron ""foolish"" when France moved to introduce a tax on US technology companies and threatened to add a tax on French wine as retaliation, tweeting: ""I've always said American wine is better than French wine!"" Mr Macron put the new taxon hold. President Trump's only mention of Georgia on Twitter  was in 2017, when heposed for a photowith the country's leader at the time, Giorgi Kvirikashvili, at the White House. He has not yet met the new Georgian prime minister, Giorgi Gakharia, but hereportedlysent him a letter in May this year to celebrate the country's independence day. In the letter, President Trump thanked Georgia for its ""significant contributions"" to the Nato mission in Afghanistan and said the US would continue to support the country's bid to become a Nato member state. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, hetook to Twitterto describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The pair have met several times since that first meeting and while Mr Trump has paid tribute to Mrs Merkel in public, his tone on Twitter is often less approving. President Trump has repeatedly taken issue with Germany failing to spend the Nato target of 2% on defence,accusingthe country of being ""delinquent"" in its payments to the alliance. He has also accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". But it has not been empty rhetoric from President Trump. In July this year, the USannouncedit was withdrawing about 12,000 of its troops from Germany in what officials described as a ""strategic"" repositioning of its forces in Europe. Mr Trump's explanation was a little more direct, telling reporters: ""We don't want to be the suckers anymore. We're reducing the force because they're not paying their bills; it's very simple."" The visit of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October 2017 could have been awkward, as he had previously criticised Mr Trump and even called him ""evil"". But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Mr Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech."" Mr Tsipras said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. The Greek prime minister was replaced by Kyriakos Mitsotakis in January 2019 and Mr Trump hosted him and his wife at the White House a year later. Speaking in the Oval Office, Mr Trump said the relationship between the two countries was ""really extraordinary"" and said Greece had made a ""tremendous comeback"" after its financial crisis. Mr Mitsotakis will have charmed the president by comparing his economic policy to Mr Trump's, saying: ""The Greek economy has done extremely well over the past months. We have lowered taxes. We are deregulating. We're following a recipe that has also worked here."" The pair spoke again on the phone in August this year, with Mr Trumpexpressing concernsabout rising tension between Greece and Turkey. In September, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Mr Mitsotakis during a visit to a US naval base on the Greek island of Crete andsaid: ""The relationship between our two countries is at an all-time high and getting stronger."" Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Hetweetedthat he had ""never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.'"" Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump reportedly asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language. Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidortold the BBCthe idea that ""we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US"" is wrong. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Securityannouncedthat Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, granted to Haitians following the 2010 earthquake, would end in July 2019. The move was initially deemed unlawful but in September 2020, an appeals courtsided with the Trump administration, meaning those with TPS could be forced to leave the US early next year. Joe Biden, Mr Trump's Democratic rival in the election, has vowed to reverse the decision if he wins. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked: ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"". President Trump has sought to decrease the number of migrants coming into the country from Latin America,threateningto cut aid to Honduras unless its government stopped large caravans of people heading towards the US. He has also tried to reduce the number of Hondurans already in the country, with his administration announcing in June 2018 that it was ending the Temporary Protection Status (TPS) that had granted nearly 60,000 Hondurans the right to live in the US. Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998, but the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster. At the moment, the TPS for Hondurans in the US is due to end in January 2021, but Joe Biden, Mr Trump's Democratic rival in the election, has vowed to reverse the decision if he wins. President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi several times and the pair appear to have developed a strong relationship. At the White House in June 2017, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations. ""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who described himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"". President Trump dispatched his daughter Ivanka to India in November 2017 for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"", with officials in Hyderabadremoving beggarsfrom the streets and rushing through road repairs before she arrived. But the president himself finally visited the country in February this year and was welcomed by huge crowds everywhere he went. Mr Modi organiseda huge eventto honour President Trump - thought to have cost more than $13m - with 100,000 people turning up to hear the two men speak. Although, most of them wereon their way outby half-way through Mr Trump's speech. During the speech, Mr Trump spoke of increasing defence cooperation between the two countries and said India had agreed to buy helicopters and other US military equipment worth $3bn. He told the crowd: ""I believe that the United States should be India's premier defence partner, and that's the way it's working out."" The pair wereunable to agree a trade dealduring President Trump's visit though, but they announced that negotiations would continue. Trade has been the major hiccup to their relationship so far, with Mr Trumpcomplainingin 2019 that Indian tariffs on US products were ""unacceptable"". Another recent move that will have strained relations between the two was Mr Trump'slate-night Twitter announcement in Aprilthat he was suspending immigration into the US in a bid to ease unemployment among Americans due to the coronavirus pandemic. The move included the H-1B visa, which allows US companies to employ highly-skilled foreign workers and is widely used by the technology sector. Indiansreportedlymake up nearly 70% of the 85,000 H-1B visas issued every year. Mr Trump and Indonesia's President Joko Widodo have met a few times at international and regional summits. The only mention Mr Widodo has had in the president's tweetswas in April this yearwhen Mr Trump said his ""friend"" had asked for ventilators to help cope with the coronavirus pandemic, which the US would provide. ""Great cooperation between us!"" he added. Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration in 2017, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised some eyebrows in the US. ""I don't know whether I am the only Indonesian who was invited, but I didn't see any other over there,"" he told Indonesian magazineTempoin February 2017. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and he told the magazine he has ""close access"" to the US president. In June 2019, it wasreportedthat President Trump had sold a mansion he owned in Los Angeles to Mr Tanoesoedibjo for some $13.5 million. While Donald Trump hasn't spoken to Iran's leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about the country. One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a ballistic missile test, which Tehran said had not violated a UN resolution on its nuclear activities. The US confirmed that Tehran was continuing to comply with the UN agreement but Mr Trumplabelled ita ""terrible deal"" and ordered a review into it nonetheless. During a trip to Israel in 2017, Mr TrumpsaidIran ""must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias."" He later claimed in a tweet that Iran was working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons. Then in May 2018, President Trump finally decided to pull out of the UN agreement with Iran,saying: ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal."" Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. In June 2019, Iranannouncedit would ignore some elements on the deal and begin ramping up enrichment of low-grade uranium. President Trumprespondedon Twitter by saying: ""Be careful with the threats, Iran. They can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before!"" Then in December 2019, the rhetoric turned into violence when the USconducted air strikesin Iraq and Syria against an Iran-backed Iraqi militia blamed for an attack that killed a US civilian contractor. In response, protesters attacked the US embassy in Baghdad and Mr Trump said Iran was responsible,tweeting: ""They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat."" Then just a couple of days later,a US air strikein Iraq killed Iran's most powerful military commander, General Qasem Soleimani. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promised ""severe revenge"" on those behind the attack and missiles were fired at air bases housing US forces in Iraq. In September, Mr Trumptweetedabout reports that Iran was preparing to retaliate for the killing of Gen Soleimani and said any attack on the US would be met with an attack on Iran ""that will be 1,000 times greater in magnitude!"" Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq was central to his initial foreign policy objectives in office. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. Eventually, however, Iraq was taken off the list after it agreed to conditions from the US government. That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trumpover the phonein February 2017 amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trumptold reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now."" In July 2018, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart,sayingthe city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. Battles against IS continued into 2019, but a happy President Trumppresented a mapin March of that year showing how their territory had been eradicated since he came into office, telling reporters: ""So that's the way it goes."" Then in October 2019, Mr TrumpannouncedIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had killed himself during a US military operation in Syria, saying he had been ""violently eliminated"" and ""died like a coward"". The president later praised a US military dog for the ""wonderful job"" it did in the operation,tweeting a photothat he said had been declassified. Despite the successful operation against IS forces, there was some tension between the US and Iraq later in 2019. Whena US air strikein Baghdad killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, Iraq's parliament called on US troops to leave the country. Mr TrumpthreatenedIraq with ""sanctions like they've never seen before"" and US troops remained in the country. President Trump is now talking about US troops in Iraq returning home though. During a meeting with the country's new prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, President Trumpsaid: ""We're going to be leaving, and hopefully we're going to be leaving a country that can defend itself."" In September, the USannouncedit was reducing its force in the country that month from about 5,200 to 3,000. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Latin America and the Middle East, but thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US have also been concerned. Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March 2017,sayingthere were ""millions out there who want to... make America great."" Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March 2018, saying the two had ""become friends - fast friends - over a short period of time"". After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US. President Trump did visit Ireland in June 2019,telling reportersduring the trip: ""We love the Irish, so it's an honour to be here."" Mr Trump spent two nights at the golf resort he owns in Doonbeg, County Clare, during the trip - where his sonspaid a visitto a local pub. Despite the pair's good relationship, Mr Varadkar was critical of the US earlier this year when hesaidthere had been an ""absence of moral leadership"" in the wake of protests over the killing of unarmed black men by white police officers. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel. He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he had come to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the two countries. In August that year, Mr Trumptweetedthat ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!"" But by December he had chosen a new path,recognisingJerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the move ""deplorable"" and said the US could no longer be a peace broker. Mr Trump pushed ahead with the decision though and in May 2018, his daughter Ivanka waspart of a delegationdispatched to open a new US embassy in Jerusalem. Marking the one year anniversary of the opening, President Trumptweetedin May 2019: ""Our beautiful embassy stands as a proud reminder of our strong relationship with Israel and of the importance of keeping a promise and standing for the truth."" In a sign of his warm relationship with Mr Netanyahu, the president congratulated him on becoming the country's longest serving prime minister in July 2019,tweetingthat he had ""led Israel with a commitment to the values of democracy, freedom, and equal opportunity that both our nations cherish and share!"" In January 2020, President Trumpunveiledhis long-awaited ""vision for peace, prosperity and a brighter future for the Israelis and Palestinians"". Mr Netanyahu called the plan the ""opportunity of the century"" but the Palestinian president dismissed it as the ""slap of the century"". In September, Mr Trumphailedthe ""dawn of a new Middle East"" after the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed agreements fully normalising their relations with Israel - becoming just the third and fourth Arab countries to recognise Israel since its founding in 1948. President Trump has dealt with two Italian prime ministers during his time in the White House. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, waswelcomedto Washington DC in April 2017 and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly happier after meeting Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June 2018. After a brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US presidentcalledMr Conte a ""great guy"". The two leaders have some similarities in their policies, with Mr Trump tweeting in 2018 that he'dspoken toMr Conte about Italy's ""very hard line on illegal immigration"" and said: ""I agree with their stance 100%, and the US is likewise taking a very hard line on illegal immigration."" In March this year, Mr Trumptweeted a videoof Italian air force jets creating their national flag with coloured smoke and said: ""THE UNITED STATES LOVES ITALY!"" The display came amid a rising death toll from the coronavirus pandemic in Italy. President Trump visited the country twice in quick succession in May 2017 and he also travelled to Vatican City where hemetwith Pope Francis, which hedescribedas the ""honour of a lifetime"". Amid the NFL national anthem controversy in 2017, President Trump singled out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as an example for other sportspeople to follow. Hetweeted: ""Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!"" Mr Trump had criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem as a protest, to highlight the treatment of black Americans. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice and paid several visits to the White House. Mr Trump spoke to the Japanese leader frequently throughout his first two years in office, mainly to discuss US negotiations with North Korea. Golf has been a key part of their relationship and they've managed to fit in several rounds, playingin Floridaand alsoin Virginia. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November 2017 - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he tooka tumble into a bunker. Mr Trump was keen to land a new trade deal with Japan,tweetingin 2019 that Mr Abe has been ""working with me to help balance out the one-sided Trade with Japan"". The two countries did agree an initial deal focusing on agriculture in September that year, with President Trumpcalling ita ""tremendous"" agreement. Prime Minister Aberesignedfor health reasons in August 2020, with Mr Trumpsayinghe would soon be ""recognised as the greatest Prime Minister in the history of Japan"". Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had several meetings since. The first occasion came in February 2017 on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April that year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June 2018 as well. Jordan was a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. The relationship was strained in late 2017 though, when President Trump announced that the US would be recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moving its embassy there. King Abdullahsaidthe decision would ""undermine efforts to resume the peace process"". US relations with Kenya were always likely to be very different under Donald Trump to how they were under Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan. When Mr Trump entered office in 2017, his decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa - before speaking to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was taken as a snub by some in the country. When they did speak, the two leadersdiscussedsecurity in the region and President Trump praised Kenya's ""significant contributions"" to the African Union force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring Somalia. While President Trump has not visited the country - or any others in Africa - First Lady Melania Trump did stop in Kenya briefly during herwhirlwind tourof the continent in October 2018. But her decision to wear a pith helmet while on safaricaused some controversy. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, for the first time during his May 2017 visit to Saudi Arabia. He called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans. The emir then visited the White Houselater that yearand held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"". President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according toPolitico. The Kuwaiti emir visited the White House again in 2018, when President Trumpdescribedhim as ""a very special friend of mine"". Earlier this year, while the emir was being treated for an illness in the US, Mr Trump awarded him the Legion of Merit, a rarely awarded honour,sayinghe had ""been a truly unwavering friend and partner to the United States"" and an ""unparalleled diplomat"". The emir died at the age of 91in September. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record showshe backed actionat the time. HehostedLibyan Prime Minister Fayez Al-Sarraj at the White House in December 2017, where the pair ""agreed to work together to advance Libyan stability and unity"". The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. But the US leader has been keen to take a less engaged approach to the country's problems,telling reportersin 2017 that he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. Since then, however, the country has become a battleground for regional powers with Turkey and Russia backing opposing forces. Mr Trump has appeared keen not to get involved in the ground war. Astatementfrom Robert O'Brien, his national security adviser, in August said the US was deeply troubled by the ""escalating conflict"" but remained an ""active, but neutral, actor"". No Donald Trump rally during his 2016 election campaign was complete without the crowd chanting: ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay for it, officially announced his intention to build the wall inan executive ordersigned on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" Mr PeÃ±a Nieto and Mr Trump unsurprisingly had a bumpy relationship at best. The Mexican leader was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. But Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, who became the new Mexican president in 2018. They spoke for the first time in July that year, with Mr Trumpsayinghe had predicted Mr Obrador would become president of Mexico years earlier. In 2019, President Trump turned up the rhetoric once again,accusingMexico of having ""taken advantage of the United States for decades"" andthreateningto put tariffs on their goods. But after negotiations, the two countriessigned a dealthat required Mexico to deploy troops along its southern border with Guatemala to stem the flow of migrants heading for the US. Earlier this year, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador said President Trump had ""completely changed his rhetoric"" towards the country,telling a reporter: ""The relationship with President Trump is very good and, as I said yesterday, he has treated us like friends, not as distant neighbours."" A few months after Jacinda Ardern became prime minister of New Zealand, the headline ofa featureabout her in Vogue magazine called her ""young, forward-looking, and unabashedly liberal - call her the Anti-Trump"". So it should come as no surprise that Ms Ardern and Mr Trump have not become best friends - but their relationship has appeared amicable enough most of the time. The pair met for the first time at a summit in Vietnam in 2017, where Ms Ardern said President Trump joked to someone else present that she had ""caused a lot of upset in her country"" with her election win. She replied: ""You know, no-one marched when I was elected."" When New Zealand suffered from a terrorist attack in March 2019, Mr Trump said he had spoken to Prime Minister Ardern andtold her""we stand in solidarity with New Zealand â and that any assistance the USA can give, we stand by ready to help. We love you New Zealand!"" The two leaders had a private meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2019, with Mr Trumpdescribingit as ""wonderful"". But there has been some tension recently, specifically over the two countries' different approach to dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. In August this year, Mr TrumpallegedNew Zealand was experiencing a ""big surge"" in cases but Ms Ardernsaidhis comparison of her country and the US was ""patently wrong"". On the day of Mr Trump's remark, the US recorded 40,000 new cases while New Zealand had just nine. And in October, when Ms Ardern was asked whether President Trump had called to congratulate her on an historic election victory, shetold reporters: ""I don't tend to have those direct communications with the president of the United States."" Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal, in part to deal with an influx of migrants from Central America. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked: ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language. Mr Trump's administrationannouncedin November 2017 that it would remove the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Nicaragua, introduced in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America. At the moment, the TPS for Nicaraguans in the US is due to end in January 2021, but Joe Biden, Mr Trump's Democratic rival in the election, has vowed to reverse the decision if he wins. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February 2017. During the call, Mr Trumpsignalled his intentionto renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April 2018, Mr Trumpsaidthe aircraft would help ""improve Nigeria's ability to target terrorists and protect civilians"". The controversial deal went ahead, despite some concerns from members of Congress, and the aircraft are due to be delivered in 2021. There wasan awkward momentfor both leaders at that joint press conference in 2018 when a journalist asked about reports that Mr Trump had referred to some African countries as ""shitholes"". President Buhari sidestepped the question, saying he was unsure of the report's validity, but Mr Trump didn't deny he'd made the comment. ""The [Nigerian] president knows me and he knows where I'm coming from,"" Mr Trump said. ""And you do have some countries that are in very bad shape and very tough places to live in."" Earlier this year, President Trumpexpandedhis administration's curbs on immigration to include six more countries, including Nigeria, reportedly due to them not meeting US security and information-sharing standards. In response, President Buharisaidthe country would work to fix the issues in order to maintain ""productive relations"" with the US. President Trump made history in June 2018 when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader. It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump hadthreatenedto unleash ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" if North Korea endangered the US. The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk. Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months - including the presidenttweetingthat he had a ""nuclear button"" and it was ""much bigger and more powerful one than his"" - as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed. In 2018, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down with Mr Kim and eventually the long-awaited summit happened in Singapore in June, with the US presidentthankingthe North Korean leader for taking ""the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people"". The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It committed North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promised ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang. They met again in Hanoi in February 2019 but talks ended without agreement after the US refused North Korean demands for sanctions relief. ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times,"" Mr Trumpsaid afterwards. In May that year, North Korea tested several missiles, but President Trumptweeted: ""Deal will happen!"" The next month, Mr Trump became the first sitting US president to step foot in North Korea bymeeting Mr Kim in the Demilitarized Zone. But talks broke down again later in the year and North Korea conducteda further seriesof missile tests in March 2020. Speaking at the White House in September, Mr Trumpsaidhe had saved ""millions of lives"" by averting a war with North Korea. When Prime Minister Erna SolbergmetMr Trump in Washington in 2018 she may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jetonly available in Call of Duty, a computer game. A day later Norway wasreportedlymentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and called some African nations ""shitholes"". Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Responding to Mr Trump, Torbjoern Saetre, a politician in Norway's Conservative Party,tweeted: ""On behalf of Norway: Thanks, but no thanks."" Tensions between the US and its previously close ally have been strained for years, but it was clear that the relationship would become even more strained when President Trump outlined his strategy towards the region in his first year in office. ""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace,"" Mr Trump said ina speechin August 2017. In January 2018, he took to Twitter again toaccusePakistan of giving ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan"" before adding: ""No more!"" Military aid worth $300m (£230m) was eventuallycutin September that year, with a Pentagon spokesman saying the US would continue ""to press Pakistan to indiscriminately target all terrorist groups"". It was with this as the backdrop that new Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan flew to Washington DCto meet President Trumpfor the first time in July 2019. There were smiles for the cameras and Mr Trump openeda joint press conferenceby calling Mr Khan ""very popular"" and ""a great athlete"". He once again accused Pakistan of failing to respect the US in recent years but he said the country was ""helping us a lot now"". Shortly after their meeting, there was renewed violence in Kashmir between Pakistani and Indian forces. At a meeting with Mr Khan in September during the UN General Assembly, Mr Trump offered to mediate between the two sides,saying: ""I think I would be an extremely good arbitrator. I have done it before, believe it or not, and I have never failed as an arbitrator."" The pair met again earlier this year, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. Mr Trumpsaidthe relationship between the two countries had ""never been closer"" but admitted he had no plans to visit the country - although he didtravel to Indiathe next month. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"". During avisitto Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again later that month, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. But Mr Trump'srecognitionof Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017 led to a sharp deterioration in relations as didhis threatsto withdraw financial support. Discussing Mr Trump's plans for Middle East peace in January 2018, Mr Abbassaid: ""The deal of the century is the slap of the century and we will not accept it."" Later that year, the USended its fundingfor the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, describing it a ""irredeemably flawed"" - a move President Abbas said was an ""assault"" against his people. Despite the rift though, Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, told reporters in June 2019 that the president was ""very fond"" of Mr Abbas,adding: ""He likes him very much personally. And at the right time, if they're willing to engage, I believe that they'll find that they'll have an opportunity."" President Trumpunveiled the detailsof his Middle East peace plan in January 2020, which involved recognising Israeli sovereignty over settlements in the West Bank. Mr Abbas rejected the plan andsaid: ""All our rights are not for sale and are not for bargain."" As recently as September, however, President Trump said his plan was still on the table. Talking at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hesaid: ""We're working on a deal. We're talking to the Palestinians. At the right time, they'll be joining too."" President TrumpmetPresident Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs. But the most memorable moment from their joint press conference was when Mr Trumpappeared to take creditfor building the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" the president said at the meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it, right?"" ""Yeah. One hundred years ago,"" Mr Varela responded. Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". Mr Varela was replaced by Laurentino Cortizo in 2019. Mr Trumpsent a delegationto Mr Cortizo's inauguration, led by Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. Mr Cortizosaidhe spoke to Mr Trump on the phone in May this year, during which the American president offered to help Panama during the coronavirus pandemic. Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski had a substantial amount of contact with Mr Trump in his first few months in the White House. The two men spoke several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski also visited Washington DC for a meeting with the president. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president was particularly interested in persuading the USto deportits fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo. Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. But he was eventuallyarrestedin the US in July 2019 before beingreleased on bailin March this year because of the risk he faced of contracting coronavirus while waiting for trial. Mr Kuczynski was replaced by MartÃ­n Vizcarra in March 2018. Mr Trump was due to meet President Vizcarra at a summit in Peru's capital Lima in April 2018, but hecancelled the tripat short notice to deal with reports of a chemical weapons attack in Syria. Donald Trump has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they caused a lot of controversy in the US. Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" in which theydiscussed""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has beenwidely criticisedfor human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Dutertecalled hima ""son of a whore"". Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trumphailedtheir ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"". Mr Trump did invite Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Earlier this year, Mr Dutertesaidhis American counterpart ""is a good president and deserves to be re-elected"". Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people. During avisitthere in July 2017, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"". Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victory over war"" during his speech in Warsaw. He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance. ""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. Polish President Andrzej Duda has visited the White House a couple of times since then, most recently in June 2019, when Mr Trumptweeted: ""US-Poland ties are at an all-time high. Thank you for being such an exemplary Ally!"" Mr Trump sent hiscongratulationsto Mr Duda after he was re-elected in July this year. A month later, the USannouncedit was redeploying about 1,000 American troops from Germany to Poland. The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself. The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. But soon after that, several Gulf countriescut travel and embassy linkswith Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denied supporting radical Islamism. Mr Trump took initialcreditfor applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June 2017, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism,tweeting: ""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar â look!"" Barely a year later, however, Mr Trump welcomed Sheikh Tamim to the White House andpraised himfor becoming a ""big advocate"" of combating terrorist financing. He also said the emir was a ""great gentleman"" and a ""friend of mine"". Theymet againin the White House the following year. Mr TrumpsaidQatar was ""creating a lot of jobs"" in the US by ""buying tremendous amounts of military equipment including planes and they are buying commercial planes... we very much appreciate it"". No US relationship has been more closely scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in July 2018, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election. He was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" hereplied. But a day later, Mr Trump saidhe had misspoken. ""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's team during the election campaign. Iteventually concludedthat Russia had interfered in the election with the intention of benefitting Mr Trump's campaign but that there was no evidence the campaign conspired with Russia. Mr Trump has tweeted more about Russia than any other country during his time as president, with the investigation being a big reason why. His administration has been pretty tough on Russia, punishing it with sanctions. But Mr Trump has also spoken of his desire to improve relations with Russia. In March 2018, hetweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory. The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thingâ¦"" Then the following month, healarmed alliesby saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. In December 2019, President Putinwarnedthat the US now viewed space as ""a military theatre"" and said Russia needed to develop its own space forces further. But a few weeks later, hethankedMr Trump for US intelligence that helped foil ""acts of terrorism"" on Russian soil. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that has continued under President Trump - despite some issues along the way. Mr Trumpmade his first foreign tripas president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in Riyadh, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn). Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when hetook partin a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to want to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia ina diplomatic standoffwith Qatar. When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trumptweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!"" There was some tension when Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist with US residency,was killed in Turkeyin October 2018. President Erdogan of Turkey said it was a ""political murder"" carried out by Saudi intelligence officers, which Saudi Arabia denied. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr Trumpsaid: ""They had a very bad original concept, it was carried out poorly and the cover-up was the worst in the history of cover-ups. He latersaidhe had spoken to King Salman, whose denial was ""very, very strong,"" beforeadding: ""It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows?"" More recently, Mr Trump called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Hetweetedhis gratitude when the Saudis and Russia agreed on a deal in April. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong several times during his four years in office. Their relationship had an awkward moment early on, when the president's social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram after their first meeting at a G20 summit andmistakenly identifiedthe prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo. But Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House a few months later during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" The two men also signalled the two countries' alliance in 2019 when they renewed a military pact that allows US forces to use Singapore's air and naval bases, extending it to 2035. Announcing the move, PM Leesaidit reflected the ""very good cooperation"" of the countries on defence but also the broader cooperation ""in security, in economics, in counterterrorism, and in culture and education, as well"". Somalia felt the effects of the Trump presidency almost immediately, with the country among those whose citizenswere bannedfrom entering the US. The move followed Mr Trump's call in 2015 for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"". His statement came after a mass shooting in California carried outby a radicalised couple. While the travel ban was initially blocked by court challenges, it was eventuallyupheld in 2018by the Supreme Court. In May 2017, a member of the US militarywas killedin Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the disastrous Black Hawk Down incident in 1993, when more than a dozen US soldiers and hundreds of Somalis were killed. There wasanother US fatalityin June 2018. The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. The number of drone strikes carried out by the US military in Somaliahas increaseda lot under President Trump. But the militant Islamist group has stubbornly resisted the offensive andkilled three Americansacross the border in Kenya in January this year. Mr Trump isreportedto have recently told his military advisers to draw up plans for the withdrawal of the remaining few hundred US troops still in the country. Ilhan Omar, a Democratic congresswoman in Minnesota who was born in Somalia, has found herself a focal point for much of President Trump's recent anti-immigration rhetoric. Talking about her at a campaign rally in Oklahoma in June, hesaid: ""She would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came - Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing, just anarchy. And now, she's telling us how to run our country. No, thank you."" Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa,tweetingthat the country was a ""mess"" back in 2015. He took a slightly different approach as president though,tellingPresident Jacob Zuma that he hoped to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September 2017. During the meeting, Mr Trumpsaid: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich."" Mr Zuma was replaced as president in February 2018 by Cyril Ramaphosa. President Trump caused some controversy in the country a few months later when hetweetedthat he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to ""closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers."" His tweet followed a piece on Fox News about South Africa's planned land reforms but a spokesman for Mr Ramaphosasaidthe American president was ""misinformed"". President Trump and Mr Ramaphosa spoke by phone earlier this year amid a growing outbreak of coronavirus in the US, with the South African leadersayinghe had ""passed our condolences to the Government and people of the US on the devastation the virus has wrought"". President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there was hope that tensions on the peninsula had been diffused when the US president brought North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After South Korean President Moon Jae-in'shistoric meetingwith Mr Kim in April 2018, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!"" Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks. Trade has also been a key part of the two countries' relationship during Mr Trump's term. The American president had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In September 2018, the two sides signed a revised trade pact that, among other things, allows US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US had introduced on steel. Mr Trumphailed itas a ""a very big deal"". There have been several moments of tension in the relationship, however. A frequent complaint of Mr Trump's has been that South Korea should pay the US more for its military support. In March 2019, hetweetedthat military drills between the countries had been cancelled ""to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. for which we are not reimbursed"". Later that year, he confirmed South Korea had started talks over increasing their payments to the US,saying: ""South Korea is a very wealthy nation that now feels an obligation to contribute to the military defence provided by the United States of America."" But in April this year, he said he had rejected an offer from Seoul,telling reporters: ""We're asking them to pay for a big percentage of what we're doing. It's not fair... It's a question of will they contribute toward the defence of their own nation."" Donald Trump has enjoyed relatively warm relations with Spain's leaders. At a meeting with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in June 2017, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Rajoy was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June 2018 and replaced by Pedro SÃ¡nchez, who President Trump has met at Nato and G7 summits but not at the White House. Mr Trump and his wife Melania have, however,welcomedSpain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House, celebrating ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"" at a meeting in June 2018. The American president had been due to host the Spanish royals for a second time in April this year, but it was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. It would have been only the third state visit under Mr Trump - the other two were by the French and Australian leaders. In 2018, Mr Trumpreportedly suggestedto Spain's foreign minister that Europe should build a wall across the Sahara, similar to the one on the US-Mexico border, to solve the migrant crisis. In recent months, Mr Trump has mentioned Spain frequently when trying to suggest that Europe has had much bigger problems dealing with coronavirus compared to the US. Speaking at the White House in June, he said: ""Look what happened to Spainâ¦ It's just been shattered."" But both countries have been hit hard by the virus, withthe death ratein Spain only slightly higher than in the US. Sudan is another of the predominantly Muslim countries that Donald Trump included on his initialtravel ban list. The Supreme Court partlyreinstatedthe ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the US, but by that point Sudanhad been removedfrom the list reportedly due to improved cooperation. However, the country wasadded once againin early 2020, meaning Sudanese nationals can no longer apply for ""diversity visas"", which are available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US. In better news for the relationship of the two countries, Mr Trump has recentlysignalled his intentionto remove Sudan from a US list of state sponsors of terror, meaning sanctions dating back to the 1990s could be removed. In another sign of the improving relations since Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was ousted in 2019, Mr Trump alsorecently announcedthat the country was normalising its relations with Israel, saying it was a ""HUGE win today for the United States and for peace in the world"". Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdoksaidthe move was part of the new government's efforts in working ""towards international relations that best serve our people"". President Trump caused a bit of a stir in Sweden early on in his presidency. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbersof migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the president [told a crowd in Florida. The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident he was referring to - not leastlots of baffled Swedes. Mr Trump later said hehad been referringto a Fox News report on gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013 - but the police officers interviewed said their comments had been taken out of context anddatadidn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. The president raised eyebrows again in 2019, when he took to Twitter tocall for the releaseof American rapper A$AP Rocky, who had been charged with assault in Stockholm. ""Give A$AP Rocky his FREEDOM. We do so much for Sweden but it doesn't seem to work the other way around. Sweden should focus on its real crime problem!"" the presidenttweetedin July 2019. ""Very disappointed in Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven for being unable to act,"" headded. The rapper was eventuallyfound guiltyand given a suspended sentence, but he had returned to the US by that point. In recent months, Mr Trump has mentioned Sweden frequently when talking about the coronavirus pandemic, tweeting in April that the country was ""paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown"". Sweden's foreign minister, however, has called Mr Trump's assessments ""factually wrong"". Despite the bumps, Mr LÃ¶fven insisted during a visit to the White House in 2018 that the two countries had a good relationship despite some differences because they shared the same values. Mr Trumptold reporters: ""Sweden is a great country. It's small, but it's very sharp, I will tell you. They are very sharp."" Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of military intervention - particularly in Syria - for some time. When his predecessor was considering military action in the country back in 2013, Mr Trumptweeted: ""Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing."" But just over two months into his term, President Trump said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by Syrian forces that he was taking military action. ""Using a deadly nerve agent,Syrian President] Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,"" Mr Trump [said. ""No child of God should ever suffer such horror."" Two US Navy shipsfired 59 Tomahawk cruise missilesat a Syrian air base from their positions in the Mediterranean in April 2017. It was the first direct US military action against Mr Assad. Mr Trump deployed his military againin April 2018, with 100 missiles targeting suspected government chemical weapons facilities in response to another chemical attack. After the strikes, Mr Trumptweeted: ""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" At the end of 2018, Mr Trump made thesurprise announcementthat US troops would be leaving Syria, saying they had achieved his objective of defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS). But even allies criticised the move and the withdrawal failed to materialise. US troopsdid begin withdrawingfrom northern Syria in 2019, however, leaving their Kurdish allies to face a Turkish offensive in the region. Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Mr Trump's, was one of many Republicans to voice their anger at the move,tweetingin October: ""Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration."" President Trumprejectedthe criticism andsaidTurkey and the Kurdish people had been ""fighting each other for 200 years"". He was involved with securing a ceasefire in the region though,sayingthat the ""Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us."" Later that month, Mr Trumpannouncedthat IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had killed himself during a US military operation in Syria, saying he had been ""violently eliminated"" and ""died like a coward"". President Trump moved quickly to establish a good relationship with Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup. The pair ""expressed a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries"" duringa callin April 2017. Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington. During their phone call, President Trump invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time, a trip that took place in October 2017. Talking to reporters with Mr Chan-ocha alongside him, Mr Trumpsaid: ""We have a very strong relationship right now, as of this moment, and it's getting stronger in the last nine months."" More recently, Mr Trump caused a stir in Thailand when hemispronouncedThailand as ""thigh-land"" at a campaign rally in Ohio. Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley spoke to Donald Trumpon the phonein February 2017 to discuss ""shared priorities"". One of those priorities is terrorism, with some US officials worried that the small Caribbean island could become a ""breeding ground for extremists"",according to the New York Times. The island's former US ambassador John Estrada told the newspaper that more than 100 people had travelled from there to fight with the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. When Donald Trump announced a ban on people entering the US from several predominantly Muslim countries, some analysts were surprised not to see Tunisia on the list. The Arab Spring began there in 2010, but it became a breeding ground for the so-called Islamic State group (IS) - more Tunisians joined them to fight in Iraq and Syria than any other nationality. President Trump appeared to have decided that a close relationship with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi was important in the fight against IS and he praised the country's ""stability and security"" ina phone callwith its leader in February 2017. When Mr Essebsidiedat the age of 92 in July 2019, a White Housestatementpraised him for being a ""tireless advocate for the Tunisian people"". Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has had a lot of ups and downs over the past four years. Relations were strained initially by Mr Trump'sdecision to armthe Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group (IS). Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group. But the pair were united at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2017, where theyreaffirmed their rejectionof a planned Kurdistan referendum. In 2018, however, there were tensions over the case of an American pastor who had been arrested and charged in Turkey over alleged links to political groups. Taking to Twitter to protest, Mr TrumpaccusedTurkey of having ""taken advantage of the United States for many years"" and said the US would be ""cutting back on Turkey!"" In anothertweetaround the same time, Mr Trump announced increased tariffs on the country and said: ""Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!"" Two months later, the pastor was released and President Trumpsaidthat while there was no deal made, there was ""great appreciation on behalf of the United States, which will lead to good, perhaps great, relations between the United States & Turkey!"" In 2019, Mr Trump's decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria and allow Turkish forces to launch an offensive on Kurdish forces was criticised heavily both at home and abroad. In response, hetweeteda threat to Turkey: ""As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!)"" Mr Trump sent Mr Erdogan a letter at the time, telling him: ""Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!"" But the Turkish leader wasreportedto have ""thoroughly rejected it and put it in the bin"". A fortnight later, President Trumplifted sanctionson Turkey after it agreed to a ceasefire in Syria. Earlier this year, Mr Erdogan suggested relations may be improving between the two countries,sayingafter a phone call with his American counterpart: ""To be honest, after our conversation tonight, a new era can begin between the United States and Turkey."" Ukraine was at the centre of the Democrats' bid to impeach President Trump so relations between the two countries have been under the spotlight in the last four years. Mr Trump has repeatedly accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine - the kind of rhetoric that will have pleased Kyiv. But early on in his presidency, the American also called for better ties to Russia, which will have worried Ukrainian authorities. In June 2017, Mr Trumpsaidhe had ""very, very good discussions"" with President Petro Poroshenko during a visit to the White House by the Ukrainian. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014. The following month, Mr Trumpcalled onRussia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Poroshenko was replaced by Volodymyr Zelensky in May 2019 and his name became well known in the US later in the year when a phone call he had with Mr Trump became a key part ofimpeachment proceedingsagainst the American president. Democrats accused Mr Trump of trying to pressure Mr Zelensky into investigating unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Joe Biden, who would later become his opponent in the 2020 president election. For his part, Mr Zelenskysaidthere was ""no blackmail"" in the phone call with President Trump, adding: ""This is not corruption, it was just a call."" In response, Mr Trumptweeted: ""This should immediately end the talk of impeachment!"" Mr Trump was eventuallyimpeachedat the end of 2019 butfound not guiltyafter a vote in the Senate in February 2020. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke to Donald Trumpon the phonejust a few days after the former businessman became the new US president. The two leaders discussed the fight against international terrorism and ""committed to further strengthen cooperation on fighting radical Islamic terrorism"". The UAE was not one of the Middle Eastern countries from which Mr Trump tried to ban travel to the US in 2017 and the state's foreign minister was one of the few officials in the region to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al NahyandescribedMr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with. The strength of the relationship was on show recently, when President Trump announced that his administration had overseen a deal with the UAE and Israel that will see the Arab state normalise relations with its historic foe. ""After decades of division and conflict we mark the dawn of a new Middle East,"" Mr Trumptolda crowd of hundreds gathered at the White House in September this year as he celebrated both the UAE deal with Israel and a similar one with Bahrain. President Trump had a slightly bumpy relationship with Theresa May, the first British prime minister he had to deal with in his presidency. He arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July 2018 but it was immediately overshadowed by the publication ofan interviewthe US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan went ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way."" But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone andsaida trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trumpalso met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the president of the United States."" But when he arrived in London for a state visit the following year, he was welcomed byfurther protestsand a giant balloondepicting him as a baby. This time around, the president was given the honour ofa state banquetat Buckingham Palace with the Queen, during which he praised the ""eternal friendship"" between the UK and US. But earlier in the day, he hadcalledLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan - who had said the UK should ""not roll out the red carpet"" for Mr Trump - a ""stone cold loser"". A few weeks later, Mr Trump also laid into Mrs May and her proposed Brexit deal,tweeting: ""What a mess she and her representatives have created. I told her how it should be done, but she decided to go another way."" So it was little surprise when Mr Trump appeared excited to congratulate Boris Johnson on becoming the new prime minister in July 2019,saying: ""He will be great!"" When asked what advice he would give to Mr Johnson on Brexit, the presidentreplied: ""He needs no advice. He's the right man for the job. I've been saying that for a long time."" While the pair have enjoyed warm personal relations, there have been some differences on policy, most notably on China, the Iran nuclear deal and the future of Nato. But after this year, they now have another thing in common - they both got and recovered from coronavirus. When Mr Johnson left intensive care back in April, Mr Trumpsaidit was ""great news"" and after he returned to the White House to recover from the virus in October, hethankedthe British PM for ""his friendship and support"". Mr Trumpspoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyevin December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation."" That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate theNew York truck attack, in which eight people were killed. The suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant. The two leadersmet for the first timein May at the White House, with Mr Trumpsayingthe two countries were ""working together from the standpoint of the military"". Venezuela has suffered from economic and political crises for several years now and it is deeply divided between those who support the government of the socialist President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and those who blame him for the country's dire state. Mr Trump has discussed the situation in Venezuela with leaders of several neighbouring countries, including Brazil and Colombia, but he has not spoken directly to President Maduro. In atweetin October 2017, Mr Trump called ""for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela"". President Maduro, however, sent aword of warningto Mr Trump, saying in a televised speech: ""Don't repeat the errors of Obama and Bush when it comes to Venezuela and Latin America."" Mr Maduro was reelected in 2018 but the election was widely dismissed as rigged. After months of a political crisis, opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ labelled Mr Maduro a ""usurper"" and declared himself interim president in January 2019. Shortly afterwards, Mr Trumptweeted: ""The citizens of Venezuela have suffered for too long at the hands of the illegitimate Maduro regime. Today, I have officially recognized the President of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan GuaidÃ³, as the Interim President of Venezuela."" The following month Mr Trumpsaid: ""I ask every member of the Maduro regime: End this nightmare of poverty, hunger and death. LET YOUR PEOPLE GO. Set your country free!"" Dozens of countries around the world have recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as president but the Venezuelan military has remained loyal to Mr Maduro. Earlier this year, President Trump suggested he would be open to meeting Mr Maduro,telling Axios: ""I would maybe think about that... Maduro would like to meet."" But he later clarified his position,tweeting: ""I would only meet with Maduro to discuss one thing: a peaceful exit from power!"" Vietnam played host to President Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017. Mr Trumptweeted his thanksfor ""a wonderful visit"" and waskeen to highlighta $12bn (£9bn)purchase of Boeing aircraftin a joint statement after the visit. A little over a year later, Mr Trump was back in Hanoi to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. But talks ended without agreement after the US refused North Korean demands for sanctions relief. ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times,"" Mr Trumpsaid afterwards. After the talks, Mr Trumptweeted: ""THANK YOU to our generous hosts in Hanoi this week: President Trong, Prime Minister Phuc, and the wonderful people of Vietnam!"" President Trump's first action on Yemen was toban its citizensfrom travelling to America. While the travel ban was initially blocked by court challenges, it was eventuallyupheld in 2018by the Supreme Court. Yemen has been inthe midst of conflictsince 2014 and what began as a civil war has grown into a battle between regional powers. One of those most involved is Saudi Arabia, which has been a close ally to President Trump. In late 2018, Mr Trumpcalled on Saudi Arabiato ""allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it"". That request followed avotein the US Senate, which sought to withdraw American support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. President Trump, however,vetoed the billpassed by Congress in April 2019 and three months laterused his veto power againto dismiss similar resolutions that blocked the sale of $8.1bn (£6.5bn) worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Yemen was the site of thefirst military operationauthorised by Mr Trump in February 2017, in which a special forces team raided the compound of a suspected terrorist leader. The mission didn't go to plan. The US Navy Seals came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP) and one member of the elite team was killed. It later emergedthat a number of civilians were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by Mr Trump. Inan interview with Fox News, Mr Trump appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William ""Ryan"" Owens on military leaders. ""This was a mission that was started before I got here,"" Mr Trump said. ""They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected... And they lost Ryan."" In February 2020, a less controversial US operation in Yemenkilled the AQAP leader, who had been linked to a series of attacks on Western interests in the 2000s.

Charlie Hebdo suspect tests positive for Covid-19,"Fourteen people are currently on trial in France over the 2015 attack The main suspect in the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack in France has tested positive for Covid-19 and his trial has been suspended, lawyers say. Ali Reza Polat is accused of helping the militant Islamist attackers who killed 12 people at the satirical magazine four years ago. The presiding judge says 10 accused accomplices must be tested for the virus before the trial can resume. The suspension is likely to delay the trial's conclusion later this month. Ali Reza Polat, 35, was sick and seen by a doctor, prompting the judge to suspend court for several days. Judge Regis de Jorna said 10 other suspects must be tested, and ""the resumption of the trial will depend on the results of these tests and the development of the health of the people concerned"". The defence lawyers were due to give their final submissions in the coming days, and verdicts were expected in two weeks' time. Fourteen people in total are on trial over the attack on the magazine, as well as related attacks on a police woman and Jewish supermarket that left 17 people dead in total over three days. Three of the 14 are being tried in absentia. The three gunmen in the two attacks were shot dead by police. Two gunmen killed 12 people in an attack on the magazine's office in 2015 Ali Reza Polat is seen as the main link between the attacks and is believed to have had a key role in obtaining the weapons used. He subsequently attempted to flee to Dubai, Lebanon and Syria but without success. The trial had already been delayed four months because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Mortgage holidays extended for up to six months,"Mortgage payment holidays are being extended for homeowners financially affected by the pandemic. The scheme had been due to come to an end on Saturday. Borrowers who have not yet had a mortgage holiday can request from their lender a pause in repayments, that can last up to six months. Those who have had their payments deferred already, can extend their mortgage holiday until they reach the six-month limit. During this period interest will still accrue on what borrowers owe. The changes form part of a new package of financial support measures announced by the government as England heads into a second coronavirus lockdown on Thursday. Last week, a study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that 1.6 million households - or a fifth of all British mortgage-holders - were worried about paying their mortgage over the next three months. Borrowers who have already reached the maximum six-month mortgage holiday and are still facing difficulty making repayments, are being advised by the FCA to speak to their lender about a tailored support plan. The announcement the furlough scheme would be extended provided great relief. However, there's been no fresh announcement about financial support for the self-employed. Groups representing the self-employed are asking for previously announced winter support grants - meant to cover three-month periods - to be increased from covering 40% of profits to something on parity with the support on offer for employees. They also want eligibility criteria reviewed to help those who have been left out of support so far. After the prime minister's address came news from the Treasury that there would be grants for businesses in England who are required to close. Linked to the rateable value of properties, they'll be between Â£1,334 and Â£3,000 per month. However it is another nervous time for firms in the worst-hit sectors, who have already taken on debt and seen their cash reserves drained by the crisis. For many, paying rent remains a big concern. And for retailers who had invested heavily in making their premises Covid-secure, the timing of the shutdown before Christmas is a worst-case scenario. Exactly how much of a hit the economy will take is unclear. Under the first lockdown the UK economy shrank by a fifth in April, but an exact repeat is not expected. Some industries like construction should carry on, while others have adapted - for example by boosting online ordering capacity. The government says mortgage payment holidays will not be recorded on borrowers' credit file, however some people havetold the BBCthey found it hard to access other loans once they disclosed to lenders they had put off mortgage repayments. Some 2.5 million people have taken a payment break on their mortgage since the start of the pandemic, according to figures from UK Finance. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says it's also considering a possible payments holiday for people struggling to pay off debts such as credit cards and personal loans. ""We are working quickly with industry to determine whether a similar approach should be adopted for consumer credit products,"" it said. But the FCA says borrowers who can afford to do so, should continue making repayments. It will announce further details about the extended mortgage holiday scheme tomorrow.

'Sports face collapse without guidance',"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""Now is the time to take action"" Tennis and golf officials are among those urging the government to make their sports exempt from new lockdown rules for England. Shadow sports minister Alison McGovern said ""sports face collapse"". It follows Saturday's announcement of a new four-week lockdown from Thursday until 2 December to combat rising Covid-19 numbers. Nine FA Cup first-round ties involving teams from 'non-elite' leagues are set to to ahead from 6-9 November. But the Football Association has said it is awaiting further information on how the wider grassroots game may be affected. ""Yet again sport and physical wellbeing is an afterthought,"" Wirral South MP McGoverntweeted.,external. Meanwhile, the Conservative chairman of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee called for exemptions. ""Today I was in touch with the minister for sport to request that the blanket ban on sports like tennis and golf be lifted,"" said Solihull MP Julian Knight. ""Government ought to allow the mixing of one other household in these socially distanced sports."" McGovern posted her message in response after the FA Women's National League (FAWNL) said it was waiting on guidance about what the new restrictions meant for its competition. ""The [DCMS] need to answer questions ASAP unless they want more sports to face collapse,"" she added. ""And we need to see a cross-government effort on physical and mental wellbeing."" English lockdown may last beyond 2 Dec, says Michael Gove Elite sport to continue during lockdown The Premier League and other elite sports have been told they can continue behind closed doors. It is not exactly clear how grassroots and amateur sport will be affected. ""We understand people will have a lot of questions and DCMS officials and ministers will be working through these and detailed implications with sectors over the coming days,"" said Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary. Many facilities, including gyms and pools, must close, along with other indoor and outdoor leisure centres. England Hockey says it is disappointed the new measures will mean no club or community hockey for at least a month. Under the new restrictions: People are being told to stay at home unless they have a specific reason to leave, such as education and work that cannot be done from home. People are allowed to exercise outdoors alone, with their household or with one other person. Read full restrictions here,external The Sports and Recreation Alliance, which represents UK national sports organisations including the FA and Rugby Football Union along with community sport, has warned the new measures may ""prove to be the final nail in the coffin for a number of these clubs"". Chief executive Lisa Wainwright said: ""The closure of our facilities will once again place a financial burden on thousands of community clubs who are already reeling from the initial lockdown and we fear that many may never reopen their doors without a comprehensive sports recovery fund provided by government."" The Sport for Development Coalition backed calls for more funding from the government as many sporting clubs, charities and local organisations ""support mental wellbeing, contribute to tackling social isolation, facilitate community connections and engage young people excluded from education and employment"". Sport England said there were ""difficult days ahead for many in our sector"" but that ""it is vital we do everything we can to continue to support people to keep active within what is permitted"". It added: ""Sport England already has several live funding packages available to help support grassroots clubs and organisations who have lost vital income this year as well as help them enable people to be active within the rules and we're working hard with officials in government to help make wider financial support available."" Swimming poolswill also have to close but Swim England chief executive Jane Nickerson says she will be ""working in partnership with other indoor sports to lobby government"", with meetings scheduled for Monday. She added: ""I am championing our clubs and the health benefits of swimming to the nation as this is a key message to government."" TheLawn Tennis Associationsays that, while indoor tennis will be halted, it will ""make a case"" to the government for outdoor tennis between two individuals from different households to be allowed in line with restrictions on exercise, adding that tennis is a ""socially distanced sport with the net acting as a natural barrier"". People are being asked by the LTA to lobby their local MPs for tennis courts to stay open, allowing for singles and one-to-one coaching, and use by same households. Golf coursesand driving ranges have also been told to close but England Golf chief executive Jeremy Tomlinson says it will ""respectfully challenge the government's rationale"" over the decision. ""It is our sincere belief that it is now counter-productive to shut down a healthy pursuit which naturally lends itself to social distancing and is played in a Covid-secure manner in the open air,"" said Tomlinson ina letter of the England Golf website.,external Meanwhile, 11-time Paralympic gold medallist Baroness Grey-Thompsonhas written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson,externalurging him to keep gyms and leisure centres open during the new lockdown. Grey-Thompson wants the facilities to stay open because of the ""essential role they play in both our fight and recovery from this virus"". BBC Sports editor Dan Roan The major professional governing bodies will be relieved that, unlike in the spring during the first national lockdown, action can at least continue behind closed doors, but hopes of a quick return of spectators eight months after turnstiles closed have suffered a major setback. The closure of gyms, pools and indoor sports facilities just a few months after they introduced strict hygiene and safety protocols enabling them to re-open, despite data showing comparatively low risk of transmission, will reinforce demands for a Â£1.5bn recovery fund for the sports sector, similar to the bail-out given to the culture and arts industry earlier this year. The fear is that these latest restrictions could lead to thousands of job losses, cause many facilities to close, and adversely affect physical and mental health, just when it is needed most to help the country get through this crisis.

Who can be in your bubble?,"Some people across the UK have been able to form household support bubbles or extended households. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is a group of people with whom you have close physical contact. Bubbles must be ""exclusive"". Once in one, you can't start another with a different household. If you decide to change your bubble, you should treat your previous bubble as a separate household for 10 days before forming a new one. People in a bubble can stay overnight in each other's homes, visit outdoors places together and do not have to socially distance. In England, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household.

Wherever possible, the government recommends that a support bubble should be with another local household to avoid unnecessary travel.

"New rules for post-firebreak era to be discussedWales' Covid firebreak is due to end on 9 November and a new set of ""national rules"" will be drawn up.Wales","What will the new rules for Wales be when the firebreak ends? The way Wales has been treated over cash for jobs during its firebreak compared to England is ""not fair at all"", says its first minister. Mark Drakeford said requests to boost wage subsidies when a national lockdown was introduced in Wales were repeatedly turned down by the UK Treasury. In October, the UK government paid up to 60% of furlough pay - including in the first week of the Wales firebreak. It will now rise back to 80% across the UK asEngland's lockdown begins. ""When things change in England they change their minds about the furlough plan. And that's not fair,"" said Mr Drakeford. While welcoming the extension of furlough, he added: ""When we were asking it was impossible to do it. Now when they have made new decisions in England it is possible."" He said written requests to Chancellor Rishi Sunak prior to the all-Wales lockdown for additional job support measures were rebuffed. It included a request to bring forward the planned replacement for furlough in Wales - the new Job Support Scheme - to cover the Wales firebreak. ""I got an answer quickly to say that was not possible for a number of technical reasons and so no,"" Mr Drakeford toldBBC Radio Cymru. England faces a new lockdown from Thursday for a month. Eligible people in Wales will also benefit form the furlough extension - as well as from a decision toextend mortgage payment holidays. The Treasury said Wales was not being treated differently to England. A spokesman added: ""It is now clear that much broader restrictions are needed right across the country to contain the virus, so we have extended our financial support across the UK to help millions of people continue to provide for their families."" Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Firebreak to end regardless of new England lockdown Has devolution helped or hampered Covid response? Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the Welsh Government did not ask for a furlough extension, instead the request was related to the Job Support Scheme - which was due to replace furlough. Hetweeted, attaching a copy of the first minister's letter to the chancellor,external: ""They asked for a different scheme to be brought forward having already been told that it was impossible."" In a response to the comments, fired back on social media,external, the Welsh Government said Mr Hart ""has his facts wrong"". ""We have repeatedly asked and called for furlough to be extended to support workers and businesses in Wales,"" said Welsh Government officials. Mr Drakeford's cabinet has been meeting on Sunday to discuss the impact of the month-long lockdown in England. Wales' firebreak will end on 9 November - and the date will not change as a result of the prime minister's announcement on Saturday night, he said. But the English lockdown ""creates a new context"", Mr Drakeford said. He used the example of pubs in Wrexham serving until 22:00 GMT after the firebreak while pubs in Chester are still closed. If that attracts people over the border ""is that going to create problems for the police in Wales?"" he said. Mr Drakeford said he raised the issue with UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove on Saturday. ""He said it would be illegal for people in England to travel outside England during the lockdown period they will have,"" said Mr Drakeford. Health Minister Vaughan Gething toldBBC Breakfastthat England's restrictions, as he understood them, meant ""normal travel won't be possible into England because of their four week decision"". A new set of ""national rules"" across Wales is due to be announced on Monday. Non-essential shops have been closed in Wales, as well as pubs, restaurants and hotels The furlough extension has been a bone of contention between the Welsh and UK governments. It was due to end on Saturday and be replaced with the new, less generous Job Support Scheme. Mr Drakeford previously asked the Treasury to extend furlough for one week to coincide with the Welsh firebreak but his requests were turned down. Mr Sunak also declined a request for the new Job Support Scheme (JSS) - which will cover 67% of wages when it replaces furlough - to be brought forward. The Welsh Government said it had offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, which a minister estimated was Â£11m. Allow Twitter content?

But on Saturday, the furlough scheme was extended until England's lockdown ends on 2 December, which will include a return to the previous 80% level. Under the scheme, the government pays 80% of the salaries of staff who were kept on by their employer while unable to work, covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month. The furlough extension and the English lockdown has to be approved by MPs - they will vote on the measures on Wednesday. Ian Price, Wales' director of business group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said a lot of businesses had already made decisions in terms of redundancies, ahead of the furlough extension announcement. ""It won't have stopped those decisions being made but I think it'll ensure that not more people are made redundant during the month of November,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement. Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake said: ""I welcome the chancellor's swift action to support businesses in England, but it is regrettable that Welsh workers were not prioritised in the same way. ""People across Wales have been made redundant in recent days due to the UK government's dithering."" Meanwhile, Conservativemember of the Senedd (MS), Andrew RT Davies, said society needed to learn to live with coronavirus and avoid lockdowns that harm the economy. ""I still don't believe that a lockdown is the solution,"" he told theBBC's Politics Wales. ""Actually a lockdown is only introduced when governments have lost control of the situation and we have to accept that."" No go: Guests from England won't be able to travel to this Carmarthenshire holiday site for the next month Mark Hadley says the England announcement - even with furlough - will hit his family's holiday accommodation business hard. They run a self-catering and guesthouse site in Llandovery in Carmarthenshire. He said cancelledÂ bookings at Llanerchindda Farm will now top Â£250,000 this year, due to Covid restrictions. He said that was on an annual turnover of Â£340,000 - so it amounts to almost 75% of his business. ""Ninety-nine per cent plus of our business comes from England,"" he said. ""Now that people will not be able to travel from England, it really means that we will be remaining pretty much closed right until the beginning of December at the very least. ""It's a worst case scenario. We lost out the half-term weeks, which we cancelled over Â£20,000 of bookings over those two weeks and three weekends.Â ""We missed out on that and now we'll miss out again because we can't get anyone coming from over the border. It's a double whammy for us."" Covid cancellations have cost the family business Â£250,000 this year, says Mark Hadley, on the right with Martin and Lynn Hadley He said the problems he faces are being mirrored across the tourism and hospitality sector in Wales, but he understood governments both in Wales and the UK were under pressure to act. ""It's such a difficult situation isn't it? I can see there is a massive health agenda and a massive potential problem for the NHS. I would not like to be in their boat,"" he said. ""Could it have been handled better? Well, maybe."" Mr Hadley said he welcomed the extension to the furlough scheme during the England lockdown, as it meant his staff were ""secure for now"". But he added: ""Support for business, although they make it out to beÂ massive, it is minimal. ""For our compensation for the firebreak we're guarenteed hopefully a Â£1,000 - possibly Â£3,000 if we get the discretionary top-up - but nobody in our local authority can tell me how they work that discretionary amount out. ""We will be out of pocket, there are no two ways about it."" People have been urged to stay at home and many shops and businesses have been closed in Wales' firebreak Non-essential shops and hospitality will have to close in England for four weeks, until 2 December. But unlike the restrictions in spring, schools, colleges and universities will be allowed to stay open. After 2 December, the restrictions would be eased and regions would go back to the tiered system, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. Elsewhere,Scotland's new tiered system of restrictions,externalwill come into force at 06:00 on Monday.

James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery dies aged 90He was the first to bring James Bond to the big screen and played the role seven times.Entertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played Sir Sean Connery's career spanned decades Sir Sean Connery has died at the age of 90, his family has said. The Scottish actor was best known for his portrayal of James Bond, being the first to bring the role to the big screen and appearing in seven of the spy thrillers. Sir Sean died peacefully in his sleep in the Bahamas, having been ""unwell for some time"", his son said. His acting career spanned seven decades and he won an Oscar in 1988 for his role in The Untouchables. Sir Sean's other films included The Hunt for Red October, Highlander, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and The Rock. Obituary: Sir Sean Connery Sir Sean Connery's career in pictures Jason Connery said his father ""had many of his family, who could be in the Bahamas, around him"" when he died overnight in Nassau. Much of the Bond film Thunderball had been filmed there. He said: ""We are all working at understanding this huge event as it only happened so recently, even though my dad has been unwell for some time. ""A sad day for all who knew and loved my dad and a sad loss for all people around the world who enjoyed the wonderful gift he had as an actor."" His publicist Nancy Seltzer said: ""There will be a private ceremony followed by a memorial yet to be planned once the virus has ended."" He leaves his wife Micheline and sons Jason and Stephane. Daniel Craig said Sir Sean defined an era Daniel Craig, the current James Bond, said Sir Sean was ""one of the true greats of cinema"". ""Sir Sean Connery will be remembered as Bond and so much more,"" he said. ""He defined an era and a style. The wit and charm he portrayed on screen could be measured in megawatts; he helped create the modern blockbuster. ""He will continue to influence actors and film-makers alike for years to come. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones."" In reference to Sir Sean's love of golf, he added: ""Wherever he is, I hope there is a golf course."" Dame Shirley Bassey, who sang the themes to three Bond films including Goldfinger, paid tribute saying: ""I'm incredibly saddened to hear of Sean's passing. ""My thoughts are with his family. He was a wonderful person, a true gentleman and we will be forever connected by Bond."" His Oscar win came in 1988 Sir Sean, from Fountainbridge in Edinburgh, had his first major film appearance in 1957 British gangster film No Road Back. He first played James Bond in Dr No in 1962 and went on to appear in five other official films - and the unofficial Never Say Never Again in 1983. He was largely regarded as being the best actor to have played 007 in the long-running franchise, often being named as such in polls. Connery made the character of James Bond his own, blending ruthlessness with sardonic wit. Many critics didn't like it and some of the reviews were scathing. But the public did not agree. The action scenes, sex and exotic locations were a winning formula. In truth, his Bond is now a museum piece; the portrayal of women impossibly dated. The action scenes are still thrilling, but the sex too often bordered on the non-consensual. Thankfully, its been a while since 007 slapped a woman on the backside and forced a kiss. But Connery's performance was of its time, enjoyed by millions of both sexes and gave the silver screen a 20th Century icon.

Bond producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they were ""devastated by the news"" of his death. They said: ""He was and shall always be remembered as the original James Bond whose indelible entrance into cinema history began when he announced those unforgettable words 'the name's Bond... James Bond'. ""He revolutionised the world with his gritty and witty portrayal of the sexy and charismatic secret agent. He is undoubtedly largely responsible for the success of the film series and we shall be forever grateful to him."" Star Wars director George Lucas, who also created the Indiana Jones character, said Sir Sean ""left an indelible mark in cinematic history"". ""He will always hold a special place in my heart as Indy's dad. With an air of intelligent authority and sly sense of comedic mischief, only someone like Sean Connery could render Indiana Jones immediately into boyish regret or relief through a stern fatherly chiding or rejoiceful hug. ""I'm thankful for having had the good fortune to have known and worked with him. My thoughts are with his family.""

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I was heartbroken to learn this morning of the passing of Sir Sean Connery. Our nation today mourns one of her best loved sons. Scottish tributes to 'global legend' Sir Sean Connery ""Sean was born into a working class Edinburgh family and through talent and sheer hard work, became an international film icon and one of the world's most accomplished actors. Sean will be remembered best as James Bond - the classic 007 - but his roles were many and varied. ""He was a global legend but, first and foremost, a patriotic and proud Scot - his towering presence at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 showed his love for the country of his birth. Sean was a lifelong advocate of an independent Scotland and those of us who share that belief owe him a great debt of gratitude."" The actor and his wife Micheline Roquebrune attended the opening of the first Scottish Parliament in 1999 Alex Salmond, former first minister of Scotland, who was close friends with Sir Sean, described him as ""the world's greatest Scot, the last of the real Hollywood stars, the definitive Bond"". He said: ""Sean Connery was all of these things but much more. He was also a staunch patriot, a deep thinker and outstanding human being."" He added: ""'Scotland Forever' wasn't just tattooed on his forearm but was imprinted on his soul.""

Two dead and five wounded in Quebec stabbing,"Police arrested the suspect in the early hours of Sunday morning At least two people have been stabbed to death in the Canadian city of Quebec by a man armed with a sword and dressed in medieval clothing, police say. Five others were wounded in the Halloween night attack. A man in his mid-20s was arrested shortly before 01:00 (06:00 GMT) on Sunday. Police said an initial probe found the suspect was not affiliated with any extremist groups. The attack took place in the historic Old Quebec neighbourhood. Prime Minister Justin Trudeausaid on Twitter,external: ""My heart breaks for the loved ones of the two killed in last night's horrific attack in Quebec City. ""I'm also wishing a full recovery to the injured. We're keeping you in our thoughts and will be there for all of you."" He also thanked first responders for their critical work. The identity of the suspect has not been made public. At a news conference on Sunday, Quebec City Police Chief Robert Pigeon said it was believed that the attack was premeditated, adding that the suspect, from the Montreal suburbs, came to Quebec City with ""the intention of doing the most damage possible"". ""Dressed in medieval costume and armed with a Japanese sword, everything leads us to believe he chose his victims at random,"" Mr Pigeon added. The suspect had spoken of conducting an attack ""in a medical context"" five years ago but was not known to police and did not have a criminal record, police said. âFirst reports of the incident near the French-speaking city's national assembly came through shortly before 22:30 local time on Saturday. The suspect was arrested near the Espace 400e business park. Quebec's Le Soleil newspaper reported that he was lying on the ground, barefoot and hypothermic, when he was arrested. He surrendered to police without any resistance, it said. Following his arrest, the suspect was taken to hospital for ""evaluation"". The five wounded are also being treated in hospital, with varying levels of injury, according to police. Police have not released details of the victims' identities or ages.

"'A new lockdown will be far worse for businesses'Several entrepreneurs tell the BBC what is at stake, for their industry and wider society.","Businessman Luke Johnson says people are despairing and lockdowns are a ""blunt instrument"" which also have consequences Multiple business leaders have hit out at the looming prospect of a second national lockdown in England, saying the potential damage ""is immense"". Businessman Luke Johnson says the country cannot afford another lockdown. ""We [the UK] are over Â£2 trillion in debt now...and I think the government has neglected to account for the total loss of the lockdown,"" he says. The government maintains it has struck a balance between protecting jobs, the economy and saving lives. Mr Johnson adds: ""The damage to confidence, entrepreneurs, investors, the destruction of jobs, unemployment and the social and welfare costs are immense."" This week, the London Ambulance Service revealed that it is now attending an average of 37 suicides a day, or attempted suicides, up from 22 a day in 2019. ""I think that is a direct consequence of lockdown. People are losing their jobs, they are lonely, depressed, the mental health toll on the country is exponential,"" says Mr Johnson, who formerly ran Pizza Express, Patisserie Valerie and the Giraffe chain. ""I think it will be much worse this winter because people can't go out into the sunshine and treat it as an extended sabbatical. ""It's going to be much grimmer."" Stock markets sink amid alarm at Covid surge Covid: 1,700 employers planned redundancies in September Rishi Sunak to unveil new rescue deal for jobs and firms He says his main problem with the government's strategy is that there is no clear ""exit plan"" for the pandemic and coronavirus restrictions. ""Before we were told it was a few weeks, and there's a suspicion it could be a few months. If Christmas is cancelled, that's it for many businesses,"" warns Mr Johnson. Frances Bishop, 29, founded children's retail chain The Pud Store, based in South Yorkshire, five years ago. Entrepreneur Frances Bishop says she has never felt so alone as a business owner ""I feel like I'm in a dictatorship. I know they're saying they're reviewing the Tier 3 rules every 28 days, but there's been no communications from the council business groups on what they're basing these restrictions on,"" says Ms Bishop, who has three stores. ""It feels like you're being asked to operate a business, pay your taxes, pay your staff and try to keep your head above water, in a room that's on fire and clouded with smoke."" She says that a big problem is that stores are allowed to be open, but customers are not allowed to come, so footfall has ""fallen off a cliff"". The situation has had an impact on her mental health, and Ms Bishop says that she has never felt more alone as a business owner, at a time when her employees are looking to her for leadership and support. ""I'm watching my life's work be undone everyday and I'm throwing everything at it,"" she says. Charlie Mullins, boss of Pimlico Plumbers, says that the government ""needs to listen to businesses and people in the real world"". Pimlico Plumbers boss Charlie Mullins thinks the ""fear factor"" will do more damage to the economy than the pandemic He thinks another lockdown will ""finish many businesses off"", and is also concerned about the toll of coronavirus restrictions on people's wellbeing. ""They're basically going the wrong way about it. The virus is going to be here for a while, we've got to learn to work around it, we can't surrender to it,"" he tells the BBC. ""We need to protect the elderly and vulnerable, of course, but the rest of us need to get back to work."" His view strongly echoed that of Mr Johnson. Mr Mullins said his firm has attended over 200,000 house calls through the pandemic and not one employee or customer has caught the coronavirus. ""The last furlough scheme they did was too generous, it's created an atmosphere of, 'I want to work from home and stay at home',"" he says. ""Boris must stand firm and ignore the fear junkies who want to play Russian roulette with our economy."" Businesses have been telling the BBC since September that theyare worried about Christmas- traditionally the most important time of the year for the hospitality, retail and event industries. Hospitality firm boss Gary Forrest says closing venues at 10pm means people leave an environment that ensures their safety for one that doesn't ""People are trying to book Christmas parties, we don't know if we can accept them - it's tending towards being a total disaster. The hospitality industry cannot afford to have a poor December this year,"" says Gary Forrest, chief executive of the High Street Group, which owns a large chain of bars, restaurants and hotels across the north-east of England. Mr Forrest was particularly frustrated that pubs and restaurants such as his have invested in measures to protect their customers, but now the industry ""seems to be bearing the brunt of the government's restrictions"". ""They told us to bring in table service - and the cost of table service is huge, your salary costs go up exponentially - and all the technology changes, but then they still come along and say, 'now you still need to shut the bars at 10pm',"" he says. ""I'm worried about the 300 people we employ, who've got mortgages and rent to pay."" Mr Forrest wants to see a system where venues are certified by the local authorities and regularly checked to ensure compliance with safety rules. And he wants more support for firms and venues located in parts of the UK where restrictions are in place, but fall short of a full lockdown with mandatory closures. He says the support for businesses operating in this 'Tier 2' environment is not sufficient. But not all business leaders are against the government's coronavirus restrictions. Events firm owner Debbie Marks says we have to do what it takes to get through to the other side of the pandemic Debbie Marks is chief executive of Qube Events, one of the North's largest luxury event companies organising large scale weddings, corporate events, private parties and galas â and now Christmas decor specialists. ""We need the restrictions to be lifted on how many people can come to an event, because 15 people is really not viable for our industry - but we need to bring an end to the pandemic, so if having a lockdown is what we need, then that's what needs to be done."" Ms Marks says she already has an order book full of events starting from next March, and that the UK has to get through the pandemic to the other side so that the events industry can resume. However, she says that isn't possible without support from the government. ""I'm devastated about the support the government has not given our industry. We've been completely ignored, and we're a billion pound industry,"" she explains. A government spokesperson said: ""At all stages we have been guided by medical and scientific advice, and have taken the necessary action in order to rightly strike a balance between protecting jobs, the economy and saving lives. ""We have always been clear that we keep these measures under constant review so they do not have to be in place for any longer than is necessary.""
