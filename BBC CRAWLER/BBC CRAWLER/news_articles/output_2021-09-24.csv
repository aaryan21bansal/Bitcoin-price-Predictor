Top Huawei boss free after deal with US,"Meng Wanzhou (C) leaves British Columbia Supreme Court A Chinese technology executive held in Canada on US fraud charges has left the country after a deal with prosecutors, following years of diplomatic tensions over her fate. Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, was detained on fraud charges in December 2018 at the request of the US. On Friday, the US Department of Justice dropped an extradition request for her. The case infuriated China and strained relations with the US and Canada. It also prompted accusations that China had detained Canadian citizens in retaliation, which China denied. ""My life has been turned upside down. It was a disruptive time for me,"" Ms Meng told reporters after being freed from Canadian detention. ""Every cloud has a silver lining,"" she continued, adding: ""I will never forget all the good wishes I received from people around the world."" Shortly afterwards she boarded an Air China flight bound for the Chinese city of Shenzhen, AFP news agency reports. Meng Wanzhou is believed to have left Vancouver International Airport on this Air China flight bound for Shenzhen Details of a possible deal for Ms Meng's release have been the subject of intense negotiations between US and Chinese diplomats. The US alleged Ms Meng misled the bank HSBC over the true nature of Huawei's relationship with a company called Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Iran. On Friday the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement. This means the DOJ would hold off from prosecuting Ms Meng until December 2022. If she complied with conditions set by court, the case would eventually be dropped. The PowerPoint that sparked an international row Meng Wanzhou: Trapped in a gilded cage The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress The deal, which recommended she be released, allowed her to formally deny guilt for key charges while also acknowledging the allegations laid out by the Americans. Later on Friday, Canadian prosecutors told a court in Vancouver that they had withdrawn efforts to extradite her to the US and that she should be discharged from detention. She had been under house arrest in her multimillion-dollar Vancouver home for nearly three years. Ahead of the court appearance, Ms Meng was seen entering the building accompanied by Chinese consular officials. The judge subsequently ordered that she go free. As part of the deal, Ms Meng agreed to a ""statement of facts"" admitting that she knowingly made false statements to HSBC. The DOJ said Ms Meng had ""taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution"". The DOJ also said said it was continuing to prepare for trial against Huawei. For months there have been extensive behind-the-scenes contacts, with senior Huawei executives sent to Washington by the company to try to resolve a case which has fuelled international tension. For Huawei's boss, the issue has been deeply personal, with his daughter being held, but for the whole of China it has also turned into a major cause of anger. It has also poisoned relations between China and Canada, with the latter believing two of its citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been held as pawns in the negotiations. A deal has the ability to reduce some of the tensions that have emerged. But there will still be questions - what does the US gain out of it? And what kind of link might there be between events in North America and the status of the two Michaels in China? Ms Meng is the elder daughter of billionaire Ren Zhengfei, who set up Huawei in 1987. The company is now the largest telecom equipment maker in the world. He served in the Chinese army for nine years, until 1983, and is also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei has faced accusations that the Chinese authorities could use its equipment for espionage - allegations it denies. In 2019, the US imposed sanctions on Huawei and placed it on an export blacklist, cutting it off from key technologies. The UK, Sweden, Australia and Japan have also banned Huawei, while other countries including France and India have adopted measures stopping short of an outright ban. A few days after Ms Meng was arrested, China detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, on suspicion of spying. Critics have accused China of treating them as political bargaining chips, held as part of what is known as ""hostage diplomacy"". China denies this. Last month, a Chinese court convicted Michael Spavor, a businessman, of espionage and sentenced him to 11 years in prison. Canada condemned the sentence, saying his trial did not satisfy even the minimum standards required by international law. This video can not be played Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou as politically motivated Ms Meng's agreement with the US may pave the way for the two Canadians' release, but tensions in China-Canada relations will not quickly dissipate, experts say. The bilateral relationship has plunged to historic lows since Meng's arrest. The US charges against Huawei remain, and the company is still on a trade blacklist. Other Chinese tech companies with operations in the US, such as social media company TikTok, are also facing scrutiny. Chinese tech sector analyst Rui Ma told the BBC that many Chinese companies were hopeful that Ms Meng's deal with the US might mean no further deterioration of US-China relations, ""but no one is taking it to mean that there is a reversal in tensions"".

Hundreds pay respects at Sabina Nessa vigil,"This video can not be played Sabina Nessa's sister, Jebina Yasmin Islam: ""We have lost an amazing, caring, beautiful sister"" Hundreds of people have joined a vigil for teacher Sabina Nessa who was killed as she walked to a pub in south-east London. The 28-year-old was discovered in Cator Park in Kidbrooke by a member of the public last Saturday. She had been walking to meet a friend at The Depot bar last Friday, a journey which ""should have taken five minutes"". More than 500 people gathered at Pegler Square, not far from where a wanted suspect was captured on CCTV. Hundreds attended a vigil for 28 year-old teacher Sabina Nessa Jebina Yasmin Islam, Sabina Nessa's sister, broke down as she addressed crowds at the vigil. She said: ""I just want to say thank you to everyone who came today to show support for my sister. ""We have lost an amazing, caring, beautiful sister, who left this world far too early."" Members of the public light candles in memory of Sabina Nessa She told the crowd how Sabina had loved her family. She said: ""Words cannot describe how we are feeling, this feels like we are stuck in a bad dream and can't get out of it - our world is shattered, we are simply lost for words. ""No family should go through what we are going through."" Sabina Nessa was found near the One Space community centre in Kidbrooke Ms Nessa's uncle, Shahin Miah, described his niece as ""a kind and a open-minded person"", who was ""always smiling and helping others"". He said Ms Nessa's death has ""once again brought to the fore the question of women's safety on the streets"". In his statement, he said: ""We don't want what happened to Sabina to happen to anyone else. ""We don't want any other mother's chest to be empty or filled with deep sorrow, or to see the tears in the eyes of any father."" This video can not be played Police want to speak to this man As the police investigation continues officers want to identifya balding man, who was seen with something in his hands, who could be ""vital"" to the case. The wanted man, who was wearing grey jeans and a black jacket, can be seen looking over his shoulder and pulling up his hood as he walks along the pavement. Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe urged anyone who may know the man to contact them. Two men arrested on suspicion of Ms Nessa's murder have now been released pending further investigation. Members of the public lay flowers at Pegler Square in Kidbrooke, south London Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official Twitter account shared a photo of a candle lit outside the front door of No 10 Downing Street with the caption ""Tonight we remember Sabina Nessa"" The Duchess of Cambridge said she was ""saddened by the loss of another innocent young woman on our streets"" as police continued the hunt for Ms Nessa's killer. In March, the duchess privately visited the memorial to murdered marketing executive Sarah Everard in Clapham Common, south-west London, after the 33-year-old was killed by off-duty police officer Wayne Couzens. A candle was also lit outside No 10 Downing Street in memory of Ms Nessa. Crowds gathered not far from the crime scene where forensic officers are still working ""Say her name. Sabina Nessa. We will never forget,"" was the request from the leaders of the vigil. Hundreds gathered here in Pegler Square all said her name. Sabina Nessa. This is the square the 28-year-old teacher was walking to this time last week. She never made it. Now Londoners from across the city, many of them holding candles and laying flowers, are listening on this quiet, still autumn evening to the vigil speakers. Dozens more silhouetted figures observe from the tower blocks overlooking Pegler Square. Many observers are crying, listening to the speakers including Sabina Nessa's sister who says her family's world has been shattered. But while a community joins together in grief, just behind the vigil, police have sealed off an area. Yellow evidence markers dot the road. As one person spoke emotionally of Sabina Nessa, a forensics officer combed the bushes, a reminder that this is still very much an ongoing investigation. Crowds also gathered in Hackney, Newham, Bristol and in Brighton, to pay tribute to Ms Nessa. There was a large turnout at a vigil for Sabina Nessa in Brighton A spokesperson for Brighton and Hove Council said: ""Every woman and girl should feel safe in their streets, in their parks and open spaces and in their homes. ""We have today lowered the flags at Hove Town Hall and Brighton Town Hall in memory of Sabina Nessa and to raise awareness of violence against women and girls.""

Visa scheme planned to ease lorry driver shortage,"Drivers have queued at some petrol stations, despite reassurances over supplies Ministers are working on plans for a temporary visa scheme to make it easier for foreign lorry drivers to come to the UK. Final details of exactly how the initiative will work are expected to be announced this weekend. Any changes to immigration rules will be temporary, with a cap on the number of workers allowed to enter the UK. The shortage of hauliers threatens more disruption to deliveries of petrol, food and other goods. It is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by the pandemic and Brexit. BP and Esso have shut a number of petrol stations due to a lack of tanker drivers, while EG Group has said it will introduce a limit of Â£30 per customer on all grades of fuel. The company, which operates 400 filling stations in the UK, said the move was due to the ""current unprecedented customer demand for fuel and associated supply challenges"". All of EG Group's UK sites remain open and operational to serve customers. HGV drivers and emergency services will be excluded from the Â£30 limit due to ""their vital role at this time"", according to the firm. ""This is a company decision to ensure all our customers have a fair chance to refuel and to enable our sites to carry on running smoothly,"" a spokesperson from the firm said. ""We kindly ask everyone visiting our sites to treat our colleagues, supply chain partners and customers with respect during these very challenging times."" A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""We have ample fuel stocks in this country and the public should be reassured there are no shortages. ""But like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary Covid-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country."" The spokesperson explained that ministers are looking at temporary measures to ""avoid any immediate problems"", but added that any measures introduced will be ""very strictly time limited"". ""We are moving to a high-wage, high-skilled economy and businesses will need to adapt with more investment in recruitment and training to provide long-term resilience,"" the spokesperson added. A sign outside a Tesco petrol station in Bracknell, Berkshire, on Friday The European Road Haulers Association said temporary visas would be a ""good idea"" but are ""only part of the solution"". The association said it is still easier to drive within the EU than driving between the EU and the UK, meaning that staying within the EU may still be more appealing for drivers. Despite reassurances, large queues formed at many petrol stations on Friday. On social media, people reported queues lasting for up to 30 minutes, while there were also reports of drivers filling jerry cans. Why is there a shortage of lorry drivers? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Are there problems at the forecourt you use? Send your pictures toyourpics@bbc.co.uk,externalorupload your pictures/video here The AA said that most of the UK's forecourts were working as they should. ""There is no shortage of fuel and thousands of forecourts are operating normally with just a few suffering temporary supply chain problems,"" said AA president Edmund King. ""Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts."" Mr King said drivers should not fill up outside their normal routines, because even if the occasional petrol station was temporarily closed, others just down the road would be open. ""This was a manageable problem,"" said. There are about 8,380 petrol stations in the UK, according to the Petrol Retailers Association. Of these, about 1% are believed to be closed at the moment. It is understood that about 50 to 100 BP forecourts are affected by shortages, while Esso said ""a small number"" of its Tesco Alliance retail sites had been hit. Allan Davison, managing director of Hoyer Petrolog UK - one of the country's leading fuel logistics companies and BP's transport contractor - told the BBC that European drivers should be offered temporary visas to help ease the situation. ""If this was a permanent request, I would understand the political and practical challenges with that, but it's not. It's a temporary request,"" he said. Helena Wright is part of family firm W's Transport, based in north Norfolk Helena Wright, transport manager for Norfolk-based firm W's Transport, told the BBC her company had sold two lorries after advertising for HGV drivers and not getting a single applicant. ""Normally we would have people on record to call who had left their details,"" she said. ""This is the first time for our firm that that's happened, but it's a problem that has been a long time coming. ""I've got a lot of drivers that are over the age of 50, 55 and looking to retire and we are not attractive as an industry for the younger generation."" She said younger people were not prepared to spend four to five nights a week away from home and were not ready to put up with ""inhumane"" conditions. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""The supply issues affecting a small number of petrol forecourts shouldn't impact the prices drivers pay to fill up. ""But unfortunately the price of oil, which has the biggest influence on what drivers pay at the pumps, is continuing to rise at the moment. This may lead to fuel prices going up in the coming days"" Supermarket Iceland - which is about 100 drivers short - joined Morrisons and Ocado in calling for the government to add HGV drivers tothe list of shortage occupations,external. That would allow foreign workers to apply for skilled worker visas to fill the current gaps. ""I think the solution - even if it's temporary - is very, very simple,"" said Iceland managing director Richard Walker. ""Let's get HGV drivers on to the skilled worker list."" The  UK's Road Haulage Association (RHA) said that on top of a historic shortage of drivers, the industry had lost 20,000 European drivers because of Brexit, while the pandemic had forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled. Ina recent RHA survey,externalof 616 hauliers, retiring colleagues and Brexit topped the list of reasons behind the driver shortages. Respondents also cited tax changes to rules known as IR35, which have made it more expensive for hauliers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK.

Does following the 'rules' keep women safe?,"The safety of women as they go about their daily business has once again been thrust into the spotlight. And once again it's because a woman has been killed in apparently ""safe"" conditions. Sabina Nessa, a 28-year-old primary school teacher, was on her way to meet a friend for a Friday evening drink. She set out on what should have been a five-minute walk through a well-used public park at about 20:30 BST and never reached her destination. She was discovered by a member of the public the following evening. Speaking at a news conference in relation to Ms Nessa's death, Det Ch Supt Trevor Lawry from the Met Police said: ""The streets are safe for women - people should be free to walk around free from fear"". Later, a community group handed outinformation sheets printed from the Met's website,external, giving ""tips for staying safe on the street"". Women are told not to wear headphones. We are told to stick to busy places, to hide our valuables. We must walk where there is good lighting and pre-book our taxi home. Six months ago, Sarah Everard was abducted, raped and murdered by a stranger. She followed a number of the protocols with which women are often issued: she walked along a main road, at the relatively early hour of 21:00, wearing sensible clothes. And she trusted a police officer. One of the people we are told to seek out if we feel we are in danger. Nine months before that, sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman were murdered by a stranger. The theory of ""safety in numbers"" did not save the sisters, who were together when they were stabbed multiple times in a public park. Staying in contact with partners via text and organising a cab to pick them up did not stop a man deciding to kill them in a so-called deal with a so-called devil. Their friends found them in undergrowth two days later. Street safety phone tips shared online How many violent attacks on women are there? The 'right amount' of panic for women in public As Det Ch Supt Lawry says, of course women ""should"" be able to walk around free from fear. And of course the problem is with the men who murder them rather than the women wearing headphones. And of course women should not have to modify their behaviour in order to not be attacked or abducted or raped or killed. But ""worrying about our safety is an integral part of our existence as women,"" said Kelly Grehan, a director of 50:50 Parliament, a cross-party campaign group promoting gender equality. ""It is drummed into us from a young age that our actions determine our safety: when we were only allowed to go in public toilets in pairs, given rape alarms at secondary school and told we were 'asking for it' or 'jailbait' when we tried to dress like the pop stars we idolised before some of us had even started menstruating."" The killings of Ms Nessa, Ms Everard, Ms Henry and Ms Smallman create an extra frisson of fear because their randomness indicates all women are at risk. If Ms Nessa arranged to meet her friend at a different bar or at a different time; if Ms Everard had left her friend's house 10 minutes earlier or later; if Ms Henry and Ms Smallman had chosen a different part of the park to have their picnic, it could have been different women facing the final few hours of their lives. It could be any woman - even if she had followed the rules. Academic studies have examined the ways in which women and girls trade their freedom to feel safer. One ofthe largest studies conducted on sexual harassment in Europe,externalfound that almost half of the 42,000 women surveyed had restricted their freedom of movement based on the fear of gender-based violence. Prof Liz Kelly, the director of the child and woman abuse studies unit at London Metropolitan University, coined the term ""safety work"", to describe the strategies women develop in response to their experiences in public. Often done without thinking, these precautions become ingrained as habit, or ""common sense"". And we all do it. We all make sure we have a fully-charged phone and do that spikey weapon-grip with our door keys at the same time as checking nobody is following us inside. We text when we are ""home safe"" and wait up until we hear the same from our companions. This is normal. This is accepted. This is part of being a woman. The tips offered by police and other organisations perpetuate the idea of safety work: take a longer route if it's busier and better lit; search for a Tube carriage with other women in; wear flat shoes for the walk home (in case you have to run). Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton when she disappeared As Prof Kelly says, the ""necessity of safety work steals our time and our energy - being vigilant means it is seldom possible to just be in public space, to feel joy in exercise or notice the changing seasons"". After Sarah Everard went missing, Met Police commissionerCressida Dick tried to reassure women that incidences of abduction and murder were ""incredibly rare"". And it's true - women account for about a third of all murders and of those, only 13% are killed by a stranger. Most are victims of a partner or ex-partner. It is far more likely that we will be killed at home than in a park. So it's a balancing act - women have to take the precautions society deems reasonable while also trying not to overreact to dangers we're told are uncommon enough to be negligible. Dr Fiona Vera-Gray, an assistant professor at Durham University, usesthe term ""the right amount of panic"",external. ""This won't ever happen to you. Except if it does, because for some of us it will, it will be your fault for not being scared enough. Don't panic enough and it's your fault, but panic too much and you're hysterical."" Bibaa Henry, 46, and 27-year-old Nicole Smallman were stabbed to death in a Wembley park Anna Birley, a co-founder of campaign group Reclaim These Streets, said: ""We often get told when the worst happens that the murder of a woman by a stranger in a public place is very rare and we are very safe. ""But the thing is, our lived experience of street harassment - cat-calling, a man exposing himself to us - tells us we're not safe, and murder is rarely the first crime someone commits. ""We shouldn't be looking to solutions that require women to change their behaviour. ""Women should be able to walk five minutes across a park at any time of day or night without fear of violence."" In an ideal world, everyone would live their lives unmolested. It would be safe to amble down dark alleys or across parks, whether sporting a diamond-encrusted miniskirt and platinum noise-cancelling headphones or a sackcloth boiler suit and an air of high alert. But until we get to that utopia, if it is even achievable, is the advice offered by police and various safety charities actually something that protects women? If we disregard the hugely problematic narrative of victim-blaming, are they pragmatic - if unpalatable - tips that would keep us safe from stranger danger? The deaths of Ms Nessa, Ms Everard, Ms Henry and Ms Smallman would suggest not. They followed the ""rules"" and still got murdered. Ms Everard's killer wasn't put off by a brightly-lit busy road and plenty of CCTV cameras. The man who murdered Ms Henry and Ms Smallman was untroubled by the women not being alone and defenceless. The cases above are the high-profile ones. There will have been a strata of incidents in which women were attacked but not fatally. In which someone tried to pull or persuade them into a car but were shaken off. In which a man said something sexually aggressive that didn't lead to a physical assault but did leave the woman upset and frightened and angry. The women affected would have stuck to the guidelines, would have done their safety work. Very few women actively decide to put themselves in situations they are repeatedly told are dangerous. Less lighting 'has no crime effect' 'We have learned nobody is going to protect us' What female joggers face on every run A report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) was commissioned by Home Secretary Priti Patel after the murder of Ms Everard. It was published the day Ms Nessa was killed. It called for ""fundamental cross-system change"",externalafter identifying continuing failings, and suggested tackling violence against women and girlsshould be ""as much of a priority as countering terrorism"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said there should be a ""fully joined-up policy to address this issue, from school with boys being taught to respect girls; and proper healthy relationship education"". He urged the government to ""outlaw misogyny"" and ""make the harassment of women in a public place a criminal offence"". Even if all those policies were put into place tomorrow, how long would it take to see real change? Until we get to the point that the concept of a ""healthy relationship"" is the norm, not something to be taught squeezed in between double maths and lunch? Women are not attacked because of our route home; we are not attacked because our walk was not ""purposeful"" enough, or because of what we were wearing. If a woman is murdered by a man she doesn't know, it is because he wanted to murder her. There is no other reason. Society as a whole - and women as individuals - owes him no excuse. No matter how well-meant, perhaps safety hints for women run the risk of offering one. And in the words of Prof Kelly - what will it take to move the conversation from protecting women's safety to protecting their freedom? Have you been affected by this story?

Why aren't there enough drivers?,"The government is taking a number of steps to address the shortage of HGV drivers, amid concerns about deliveries of food, fuel and other items in the run-up to Christmas. It hasintroduced temporary visasfor 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden. The shortage of HGV drivers is due to a combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors. A Road Haulage Association (RHA) survey of its members estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. That number includes thousands of drivers from European Union (EU) member states who were previously living and working in the UK. TheAnnual Population Survey,externalproduced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that there were 16,000 fewer EU nationals working as HGV drivers in the year ending March 2021, than in the previous year. Even before Covid, the overall estimated shortage was about 60,000 drivers. Covid is certainly part of the problem. As travel became increasingly restricted last year, and large parts of the economy shut down, many European drivers went home. And haulage companies say very few have returned. The pandemic also created a large backlog in HGV driver tests, so it has been impossible to get enough new drivers up and running. The industrywarned the prime minister,externalin June that there were 25,000 fewer candidates passing their test in 2020 than in 2019. There are HGV driver shortages across Europe, but in the UK Brexit has made things worse. Many European drivers who went back to their home countries, or decided to work elsewhere, are unable to return. When the UK was part of the EU single market, they used to be able to come and go as they pleased. But new immigration rules mean that is no longer the case. There is also new bureaucracy, and the decline in the value of the pound against the euro since the Brexit vote has made working in the UK less attractive for EU nationals. The strain on the freight transport system comes before Britain imposes checks on goods coming in from the EU. They have now been delayed until next year - some in January, others in July. If they prove too intrusive, that could make it even more difficult to encourage European drivers to work in this country. Many drivers are paid by the mile or kilometre rather than by the hour, so delays cost them money. There have also been tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. The reform of the IR35 rules - on how people working off the payroll pay tax - are designed to prevent workers setting up limited companies and paying less tax and National Insurance while working, in effect, as an employee. Haulage companies say the average age of HGV drivers in the UK is 55, and they want more to be done to attract younger workers. Why is there a shortage of lorry drivers? Backlash against longer hours for lorry drivers That includes better terms and conditions, better facilities for long distance drivers to use, and a recognition that they are a vital part of the economy. One consequence of shortages, though, has been thatsome wages for driversare already going up. According to data collected by Transport Intelligence, Poland was short of more than 120,000 drivers last year, while in Germany between 45,000 and 60,000 were needed. New figures are expected in the coming weeks. But shortages in other countries are having less impact than in the UK. Other European countries can call upon a much larger pool of labour in the EU single market, with the guarantee of free movement. In the UK, that flexibility is no longer available, and the labour shortage is affecting other industries as well - from food processing to fruit picking. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Like other parts of the UK, Northern Ireland is short of HGV drivers but there haven't been fuel shortages because it is not experiencing the same acute problems with tanker drivers. Northern Ireland was less reliant on drivers from the EU so has been less impacted by those workers no longer being available. An industry source says tanker driving tends to have better pay and working hours, so it is sought after by local drivers. Geography also works in Northern Ireland's favour - it's not much more than 100 miles wide so supply chains can't get as stretched as they are in the rest of the UK. As well as allowing more foreign workers into the UK, Ministry of Defence examiners will be brought in to increase the number of HGV driving tests. There will befree intensive 'boot camps',externalto train 5,000 people to become HGV drivers, with another 1,000 to be trained through courses funded by the adult education budget. The government is also writing to nearly one million drivers who hold an HGV licence to encourage them to return to the industry. There have been warnings about fruit and vegetable deliveries because of driver shortages It has also slightly relaxed the Drivers' Hours rules, which means drivers will be able to increase their daily driving limit from nine hours to 11 hours twice a week. There is Â£7,000 per person funding for the Large Goods Vehicle Driver apprenticeship scheme. Andthe government is consultingon a temporary weakening of the rules on what is called cabotage. Cabotage refers to whether a foreign HGV driver arriving in the UK is allowed to make collections and deliveries in the country before returning to their own countries. It's proposing to allow unlimited deliveries in a 14-day period. The Road Haulage Associationopposes this,external, because it will mean non-UK haulage companies can take work in the UK, as opposed to foreign HGV drivers working for UK haulage companies.

BP closes some sites,"A BP garage showing out of use signs today in Sherborne BP has warned it has had to ""temporarily"" close some of its petrol stations due to a shortage of lorry drivers. The oil firm said only ""a handful"" of sites were affected by the fuel supply issues, which have led to a lack of unleaded and diesel fuel. There are around 1,200 BP branded petrol stations around the UK, of which 300 are operated by BP themselves. The company said it was working hard to address the issues. Supply chain delays had been ""impacted by industry wide driver shortages across the UK"" and that the company was working hard to address the issues, BP said in a statement. ""We continue to work with our haulier supplier to minimise disruption and to ensure efficient and effective deliveries,"" the company added. Other petrol station operators have been approached by the BBC for comment. Esso said that a ""small number"" of its 200 Tesco Alliance retail sites have been affected. ""We are working closely with all parties in our distribution network to optimise supplies and minimise any inconvenience to customers. We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience,"" a spokesperson from Esso added. However, supermarket Morrisons, which operates 338 petrol stations across the UK, said it was not seeing any similar issues at the moment. Co-op runs 130 petrol stations in the country, and said it has a ""full complement"" of fuel delivery drivers. Tesco also said that they have a ""good availability of fuel"" and both Sainsbury's and Asda said there are no current issues in their fuel supplies. A BP petrol station in Worcester was closed due a lack of fuel Downing Street has said people should continue buying fuel as normal. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was no shortage of fuel in the UK, adding: ""We obviously recognise the challenges faced by the industry and we're taking steps to support them."" He pointed to changes made by the Department for Transport to make it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences and said that this is a problem several countries are facing. Grant Shapps also told the BBC's Question Time on Thursday that he believed the shortages had also been caused because of working conditions that ""hadn't been pleasant"" and that higher salaries offered to drivers was something the government was ""happy to see"". He also said that improvements in the availability of tests were ""coming in prior to Christmasâ¦ so these are things that will resolve the issues in the lead up to Christmas"". The temporary closures come just months after BPhad to close a ""handful"" of its UK sites in Julybecause of lorry driver shortages. At the time, BP said its supply chain issues had also been exacerbated by the closure of a distribution terminal due to staff being told to isolate. Paul Cheema's petrol station is just about to run out of unleaded petrol Paul Cheema has run a petrol station in Coventry since 2013, and says he's never experienced a situation like this before. ""We used to be able to put orders in for next day delivery. Now we have to do it a week in advance, but we're ordering blind. We don't know how much fuel we're going to sell in that time. If we'll have enough, or even too much,"" says Paul. ""Last week we put in an order for a delivery to arrive today. That was pushed back until tomorrow, and now we've been told it won't arrive until Saturday."" ""So that means we won't have any unleaded petrol to sell tomorrow,"" he said. Paul says that fuel delivery delays have been happening all summer, but it's been particularly bad in the last couple of weeks. ""We're a petrol station. We should have availability 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I'm not blaming our fuel supplier. It's not their fault. It's the bigger driver shortage problem behind it."" He sells thousands of litres of unleaded every day, so the cost implications for him are huge. ""There could be a 40% impact on sales with this week's delivery problems. If I haven't got any liquid in the ground, I'm not making money. I can't operate the site at a loss."" ""If I haven't got fuel to sell, that customer isn't coming into my petrol station shop either, so I'm losing money there too,"" says Paul. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents petrol station operators across the UK, said that some sites across the UK were seeing delivery delays, but that they were largely confined to London and the South East, and were ""temporary by nature"". Gordon Balmer from the PRA said that petrol station closures were rare, and that the fuel supply chain was resilient enough to cope. ""Fuel demand is still only at 92% of pre-pandemic levels so we believe there should be ample stock available at refineries and delivery terminals throughout the UK."" Many businesses have been complaining about the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, which is still causing serious supply chain problems. The coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes have all contributed to a lack of qualified drivers. Industry bodies estimate there is a shortfall of about 100,000 workers. Logistics UK, which represents the haulage industry, said it was ""aware of reports that petrol supplies are currently being affected"" by the lack of drivers. ""The driver shortage is a very serious issue that needs urgent government and industry action to resolve, however, we urge people not to panic buy; the logistics industry is resilient and has proven capable of supporting shops, families and businesses during Covid-19, border closures and the first stages of Brexit, and will continue to serve the needs of the nation,"" the industry body said.

What happened to Scotland's state-run energy plan?,"A plan to launch a state-run energy company in Scotland has fallen by the wayside As many customers face uncertainty over their household energy bills, we take a look at why plans for a state-owned energy company in Scotland fell by the wayside. In 2017 the Scottish government pledged to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit company to sell gas and electricity to customers at low prices by 2021. Why has this plan not come to fruition? When the plan was announced at the 2017 SNP conference in Glasgow, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said energy would be bought wholesale or generated in Scotland - and sold to customers ""as close to cost price as possible"". She said the company would not pay shareholders or corporate bonuses and that its only job would be to secure the lowest price for consumers Ms Sturgeon added that it would give people - particularly those on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use. At the time, energy market firm Schneider Electric told the BBC that independent suppliers had reduced the dominance of the Big Six suppliers but they could not always beat them on price because of the way the wholesale market worked. Why are gas prices so high? They said independent suppliers did well when the wholesale market fell because they were tracking the market more closely and their tariffs were more responsive - but the flip side was that when wholesale markets rose they did less well and had to increase prices. Now, nearly 1.5 million customers have been hit in just two weeks by energy firms collapsing under soaring gas prices. Not in so many words. In their 2021 manifesto, the SNP said that work on the public energy company had been ""halted"" during the pandemic, and efforts were being ""refocused"" on a public energy agency. It said the agency would ""coordinate and accelerate"" the delivery of heat and energy efficiency work as well as ""informing and educating"" the public on required changes. There have been fresh calls to revive the plan by SNP activists, but when asked if the Scottish government had dropped it altogether, Energy Secretary Michael Matheson said the party ""had not anticipated"" as great a need for decarbonisation in 2017. Energy firms' collapse hits 1.5 million customers Thousands of energy customers facing bill shocks How would a state-run energy company work? He told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""The reality is a public energy company will not resolve what are very serious systemic problems in the UK energy network and the UK energy system that the UK government have failed to address over many decades. ""There's been a significant change in both the market and what we now need to do to meet our climate change targets."" Rather than having a state-owned company, Mr Matheson said the Scottish government hoped to move to a model based on district heating - taking heat energy from a number of different sources and passing it to consumers through insulated pipes. He said this would help meet the target of decarbonising the heating of more than one million homes and 50,000 businesses. A worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies has now pushed up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they have risen 250% and prices have soared 70% from August alone. Outside the Bix Six energy companies, firms are struggling and some have already folded. Most recently Avro Energy and Green ceased trading on Wednesday and their 830,000 combined customers face being switched to a new, potentially more expensive, provider. No chance lights will go out, says government Earlier this monthEdinburgh-based People's Energy, which supplies gas and electricity to about 350,000 homes and 1,000 businesses, also ceased trading. The government has said it is considering offering emergency state-backed loans to surviving energy companies to encourage them to take on customers from bust firms. Founder and CEO of Green Energy Peter McGirr said the decision to close was not because they did not have enough money in the bank, but because of ""a number of extra pressures"" as a result of the pandemic. These pressures, he said, include people not paying bills due to financial issues, extended payment holidays for bills and additional demand due to people being at home during lockdown. He said: ""If you start lending money out and you have no mechanism to recover that, that is going to put your business under financial pressure. ""We could see this future event - this winter - which we couldn't make it through due to a cash flow shortage. We've been aware of this for several months, yet we talk about this gas crisis as if it's came about in the last week or two."" Mr McGirr shared concerns that people may not be able to afford to heat their homes Mr McGirr also predicted about 30 smaller companies would also cease trading due to pressure over the winter - a fate he believes could have been avoided with financial support from the UK government, asCO2 supplier CF Industries has received. ""I don't see why the government has chosen to put Â£50m into a fertiliser plant for CO2,"" he said. ""We'd still have food on the shelves. ""We might not have had meat, we might not have had some bubbles in our lemonade, but here and now if the shelves were empty that would look bad. ""But how is it going to look over winter when people cannot heat their homes, when come 1 April we increase people's bills by hundreds of pounds and people cannot afford to heat their homes?""

Several petrol stations shut amid panic buying,"This video can not be played People should carry on buying petrol as normal, the UK government says Several supermarkets have closed petrol stations in Wales due to demand for fuel, amid panic buying. It comes despite assurances from the UK government that people shouldcarry on buying petrol as normal. Tesco and Sainsbury's both confirmed closures, but Tesco said it had a ""good availability"" with deliveries arriving every day. Asda had to close some stations to temporarily refuel to meet demand, but did not report any fuel shortages. Buy petrol as normal, says minister BP closes some sites due to lorry driver shortage Sainsbury's said its Thornhill store in Cardiff had shut on Friday afternoon, adding: ""All our sites are receiving more fuel and we'll reopen again as soon as possible."" A Tesco Extra petrol station on Cowbridge Road, in Bridgend, was also closed as of 12:00 BST on Friday and at a Tesco in Bridgend, diesel was not available and only two pumps out of eight on its forecourt were open to motorists. Cardiff Gate services off junction 30 of the M4 ran out of fuel at about 19:45 BST, according to Traffic Wales. The Asda petrol station at Leckwith, near Cardiff City FC Stadium, was closed on Friday evening to refuel after the increased demand. Traffic brought to a halt at Aberthaw as drivers try to fill up Sion Jones, of Valley Services, Llandysul in the Teifi Valley, said he would have to ""consider rationing fuel sales"" to customers if panic buying continues. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC the Army could be brought in to drive fuel tankers if it would help. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Wales Police appealed on Twitter for drivers to keep roads clear. ""We are aware of drivers queuing at petrol stations across South Wales,"" the force wrote. ""Keeping highways clear is essential for emergency services, & other public service functions, and hindering them poses a public safety risk."" Sainsbury's in Thornhill was closed on Friday afternoon Bus company Stagecoach South Wales also wrote on Twitter: ""All our services are experiencing severe delays due to traffic queues at petrol stations. We are working to maintain services."" Stagecoach apologised to passengers because it was unable to use the bus stop at Asda in Dowlais, Merthyr, due to the amount of vehicles queueing for fuel at the superstore. Cardiff Bus said in a statement: ""We would like to apologise for the current delays we are experiencing across our network. ""The roads are extremely busy due to the panic buying of fuel - we would like to thank you for your patience, our driver will be with you asap."" Queues were seen outside a garage in Dolgellau... It is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with gaps made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit. Outside Wales, some stations owned by BP and Esso-owned Tesco Alliance were shut on Thursday because of a lack of delivery drivers. Mr Jones is considering rationing fuel at the garage he works at Steve Coombe, of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ""There were no supply outages last week but there are some sites that are confirming delay in deliveries... they appear confined to London and the south-east [of England] and one or two in the Midlands, but they appear to be temporary in nature."" He added: ""Sometimes newspaper headlines can sensationalise... everyone keep calm, there is plenty of stock. ""Those sites that have had problems are getting their fuel replenished."" Motorists queued for fuel in Llanishen, Cardiff, on Friday Will Young, who queued for half an hour for petrol at Morrisons in Llanishen, said:  ""You could see it coming really because on the news yesterday, it said it's going to happen over the next couple of weeks. ""It's not my problem but it is a problem for people who use their cars for every day purposes like business and taking their children to school."" Tony Fundell, another shopper, told BBC Wales: ""I think people are panicking. I've got enough to last me a few days so I'll top up as and when I need it. ""I'm retired so I've got enough time on my hands but I feel sorry for those who are in business."" Sometimes newspaper headlines can sensationalise the issue, says the Petrol Retailers Association Chris Bird, director of C J Bird Transport in Llantrisant, told BBC Radio Wales that petrol panic buyers are ""creating their own problem"". ""If you don't need it, don't bother. Unfortunately as humans we tend to panic and be very selfish in these times,"" he said. He added that turning to European drivers to fix the HGV driver shortage is no solution. ""The eastern European drivers have been the band aid for the job for the last 10 years I would say. ""It's solvable, the market will find its feet, the wages will go up to a point where people will become more attracted to it."" Queues at Tesco on Western Avenue, Cardiff The Welsh government said: ""The shortage of HGV drivers is of significant concern as they are critical to effective and timely distribution of goods across the country. ""We are monitoring the situation very closely but responsibility lies with UK government and we continue to raise our concerns with them."" Some senior UK government ministers will meet later to discuss supply problems at petrol stations. Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

"Buy petrol as normal, says minister","This video can not be played ""The fuel is there, it can continue to flow"" â Transport Secretary Grant Shapps People should carry on buying petrol as normal, despite supply problems that have closed some stations, the government has said. A ""handful"" of BP stations, and a small number of Esso-owned Tesco Alliance stations, were closed on Thursday because of a lack of delivery drivers. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said refineries had ""plenty of petrol"". He told the BBC that the government could bring in the army to drive fuel tankers if it would help. It is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with gaps made worse by the pandemic and Brexit. Other industries such as food processing have been impacted. Britain's biggest baker Warburtons has confirmed that the company is facing challenges recruiting lorry drivers and that the shortage is causing some disruption to its supply chain. The baker delivers to around 18,500 stores and says it can't deliver to a number of them. ""The national driver shortage continues to place a strain on the Warburtons distribution network but we are working incredibly hard to maintain a good level of service for our customers nationwide."" Reports in several newspapers have suggested that the government is considering getting soldiers to drive fuel tankers under emergency plans. When questioned about this on BBC Breakfast, Mr Shapps said: ""If it can actually help, we will bring them in."" However, he said there would be ""technicalities"" as to whether military personnel could switch to driving civilian vehicles. Why is there a shortage of lorry drivers? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Are there problems at the forecourt you use? Send your pictures toyourpics@bbc.co.uk,externalorupload your pictures/video here The AA said that most of the UK's forecourts were working as they should. ""There is no shortage of fuel and thousands of forecourts are operating normally with just a few suffering temporary supply chain problems,"" said AA president Edmund King. ""Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts, as drivers either combine filling up with shopping runs, prepare for weekend trips or refuel for the start of the new working week."" Mr King said drivers should not fill up outside their normal routines, because even if the occasional petrol station was temporarily closed, others just down the road would be open. ""It is now clear that there have been occasional delays over recent weeks that have been managed with hardly anyone noticing. This was a manageable problem."" There are about 8,380 petrol stations in the UK, according to the Petrol Retailers Association. Of these, about 1% are believed to be closed at the moment. It is understood that about 50 to 100 BP forecourts are affected by shortages, while Esso said ""a small number"" of its Tesco Alliance retail sites had been hit. Helena Wright is part of family firm W's Transport, based in north Norfolk Helena Wright, transport manager for Norfolk-based firm W's Transport, told the BBC her company had sold two lorries after advertising for HGV drivers and not getting a single applicant. ""Normally we would have people on record to call who had left their details,"" she said. ""This is the first time for our firm that that's happened, but it's a problem that has been a long time coming. ""I've got a lot of drivers that are over the age of 50, 55 and looking to retire and we are not attractive as an industry for the younger generation."" She said younger people were not prepared to spend four to five nights a week away from home and were not ready to put up with ""inhumane"" conditions. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has urged the government to relax visa restrictions for foreign workers in the short term to ease the driver shortage. But Mr Shapps told the BBC he did not want UK lorry drivers to ""drop out"" because of being ""undercut"" by cheaper EU labour. He said there were ""systemic problems"" in the haulage industry that needed to be resolved, pointing out that the profession was ""99% white male"" with an average age of 55, facing poor conditions and wages. Now, he said, pay was rising and there was ""a gradual increase"" in new drivers. While the UK does not lack petrol and diesel at refineries, getting it to forecourts has been difficult in some areas. It is the latest problem caused by driver shortages, which have already led to supply squeezes in other industries, including supermarkets. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""The supply issues affecting a small number of petrol forecourts shouldn't impact the prices drivers pay to fill up. ""But unfortunately the price of oil, which has the biggest influence on what drivers pay at the pumps, is continuing to rise at the moment. ""This may lead to fuel prices going up in the coming days, which would be yet more bad news for drivers, as a litre of unleaded is already over 21p a litre more expensive than a year ago."" The RHA's Rod McKenzie told BBC Breakfast more lorry drivers were leaving the profession each week than joining it. He said: ""It's as simple as this: everything we get in Britain comes on the back of a truck. ""So if there is a shortage of HGV drivers - and there is by 100,000 - then it is inevitable that we are not going to get all the things we want when we want them."" ""It is not a case of running out - and people should not panic buy,"" he added. He warned there would be glitches ""because the supply chain on which we all depend is creaking"". Supermarket Iceland - which is about 100 drivers short - joined Morrisons and Ocado in calling for the government to add HGV drivers tothe list of shortage occupations,external. That would allow foreign workers to apply for skilled worker visas to fill the current gaps. ""I think the solution - even if it's temporary - is very, very simple,"" said Iceland managing director Richard Walker. ""Let's get HGV drivers on to the skilled worker list."" The RHA's Mr McKenzie said that on top of a historic shortage of drivers, the industry had lost 20,000 European drivers because of Brexit, while the pandemic had forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled. Ina recent RHA survey,externalof 616 hauliers, retiring colleagues and Brexit topped the list of reasons behind the driver shortages. Respondents also cited tax changes to rules known as IR35, which have made it more expensive for hauliers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. Businesses across the food, fuel and construction sectors have been warning about driver shortages for months. BP temporarily closed a number of petrol stations earlier in summer, when driver shortages also caused short-term supply problems for McDonald's, Nandos, and the pub chain Wetherspoons. Speaking on BBC Question Time on Thursday, Mr Shapps suggested visa changes would not solve the problem, but said nothing had been ruled out. But shadow justice secretary David Lammy said visas were needed in various sectors, telling Mr Shapps: ""You promised that immigration would come down and you know that it will need to go up if we are to deal with these problems."" Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said there was ""an endemic problem with retention and recruitment"" in the industry. ""We're actually not short of HGV drivers per se - we've got 600,000 people who are qualified to drive those big trucks, but only 300,000 people chose to work in the industry,"" he told the BBC. Mr Bridgen suggested the industry needed to modernise and improve working conditions to retain young drivers. In recent weeks, the Department for Transport has made it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences, butthe RHA criticisedthe changes as a risk to road safety.

"Protester, 82, prepared to go to jail over climate","Judy Bruce says she spends some of her time at protests ""de-escalating"", by explaining why the group are there An 82-year-old climate change protester says she is prepared to go to prison for blocking motorways. Judy Bruce, from Swansea, is a member of the Insulate Britain group, which has blocked parts of the M25 five times in the last fortnight. She said she had already spent three nights in custody but ""nothing has got the impact that disruption does"". Earlier this week police said the protests were putting drivers at a""very high risk of death"". On Thursday the UK governmentwon a court rulingagainst Insulate Britain, which wants the installation of heat-saving measures in social housing by 2025, and all homes by 2030. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted,externalthe activists faced ""possible imprisonment if they flout"" an injunction. Judy Bruce says Insulate Britain has ""the notice of the whole country"" Protesters have also targeted other motorways, including the M11 near Stansted Airport in Essex, and the M3 in Surrey. Ms Bruce said as well as well as sitting on the motorway she had been ""de-escalating"" by ""talking to angry drivers and explaining why we're doing it"". She said: ""[I've been] trying to help people who are really stuck with an urgent appointment, trying to get them to ring an ambulance which will always get through."" M25 protests: Protesters 'may cause serious injury or death' Air pollution: Even worse than we thought - WHO Climate change: UN warning over nations' climate plans She said she understood why they were angry, adding: ""If I was in a traffic jam, I'd be angry too. ""We've actually tried everything else... nothing has really got the impact that disruption does. ""We've got the notice of the whole country now and everybody is talking about it."" Judy Bruce, pictured left, wants the billions being spent on new roads and HS2 to be redirected to insulating homes When asked byBBC Radio Wales Breakfastif she was prepared to go to prison for protesting, she said: ""Well yes I am actually, and I've spent three evenings and into the early morning in police custody already - it is not very comfortable, I can tell you. ""But this is such a serious matter - I don't happen to have any children but other people are thinking of their grandchildren."" She said Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ""saying all the right things"" on climate change but ""not actually putting them into practice"", and called for the billions being spent on new roads and HS2 to be redirected to insulating homes. Mr Johnson has said the COP26 summit in Glasgow will be the""turning point for humanity"". The civil court action was taken by National Highways, the government body which runs motorways. In his High Court order, Mr Justice Lavender ruled it should last until 21 March, but there would be a hearing to review the situation on 5 October. The order covers every part of the M25 and the Dartford Crossing, including slip roads and bridges, and states demonstrators are banned from ""causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto"". Insulate Britain protesters blocking the A20 in Kent on Thursday morning The order means that breaching it could lead to a civil court hearing. In a statement, Insulate Britain said it would continue its protests and ""as soon as the government makes a meaningful statement that we can trust, we will leave the motorway"". During the recent protests, the government said it was ""investing Â£1.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures, and our upcoming Heat and Buildings Strategy will set out how we decarbonise the nation's homes in a way that is fair, practical and affordable"".

Ministers discuss petrol driver shortages,"Drivers have queued at some petrol stations, despite reassurances over supplies Ministers are working on plans for a temporary visa scheme to make it easier for foreign lorry drivers to come to the UK. Final details of exactly how the initiative will work are expected to be announced this weekend. Any changes to immigration rules will be temporary, with a cap on the number of workers allowed to enter the UK. The shortage of hauliers threatens more disruption to deliveries of petrol, food and other goods. It is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by the pandemic and Brexit. BP and Esso have shut a number of petrol stations due to a lack of tanker drivers, while EG Group has said it will introduce a limit of Â£30 per customer on all grades of fuel. The company, which operates 400 filling stations in the UK, said the move was due to the ""current unprecedented customer demand for fuel and associated supply challenges"". All of EG Group's UK sites remain open and operational to serve customers. HGV drivers and emergency services will be excluded from the Â£30 limit due to ""their vital role at this time"", according to the firm. ""This is a company decision to ensure all our customers have a fair chance to refuel and to enable our sites to carry on running smoothly,"" a spokesperson from the firm said. ""We kindly ask everyone visiting our sites to treat our colleagues, supply chain partners and customers with respect during these very challenging times."" A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""We have ample fuel stocks in this country and the public should be reassured there are no shortages. ""But like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary Covid-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country."" The spokesperson explained that ministers are looking at temporary measures to ""avoid any immediate problems"", but added that any measures introduced will be ""very strictly time limited"". ""We are moving to a high-wage, high-skilled economy and businesses will need to adapt with more investment in recruitment and training to provide long-term resilience,"" the spokesperson added. A sign outside a Tesco petrol station in Bracknell, Berkshire, on Friday The European Road Haulers Association said temporary visas would be a ""good idea"" but are ""only part of the solution"". The association said it is still easier to drive within the EU than driving between the EU and the UK, meaning that staying within the EU may still be more appealing for drivers. Despite reassurances, large queues formed at many petrol stations on Friday. On social media, people reported queues lasting for up to 30 minutes, while there were also reports of drivers filling jerry cans.

US agrees deal to free detained Huawei boss,"Meng Wanzhou (C) leaves British Columbia Supreme Court A Chinese technology executive held in Canada on US fraud charges has left the country after a deal with prosecutors, following years of diplomatic tensions over her fate. Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, was detained on fraud charges in December 2018 at the request of the US. On Friday, the US Department of Justice dropped an extradition request for her. The case infuriated China and strained relations with the US and Canada. It also prompted accusations that China had detained Canadian citizens in retaliation, which China denied. ""My life has been turned upside down. It was a disruptive time for me,"" Ms Meng told reporters after being freed from Canadian detention. ""Every cloud has a silver lining,"" she continued, adding: ""I will never forget all the good wishes I received from people around the world."" Shortly afterwards she boarded an Air China flight bound for the Chinese city of Shenzhen, AFP news agency reports. Meng Wanzhou is believed to have left Vancouver International Airport on this Air China flight bound for Shenzhen Details of a possible deal for Ms Meng's release have been the subject of intense negotiations between US and Chinese diplomats. The US alleged Ms Meng misled the bank HSBC over the true nature of Huawei's relationship with a company called Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Iran. On Friday the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement. This means the DOJ would hold off from prosecuting Ms Meng until December 2022. If she complied with conditions set by court, the case would eventually be dropped. The PowerPoint that sparked an international row Meng Wanzhou: Trapped in a gilded cage The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress The deal, which recommended she be released, allowed her to formally deny guilt for key charges while also acknowledging the allegations laid out by the Americans. Later on Friday, Canadian prosecutors told a court in Vancouver that they had withdrawn efforts to extradite her to the US and that she should be discharged from detention. She had been under house arrest in her multimillion-dollar Vancouver home for nearly three years. Ahead of the court appearance, Ms Meng was seen entering the building accompanied by Chinese consular officials. The judge subsequently ordered that she go free. As part of the deal, Ms Meng agreed to a ""statement of facts"" admitting that she knowingly made false statements to HSBC. The DOJ said Ms Meng had ""taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution"". The DOJ also said said it was continuing to prepare for trial against Huawei. For months there have been extensive behind-the-scenes contacts, with senior Huawei executives sent to Washington by the company to try to resolve a case which has fuelled international tension. For Huawei's boss, the issue has been deeply personal, with his daughter being held, but for the whole of China it has also turned into a major cause of anger. It has also poisoned relations between China and Canada, with the latter believing two of its citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been held as pawns in the negotiations. A deal has the ability to reduce some of the tensions that have emerged. But there will still be questions - what does the US gain out of it? And what kind of link might there be between events in North America and the status of the two Michaels in China? Ms Meng is the elder daughter of billionaire Ren Zhengfei, who set up Huawei in 1987. The company is now the largest telecom equipment maker in the world. He served in the Chinese army for nine years, until 1983, and is also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei has faced accusations that the Chinese authorities could use its equipment for espionage - allegations it denies. In 2019, the US imposed sanctions on Huawei and placed it on an export blacklist, cutting it off from key technologies. The UK, Sweden, Australia and Japan have also banned Huawei, while other countries including France and India have adopted measures stopping short of an outright ban. A few days after Ms Meng was arrested, China detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, on suspicion of spying.

Hunt for CCTV suspect in Sabina Nessa killing,"This video can not be played Police want to speak to this man Detectives investigating the murder of Sabina Nessa are hunting a man seen on CCTV near the scene of her death. The 28-year-old was discovered in Cator Park in Kidbrooke, south-east London, by a member of the public on Saturday. Police say identifying the balding man, who was seen with something in his hands, could be ""vital"" to the case. Reclaim These Streets, set up after Sarah Everard's murder, held a vigil in Pegler Square - where the suspect was pictured - at 19:00 GMT. The wanted man, who was wearing grey jeans and a black jacket, can be seen looking over his shoulder and pulling up his hood as he walks along the pavement. A 38-year-old man who was arrested in south-east London on Thursday on suspicion of murdering the teacher was released earlier on Friday, the Met Police said. Sabina Nessa's post-mortem carried out on Monday was inconclusive Ahead of the vigil for Ms Nessa, her sister urged people to stay safe and to pray for her. Jebina Yasmin Islam said: ""We as a family are shocked at the murder of our sister, daughter and aunty to my girls. ""There are no words to describe how we are feeling as a family at the moment. We did not expect that something like this would ever happen to us."" Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Ms Nessa was attacked shortly after leaving her home in Astell Road at about 20:30 BST last Friday. She had been walking to meet a friend at The Depot bar, a journey that police said ""should have taken just over five minutes"". Her body was found the next day near a walkway in the park. Police have also released an image of a car they believe the wanted man had access to Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe said the force was not asking women to change their behaviour when going out at night. It comes after information sheets advising women on how to stay safe at night were handed out by a community group. ""It's really important to us that we don't ask women to change their behaviour,"" she said. ""Violence against women and girls is a priority for police across the UK but we're really conscious that women should be free to go about their lives without fear of abuse."" This video can not be played Tracing Sabina Nessa's final steps She added that violence against women had the ""hallmarks of an epidemic"". ""It is something that is tolerated far too much in society and we the police are determined to bring offenders to justice and to prevent these offences where we can,"" she said. She asked anyone with information about Ms Nessa's death to come forward. The Duchess of Cambridge has said her thoughts are with the family and friends of Ms Nessa and that she is ""saddened by the loss of another innocent young woman on our streets"". Ms Nessa was a teacher at Rushey Green primary school in Catford. The head, Lisa Williams, called her ""a brilliant teacher"" adding that she was ""kind, caring and absolutely dedicated to her pupils"". Have you been affected by this story?

US agrees deal that could free detained Huawei bossChief financial officer Meng Wanzhou has been detained in Canada over US fraud charges since 2018.US & Canada,"Meng Wanzhou (C) leaves British Columbia Supreme Court A Chinese technology executive held in Canada on US fraud charges has left the country after a deal with prosecutors, following years of diplomatic tensions over her fate. Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, was detained on fraud charges in December 2018 at the request of the US. On Friday, the US Department of Justice dropped an extradition request for her. The case infuriated China and strained relations with the US and Canada. It also prompted accusations that China had detained Canadian citizens in retaliation, which China denied. ""My life has been turned upside down. It was a disruptive time for me,"" Ms Meng told reporters after being freed from Canadian detention. ""Every cloud has a silver lining,"" she continued, adding: ""I will never forget all the good wishes I received from people around the world."" Shortly afterwards she boarded an Air China flight bound for the Chinese city of Shenzhen, AFP news agency reports. Meng Wanzhou is believed to have left Vancouver International Airport on this Air China flight bound for Shenzhen Details of a possible deal for Ms Meng's release have been the subject of intense negotiations between US and Chinese diplomats. The US alleged Ms Meng misled the bank HSBC over the true nature of Huawei's relationship with a company called Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Iran. On Friday the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement. This means the DOJ would hold off from prosecuting Ms Meng until December 2022. If she complied with conditions set by court, the case would eventually be dropped. The PowerPoint that sparked an international row Meng Wanzhou: Trapped in a gilded cage The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress The deal, which recommended she be released, allowed her to formally deny guilt for key charges while also acknowledging the allegations laid out by the Americans. Later on Friday, Canadian prosecutors told a court in Vancouver that they had withdrawn efforts to extradite her to the US and that she should be discharged from detention. She had been under house arrest in her multimillion-dollar Vancouver home for nearly three years. Ahead of the court appearance, Ms Meng was seen entering the building accompanied by Chinese consular officials. The judge subsequently ordered that she go free. As part of the deal, Ms Meng agreed to a ""statement of facts"" admitting that she knowingly made false statements to HSBC. The DOJ said Ms Meng had ""taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution"". The DOJ also said said it was continuing to prepare for trial against Huawei. For months there have been extensive behind-the-scenes contacts, with senior Huawei executives sent to Washington by the company to try to resolve a case which has fuelled international tension. For Huawei's boss, the issue has been deeply personal, with his daughter being held, but for the whole of China it has also turned into a major cause of anger. It has also poisoned relations between China and Canada, with the latter believing two of its citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been held as pawns in the negotiations. A deal has the ability to reduce some of the tensions that have emerged. But there will still be questions - what does the US gain out of it? And what kind of link might there be between events in North America and the status of the two Michaels in China? Ms Meng is the elder daughter of billionaire Ren Zhengfei, who set up Huawei in 1987. The company is now the largest telecom equipment maker in the world. He served in the Chinese army for nine years, until 1983, and is also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei has faced accusations that the Chinese authorities could use its equipment for espionage - allegations it denies. In 2019, the US imposed sanctions on Huawei and placed it on an export blacklist, cutting it off from key technologies. The UK, Sweden, Australia and Japan have also banned Huawei, while other countries including France and India have adopted measures stopping short of an outright ban. A few days after Ms Meng was arrested, China detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, on suspicion of spying. Critics have accused China of treating them as political bargaining chips, held as part of what is known as ""hostage diplomacy"". China denies this.

Johnson and Macron speak after military pact row,"Boris Johnson has spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron for the first time since a row broke out between London and Paris over a military pact between the UK, US and Australia. The UK prime minister and Mr Macron had agreed to ""continue working closely together around the world"", Downing Street said. A French government source said the two countries shared ""common interests"". The Aukus pact cost France a submarine contract worth billions of dollars. The row between Paris and London started after Australia signed up to the Aukus pact with the US and UK, to provide it with nuclear-powered submarines. This involved Australia pulling out out of an existing $37bn (Â£27bn) deal with France to build 12 conventional diesel-powered submarines. PM tells Macron: Donnez-moi un break over new pact France and US seek to mend rift over Aukus pact France recalls envoys amid security pact row Aukus pact delivers France some hard truths As a result, the French defence minister cancelled talks with her UK counterpart, while the French government recalled its ambassadors in Washington and Canberra. One minister called the Aukus deal a ""stab in the back"", but Mr Johnson has accused the French of over-reacting, urging Mr Macron: ""Donnez-moi (give me) a break."" In an effort to smooth out differences, a Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson and Mr Macron had spoken by telephone on Friday and discussed ""a range of issues of mutual interest"". ""They reaffirmed the importance of the UK-France relationship and agreed to continue working closely together around the world on our shared agenda, through Nato and bilaterally,"" they added. The two leaders also discussed migrant Channel crossings. What is Aukus?It's a security pact between Australia, the US and UK. It allows for greater sharing of intelligence, but crucially it gives Australia secret technology to build nuclear-powered submarines, though not equipped with nuclear weapons What's the aim?Aukus is widely seen as a response to the growing power of China, and an effort to counter its influence in the contested South China Sea Why has it angered France?Australia cancelled a $37bn (Â£27bn) deal with a French company building diesel-powered submarines, and, what's more, France - a traditional Western ally - found out about the new pact only a few hours before the public announcement The spokesperson also said Mr Johnson and Mr Macron had ""noted in particular the strategic significance of our long-standing cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and in Africa"". And they had discussed how to ""break the business model of people smugglers who put lives at risk"" in the English Channel and resolved to ""keep talking on other issues, such as fisheries licences and the Northern Ireland Protocol"". A French government source told the BBC the two leaders had spoken at Mr Johnson's request. They added: ""Mr Boris Johnson expressed his intention to re-establish cooperation between France and the United Kingdom, in accordance with our values and our common interests.""

Thank you for joining our coverage - it's been edited by Holly Wallis and Rob Corp, and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner and Hazel Shearing. It's been a busy day and we'll be signing off shortly. Here are some of the headlines from around the UK:  Magaret Keenan, the first person outside a trial to receive a Covid vaccine in the world, is urging others to ""go for it"" and get their booster jabafter receiving hers. She returned to University Hospital Coventry, in the West Midlands - where she had the historic injection in December 2020 - to get her booster on Friday. The 91-year-old, who only retired from her job working in a jeweller's five years ago, says: ""I don't really know what stops people from having it... there's nothing to be frightened of. ""It's protected me in the mind, as well, you know. ""I feel quite confident now, going out, places I wouldn't have thought about before."" It comes as the NHS revealed more than 350,000 people had booked a booster this week. More than 1.5 million eligible people have so far been invited to book their booster vaccine. You can find out who is eligible for a boosterhere. As we've reported, senior ministers have been meeting this afternoon to discuss fuel delivery problems at some petrol stations. It's after a small number were affected because of a shortage of HGV drivers. Some people have posted pictures of queues forming near forecourts. Ifan Morgan Jones, who took the first photo below, told the BBC he had never seen a petrol queue as long in Dolgellau, Wales. But the government says refineries have ""plenty of petrol"" and drivers should carry on as normal. And the AA says most of the UK's forecourts are working as they should. AA president Edmund King said: ""Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts, as drivers either combine filling up with shopping runs, prepare for weekend trips or refuel for the start of the new working week."" Dolgellau in Wales Costco, Lakeside Sainsburyâs Ashford Kent New Chester Road, Tranmere Turning back to the fuel delivery issues, the Scottish government saysthere is no shortage of fuel in Scotlandand supplies are operating as normal. Ministers are however having urgent discussions with the sector and say they will support consumers however they can. Their comments came as long queues were seen outside some Scottish petrol stations on Friday afternoon. Drivers waited in line in Cambuslang, Port Glasgow and at Braehead Shopping Centre near Glasgow. Earlier UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the lorry driver shortage behind the fuel supply problem had been made worse by the pandemic, as well as systemic issues relating to pay and conditions. A further 35,623 people have tested positive for Covid in the UK, according to official government figures - slightly down on the 36,710 reported on Thursday but up from the 32,651 cases reported for the same day last week. There have also been a further 180 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded - taking the total by that measure to 135,983 since the pandemic began. A further 31,617 first doses and 44,817 second doses of coronavirus vaccines were given on Thursday. It means that more than 48.7 million people have received at least one dose, 89.6% of the UK population aged 16 and above. More than 44.6 million are now fully vaccinated - 82.1% of that group. A third of people with confirmed Covid in Wales in the past week were unvaccinated, according to new figures released by Public Health Wales (PHW). The figures also showed 99% of people who tested positive for Covid in the past week in Wales were under 60. Of these, 37% were unvaccinated. Nearly 13% of hospital patients with confirmed Covid were unvaccinated. PHW says vaccines have helped to keep Covid hospital numbers much lower during the third wave. Although 80% of patients have been double-dosed with a vaccine, public health officials say this is not evidence that the vaccine is not working - and they insist vaccines keep 95% of people out of hospital. Without this protection, the numbers in hospital would be far greater, they add.Here's what else the figures show. The council described the Zoom footage, recorded last year, as ""innocuous"" A New Zealand council's Zoom meeting recorded during a Covid-19 lockdown period last year has unexpectedly gone viral. The meeting of the Waipa District Council's finance and corporate committee has been viewed more than 290,000 times on YouTube as people use it to pretend to take part and avoid being disturbed. ""We're feeling famous,"" the council wrote on Twitter on Friday, adding: ""After inexplicably going viral on the internet... we're just as confused as you."" The footage, which runs for about one hour and 44 minutes and is described as ""innocuous"", discussesthe impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the nation's tourism industry,external. ""I have used this meeting six times now,"" writes one YouTuber. ""My wife asked why the person speaking has an accentâ¦ I'm in the  US,"" another commented. Other users included students who said they had played the footage to convince their parents they were studying from home. New Zealand was initially praised for its handling of the virus, but has since seen a slow roll-out of vaccines although it has been ramping up in recent days. A spike in Covid cases, attributed to the Delta variant, recently put large parts of the country back into lockdown. Readmore on this story here.

asked about the shortage of HGV drivers on Question Time, Transport Secretary
Grant Shapps said this was happening in other countries too. He said Poland had
a shortage of 123,000 drivers and Germany had a shortage of 60,000. According to data collected by Transport Intelligence, Poland was short of
123,842 drivers last year, while in Germany, between 45,000 and 60,000 were
needed. We
couldnât find more recent data, so we donât know how these figures compare with
the current estimate for the UK â from the Road Haulage Association â of a
shortage of about 100,000 drivers. In arecent interview with Trans.Info,external, Michael
Clover, Transport Intelligence's head of commercial development, pointed out
that driver shortages in Europe were not leading to empty shelves and said
Brexit was a factor. He
said driver vacancies in EU countries could be quickly filled by drivers from
neighbouring countries, and drivers didnât have to face checks at the
border [because these countries are in the EU single market, unlike the UK]. Shapps, on Question Time, blamed the impact of Covid for causing the HGV ""bottleneck"" â because testing centres to get licences had to close. He also

Retailers are warning that significant disruption to Christmas preparations will be ""inevitable"" unless the government finds a solution to the HGV driver shortage in the next 10 days. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium (BRC), says: ""HGV drivers are the glue which hold our supply chains together. ""Without them, we are unable to move goods from farms to warehouses to shops.

Passengers journeying to Jersey from any country will no longer have to isolate or test on arrival if they can produce a negative Covid PCR test. This new rule -accepting negative pre-departure tests from all countries- comes into effect on Tuesday, the government of Jersey has announced. Previously only negative PCR tests from the UK were accepted. A pre-departure form will still be required, plus evidence of a negative test result. The test must have been conducted within 72 hours of departure. As we reported earlier, Scottish ministers have agreed to bring the nation in line with the UK government over international travel testing. Now the Northern Ireland Executive hasdecided to change the rulesthere to bring them in line with the rest of the UK. Ministers agreed to remove the requirement for pre-departure testing for fully vaccinated arrivals from non-red list countries. This change will come into force at 04:00 BST on 4 October. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There have been Covid outbreaks in two Chinese provinces in the last couple of weeks, and fears of a more widespread outbreak ahead of a major travel period next month. One district in the Chinese city of Xiamen is offering people cash rewards if they report people they believe havenât been tested for Covid-19. According tothe national Global Times newspaper,external, Tongan District in Xiamen, Fujian province, is offering 1,000 yuan (Â£113) rewards to residents if they tip off the authorities. People have been warned that they could be denied entry to various public places if they do not comply with testing drives, or even face criminal punishment. Xiamen is one of four cities in Fujian province that has confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the last couple of weeks.There have been more than 400 confirmed cases in Fujian since 11 September,external, a quarter of which are in children. Whenever cases of Covid-19 are identified in Chinese towns or cities, large-scale testing drives are ordered to identify any symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Xiamen, which has a population of five million people,has carried out four rounds of city-wide testing.,external The city is hopeful that it can curb its outbreak by the Golden Week holiday commencing on 1 October, and the second biggest travel period after the Lunar New Year. Media outlets have warned that peopleâs travel plans may be disrupted at a provincial level if regions donât get their case numbers down to zero. Last week, the Ministry of Culture said âtrans-provincial group tours, air tickets and hotel reservation servicesâ must be âimmediatelyâ suspended within affected provinces if cases of Covid-19 force areas into lockdown. A public health official for two English districts with high rates of Covid-19 said she ""supports"" the return of face coverings in secondary schools. At least four schools in Corby and two in Kettering, both in Northamptonshire, have asked for masks in communal areas. Kettering has the second-highest case rate in England, while Corby has the third. The county's director of public health, Lucy Wightman, says: ""If you have case rates as high as we've seen, why would people not take those precautions to try and reduce risk to them and that disruption to education and the risk to the wider population?"" At the start of term, schools in England were advised face coverings were no longer routinely needed for staff or pupils, although they were still recommended in crowded spaces such as on school buses. But the Department for Education said schools could temporarily reintroduce bubble groups and face masks in communal spaces inareas with higher Covid rates. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Could England's run to the Euro 2020 championships final have helped increase immunity? People in Scotland are twice as likely as those in England
to test positive for Covid at the moment. One in 45 people test positive north of the border compared
with one in 90 below it. But why and will the rest of the UK follow Scotlandâs lead? There are no clear answers. There could be differences in
levels of immunity in the two countries due to the spread of the virus in
previous waves. Even the England football teamâs run to the finals of the
Euros, which did help Covid spread, could have topped up immunity. Differences in the schooling system â schools in Scotland go
back in mid-August rather than early September â could also have an impact. Understanding the difference could help us figure out what
is going to happen in the months to come as there is still considerable
uncertainty about how tough this winter is going to be. Covid infections in England are now highest among school age children, according to the Office for National Statistics, with secondary school children the worst affected. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), says the higher case numbers in that age group will be partly down to more testing among school children. âSome of this is a genuine rise in cases in that age group and some of it is that youâre finding cases because youâre looking for them,â he tells BBC Radio 4âs The World at One. He says âadults are infecting children more than children are infecting adultsâ, and warns there could be a spike among young adults âcoming upâ as students start university. âThe people we need to most urgently pay attention to are the young adults who socialise a lot, many of whom are still not immunised. Thatâs where weâre going to see most transmission going on in the coming weeks and months,â he says. âThe universities really need to give every opportunity they can to students coming in to make it easy and convenient.â  The Scottish government will bring Covidtesting for travellers returning from abroad into line with the rest of the UK. Tests before departure will no longer be required for those who are fully vaccinated. It is not yet known when the change will take effect. Scottish ministers also said they ""intend to align with the UK post-arrival testing regime"" but details of this have still be finalised. This includes whether a a PCR or lateral flow test will be required within two days of arriving home. A shortage of HGV drivers in the UK is not a Brexit issue, says a member of the transport committee. Conservative MP Greg Smith told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""This isn't a Brexit issue. If it was a Brexit issue then everyone in the European Union would be just fine and have as many HGV drivers as they need and we know that's not true. We know Germany, we know Poland have as bigger problem as the UK does if not slightly bigger."" He says: ""It's perfectly natural thing to look at to say there's a shortage of HGV drivers as there clearly is and we can't fill that gap from the domestic market then we should look at increasing the number of points you get for holding an HGV licence for being able to come here and work in that sector either on a permanent footing or a temporary measure."" We've been reporting on a lorry driver shortage in the UK which has been exacerbated by coronavirus. John Buckland gave up teaching to become an HGV driver in 2015 and says although he finds it ""a fun job"", he's now having second thoughts ""Long distance means I have to have nights out,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. ""So at the moment I'm spending four to five nights out a week and I just want to be home. The wages are also really pretty poor as well."" He says offering higher salaries will not be enough to get people into the job. ""They're going to say alright you're going to get Â£50,000 but you're never going to see home, you're going to be out at weekends, sleeping in the cab you're going to have to park in lay-bys. I don't think that's going to be very attractive to very many people at all,"" he says. Kieran Smith from specialist HGV training agency, Driver Require, says: ""We estimate 230,000 licence holders are not driving at the moment,"" he says. ""Of those, 50,000 left in the last six months, so some of those should be able to be attracted back and that's probably the most easy short-term fix."" Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveLorry driver crisis made worse by Covid - Shapps3 minutes ago,"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the shortage of HGV drivers is a âglobal problemâ and has been made worse by coronavirus He says the ""principal bottleneck"" relates to getting more tests for HGV drivers - after none were available during the pandemic There are also other ""systemic problems"" in the haulage industry that need to be resolved, the transport secretary says Senior UK ministers are meeting this afternoon to discuss supply problems at petrol stations It comes after a small number of BP and Esso-owned Tesco Alliance petrol stations closed due to a lack of delivery drivers The pandemic has forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled, the Road Haulage Association says Lorry driver shortages have also been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit and other industry issues around conditions and pay But No 10 says there is ""no shortage of fuel in the UK and people should continue to buy fuel as normal"" Meanwhile, Magaret Keenan - the first person outside a trial to receive a Covid jab in the world - has received her booster shot Around one in 90 people in private households in England had Covid in the week to 18 September, down from one in 80 in the previous week - ONS A further 35,623 people have tested positive for Covid, according to UK figures, with another 180 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis That's all from us. Thank you for joining our coverage - it's been edited by Holly Wallis and Rob Corp, and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner and Hazel Shearing. It's been a busy day and we'll be signing off shortly. Here are some of the headlines from around the UK:  Magaret Keenan, the first person outside a trial to receive a Covid vaccine in the world, is urging others to ""go for it"" and get their booster jabafter receiving hers. She returned to University Hospital Coventry, in the West Midlands - where she had the historic injection in December 2020 - to get her booster on Friday. The 91-year-old, who only retired from her job working in a jeweller's five years ago, says: ""I don't really know what stops people from having it... there's nothing to be frightened of. ""It's protected me in the mind, as well, you know. ""I feel quite confident now, going out, places I wouldn't have thought about before."" It comes as the NHS revealed more than 350,000 people had booked a booster this week. More than 1.5 million eligible people have so far been invited to book their booster vaccine. You can find out who is eligible for a boosterhere. As we've reported, senior ministers have been meeting this afternoon to discuss fuel delivery problems at some petrol stations. It's after a small number were affected because of a shortage of HGV drivers. Some people have posted pictures of queues forming near forecourts. Ifan Morgan Jones, who took the first photo below, told the BBC he had never seen a petrol queue as long in Dolgellau, Wales. But the government says refineries have ""plenty of petrol"" and drivers should carry on as normal. And the AA says most of the UK's forecourts are working as they should. AA president Edmund King said: ""Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts, as drivers either combine filling up with shopping runs, prepare for weekend trips or refuel for the start of the new working week."" Dolgellau in Wales Costco, Lakeside Sainsburyâs Ashford Kent New Chester Road, Tranmere Turning back to the fuel delivery issues, the Scottish government saysthere is no shortage of fuel in Scotlandand supplies are operating as normal. Ministers are however having urgent discussions with the sector and say they will support consumers however they can. Their comments came as long queues were seen outside some Scottish petrol stations on Friday afternoon. Drivers waited in line in Cambuslang, Port Glasgow and at Braehead Shopping Centre near Glasgow. Earlier UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the lorry driver shortage behind the fuel supply problem had been made worse by the pandemic, as well as systemic issues relating to pay and conditions. A further 35,623 people have tested positive for Covid in the UK, according to official government figures - slightly down on the 36,710 reported on Thursday but up from the 32,651 cases reported for the same day last week. There have also been a further 180 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded - taking the total by that measure to 135,983 since the pandemic began. A further 31,617 first doses and 44,817 second doses of coronavirus vaccines were given on Thursday. It means that more than 48.7 million people have received at least one dose, 89.6% of the UK population aged 16 and above. More than 44.6 million are now fully vaccinated - 82.1% of that group. A third of people with confirmed Covid in Wales in the past week were unvaccinated, according to new figures released by Public Health Wales (PHW). The figures also showed 99% of people who tested positive for Covid in the past week in Wales were under 60. Of these, 37% were unvaccinated. Nearly 13% of hospital patients with confirmed Covid were unvaccinated. PHW says vaccines have helped to keep Covid hospital numbers much lower during the third wave. Although 80% of patients have been double-dosed with a vaccine, public health officials say this is not evidence that the vaccine is not working - and they insist vaccines keep 95% of people out of hospital. Without this protection, the numbers in hospital would be far greater, they add.Here's what else the figures show. The council described the Zoom footage, recorded last year, as ""innocuous"" A New Zealand council's Zoom meeting recorded during a Covid-19 lockdown period last year has unexpectedly gone viral. The meeting of the Waipa District Council's finance and corporate committee has been viewed more than 290,000 times on YouTube as people use it to pretend to take part and avoid being disturbed. ""We're feeling famous,"" the council wrote on Twitter on Friday, adding: ""After inexplicably going viral on the internet... we're just as confused as you."" The footage, which runs for about one hour and 44 minutes and is described as ""innocuous"", discussesthe impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the nation's tourism industry,external. ""I have used this meeting six times now,"" writes one YouTuber. ""My wife asked why the person speaking has an accentâ¦ I'm in the  US,"" another commented. Other users included students who said they had played the footage to convince their parents they were studying from home. New Zealand was initially praised for its handling of the virus, but has since seen a slow roll-out of vaccines although it has been ramping up in recent days. A spike in Covid cases, attributed to the Delta variant, recently put large parts of the country back into lockdown. Readmore on this story here.

asked about the shortage of HGV drivers on Question Time, Transport Secretary
Grant Shapps said this was happening in other countries too. He said Poland had
a shortage of 123,000 drivers and Germany had a shortage of 60,000. According to data collected by Transport Intelligence, Poland was short of
123,842 drivers last year, while in Germany, between 45,000 and 60,000 were
needed. We
couldnât find more recent data, so we donât know how these figures compare with
the current estimate for the UK â from the Road Haulage Association â of a
shortage of about 100,000 drivers. In arecent interview with Trans.Info,external, Michael
Clover, Transport Intelligence's head of commercial development, pointed out
that driver shortages in Europe were not leading to empty shelves and said
Brexit was a factor. He
said driver vacancies in EU countries could be quickly filled by drivers from
neighbouring countries, and drivers didnât have to face checks at the
border [because these countries are in the EU single market, unlike the UK]. Shapps, on Question Time, blamed the impact of Covid for causing the HGV ""bottleneck"" â because testing centres to get licences had to close. He also
talked about systemic problems in the industry such as pay and conditions. Retailers are warning that significant disruption to Christmas preparations will be ""inevitable"" unless the government finds a solution to the HGV driver shortage in the next 10 days. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium (BRC), says: ""HGV drivers are the glue which hold our supply chains together.

Police arrest 39 as activists block Port of DoverQueues form at Europe's busiest ferry terminal as Insulate Britain shift their protest from the M25.,"Specialist teams worked to remove Insulate Britain protesters who glued themselves on top of a tanker Thirty nine people have been arrested after climate activists blocked Dover port, causing queues of vehicles attempting to cross the Channel. Insulate Britain, which has brought chaos on the M25 five times in the past fortnight, said more than 40 people had gathered. The Kent port - Europe's busiest ferry terminal -  said passengers should take extra time for their journeys. The main protest began at 08:20 BST and was cleared by police two hours later. One lane of the A20 remained blocked afterwards, as two protesters were sitting on top of a tanker with their hands glued to the vehicle. While she was on the tanker with her hand stuck to the railing, one protester who gave her first name as Stephanie said she did not want to be there. She said: ""I want to be home with my family spending time with them but if we don't do this they aren't going to have a future. ""The government are not doing enough. On the current trajectory we are heading for chaos."" Both Stephanie, 27, and her fellow protester Josh, 28, were later lifted down by police. Lorry drivers were held up by Insulate Britain protesters blocking the A20 Kent Police said the protest caused ""traffic disruption in Dover"", with queues forming on the A20 and the A2 approaching the port. All those detained on Friday were arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance and obstructing a highway, the force said. Police said all those arrested remained in custody on Friday afternoon, when roads were again clear. Police carried away a protester who was on top of a tanker Dover TAP, short for Traffic Assessment Project, was implemented by National Highways, due to the congestion. It enforces a 40mph speed restriction on the A20 approaching Dover, and lorry drivers heading for the port must remain in the left lane. The Port of Dover said at 11:21 BST that traffic had resumed and was flowing in and out of the site. Police officers removed a protester from the A20 in Kent The protest followed a court ruling won by the government which means climate change protesters can be jailed if they continue their campaign of blocking the M25. Hundreds of campaigners previously forced the closure of the motorway in parts of Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government would take further action. Hewrote on Twitter,external: ""We won't tolerate reckless behaviour on motorways or ports (Dover this morning). I'm therefore seeking a further injunction to prevent this disruption."" Later, the government confirmed a further injunction had been approved by the High Court to prevent protesters from occupying the A20 and strategic roads linked to the Port of Dover. Mr Shapps said: ""We are absolutely committed to protecting the right to peaceful protest, but it is unacceptable that people cannot go about their day-to-day businesses and that businesses, or critical supplies should be put on a knife's edge because of the reckless actions of a few protesters."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""The British public are rightly furious that the behaviours of a selfish minority have been putting lives at risk and causing untold disruption on our roads and now at Dover."" Protesters from Insulate Britain sit on top of a vehicle as they block the A20 in Kent Several drivers remonstrated with activists in Dover.

Police cleared the A20 of protesters after two hours Dover MP Natalie Elphicke called the protesters ""hooligans"".

US agrees deal to free detained Huawei boss - reportsChief financial officer Meng Wanzhou has been detained in Canada over US fraud charges since 2018.,"Meng Wanzhou (C) leaves British Columbia Supreme Court A Chinese technology executive held in Canada on US fraud charges has left the country after a deal with prosecutors, following years of diplomatic tensions over her fate. Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, was detained on fraud charges in December 2018 at the request of the US. On Friday, the US Department of Justice dropped an extradition request for her. The case infuriated China and strained relations with the US and Canada. It also prompted accusations that China had detained Canadian citizens in retaliation, which China denied. ""My life has been turned upside down. It was a disruptive time for me,"" Ms Meng told reporters after being freed from Canadian detention. ""Every cloud has a silver lining,"" she continued, adding: ""I will never forget all the good wishes I received from people around the world."" Shortly afterwards she boarded an Air China flight bound for the Chinese city of Shenzhen, AFP news agency reports. Meng Wanzhou is believed to have left Vancouver International Airport on this Air China flight bound for Shenzhen Details of a possible deal for Ms Meng's release have been the subject of intense negotiations between US and Chinese diplomats. The US alleged Ms Meng misled the bank HSBC over the true nature of Huawei's relationship with a company called Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Iran. On Friday the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement. This means the DOJ would hold off from prosecuting Ms Meng until December 2022. If she complied with conditions set by court, the case would eventually be dropped. The PowerPoint that sparked an international row Meng Wanzhou: Trapped in a gilded cage The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress The deal, which recommended she be released, allowed her to formally deny guilt for key charges while also acknowledging the allegations laid out by the Americans. Later on Friday, Canadian prosecutors told a court in Vancouver that they had withdrawn efforts to extradite her to the US and that she should be discharged from detention. She had been under house arrest in her multimillion-dollar Vancouver home for nearly three years. Ahead of the court appearance, Ms Meng was seen entering the building accompanied by Chinese consular officials. The judge subsequently ordered that she go free. As part of the deal, Ms Meng agreed to a ""statement of facts"" admitting that she knowingly made false statements to HSBC. The DOJ said Ms Meng had ""taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution"". The DOJ also said said it was continuing to prepare for trial against Huawei. For months there have been extensive behind-the-scenes contacts, with senior Huawei executives sent to Washington by the company to try to resolve a case which has fuelled international tension. For Huawei's boss, the issue has been deeply personal, with his daughter being held, but for the whole of China it has also turned into a major cause of anger. It has also poisoned relations between China and Canada, with the latter believing two of its citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been held as pawns in the negotiations. A deal has the ability to reduce some of the tensions that have emerged. But there will still be questions - what does the US gain out of it? And what kind of link might there be between events in North America and the status of the two Michaels in China? Ms Meng is the elder daughter of billionaire Ren Zhengfei, who set up Huawei in 1987. The company is now the largest telecom equipment maker in the world. He served in the Chinese army for nine years, until 1983, and is also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei has faced accusations that the Chinese authorities could use its equipment for espionage - allegations it denies. In 2019, the US imposed sanctions on Huawei and placed it on an export blacklist, cutting it off from key technologies. The UK, Sweden, Australia and Japan have also banned Huawei, while other countries including France and India have adopted measures stopping short of an outright ban. A few days after Ms Meng was arrested, China detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, on suspicion of spying. Critics have accused China of treating them as political bargaining chips, held as part of what is known as ""hostage diplomacy"". China denies this. Last month, a Chinese court convicted Michael Spavor, a businessman, of espionage and sentenced him to 11 years in prison. Canada condemned the sentence, saying his trial did not satisfy even the minimum standards required by international law. This video can not be played Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou as politically motivated Ms Meng's agreement with the US may pave the way for the two Canadians' release, but tensions in China-Canada relations will not quickly dissipate, experts say. The bilateral relationship has plunged to historic lows since Meng's arrest. The US charges against Huawei remain, and the company is still on a trade blacklist. Other Chinese tech companies with operations in the US, such as social media company TikTok, are also facing scrutiny. Chinese tech sector analyst Rui Ma told the BBC that many Chinese companies were hopeful that Ms Meng's deal with the US might mean no further deterioration of US-China relations, ""but no one is taking it to mean that there is a reversal in tensions"".

"Hunt for CCTV suspect in Sabina Nessa killingThe man was seen walking through Pegler Square, where a vigil is being held for the teacher later.London","This video can not be played Police want to speak to this man Detectives investigating the murder of Sabina Nessa are hunting a man seen on CCTV near the scene of her death. The 28-year-old was discovered in Cator Park in Kidbrooke, south-east London, by a member of the public on Saturday. Police say identifying the balding man, who was seen with something in his hands, could be ""vital"" to the case. Reclaim These Streets, set up after Sarah Everard's murder, held a vigil in Pegler Square - where the suspect was pictured - at 19:00 GMT. The wanted man, who was wearing grey jeans and a black jacket, can be seen looking over his shoulder and pulling up his hood as he walks along the pavement. A 38-year-old man who was arrested in south-east London on Thursday on suspicion of murdering the teacher was released earlier on Friday, the Met Police said. Sabina Nessa's post-mortem carried out on Monday was inconclusive Ahead of the vigil for Ms Nessa, her sister urged people to stay safe and to pray for her. Jebina Yasmin Islam said: ""We as a family are shocked at the murder of our sister, daughter and aunty to my girls. ""There are no words to describe how we are feeling as a family at the moment. We did not expect that something like this would ever happen to us."" Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Ms Nessa was attacked shortly after leaving her home in Astell Road at about 20:30 BST last Friday. She had been walking to meet a friend at The Depot bar, a journey that police said ""should have taken just over five minutes"". Her body was found the next day near a walkway in the park. Police have also released an image of a car they believe the wanted man had access to Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe said the force was not asking women to change their behaviour when going out at night. It comes after information sheets advising women on how to stay safe at night were handed out by a community group. ""It's really important to us that we don't ask women to change their behaviour,"" she said. ""Violence against women and girls is a priority for police across the UK but we're really conscious that women should be free to go about their lives without fear of abuse."" This video can not be played Tracing Sabina Nessa's final steps She added that violence against women had the ""hallmarks of an epidemic"". ""It is something that is tolerated far too much in society and we the police are determined to bring offenders to justice and to prevent these offences where we can,"" she said. She asked anyone with information about Ms Nessa's death to come forward. The Duchess of Cambridge has said her thoughts are with the family and friends of Ms Nessa and that she is ""saddened by the loss of another innocent young woman on our streets"". Ms Nessa was a teacher at Rushey Green primary school in Catford. The head, Lisa Williams, called her ""a brilliant teacher"" adding that she was ""kind, caring and absolutely dedicated to her pupils"". Have you been affected by this story?

Ministers meeting over petrol supply shortages,"Drivers have queued at some petrol stations, despite reassurances over supplies Ministers are working on plans for a temporary visa scheme to make it easier for foreign lorry drivers to come to the UK. Final details of exactly how the initiative will work are expected to be announced this weekend. Any changes to immigration rules will be temporary, with a cap on the number of workers allowed to enter the UK. The shortage of hauliers threatens more disruption to deliveries of petrol, food and other goods. It is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by the pandemic and Brexit. BP and Esso have shut a number of petrol stations due to a lack of tanker drivers, while EG Group has said it will introduce a limit of Â£30 per customer on all grades of fuel. The company, which operates 400 filling stations in the UK, said the move was due to the ""current unprecedented customer demand for fuel and associated supply challenges"". All of EG Group's UK sites remain open and operational to serve customers. HGV drivers and emergency services will be excluded from the Â£30 limit due to ""their vital role at this time"", according to the firm. ""This is a company decision to ensure all our customers have a fair chance to refuel and to enable our sites to carry on running smoothly,"" a spokesperson from the firm said. ""We kindly ask everyone visiting our sites to treat our colleagues, supply chain partners and customers with respect during these very challenging times."" A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""We have ample fuel stocks in this country and the public should be reassured there are no shortages. ""But like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary Covid-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country."" The spokesperson explained that ministers are looking at temporary measures to ""avoid any immediate problems"", but added that any measures introduced will be ""very strictly time limited"". ""We are moving to a high-wage, high-skilled economy and businesses will need to adapt with more investment in recruitment and training to provide long-term resilience,"" the spokesperson added. A sign outside a Tesco petrol station in Bracknell, Berkshire, on Friday The European Road Haulers Association said temporary visas would be a ""good idea"" but are ""only part of the solution"". The association said it is still easier to drive within the EU than driving between the EU and the UK, meaning that staying within the EU may still be more appealing for drivers. Despite reassurances, large queues formed at many petrol stations on Friday. On social media, people reported queues lasting for up to 30 minutes, while there were also reports of drivers filling jerry cans. Why is there a shortage of lorry drivers? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Are there problems at the forecourt you use? Send your pictures toyourpics@bbc.co.uk,externalorupload your pictures/video here The AA said that most of the UK's forecourts were working as they should. ""There is no shortage of fuel and thousands of forecourts are operating normally with just a few suffering temporary supply chain problems,"" said AA president Edmund King. ""Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts."" Mr King said drivers should not fill up outside their normal routines, because even if the occasional petrol station was temporarily closed, others just down the road would be open. ""This was a manageable problem,"" said. There are about 8,380 petrol stations in the UK, according to the Petrol Retailers Association. Of these, about 1% are believed to be closed at the moment. It is understood that about 50 to 100 BP forecourts are affected by shortages, while Esso said ""a small number"" of its Tesco Alliance retail sites had been hit. Allan Davison, managing director of Hoyer Petrolog UK - one of the country's leading fuel logistics companies and BP's transport contractor - told the BBC that European drivers should be offered temporary visas to help ease the situation. ""If this was a permanent request, I would understand the political and practical challenges with that, but it's not. It's a temporary request,"" he said. Helena Wright is part of family firm W's Transport, based in north Norfolk Helena Wright, transport manager for Norfolk-based firm W's Transport, told the BBC her company had sold two lorries after advertising for HGV drivers and not getting a single applicant. ""Normally we would have people on record to call who had left their details,"" she said. ""This is the first time for our firm that that's happened, but it's a problem that has been a long time coming. ""I've got a lot of drivers that are over the age of 50, 55 and looking to retire and we are not attractive as an industry for the younger generation."" She said younger people were not prepared to spend four to five nights a week away from home and were not ready to put up with ""inhumane"" conditions. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""The supply issues affecting a small number of petrol forecourts shouldn't impact the prices drivers pay to fill up. ""But unfortunately the price of oil, which has the biggest influence on what drivers pay at the pumps, is continuing to rise at the moment. This may lead to fuel prices going up in the coming days"" Supermarket Iceland - which is about 100 drivers short - joined Morrisons and Ocado in calling for the government to add HGV drivers tothe list of shortage occupations,external. That would allow foreign workers to apply for skilled worker visas to fill the current gaps. ""I think the solution - even if it's temporary - is very, very simple,"" said Iceland managing director Richard Walker. ""Let's get HGV drivers on to the skilled worker list."" The  UK's Road Haulage Association (RHA) said that on top of a historic shortage of drivers, the industry had lost 20,000 European drivers because of Brexit, while the pandemic had forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled. Ina recent RHA survey,externalof 616 hauliers, retiring colleagues and Brexit topped the list of reasons behind the driver shortages. Respondents also cited tax changes to rules known as IR35, which have made it more expensive for hauliers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK.

Petrol station shuts amid panic buying,"This video can not be played People should carry on buying petrol as normal, the UK government says Several supermarkets have closed petrol stations in Wales due to demand for fuel, amid panic buying. It comes despite assurances from the UK government that people shouldcarry on buying petrol as normal. Tesco and Sainsbury's both confirmed closures, but Tesco said it had a ""good availability"" with deliveries arriving every day. Asda had to close some stations to temporarily refuel to meet demand, but did not report any fuel shortages. Buy petrol as normal, says minister BP closes some sites due to lorry driver shortage Sainsbury's said its Thornhill store in Cardiff had shut on Friday afternoon, adding: ""All our sites are receiving more fuel and we'll reopen again as soon as possible."" A Tesco Extra petrol station on Cowbridge Road, in Bridgend, was also closed as of 12:00 BST on Friday and at a Tesco in Bridgend, diesel was not available and only two pumps out of eight on its forecourt were open to motorists. Cardiff Gate services off junction 30 of the M4 ran out of fuel at about 19:45 BST, according to Traffic Wales. The Asda petrol station at Leckwith, near Cardiff City FC Stadium, was closed on Friday evening to refuel after the increased demand. Traffic brought to a halt at Aberthaw as drivers try to fill up Sion Jones, of Valley Services, Llandysul in the Teifi Valley, said he would have to ""consider rationing fuel sales"" to customers if panic buying continues. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC the Army could be brought in to drive fuel tankers if it would help. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Wales Police appealed on Twitter for drivers to keep roads clear. ""We are aware of drivers queuing at petrol stations across South Wales,"" the force wrote. ""Keeping highways clear is essential for emergency services, & other public service functions, and hindering them poses a public safety risk."" Sainsbury's in Thornhill was closed on Friday afternoon Bus company Stagecoach South Wales also wrote on Twitter: ""All our services are experiencing severe delays due to traffic queues at petrol stations. We are working to maintain services."" Stagecoach apologised to passengers because it was unable to use the bus stop at Asda in Dowlais, Merthyr, due to the amount of vehicles queueing for fuel at the superstore. Cardiff Bus said in a statement: ""We would like to apologise for the current delays we are experiencing across our network. ""The roads are extremely busy due to the panic buying of fuel - we would like to thank you for your patience, our driver will be with you asap."" Queues were seen outside a garage in Dolgellau... It is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with gaps made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit. Outside Wales, some stations owned by BP and Esso-owned Tesco Alliance were shut on Thursday because of a lack of delivery drivers. Mr Jones is considering rationing fuel at the garage he works at Steve Coombe, of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ""There were no supply outages last week but there are some sites that are confirming delay in deliveries... they appear confined to London and the south-east [of England] and one or two in the Midlands, but they appear to be temporary in nature."" He added: ""Sometimes newspaper headlines can sensationalise... everyone keep calm, there is plenty of stock. ""Those sites that have had problems are getting their fuel replenished."" Motorists queued for fuel in Llanishen, Cardiff, on Friday Will Young, who queued for half an hour for petrol at Morrisons in Llanishen, said:  ""You could see it coming really because on the news yesterday, it said it's going to happen over the next couple of weeks. ""It's not my problem but it is a problem for people who use their cars for every day purposes like business and taking their children to school."" Tony Fundell, another shopper, told BBC Wales: ""I think people are panicking. I've got enough to last me a few days so I'll top up as and when I need it. ""I'm retired so I've got enough time on my hands but I feel sorry for those who are in business."" Sometimes newspaper headlines can sensationalise the issue, says the Petrol Retailers Association Chris Bird, director of C J Bird Transport in Llantrisant, told BBC Radio Wales that petrol panic buyers are ""creating their own problem"". ""If you don't need it, don't bother. Unfortunately as humans we tend to panic and be very selfish in these times,"" he said. He added that turning to European drivers to fix the HGV driver shortage is no solution. ""The eastern European drivers have been the band aid for the job for the last 10 years I would say. ""It's solvable, the market will find its feet, the wages will go up to a point where people will become more attracted to it."" Queues at Tesco on Western Avenue, Cardiff The Welsh government said: ""The shortage of HGV drivers is of significant concern as they are critical to effective and timely distribution of goods across the country. ""We are monitoring the situation very closely but responsibility lies with UK government and we continue to raise our concerns with them.""

"Protester, 82, prepared to go to jail over climateJudy Bruce from Swansea protests by sitting on motorways with members of the Insulate Britain group.Wales","Judy Bruce says she spends some of her time at protests ""de-escalating"", by explaining why the group are there An 82-year-old climate change protester says she is prepared to go to prison for blocking motorways. Judy Bruce, from Swansea, is a member of the Insulate Britain group, which has blocked parts of the M25 five times in the last fortnight. She said she had already spent three nights in custody but ""nothing has got the impact that disruption does"". Earlier this week police said the protests were putting drivers at a""very high risk of death"". On Thursday the UK governmentwon a court rulingagainst Insulate Britain, which wants the installation of heat-saving measures in social housing by 2025, and all homes by 2030. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted,externalthe activists faced ""possible imprisonment if they flout"" an injunction. Judy Bruce says Insulate Britain has ""the notice of the whole country"" Protesters have also targeted other motorways, including the M11 near Stansted Airport in Essex, and the M3 in Surrey. Ms Bruce said as well as well as sitting on the motorway she had been ""de-escalating"" by ""talking to angry drivers and explaining why we're doing it"". She said: ""[I've been] trying to help people who are really stuck with an urgent appointment, trying to get them to ring an ambulance which will always get through."" M25 protests: Protesters 'may cause serious injury or death' Air pollution: Even worse than we thought - WHO Climate change: UN warning over nations' climate plans She said she understood why they were angry, adding: ""If I was in a traffic jam, I'd be angry too. ""We've actually tried everything else... nothing has really got the impact that disruption does. ""We've got the notice of the whole country now and everybody is talking about it."" Judy Bruce, pictured left, wants the billions being spent on new roads and HS2 to be redirected to insulating homes When asked byBBC Radio Wales Breakfastif she was prepared to go to prison for protesting, she said: ""Well yes I am actually, and I've spent three evenings and into the early morning in police custody already - it is not very comfortable, I can tell you. ""But this is such a serious matter - I don't happen to have any children but other people are thinking of their grandchildren."" She said Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ""saying all the right things"" on climate change but ""not actually putting them into practice"", and called for the billions being spent on new roads and HS2 to be redirected to insulating homes. Mr Johnson has said the COP26 summit in Glasgow will be the""turning point for humanity"". The civil court action was taken by National Highways, the government body which runs motorways. In his High Court order, Mr Justice Lavender ruled it should last until 21 March, but there would be a hearing to review the situation on 5 October. The order covers every part of the M25 and the Dartford Crossing, including slip roads and bridges, and states demonstrators are banned from ""causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto"". Insulate Britain protesters blocking the A20 in Kent on Thursday morning The order means that breaching it could lead to a civil court hearing. In a statement, Insulate Britain said it would continue its protests and ""as soon as the government makes a meaningful statement that we can trust, we will leave the motorway"". During the recent protests, the government said it was ""investing Â£1.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures, and our upcoming Heat and Buildings Strategy will set out how we decarbonise the nation's homes in a way that is fair, practical and affordable"".

"Hillary Clinton installed as new QUB chancellorThe former presidential candidate describes the university as ""special"" during her speech.Northern Ireland","ï»¿The former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been installed as Queen's University's first female chancellor. Speaking at a ceremony on Friday, she described the university as ""special"". She said she was looking forward to ""learning much more about this university"" and ""helping to tell the university's exciting story"". The ceremony is being held at the end of the first week of the new academic year. Mrs Clinton said there was ""another reason"" she had ""agreed to become a member of this community"". ""Northern Ireland has become a symbol of democracy's power to transcend divisions and deliver peace, and we need that beacon of hope now more than ever,"" she said. ""But with hope comes responsibilities, the responsibility to be a citizen, to be willing to discuss and learn from people unlike yourselves. ""To debate and compromise in search of common ground to participate in our shared institutions, to respect the rights, dignity and needs of all people, and to uphold the rule of law."" Mrs Clinton used her speech to encourage people and politicians in Northern Ireland to work together to resolve ï»¿their differences over Brexit and dealing with the legacy of past violence. Speaking for 15 minutes, she also paid tribute tothe late Pat Hume, wife of former SDLP leader John Hume, and said ""peace is a process not an event"". This video can not be played 'The difficulties of the past continue to threaten the present' With her inauguration, Mrs Clinton became the university's 11th chancellor. She wasappointed in January 2020. But Mrs Clinton has not been able to visit the university in that capacity due to the coronavirus pandemic. The former US secretary of state has had an illustrious career serving as a US senator for New York and as first lady during her husband Bill's two terms as US president. She was also the losing Democratic Party candidate in the presidential election which saw Donald Trump come to power. During the ceremony, 14 figures from the worlds of business, politics, sport, the arts, policing and education were awarded honorary degrees.

China declares all Bitcoin transactions illegal,"China's central bank has announced that all transactions of crypto-currencies are illegal, effectively banning digital tokens such as Bitcoin. ""Virtual currency-related business activities are illegal financial activities,"" the People's Bank of China said, warning it ""seriously endangers the safety of people's assets"". China is one of the world's largest crypto-currency markets. Fluctuations there often impact the global price of crypto-currencies. The price of Bitcoin fell by more than $2,000 (Â£1,460) in the wake of the Chinese announcement. It is the latest in China's national crackdown on what it sees as a volatile, speculative investment at best - and a way to launder money at worst. The Texas Chinese bitcoin gold rush Bitcoin dives as China cracks down on crypto Trading crypto-currency has officially been banned in China since 2019, but has continued online through foreign exchanges. However, there has been a significant crackdown this year. In May,Chinese state intuitions warned buyersthey would have no protection for continuing to trade Bitcoin and other currencies online, as government officials vowed to increase pressure on the industry. In June,it told banks and payment platforms to stop facilitating transactionsand issued bans on ""mining"" the currencies - the trade of using powerful computers to make new coins. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? But Friday's announcement is the clearest indication yet that China wants to shut down crypto-currency trading in all its forms. The statement makes clear that those who are involved in ""illegal financial activities"" are committing a crime and will be prosecuted. And foreign websites providing such services to Chinese citizens online is also an illegal activity, it said. The technology at the core of many crypto-currencies, including Bitcoin, relies on many distributed computers verifying and checking transactions on a giant shared ledger known as the blockchain. As a reward, new ""coins"" are randomly awarded to those who take part in this work - known as crypto ""mining"". China, with its relatively low electricity costs and cheaper computer hardware, has long been one of the world's main centres for mining. The activity is so popular there that gamers have sometimes blamed the industry for a global shortage of powerful graphics cards, which miners use for processing crypto-currencies. The Chinese crackdown has already hit the mining industry. In September 2019, China accounted for 75% of the world's Bitcoin energy use. By April 2021,that had fallen to 46%.

Thousands of energy customers facing bill shocks,"Hundreds of thousands of people are facing uncertainty over their household energy bills after the collapse of suppliers in recent days. Customers are awaiting announcements by the regulator, Ofgem, about which surviving company will take on their supply and which tariff they must pay. Many will face the prospect of an annual bill hundreds of pounds higher than they had expected. Avro Energy and Green ceased trading on Wednesday, with others likely to fold. Those two firms were the latest to collapse, following a string of other failures of small providers in recent weeks. Avro and Green had 830,000 customers between them who are now waiting to be automatically switched to a new, potentially more expensive, provider. Daniel Cooke says he is worried about how he will cope with rising bills They include Daniel Cooke, from Taunton, who said: ""I am deeply concerned as a young family of five how we are going to cope with what could be a huge rise in cost when we are allocated a new energy supplier. ""Where we have boxed clever for the last few years with Avro energy we are now going to be punished over the next few months running into winter. ""I know there are millions of people trying to balance the books. If the bills go up we'll have to find extra money."" Ministers prepare for worst in gas price crisis Why are gas prices high and what's the energy price cap? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Under Ofgem rules, any customer of a collapsed firm is moved automatically to a new supplier which it appoints. The new provider is required to honour any credit a customer has built up in their energy account. It pays for that through an industry-wide levy, which itself is likely to add to every customer's bill. The new provider must also pay any credit that is owed to a customer who recently switched away, but has not yet been refunded their overpayments. That process can take a few weeks, and customers are advised to wait until they are contacted by their new supplier before doing anything. While continuation of their supply is guaranteed, their tariff - in other words, the price they pay - is not. Customers of collapsed firms will be placed on a new dedicated tariff by their new supplier for those in the same position. It is likely to be priced in line with Ofgem's price cap. An Avro customer in a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity, who got a fixed rate deal in August, would have been paying Â£1,087 a year, according to price comparison site Uswitch. In March, they could have got a deal costing Â£920 a year. Now Avro has collapsed, they are likely to be paying Â£1,277 a year at their new supplier from 1 October, in line with Ofgem's price cap. The price cap does not mean it is impossible to pay more than Â£1,277 a year. It is a cap on the price, not the final bill. So, a household with heavy energy use will have a higher annual bill. Once switched to the new supplier, they are free to move to a different supplier. However, it is basically impossible to find a better deal at the moment as suppliers grapple with the rapidly increasing cost of wholesale gas. The same problem faces customers of surviving energy firms who are coming to the end of their fixed rate term. When that expires, they are automatically shifted on the supplier's more expensive standard rate, which will be at the price cap level. They, too, will be unable to find a better deal at present. There could also be complications for pre-payment meter customers who are automatically switched. Peter Smith, from National Energy Action, which lobbies for action for warm and dry homes, said: ""We are very concerned about legacy pre-payment customers, people in debt and those eligible for energy discounts who may miss out when they transfer over to their new suppliers. ""The government and Ofgem's key urgent priority must be to ensure vulnerable households are protected when their supplier fails."" Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here. How much are energy bills going up?

Police arrest 39 as activists block Port of Dover,"Specialist teams worked to remove Insulate Britain protesters who glued themselves on top of a tanker Thirty nine people have been arrested after climate activists blocked Dover port, causing queues of vehicles attempting to cross the Channel. Insulate Britain, which has brought chaos on the M25 five times in the past fortnight, said more than 40 people had gathered. The Kent port - Europe's busiest ferry terminal -  said passengers should take extra time for their journeys. The main protest began at 08:20 BST and was cleared by police two hours later. One lane of the A20 remained blocked afterwards, as two protesters were sitting on top of a tanker with their hands glued to the vehicle. While she was on the tanker with her hand stuck to the railing, one protester who gave her first name as Stephanie said she did not want to be there. She said: ""I want to be home with my family spending time with them but if we don't do this they aren't going to have a future. ""The government are not doing enough. On the current trajectory we are heading for chaos."" Both Stephanie, 27, and her fellow protester Josh, 28, were later lifted down by police. Lorry drivers were held up by Insulate Britain protesters blocking the A20 Kent Police said the protest caused ""traffic disruption in Dover"", with queues forming on the A20 and the A2 approaching the port. All those detained on Friday were arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance and obstructing a highway, the force said. Police said all those arrested remained in custody on Friday afternoon, when roads were again clear. Police carried away a protester who was on top of a tanker Dover TAP, short for Traffic Assessment Project, was implemented by National Highways, due to the congestion. It enforces a 40mph speed restriction on the A20 approaching Dover, and lorry drivers heading for the port must remain in the left lane. The Port of Dover said at 11:21 BST that traffic had resumed and was flowing in and out of the site. Police officers removed a protester from the A20 in Kent The protest followed a court ruling won by the government which means climate change protesters can be jailed if they continue their campaign of blocking the M25. Hundreds of campaigners previously forced the closure of the motorway in parts of Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government would take further action. Hewrote on Twitter,external: ""We won't tolerate reckless behaviour on motorways or ports (Dover this morning). I'm therefore seeking a further injunction to prevent this disruption."" Later, the government confirmed a further injunction had been approved by the High Court to prevent protesters from occupying the A20 and strategic roads linked to the Port of Dover. Mr Shapps said: ""We are absolutely committed to protecting the right to peaceful protest, but it is unacceptable that people cannot go about their day-to-day businesses and that businesses, or critical supplies should be put on a knife's edge because of the reckless actions of a few protesters."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""The British public are rightly furious that the behaviours of a selfish minority have been putting lives at risk and causing untold disruption on our roads and now at Dover."" Protesters from Insulate Britain sit on top of a vehicle as they block the A20 in Kent Several drivers remonstrated with activists in Dover.

Ministers to meet over petrol supply problem,"Drivers have queued at some petrol stations, despite reassurances over supplies Ministers are working on plans for a temporary visa scheme to make it easier for foreign lorry drivers to come to the UK. Final details of exactly how the initiative will work are expected to be announced this weekend. Any changes to immigration rules will be temporary, with a cap on the number of workers allowed to enter the UK. The shortage of hauliers threatens more disruption to deliveries of petrol, food and other goods. It is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by the pandemic and Brexit. BP and Esso have shut a number of petrol stations due to a lack of tanker drivers, while EG Group has said it will introduce a limit of Â£30 per customer on all grades of fuel. The company, which operates 400 filling stations in the UK, said the move was due to the ""current unprecedented customer demand for fuel and associated supply challenges"". All of EG Group's UK sites remain open and operational to serve customers. HGV drivers and emergency services will be excluded from the Â£30 limit due to ""their vital role at this time"", according to the firm. ""This is a company decision to ensure all our customers have a fair chance to refuel and to enable our sites to carry on running smoothly,"" a spokesperson from the firm said. ""We kindly ask everyone visiting our sites to treat our colleagues, supply chain partners and customers with respect during these very challenging times."" A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""We have ample fuel stocks in this country and the public should be reassured there are no shortages. ""But like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary Covid-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country."" The spokesperson explained that ministers are looking at temporary measures to ""avoid any immediate problems"", but added that any measures introduced will be ""very strictly time limited"". ""We are moving to a high-wage, high-skilled economy and businesses will need to adapt with more investment in recruitment and training to provide long-term resilience,"" the spokesperson added. A sign outside a Tesco petrol station in Bracknell, Berkshire, on Friday The European Road Haulers Association said temporary visas would be a ""good idea"" but are ""only part of the solution"". The association said it is still easier to drive within the EU than driving between the EU and the UK, meaning that staying within the EU may still be more appealing for drivers. Despite reassurances, large queues formed at many petrol stations on Friday. On social media, people reported queues lasting for up to 30 minutes, while there were also reports of drivers filling jerry cans. Why is there a shortage of lorry drivers? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Are there problems at the forecourt you use? Send your pictures toyourpics@bbc.co.uk,externalorupload your pictures/video here The AA said that most of the UK's forecourts were working as they should. ""There is no shortage of fuel and thousands of forecourts are operating normally with just a few suffering temporary supply chain problems,"" said AA president Edmund King. ""Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts."" Mr King said drivers should not fill up outside their normal routines, because even if the occasional petrol station was temporarily closed, others just down the road would be open. ""This was a manageable problem,"" said. There are about 8,380 petrol stations in the UK, according to the Petrol Retailers Association. Of these, about 1% are believed to be closed at the moment. It is understood that about 50 to 100 BP forecourts are affected by shortages, while Esso said ""a small number"" of its Tesco Alliance retail sites had been hit. Allan Davison, managing director of Hoyer Petrolog UK - one of the country's leading fuel logistics companies and BP's transport contractor - told the BBC that European drivers should be offered temporary visas to help ease the situation. ""If this was a permanent request, I would understand the political and practical challenges with that, but it's not. It's a temporary request,"" he said. Helena Wright is part of family firm W's Transport, based in north Norfolk Helena Wright, transport manager for Norfolk-based firm W's Transport, told the BBC her company had sold two lorries after advertising for HGV drivers and not getting a single applicant. ""Normally we would have people on record to call who had left their details,"" she said. ""This is the first time for our firm that that's happened, but it's a problem that has been a long time coming. ""I've got a lot of drivers that are over the age of 50, 55 and looking to retire and we are not attractive as an industry for the younger generation."" She said younger people were not prepared to spend four to five nights a week away from home and were not ready to put up with ""inhumane"" conditions. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""The supply issues affecting a small number of petrol forecourts shouldn't impact the prices drivers pay to fill up. ""But unfortunately the price of oil, which has the biggest influence on what drivers pay at the pumps, is continuing to rise at the moment. This may lead to fuel prices going up in the coming days"" Supermarket Iceland - which is about 100 drivers short - joined Morrisons and Ocado in calling for the government to add HGV drivers tothe list of shortage occupations,external. That would allow foreign workers to apply for skilled worker visas to fill the current gaps. ""I think the solution - even if it's temporary - is very, very simple,"" said Iceland managing director Richard Walker. ""Let's get HGV drivers on to the skilled worker list."" The  UK's Road Haulage Association (RHA) said that on top of a historic shortage of drivers, the industry had lost 20,000 European drivers because of Brexit, while the pandemic had forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled. Ina recent RHA survey,externalof 616 hauliers, retiring colleagues and Brexit topped the list of reasons behind the driver shortages. Respondents also cited tax changes to rules known as IR35, which have made it more expensive for hauliers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK.

Hospitality staff set to keep all their tipsThe government is set to make it illegal for hospitality bosses to withhold tips from their workers.Business,"Restaurant, cafÃ© and pub bosses are set to be banned from keeping tips left for staff by customers in Britain. The government plans to make it illegal for hospitality firms to withhold tips from workers, who often rely on them to top up their income. Labour Markets Minister Paul Scully said the plans would ""ensure tips will go to those who worked for it"". If an employer breaks the new rules they can be taken to an employment tribunal. In that instance, bosses may be forced to compensate workers or face fines. In a statement, the Department for Business said that the new legislation would help about two million people working in the hospitality industry. It is expected to come into force within the next year. But it comes some time after the practice was reported to have taken place at High Street chains such asPizza Express, Cote Brasserie and Bill's. In 2015, the restaurants were accused of keeping tips or charging 10% ""administrative costs"" on processing the service charge payments if they were made by debit or credit card. Although they denied any wrongdoing, the reports drew a huge backlash from unions and the public. Bullying culture and low pay blamed for staff shortage Should you tip the takeaway delivery driver? Restaurants offer perks to beat staffing crisis Conservative MP Paul Scully said on Tuesday: ""Unfortunately, some companies choose to withhold cash from hardworking staff who have been tipped by customers as a reward for good service. ""Our plans will make this illegal and ensure tips will go to those who worked for it"". He added that the move would also reassure customers that their money is going to ""those who deserve it"". Ministers also pointed towards research that suggests most tips are now paid by card in the UK, rather than in cash. Currently, businesses who receive tips by card have the choice of whether to keep it or pass it on to workers. Cash tips, on the other hand, are legally the property of staff. Fewer tips are being paid in cash due to the rise in contactless payments As well as requiring all employers to pass on all tips, service charges and gratuities in full without any deductions, the new legislation will introduce a code of practice, which will set out exactly how tips should be distributed fairly. Workers will also get the right to request information on their boss's tipping record, in case they want to bring a claim to an employment tribunal. While the move was welcomed by the Living Wage Foundation, it said that the focus should be on improving wages in lower-paid sectors instead. Its interim director, Graham Griffiths, said: ""If this work is to be truly valued we need to see more people lifted onto a real Living Wage. ""To build a stronger and more dynamic economy, our focus should be on increasing the number of businesses doing the right thing and committing to pay a Living Wage"". Kate Nicholls, UKHospitality chief executive, added the new rules would strengthen the sector's ability to create jobs. But she pointed out: ""For hospitality businesses, though, customers tipping with a card incurs bank charges for the business, and many also employ external partners to ensure tips are fairly distributed among staff. ""With restaurants, pubs and other venues struggling to get back on their feet... we urge the government to continue to work closely with the sector as it introduces this legislation to ensure this works for businesses and employees.""

Thousands of energy customers facing bill shocksPeople are awaiting decisions by the regulator about which surviving company will take on their supply.Business,"Hundreds of thousands of people are facing uncertainty over their household energy bills after the collapse of suppliers in recent days. Customers are awaiting announcements by the regulator, Ofgem, about which surviving company will take on their supply and which tariff they must pay. Many will face the prospect of an annual bill hundreds of pounds higher than they had expected. Avro Energy and Green ceased trading on Wednesday, with others likely to fold. Those two firms were the latest to collapse, following a string of other failures of small providers in recent weeks. Avro and Green had 830,000 customers between them who are now waiting to be automatically switched to a new, potentially more expensive, provider. Daniel Cooke says he is worried about how he will cope with rising bills They include Daniel Cooke, from Taunton, who said: ""I am deeply concerned as a young family of five how we are going to cope with what could be a huge rise in cost when we are allocated a new energy supplier. ""Where we have boxed clever for the last few years with Avro energy we are now going to be punished over the next few months running into winter. ""I know there are millions of people trying to balance the books. If the bills go up we'll have to find extra money."" Ministers prepare for worst in gas price crisis Why are gas prices high and what's the energy price cap? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Under Ofgem rules, any customer of a collapsed firm is moved automatically to a new supplier which it appoints. The new provider is required to honour any credit a customer has built up in their energy account. It pays for that through an industry-wide levy, which itself is likely to add to every customer's bill. The new provider must also pay any credit that is owed to a customer who recently switched away, but has not yet been refunded their overpayments. That process can take a few weeks, and customers are advised to wait until they are contacted by their new supplier before doing anything. While continuation of their supply is guaranteed, their tariff - in other words, the price they pay - is not. Customers of collapsed firms will be placed on a new dedicated tariff by their new supplier for those in the same position. It is likely to be priced in line with Ofgem's price cap. An Avro customer in a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity, who got a fixed rate deal in August, would have been paying Â£1,087 a year, according to price comparison site Uswitch. In March, they could have got a deal costing Â£920 a year. Now Avro has collapsed, they are likely to be paying Â£1,277 a year at their new supplier from 1 October, in line with Ofgem's price cap. The price cap does not mean it is impossible to pay more than Â£1,277 a year. It is a cap on the price, not the final bill. So, a household with heavy energy use will have a higher annual bill. Once switched to the new supplier, they are free to move to a different supplier. However, it is basically impossible to find a better deal at the moment as suppliers grapple with the rapidly increasing cost of wholesale gas. The same problem faces customers of surviving energy firms who are coming to the end of their fixed rate term. When that expires, they are automatically shifted on the supplier's more expensive standard rate, which will be at the price cap level. They, too, will be unable to find a better deal at present. There could also be complications for pre-payment meter customers who are automatically switched. Peter Smith, from National Energy Action, which lobbies for action for warm and dry homes, said: ""We are very concerned about legacy pre-payment customers, people in debt and those eligible for energy discounts who may miss out when they transfer over to their new suppliers. ""The government and Ofgem's key urgent priority must be to ensure vulnerable households are protected when their supplier fails."" Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here. How much are energy bills going up?

Hillary Clinton installed as new QUB chancellor,"ï»¿The former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been installed as Queen's University's first female chancellor. Speaking at a ceremony on Friday, she described the university as ""special"". She said she was looking forward to ""learning much more about this university"" and ""helping to tell the university's exciting story"". The ceremony is being held at the end of the first week of the new academic year. Mrs Clinton said there was ""another reason"" she had ""agreed to become a member of this community"". ""Northern Ireland has become a symbol of democracy's power to transcend divisions and deliver peace, and we need that beacon of hope now more than ever,"" she said. ""But with hope comes responsibilities, the responsibility to be a citizen, to be willing to discuss and learn from people unlike yourselves. ""To debate and compromise in search of common ground to participate in our shared institutions, to respect the rights, dignity and needs of all people, and to uphold the rule of law."" Mrs Clinton used her speech to encourage people and politicians in Northern Ireland to work together to resolve ï»¿their differences over Brexit and dealing with the legacy of past violence. Speaking for 15 minutes, she also paid tribute tothe late Pat Hume, wife of former SDLP leader John Hume, and said ""peace is a process not an event"". This video can not be played 'The difficulties of the past continue to threaten the present' With her inauguration, Mrs Clinton became the university's 11th chancellor. She wasappointed in January 2020. But Mrs Clinton has not been able to visit the university in that capacity due to the coronavirus pandemic. The former US secretary of state has had an illustrious career serving as a US senator for New York and as first lady during her husband Bill's two terms as US president. She was also the losing Democratic Party candidate in the presidential election which saw Donald Trump come to power. During the ceremony, 14 figures from the worlds of business, politics, sport, the arts, policing and education were awarded honorary degrees. These include Derry Girls writer and creator Lisa McGee, former Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Sir George Hamilton, and international hockey player Shirley McCay. Speaking ahead of the event, Mrs Clinton said she was pleased to be in Belfast. ""I am proud of my longstanding connection with Northern Ireland and its people and look forward to continuing to make my contribution to the university over the next few years,"" she said. Prof Ian Greer, Queen's president and vice-chancellor, said Mrs Clinton had an ""enormous amount"" to offer the university and would continue to work as a ""key advocate for Queen's on the international stage"". A number of protesters gathered outside the university on Friday morning as Mrs Clinton arrived, chanting ""shame on Queen's"". They were protesting against the United States' foreign policy. Protesters gathered at Queen's as Mrs Clinton arrived The majority of students at Northern Irish universities spent the 2020/21 academic year taking their degree courses online. The university is also making a special posthumous award to recognise the public service achievements of Norman Houston, director of the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington for more than 12 years, who died in January. During the ceremony, the university, with support from the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington, will announce an annual Norman Houston Study Northern Ireland Scholarship which will support a US student studying at Queen's.

Police arrest 17 as activists block Port of Dover,"Specialist teams worked to remove Insulate Britain protesters who glued themselves on top of a tanker Thirty nine people have been arrested after climate activists blocked Dover port, causing queues of vehicles attempting to cross the Channel. Insulate Britain, which has brought chaos on the M25 five times in the past fortnight, said more than 40 people had gathered. The Kent port - Europe's busiest ferry terminal -  said passengers should take extra time for their journeys. The main protest began at 08:20 BST and was cleared by police two hours later. One lane of the A20 remained blocked afterwards, as two protesters were sitting on top of a tanker with their hands glued to the vehicle. While she was on the tanker with her hand stuck to the railing, one protester who gave her first name as Stephanie said she did not want to be there. She said: ""I want to be home with my family spending time with them but if we don't do this they aren't going to have a future. ""The government are not doing enough. On the current trajectory we are heading for chaos."" Both Stephanie, 27, and her fellow protester Josh, 28, were later lifted down by police. Lorry drivers were held up by Insulate Britain protesters blocking the A20 Kent Police said the protest caused ""traffic disruption in Dover"", with queues forming on the A20 and the A2 approaching the port. All those detained on Friday were arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance and obstructing a highway, the force said. Police said all those arrested remained in custody on Friday afternoon, when roads were again clear. Police carried away a protester who was on top of a tanker Dover TAP, short for Traffic Assessment Project, was implemented by National Highways, due to the congestion. It enforces a 40mph speed restriction on the A20 approaching Dover, and lorry drivers heading for the port must remain in the left lane. The Port of Dover said at 11:21 BST that traffic had resumed and was flowing in and out of the site. Police officers removed a protester from the A20 in Kent The protest followed a court ruling won by the government which means climate change protesters can be jailed if they continue their campaign of blocking the M25. Hundreds of campaigners previously forced the closure of the motorway in parts of Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government would take further action. Hewrote on Twitter,external: ""We won't tolerate reckless behaviour on motorways or ports (Dover this morning). I'm therefore seeking a further injunction to prevent this disruption."" Later, the government confirmed a further injunction had been approved by the High Court to prevent protesters from occupying the A20 and strategic roads linked to the Port of Dover. Mr Shapps said: ""We are absolutely committed to protecting the right to peaceful protest, but it is unacceptable that people cannot go about their day-to-day businesses and that businesses, or critical supplies should be put on a knife's edge because of the reckless actions of a few protesters."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""The British public are rightly furious that the behaviours of a selfish minority have been putting lives at risk and causing untold disruption on our roads and now at Dover."" Protesters from Insulate Britain sit on top of a vehicle as they block the A20 in Kent Several drivers remonstrated with activists in Dover. Insulate Britain also held a demonstration outside the Home Office's Westminster headquarters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ch Supt Simon Thompson, from Kent Police, thanked people affected for their patience, and said: ""The impact this disruption had on the local community and port-bound traffic is not lost on us."" Police cleared the A20 of protesters after two hours Dover MP Natalie Elphicke called the protesters ""hooligans"". Writing on Twitter, she added: ""The port is the vital artery of our nation's trade - about one-fifth of all trade comes through Dover.

Insulate Britain protesters blocked the A20 in Kent The Port of Dover handles 17% of the UK's trade in goods. It was used by an average of 6,200 road haulage vehicles every day last year. Doug Bannister, chief executive of the port, said it ""implemented its tried and tested resilience plans in order to deal with the impact of the protest"".

Vet unfairly dismissed by Department of Agriculture,"Vet says she raised concerns about overloaded and unclean pens, and lame sheep and cattle A whistleblower vet who raised ""serious"" concerns about animals' welfare has won her case against the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera). Dr Tamara Bronckaers told an industrial tribunal she felt she had to resign. She said she resigned after being ""excluded, ignored and undermined"" when she brought issues to the department's attention. Dr Bronckaers worked for Daera for nearly two decades until April 2018. In the course of her work, she found breaches of animal welfare at livestock markets. She also uncovered failures in the way the movement of cattle was recorded at markets, and the abuse of a process called ""deleted moves"". That, Dr Bronckaers claimed, could affect the traceability of meat within the food supply chain and have an impact on the spread of disease in cattle, in particular tuberculosis. Employment tribunal backlog 'hugely significant' Balmoral Show returns with new Covid entry rules ""Animal welfare was a major concern for me and I witnessed first-hand animals suffering unnecessarily - in one livestock market, there were overloaded and unclean pens, lame sheep and cattle, and animals being left overnight without food or water,"" she said. She added: ""I suspect that over the past five years in excess of 25,000 animals have been involved in deleted moves, resulting not only in issues around animal welfare but also detrimental implications for traceability within the supply chain."" Dr Bronckaers' solicitor John McShane said she had tried to raise her concerns with the department. ""Whenever those representations, those concerns, through a period of over a year, had been forcefully put forward, the line from the department was simply to ignore it,"" he said. ""To present Dr Bronckaer as being a nuisance, to humiliate her, to denigrate her, and to ultimately leave her in a position where she felt no option but to resign from her employment of nearly 20 years and all the financial implications of that, and the distress to her and also her family."" The tribunal concluded that Dr Bronckaers had been unfairly dismissed.

It's after a small number were affected because of a shortage of HGV drivers. Some people have posted pictures of queues forming near forecourts. Ifan Morgan Jones, who took the first photo below, told the BBC he had never seen a petrol queue as long in Dolgellau, Wales. But the government says refineries have ""plenty of petrol"" and drivers should carry on as normal. And the AA says most of the UK's forecourts are working as they should. AA president Edmund King said: ""Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts, as drivers either combine filling up with shopping runs, prepare for weekend trips or refuel for the start of the new working week."" Dolgellau in Wales Costco, Lakeside Sainsburyâs Ashford Kent New Chester Road, Tranmere Turning back to the fuel delivery issues, the Scottish government saysthere is no shortage of fuel in Scotlandand supplies are operating as normal. Ministers are however having urgent discussions with the sector and say they will support consumers however they can. Their comments came as long queues were seen outside some Scottish petrol stations on Friday afternoon. Drivers waited in line in Cambuslang, Port Glasgow and at Braehead Shopping Centre near Glasgow. Earlier UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the lorry driver shortage behind the fuel supply problem had been made worse by the pandemic, as well as systemic issues relating to pay and conditions. A further 35,623 people have tested positive for Covid in the UK, according to official government figures - slightly down on the 36,710 reported on Thursday but up from the 32,651 cases reported for the same day last week. There have also been a further 180 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded - taking the total by that measure to 135,983 since the pandemic began. A further 31,617 first doses and 44,817 second doses of coronavirus vaccines were given on Thursday. It means that more than 48.7 million people have received at least one dose, 89.6% of the UK population aged 16 and above. More than 44.6 million are now fully vaccinated - 82.1% of that group. A third of people with confirmed Covid in Wales in the past week were unvaccinated, according to new figures released by Public Health Wales (PHW). The figures also showed 99% of people who tested positive for Covid in the past week in Wales were under 60. Of these, 37% were unvaccinated. Nearly 13% of hospital patients with confirmed Covid were unvaccinated. PHW says vaccines have helped to keep Covid hospital numbers much lower during the third wave. Although 80% of patients have been double-dosed with a vaccine, public health officials say this is not evidence that the vaccine is not working - and they insist vaccines keep 95% of people out of hospital. Without this protection, the numbers in hospital would be far greater, they add.Here's what else the figures show. The council described the Zoom footage, recorded last year, as ""innocuous"" A New Zealand council's Zoom meeting recorded during a Covid-19 lockdown period last year has unexpectedly gone viral. The meeting of the Waipa District Council's finance and corporate committee has been viewed more than 290,000 times on YouTube as people use it to pretend to take part and avoid being disturbed. ""We're feeling famous,"" the council wrote on Twitter on Friday, adding: ""After inexplicably going viral on the internet... we're just as confused as you."" The footage, which runs for about one hour and 44 minutes and is described as ""innocuous"", discussesthe impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the nation's tourism industry,external. ""I have used this meeting six times now,"" writes one YouTuber. ""My wife asked why the person speaking has an accentâ¦ I'm in the  US,"" another commented. Other users included students who said they had played the footage to convince their parents they were studying from home. New Zealand was initially praised for its handling of the virus, but has since seen a slow roll-out of vaccines although it has been ramping up in recent days. A spike in Covid cases, attributed to the Delta variant, recently put large parts of the country back into lockdown. Readmore on this story here.

asked about the shortage of HGV drivers on Question Time, Transport Secretary
Grant Shapps said this was happening in other countries too. He said Poland had
a shortage of 123,000 drivers and Germany had a shortage of 60,000. According to data collected by Transport Intelligence, Poland was short of
123,842 drivers last year, while in Germany, between 45,000 and 60,000 were
needed. We
couldnât find more recent data, so we donât know how these figures compare with
the current estimate for the UK â from the Road Haulage Association â of a
shortage of about 100,000 drivers. In arecent interview with Trans.Info,external, Michael
Clover, Transport Intelligence's head of commercial development, pointed out
that driver shortages in Europe were not leading to empty shelves and said
Brexit was a factor. He
said driver vacancies in EU countries could be quickly filled by drivers from
neighbouring countries, and drivers didnât have to face checks at the
border [because these countries are in the EU single market, unlike the UK]. Shapps, on Question Time, blamed the impact of Covid for causing the HGV ""bottleneck"" â because testing centres to get licences had to close. He also
talked about systemic problems in the industry such as pay and conditions. Retailers are warning that significant disruption to Christmas preparations will be ""inevitable"" unless the government finds a solution to the HGV driver shortage in the next 10 days. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium (BRC), says: ""HGV drivers are the glue which hold our supply chains together. ""Without them, we are unable to move goods from farms to warehouses to shops. ""Currently, the UK faces a shortfall of around 90,000 HGV drivers and it is consumers who ultimately suffer the consequences. ""Unless a solution can be found in the next 10 days, it is inevitable that we will see significant disruption in the run up to Christmas."" We've got a bit more travel news now. Passengers journeying to Jersey from any country will no longer have to isolate or test on arrival if they can produce a negative Covid PCR test. This new rule -accepting negative pre-departure tests from all countries- comes into effect on Tuesday, the government of Jersey has announced. Previously only negative PCR tests from the UK were accepted. A pre-departure form will still be required, plus evidence of a negative test result. The test must have been conducted within 72 hours of departure. As we reported earlier, Scottish ministers have agreed to bring the nation in line with the UK government over international travel testing. Now the Northern Ireland Executive hasdecided to change the rulesthere to bring them in line with the rest of the UK. Ministers agreed to remove the requirement for pre-departure testing for fully vaccinated arrivals from non-red list countries. This change will come into force at 04:00 BST on 4 October. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There have been Covid outbreaks in two Chinese provinces in the last couple of weeks, and fears of a more widespread outbreak ahead of a major travel period next month. One district in the Chinese city of Xiamen is offering people cash rewards if they report people they believe havenât been tested for Covid-19. According tothe national Global Times newspaper,external, Tongan District in Xiamen, Fujian province, is offering 1,000 yuan (Â£113) rewards to residents if they tip off the authorities. People have been warned that they could be denied entry to various public places if they do not comply with testing drives, or even face criminal punishment. Xiamen is one of four cities in Fujian province that has confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the last couple of weeks.There have been more than 400 confirmed cases in Fujian since 11 September,external, a quarter of which are in children. Whenever cases of Covid-19 are identified in Chinese towns or cities, large-scale testing drives are ordered to identify any symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Xiamen, which has a population of five million people,has carried out four rounds of city-wide testing.,external The city is hopeful that it can curb its outbreak by the Golden Week holiday commencing on 1 October, and the second biggest travel period after the Lunar New Year. Media outlets have warned that peopleâs travel plans may be disrupted at a provincial level if regions donât get their case numbers down to zero. Last week, the Ministry of Culture said âtrans-provincial group tours, air tickets and hotel reservation servicesâ must be âimmediatelyâ suspended within affected provinces if cases of Covid-19 force areas into lockdown. A public health official for two English districts with high rates of Covid-19 said she ""supports"" the return of face coverings in secondary schools. At least four schools in Corby and two in Kettering, both in Northamptonshire, have asked for masks in communal areas. Kettering has the second-highest case rate in England, while Corby has the third. The county's director of public health, Lucy Wightman, says: ""If you have case rates as high as we've seen, why would people not take those precautions to try and reduce risk to them and that disruption to education and the risk to the wider population?"" At the start of term, schools in England were advised face coverings were no longer routinely needed for staff or pupils, although they were still recommended in crowded spaces such as on school buses. But the Department for Education said schools could temporarily reintroduce bubble groups and face masks in communal spaces inareas with higher Covid rates. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Could England's run to the Euro 2020 championships final have helped increase immunity? People in Scotland are twice as likely as those in England
to test positive for Covid at the moment. One in 45 people test positive north of the border compared
with one in 90 below it. But why and will the rest of the UK follow Scotlandâs lead? There are no clear answers. There could be differences in
levels of immunity in the two countries due to the spread of the virus in
previous waves. Even the England football teamâs run to the finals of the
Euros, which did help Covid spread, could have topped up immunity. Differences in the schooling system â schools in Scotland go
back in mid-August rather than early September â could also have an impact. Understanding the difference could help us figure out what
is going to happen in the months to come as there is still considerable
uncertainty about how tough this winter is going to be. Covid infections in England are now highest among school age children, according to the Office for National Statistics, with secondary school children the worst affected. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), says the higher case numbers in that age group will be partly down to more testing among school children. âSome of this is a genuine rise in cases in that age group and some of it is that youâre finding cases because youâre looking for them,â he tells BBC Radio 4âs The World at One. He says âadults are infecting children more than children are infecting adultsâ, and warns there could be a spike among young adults âcoming upâ as students start university. âThe people we need to most urgently pay attention to are the young adults who socialise a lot, many of whom are still not immunised. Thatâs where weâre going to see most transmission going on in the coming weeks and months,â he says. âThe universities really need to give every opportunity they can to students coming in to make it easy and convenient.â  The Scottish government will bring Covidtesting for travellers returning from abroad into line with the rest of the UK. Tests before departure will no longer be required for those who are fully vaccinated. It is not yet known when the change will take effect. Scottish ministers also said they ""intend to align with the UK post-arrival testing regime"" but details of this have still be finalised. This includes whether a a PCR or lateral flow test will be required within two days of arriving home. A shortage of HGV drivers in the UK is not a Brexit issue, says a member of the transport committee. Conservative MP Greg Smith told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""This isn't a Brexit issue. If it was a Brexit issue then everyone in the European Union would be just fine and have as many HGV drivers as they need and we know that's not true. We know Germany, we know Poland have as bigger problem as the UK does if not slightly bigger."" He says: ""It's perfectly natural thing to look at to say there's a shortage of HGV drivers as there clearly is and we can't fill that gap from the domestic market then we should look at increasing the number of points you get for holding an HGV licence for being able to come here and work in that sector either on a permanent footing or a temporary measure."" We've been reporting on a lorry driver shortage in the UK which has been exacerbated by coronavirus. John Buckland gave up teaching to become an HGV driver in 2015 and says although he finds it ""a fun job"", he's now having second thoughts ""Long distance means I have to have nights out,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. ""So at the moment I'm spending four to five nights out a week and I just want to be home. The wages are also really pretty poor as well."" He says offering higher salaries will not be enough to get people into the job. ""They're going to say alright you're going to get Â£50,000 but you're never going to see home, you're going to be out at weekends, sleeping in the cab you're going to have to park in lay-bys. I don't think that's going to be very attractive to very many people at all,"" he says. Kieran Smith from specialist HGV training agency, Driver Require, says: ""We estimate 230,000 licence holders are not driving at the moment,"" he says. ""Of those, 50,000 left in the last six months, so some of those should be able to be attracted back and that's probably the most easy short-term fix."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Xiamen is one of four cities in Fujian province that has confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the last couple of weeks.There have been more than 400 confirmed cases in Fujian since 11 September,external, a quarter of which are in children. Whenever cases of Covid-19 are identified in Chinese towns or cities, large-scale testing drives are ordered to identify any symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Xiamen, which has a population of five million people,has carried out four rounds of city-wide testing.,external The city is hopeful that it can curb its outbreak by the Golden Week holiday commencing on 1 October, and the second biggest travel period after the Lunar New Year. Media outlets have warned that peopleâs travel plans may be disrupted at a provincial level if regions donât get their case numbers down to zero. Last week, the Ministry of Culture said âtrans-provincial group tours, air tickets and hotel reservation servicesâ must be âimmediatelyâ suspended within affected provinces if cases of Covid-19 force areas into lockdown. A public health official for two English districts with high rates of Covid-19 said she ""supports"" the return of face coverings in secondary schools. At least four schools in Corby and two in Kettering, both in Northamptonshire, have asked for masks in communal areas. Kettering has the second-highest case rate in England, while Corby has the third. The county's director of public health, Lucy Wightman, says: ""If you have case rates as high as we've seen, why would people not take those precautions to try and reduce risk to them and that disruption to education and the risk to the wider population?"" At the start of term, schools in England were advised face coverings were no longer routinely needed for staff or pupils, although they were still recommended in crowded spaces such as on school buses. But the Department for Education said schools could temporarily reintroduce bubble groups and face masks in communal spaces inareas with higher Covid rates. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Could England's run to the Euro 2020 championships final have helped increase immunity? People in Scotland are twice as likely as those in England
to test positive for Covid at the moment. One in 45 people test positive north of the border compared
with one in 90 below it. But why and will the rest of the UK follow Scotlandâs lead? There are no clear answers. There could be differences in
levels of immunity in the two countries due to the spread of the virus in
previous waves. Even the England football teamâs run to the finals of the
Euros, which did help Covid spread, could have topped up immunity. Differences in the schooling system â schools in Scotland go
back in mid-August rather than early September â could also have an impact. Understanding the difference could help us figure out what
is going to happen in the months to come as there is still considerable
uncertainty about how tough this winter is going to be. Covid infections in England are now highest among school age children, according to the Office for National Statistics, with secondary school children the worst affected. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), says the higher case numbers in that age group will be partly down to more testing among school children. âSome of this is a genuine rise in cases in that age group and some of it is that youâre finding cases because youâre looking for them,â he tells BBC Radio 4âs The World at One. He says âadults are infecting children more than children are infecting adultsâ, and warns there could be a spike among young adults âcoming upâ as students start university. âThe people we need to most urgently pay attention to are the young adults who socialise a lot, many of whom are still not immunised. Thatâs where weâre going to see most transmission going on in the coming weeks and months,â he says. âThe universities really need to give every opportunity they can to students coming in to make it easy and convenient.â  The Scottish government will bring Covidtesting for travellers returning from abroad into line with the rest of the UK. Tests before departure will no longer be required for those who are fully vaccinated. It is not yet known when the change will take effect. Scottish ministers also said they ""intend to align with the UK post-arrival testing regime"" but details of this have still be finalised. This includes whether a a PCR or lateral flow test will be required within two days of arriving home. A shortage of HGV drivers in the UK is not a Brexit issue, says a member of the transport committee. Conservative MP Greg Smith told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""This isn't a Brexit issue. If it was a Brexit issue then everyone in the European Union would be just fine and have as many HGV drivers as they need and we know that's not true. We know Germany, we know Poland have as bigger problem as the UK does if not slightly bigger."" He says: ""It's perfectly natural thing to look at to say there's a shortage of HGV drivers as there clearly is and we can't fill that gap from the domestic market then we should look at increasing the number of points you get for holding an HGV licence for being able to come here and work in that sector either on a permanent footing or a temporary measure."" We've been reporting on a lorry driver shortage in the UK which has been exacerbated by coronavirus. John Buckland gave up teaching to become an HGV driver in 2015 and says although he finds it ""a fun job"", he's now having second thoughts ""Long distance means I have to have nights out,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. ""So at the moment I'm spending four to five nights out a week and I just want to be home. The wages are also really pretty poor as well."" He says offering higher salaries will not be enough to get people into the job. ""They're going to say alright you're going to get Â£50,000 but you're never going to see home, you're going to be out at weekends, sleeping in the cab you're going to have to park in lay-bys. I don't think that's going to be very attractive to very many people at all,"" he says. Kieran Smith from specialist HGV training agency, Driver Require, says: ""We estimate 230,000 licence holders are not driving at the moment,"" he says. ""Of those, 50,000 left in the last six months, so some of those should be able to be attracted back and that's probably the most easy short-term fix."" Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveLorry driver crisis made worse by Covid - ShappsTransport Secretary Grant Shapps says there's a bottleneck because HGV driver tests were not available during the pandemic.UK,"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the shortage of HGV drivers is a âglobal problemâ and has been made worse by coronavirus He says the ""principal bottleneck"" relates to getting more tests for HGV drivers - after none were available during the pandemic There are also other ""systemic problems"" in the haulage industry that need to be resolved, the transport secretary says Senior UK ministers are meeting this afternoon to discuss supply problems at petrol stations It comes after a small number of BP and Esso-owned Tesco Alliance petrol stations closed due to a lack of delivery drivers The pandemic has forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled, the Road Haulage Association says Lorry driver shortages have also been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit and other industry issues around conditions and pay But No 10 says there is ""no shortage of fuel in the UK and people should continue to buy fuel as normal"" Meanwhile, Magaret Keenan - the first person outside a trial to receive a Covid jab in the world - has received her booster shot Around one in 90 people in private households in England had Covid in the week to 18 September, down from one in 80 in the previous week - ONS A further 35,623 people have tested positive for Covid, according to UK figures, with another 180 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis That's all from us. Thank you for joining our coverage - it's been edited by Holly Wallis and Rob Corp, and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner and Hazel Shearing. It's been a busy day and we'll be signing off shortly. Here are some of the headlines from around the UK:  Magaret Keenan, the first person outside a trial to receive a Covid vaccine in the world, is urging others to ""go for it"" and get their booster jabafter receiving hers. She returned to University Hospital Coventry, in the West Midlands - where she had the historic injection in December 2020 - to get her booster on Friday. The 91-year-old, who only retired from her job working in a jeweller's five years ago, says: ""I don't really know what stops people from having it... there's nothing to be frightened of. ""It's protected me in the mind, as well, you know. ""I feel quite confident now, going out, places I wouldn't have thought about before."" It comes as the NHS revealed more than 350,000 people had booked a booster this week. More than 1.5 million eligible people have so far been invited to book their booster vaccine. You can find out who is eligible for a boosterhere. As we've reported, senior ministers have been meeting this afternoon to discuss fuel delivery problems at some petrol stations. It's after a small number were affected because of a shortage of HGV drivers. Some people have posted pictures of queues forming near forecourts. Ifan Morgan Jones, who took the first photo below, told the BBC he had never seen a petrol queue as long in Dolgellau, Wales. But the government says refineries have ""plenty of petrol"" and drivers should carry on as normal. And the AA says most of the UK's forecourts are working as they should. AA president Edmund King said: ""Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts, as drivers either combine filling up with shopping runs, prepare for weekend trips or refuel for the start of the new working week."" Dolgellau in Wales Costco, Lakeside Sainsburyâs Ashford Kent New Chester Road, Tranmere Turning back to the fuel delivery issues, the Scottish government saysthere is no shortage of fuel in Scotlandand supplies are operating as normal. Ministers are however having urgent discussions with the sector and say they will support consumers however they can. Their comments came as long queues were seen outside some Scottish petrol stations on Friday afternoon. Drivers waited in line in Cambuslang, Port Glasgow and at Braehead Shopping Centre near Glasgow. Earlier UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the lorry driver shortage behind the fuel supply problem had been made worse by the pandemic, as well as systemic issues relating to pay and conditions. A further 35,623 people have tested positive for Covid in the UK, according to official government figures - slightly down on the 36,710 reported on Thursday but up from the 32,651 cases reported for the same day last week. There have also been a further 180 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded - taking the total by that measure to 135,983 since the pandemic began. A further 31,617 first doses and 44,817 second doses of coronavirus vaccines were given on Thursday. It means that more than 48.7 million people have received at least one dose, 89.6% of the UK population aged 16 and above. More than 44.6 million are now fully vaccinated - 82.1% of that group. A third of people with confirmed Covid in Wales in the past week were unvaccinated, according to new figures released by Public Health Wales (PHW). The figures also showed 99% of people who tested positive for Covid in the past week in Wales were under 60. Of these, 37% were unvaccinated. Nearly 13% of hospital patients with confirmed Covid were unvaccinated. PHW says vaccines have helped to keep Covid hospital numbers much lower during the third wave. Although 80% of patients have been double-dosed with a vaccine, public health officials say this is not evidence that the vaccine is not working - and they insist vaccines keep 95% of people out of hospital. Without this protection, the numbers in hospital would be far greater, they add.Here's what else the figures show. The council described the Zoom footage, recorded last year, as ""innocuous"" A New Zealand council's Zoom meeting recorded during a Covid-19 lockdown period last year has unexpectedly gone viral. The meeting of the Waipa District Council's finance and corporate committee has been viewed more than 290,000 times on YouTube as people use it to pretend to take part and avoid being disturbed. ""We're feeling famous,"" the council wrote on Twitter on Friday, adding: ""After inexplicably going viral on the internet... we're just as confused as you."" The footage, which runs for about one hour and 44 minutes and is described as ""innocuous"", discussesthe impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the nation's tourism industry,external. ""I have used this meeting six times now,"" writes one YouTuber. ""My wife asked why the person speaking has an accentâ¦ I'm in the  US,"" another commented. Other users included students who said they had played the footage to convince their parents they were studying from home. New Zealand was initially praised for its handling of the virus, but has since seen a slow roll-out of vaccines although it has been ramping up in recent days. A spike in Covid cases, attributed to the Delta variant, recently put large parts of the country back into lockdown. Readmore on this story here.

asked about the shortage of HGV drivers on Question Time, Transport Secretary
Grant Shapps said this was happening in other countries too. He said Poland had
a shortage of 123,000 drivers and Germany had a shortage of 60,000. According to data collected by Transport Intelligence, Poland was short of
123,842 drivers last year, while in Germany, between 45,000 and 60,000 were
needed. We
couldnât find more recent data, so we donât know how these figures compare with
the current estimate for the UK â from the Road Haulage Association â of a
shortage of about 100,000 drivers. In arecent interview with Trans.Info,external, Michael
Clover, Transport Intelligence's head of commercial development, pointed out
that driver shortages in Europe were not leading to empty shelves and said
Brexit was a factor. He
said driver vacancies in EU countries could be quickly filled by drivers from
neighbouring countries, and drivers didnât have to face checks at the
border [because these countries are in the EU single market, unlike the UK]. Shapps, on Question Time, blamed the impact of Covid for causing the HGV ""bottleneck"" â because testing centres to get licences had to close. He also
talked about systemic problems in the industry such as pay and conditions. Retailers are warning that significant disruption to Christmas preparations will be ""inevitable"" unless the government finds a solution to the HGV driver shortage in the next 10 days. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium (BRC), says: ""HGV drivers are the glue which hold our supply chains together. ""Without them, we are unable to move goods from farms to warehouses to shops. ""Currently, the UK faces a shortfall of around 90,000 HGV drivers and it is consumers who ultimately suffer the consequences. ""Unless a solution can be found in the next 10 days, it is inevitable that we will see significant disruption in the run up to Christmas."" We've got a bit more travel news now. Passengers journeying to Jersey from any country will no longer have to isolate or test on arrival if they can produce a negative Covid PCR test. This new rule -accepting negative pre-departure tests from all countries- comes into effect on Tuesday, the government of Jersey has announced. Previously only negative PCR tests from the UK were accepted. A pre-departure form will still be required, plus evidence of a negative test result. The test must have been conducted within 72 hours of departure. As we reported earlier, Scottish ministers have agreed to bring the nation in line with the UK government over international travel testing. Now the Northern Ireland Executive hasdecided to change the rulesthere to bring them in line with the rest of the UK. Ministers agreed to remove the requirement for pre-departure testing for fully vaccinated arrivals from non-red list countries. This change will come into force at 04:00 BST on 4 October. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There have been Covid outbreaks in two Chinese provinces in the last couple of weeks, and fears of a more widespread outbreak ahead of a major travel period next month.

Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutions,"Supplies of Russian gas have fallen in recent weeks, and Europeans are looking to cut their reliance on it A surge in gas prices has hit consumers and energy firms in the UK, with knock-on effects for the food industry and supplies of carbon dioxide. Elsewhere in Europe, consumers are also facing a steep rise in energy bills, and governments are scrambling to help. The crisis has highlighted the difficulty for Europeans in funding the move to renewable energy. Here, five correspondents explain how different countries are responding. Consumers' bills have spiralled here in recent months, with the cost of electricity increasing 35% over the last year and nearly 8% in August alone. Energy prices in Spain are closely tied to the wholesale gas market, so the price per megawatt hour for consumers has repeatedly hit new highs recently. ""I was paying about â¬40 (Â£34) per month and now I'm paying around â¬60,"" said Amparo Vega, who has a newspaper kiosk in central Madrid. Earlier this month, the coalition government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez unveiled a series of measures aimed at bringing bills back down. They include tax cuts and a temporary reduction in extraordinary profits made by energy companies. The latter move has drawn criticism from the industry, although the government has clarified that renewable energy providers will be exempt. The government says its aim is to reduce electricity bills by over 20% by the end of the year. As winter approaches, consumers such as Ms Vega hope that happens. ""The outlook isn't very rosy,"" says Michele Fiorita, taking some air outside his shop in central Rome. ""My energy bills have gone up by about 15% but I've heard they'll rise by around 40% in the next few months."" Italy is particularly exposed to gas price hikes: 40% of its energy comes from natural gas and around half of that is imported from Russia. So lower Russian gas exports to Europe and an increase in the price of raw materials have hit hard. The Italian government has already spent some â¬1.2bn to cut the increase in energy prices for households and this week pledged another â¬3bn to help further in the coming months. Prime Minister Mario Draghi says for the next three months ""system costs"" will be eliminated from gas and electricity bills. They're the tariffs added to bills to help fund the transition to renewable energy. It's a short-term sticking plaster to help reduce the jump in energy prices for struggling households but removes an important financial incentive to help the switch to renewables. Fundamentally, Italy will need to diversify its energy sources, moving away from its dependence on gas and more towards green energy. ""That's surely the future,"" says Michele, ""it's the only way to reduce costs in the long-term."" As soaring energy costs present huge personal difficulties for families, they also pose some tricky politics for Brussels. EU leaders have been busy pushing their sweeping climate plan to cut carbon emissions by 55% by 2030 - a drive known as ""Fit for 55"". It's wide-ranging but includes proposals that, critics say, could lead to huge further price hikes. Even backers of the measures quietly admit the transition to a greener economy inevitably, one way or another, hits people in the pocket. On the current crisis, the European Commission says that price rises are a combination of several factors, particularly the global surge in demand. Increases in the price of CO2 permits under the EU's carbon pricing scheme are blamed for some of the rises, but the Commission says it's only a ""small percentage"". It wants to expand that scheme under ""Fit for 55"". But with calls from the Spanish government for the energy crisis to be on the table at the next EU leaders' summit, Brussels is facing questions over what it can or will do to help. Guidance is being worked on in terms of the mitigation measures member states can individually take within EU rules. But there's no sign of any significant, centralised intervention. The more the crisis heats up, the greater the backlash may be over the EU's climate plans. However, those in favour would argue that the faster the move to a green economy, the faster member states can escape this kind of volatility. Surging European gas prices have been felt by Polish consumers because the country's energy regulator has approved three price hikes this year, raising bills by more than 20%. But household gas bills are still regulated here, so customers are insulated from any sharp changes in market prices. Also, about half of Poland's gas demand is met by domestic production, which is typically cheaper than imported gas. That cheaper, domestic gas is used to cover the needs of households first, while industry is mostly supplied with more expensive imports. But here again, energy-intensive Polish companies are shielded from sky-rocketing market prices because they have long-term supply contracts with a fixed price. Poland is trying to move away from coal and has been ordered to pay a big fine for not closing this huge open mine In Poland, coal is still the main fuel driving the economy, with gas a long way behind. That is starting to change. The solar power market is one of the fastest growing in Europe and state-controlled power companies are planning huge investments in offshore wind. Gas will become more important then, because the government sees natural gas as a bridging fuel to replace ageing coal plants and ensure the lights remain on when the wind drops under cloudy skies. In Poland, the origin of the gas is a political issue. The government plans to cease its decades-old dependence on Russian gas next year and replace it with US and Norwegian gas, arguing it will no longer suffer Gazprom overcharging it for gas, because it can abuse its position as a monopoly supplier. POLAND'S COAL:The vast European mine infuriating the neighbours Non-EU Norway is one of the biggest producers of oil and natural gas in Europe, though very little of it is used for its own needs. Only 1.4% of electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels and waste, 5.8% by wind power and the remaining 92.9% is produced by hydroelectric power. Norway's Equinor energy company has agreed to allow a 2bn-cubic-metre increase in gas exports for the next year to support increased European and UK demand. Formerly known as Statoil, Equinor is two-thirds owned by the state. While bills are not as high as elsewhere in Europe, Norwegians are not immune from increasing energy prices. ""We currently pay 750 NOK (Â£63) a month for energy and warm water, but in Oslo prices are relatively low,"" says Magnus, 26, who lives in a studio apartment in the capital with his girlfriend. Norway's Equinor is Europe's second-largest gas supplier after Russia's Gazprom The couple are moving to a bigger flat in Bergen on the west coast and expect their bills to go up: ""When you live somewhere where fewer people are, then electricity is more expensive. That's why I'm thinking of just getting solar panels."" From 1 October, Norway will be able to export electricity to the UK via a ""North Sea link"" of underwater high-voltage electric cables connecting the two power grids. There have been concerns the recent UK price surge could spread to Norwegian households and industries. But one proposal to impose a tax on outgoing energy has been rejected, as Norway also needs to import energy in certain periods of the year.

Queues grow as activists block Dover port,"Specialist teams worked to remove Insulate Britain protesters who glued themselves on top of a tanker Thirty nine people have been arrested after climate activists blocked Dover port, causing queues of vehicles attempting to cross the Channel. Insulate Britain, which has brought chaos on the M25 five times in the past fortnight, said more than 40 people had gathered. The Kent port - Europe's busiest ferry terminal -  said passengers should take extra time for their journeys. The main protest began at 08:20 BST and was cleared by police two hours later. One lane of the A20 remained blocked afterwards, as two protesters were sitting on top of a tanker with their hands glued to the vehicle. While she was on the tanker with her hand stuck to the railing, one protester who gave her first name as Stephanie said she did not want to be there. She said: ""I want to be home with my family spending time with them but if we don't do this they aren't going to have a future. ""The government are not doing enough. On the current trajectory we are heading for chaos."" Both Stephanie, 27, and her fellow protester Josh, 28, were later lifted down by police. Lorry drivers were held up by Insulate Britain protesters blocking the A20 Kent Police said the protest caused ""traffic disruption in Dover"", with queues forming on the A20 and the A2 approaching the port. All those detained on Friday were arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance and obstructing a highway, the force said. Police said all those arrested remained in custody on Friday afternoon, when roads were again clear. Police carried away a protester who was on top of a tanker Dover TAP, short for Traffic Assessment Project, was implemented by National Highways, due to the congestion. It enforces a 40mph speed restriction on the A20 approaching Dover, and lorry drivers heading for the port must remain in the left lane. The Port of Dover said at 11:21 BST that traffic had resumed and was flowing in and out of the site. Police officers removed a protester from the A20 in Kent The protest followed a court ruling won by the government which means climate change protesters can be jailed if they continue their campaign of blocking the M25. Hundreds of campaigners previously forced the closure of the motorway in parts of Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government would take further action. Hewrote on Twitter,external: ""We won't tolerate reckless behaviour on motorways or ports (Dover this morning). I'm therefore seeking a further injunction to prevent this disruption."" Later, the government confirmed a further injunction had been approved by the High Court to prevent protesters from occupying the A20 and strategic roads linked to the Port of Dover. Mr Shapps said: ""We are absolutely committed to protecting the right to peaceful protest, but it is unacceptable that people cannot go about their day-to-day businesses and that businesses, or critical supplies should be put on a knife's edge because of the reckless actions of a few protesters."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""The British public are rightly furious that the behaviours of a selfish minority have been putting lives at risk and causing untold disruption on our roads and now at Dover."" Protesters from Insulate Britain sit on top of a vehicle as they block the A20 in Kent Several drivers remonstrated with activists in Dover.

Ch Supt Simon Thompson, from Kent Police, thanked people affected for their patience, and said: ""The impact this disruption had on the local community and port-bound traffic is not lost on us."" Police cleared the A20 of protesters after two hours Dover MP Natalie Elphicke called the protesters ""hooligans"". Writing on Twitter, she added: ""The port is the vital artery of our nation's trade - about one-fifth of all trade comes through Dover.

LiveLiveLorry driver crisis direct result of Covid - Shapps5 minutes ago,"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the shortage of HGV drivers is a âglobal problemâ and has been made worse by coronavirus He says the ""principal bottleneck"" relates to getting more tests for HGV drivers - after none were available during the pandemic There are also other ""systemic problems"" in the haulage industry that need to be resolved, the transport secretary says Senior UK ministers are meeting this afternoon to discuss supply problems at petrol stations It comes after a small number of BP and Esso-owned Tesco Alliance petrol stations closed due to a lack of delivery drivers The pandemic has forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled, the Road Haulage Association says Lorry driver shortages have also been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit and other industry issues around conditions and pay But No 10 says there is ""no shortage of fuel in the UK and people should continue to buy fuel as normal"" Meanwhile, Magaret Keenan - the first person outside a trial to receive a Covid jab in the world - has received her booster shot Around one in 90 people in private households in England had Covid in the week to 18 September, down from one in 80 in the previous week - ONS A further 35,623 people have tested positive for Covid, according to UK figures, with another 180 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis That's all from us. Thank you for joining our coverage - it's been edited by Holly Wallis and Rob Corp, and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner and Hazel Shearing. It's been a busy day and we'll be signing off shortly. Here are some of the headlines from around the UK:  Magaret Keenan, the first person outside a trial to receive a Covid vaccine in the world, is urging others to ""go for it"" and get their booster jabafter receiving hers. She returned to University Hospital Coventry, in the West Midlands - where she had the historic injection in December 2020 - to get her booster on Friday. The 91-year-old, who only retired from her job working in a jeweller's five years ago, says: ""I don't really know what stops people from having it... there's nothing to be frightened of. ""It's protected me in the mind, as well, you know. ""I feel quite confident now, going out, places I wouldn't have thought about before."" It comes as the NHS revealed more than 350,000 people had booked a booster this week. More than 1.5 million eligible people have so far been invited to book their booster vaccine. You can find out who is eligible for a boosterhere. As we've reported, senior ministers have been meeting this afternoon to discuss fuel delivery problems at some petrol stations. It's after a small number were affected because of a shortage of HGV drivers. Some people have posted pictures of queues forming near forecourts. Ifan Morgan Jones, who took the first photo below, told the BBC he had never seen a petrol queue as long in Dolgellau, Wales. But the government says refineries have ""plenty of petrol"" and drivers should carry on as normal. And the AA says most of the UK's forecourts are working as they should. AA president Edmund King said: ""Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts, as drivers either combine filling up with shopping runs, prepare for weekend trips or refuel for the start of the new working week."" Dolgellau in Wales Costco, Lakeside Sainsburyâs Ashford Kent New Chester Road, Tranmere Turning back to the fuel delivery issues, the Scottish government saysthere is no shortage of fuel in Scotlandand supplies are operating as normal. Ministers are however having urgent discussions with the sector and say they will support consumers however they can. Their comments came as long queues were seen outside some Scottish petrol stations on Friday afternoon. Drivers waited in line in Cambuslang, Port Glasgow and at Braehead Shopping Centre near Glasgow. Earlier UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the lorry driver shortage behind the fuel supply problem had been made worse by the pandemic, as well as systemic issues relating to pay and conditions. A further 35,623 people have tested positive for Covid in the UK, according to official government figures - slightly down on the 36,710 reported on Thursday but up from the 32,651 cases reported for the same day last week. There have also been a further 180 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded - taking the total by that measure to 135,983 since the pandemic began. A further 31,617 first doses and 44,817 second doses of coronavirus vaccines were given on Thursday. It means that more than 48.7 million people have received at least one dose, 89.6% of the UK population aged 16 and above. More than 44.6 million are now fully vaccinated - 82.1% of that group. A third of people with confirmed Covid in Wales in the past week were unvaccinated, according to new figures released by Public Health Wales (PHW). The figures also showed 99% of people who tested positive for Covid in the past week in Wales were under 60. Of these, 37% were unvaccinated. Nearly 13% of hospital patients with confirmed Covid were unvaccinated. PHW says vaccines have helped to keep Covid hospital numbers much lower during the third wave. Although 80% of patients have been double-dosed with a vaccine, public health officials say this is not evidence that the vaccine is not working - and they insist vaccines keep 95% of people out of hospital. Without this protection, the numbers in hospital would be far greater, they add.Here's what else the figures show. The council described the Zoom footage, recorded last year, as ""innocuous"" A New Zealand council's Zoom meeting recorded during a Covid-19 lockdown period last year has unexpectedly gone viral. The meeting of the Waipa District Council's finance and corporate committee has been viewed more than 290,000 times on YouTube as people use it to pretend to take part and avoid being disturbed. ""We're feeling famous,"" the council wrote on Twitter on Friday, adding: ""After inexplicably going viral on the internet... we're just as confused as you."" The footage, which runs for about one hour and 44 minutes and is described as ""innocuous"", discussesthe impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the nation's tourism industry,external. ""I have used this meeting six times now,"" writes one YouTuber. ""My wife asked why the person speaking has an accentâ¦ I'm in the  US,"" another commented. Other users included students who said they had played the footage to convince their parents they were studying from home. New Zealand was initially praised for its handling of the virus, but has since seen a slow roll-out of vaccines although it has been ramping up in recent days. A spike in Covid cases, attributed to the Delta variant, recently put large parts of the country back into lockdown. Readmore on this story here.

asked about the shortage of HGV drivers on Question Time, Transport Secretary
Grant Shapps said this was happening in other countries too. He said Poland had
a shortage of 123,000 drivers and Germany had a shortage of 60,000. According to data collected by Transport Intelligence, Poland was short of
123,842 drivers last year, while in Germany, between 45,000 and 60,000 were
needed. We
couldnât find more recent data, so we donât know how these figures compare with
the current estimate for the UK â from the Road Haulage Association â of a
shortage of about 100,000 drivers. In arecent interview with Trans.Info,external, Michael
Clover, Transport Intelligence's head of commercial development, pointed out
that driver shortages in Europe were not leading to empty shelves and said
Brexit was a factor. He
said driver vacancies in EU countries could be quickly filled by drivers from
neighbouring countries, and drivers didnât have to face checks at the
border [because these countries are in the EU single market, unlike the UK]. Shapps, on Question Time, blamed the impact of Covid for causing the HGV ""bottleneck"" â because testing centres to get licences had to close. He also
talked about systemic problems in the industry such as pay and conditions. Retailers are warning that significant disruption to Christmas preparations will be ""inevitable"" unless the government finds a solution to the HGV driver shortage in the next 10 days. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium (BRC), says: ""HGV drivers are the glue which hold our supply chains together. ""Without them, we are unable to move goods from farms to warehouses to shops. ""Currently, the UK faces a shortfall of around 90,000 HGV drivers and it is consumers who ultimately suffer the consequences. ""Unless a solution can be found in the next 10 days, it is inevitable that we will see significant disruption in the run up to Christmas."" We've got a bit more travel news now. Passengers journeying to Jersey from any country will no longer have to isolate or test on arrival if they can produce a negative Covid PCR test. This new rule -accepting negative pre-departure tests from all countries- comes into effect on Tuesday, the government of Jersey has announced. Previously only negative PCR tests from the UK were accepted. A pre-departure form will still be required, plus evidence of a negative test result. The test must have been conducted within 72 hours of departure. As we reported earlier, Scottish ministers have agreed to bring the nation in line with the UK government over international travel testing. Now the Northern Ireland Executive hasdecided to change the rulesthere to bring them in line with the rest of the UK. Ministers agreed to remove the requirement for pre-departure testing for fully vaccinated arrivals from non-red list countries. This change will come into force at 04:00 BST on 4 October. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There have been Covid outbreaks in two Chinese provinces in the last couple of weeks, and fears of a more widespread outbreak ahead of a major travel period next month. One district in the Chinese city of Xiamen is offering people cash rewards if they report people they believe havenât been tested for Covid-19. According tothe national Global Times newspaper,external, Tongan District in Xiamen, Fujian province, is offering 1,000 yuan (Â£113) rewards to residents if they tip off the authorities. People have been warned that they could be denied entry to various public places if they do not comply with testing drives, or even face criminal punishment. Xiamen is one of four cities in Fujian province that has confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the last couple of weeks.There have been more than 400 confirmed cases in Fujian since 11 September,external, a quarter of which are in children. Whenever cases of Covid-19 are identified in Chinese towns or cities, large-scale testing drives are ordered to identify any symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Xiamen, which has a population of five million people,has carried out four rounds of city-wide testing.,external The city is hopeful that it can curb its outbreak by the Golden Week holiday commencing on 1 October, and the second biggest travel period after the Lunar New Year. Media outlets have warned that peopleâs travel plans may be disrupted at a provincial level if regions donât get their case numbers down to zero. Last week, the Ministry of Culture said âtrans-provincial group tours, air tickets and hotel reservation servicesâ must be âimmediatelyâ suspended within affected provinces if cases of Covid-19 force areas into lockdown. A public health official for two English districts with high rates of Covid-19 said she ""supports"" the return of face coverings in secondary schools. At least four schools in Corby and two in Kettering, both in Northamptonshire, have asked for masks in communal areas. Kettering has the second-highest case rate in England, while Corby has the third. The county's director of public health, Lucy Wightman, says: ""If you have case rates as high as we've seen, why would people not take those precautions to try and reduce risk to them and that disruption to education and the risk to the wider population?"" At the start of term, schools in England were advised face coverings were no longer routinely needed for staff or pupils, although they were still recommended in crowded spaces such as on school buses. But the Department for Education said schools could temporarily reintroduce bubble groups and face masks in communal spaces inareas with higher Covid rates. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Could England's run to the Euro 2020 championships final have helped increase immunity? People in Scotland are twice as likely as those in England
to test positive for Covid at the moment. One in 45 people test positive north of the border compared
with one in 90 below it. But why and will the rest of the UK follow Scotlandâs lead? There are no clear answers. There could be differences in
levels of immunity in the two countries due to the spread of the virus in
previous waves. Even the England football teamâs run to the finals of the
Euros, which did help Covid spread, could have topped up immunity. Differences in the schooling system â schools in Scotland go
back in mid-August rather than early September â could also have an impact. Understanding the difference could help us figure out what
is going to happen in the months to come as there is still considerable
uncertainty about how tough this winter is going to be. Covid infections in England are now highest among school age children, according to the Office for National Statistics, with secondary school children the worst affected. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), says the higher case numbers in that age group will be partly down to more testing among school children. âSome of this is a genuine rise in cases in that age group and some of it is that youâre finding cases because youâre looking for them,â he tells BBC Radio 4âs The World at One. He says âadults are infecting children more than children are infecting adultsâ, and warns there could be a spike among young adults âcoming upâ as students start university. âThe people we need to most urgently pay attention to are the young adults who socialise a lot, many of whom are still not immunised. Thatâs where weâre going to see most transmission going on in the coming weeks and months,â he says. âThe universities really need to give every opportunity they can to students coming in to make it easy and convenient.â  The Scottish government will bring Covidtesting for travellers returning from abroad into line with the rest of the UK. Tests before departure will no longer be required for those who are fully vaccinated. It is not yet known when the change will take effect. Scottish ministers also said they ""intend to align with the UK post-arrival testing regime"" but details of this have still be finalised. This includes whether a a PCR or lateral flow test will be required within two days of arriving home. A shortage of HGV drivers in the UK is not a Brexit issue, says a member of the transport committee. Conservative MP Greg Smith told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""This isn't a Brexit issue. If it was a Brexit issue then everyone in the European Union would be just fine and have as many HGV drivers as they need and we know that's not true. We know Germany, we know Poland have as bigger problem as the UK does if not slightly bigger."" He says: ""It's perfectly natural thing to look at to say there's a shortage of HGV drivers as there clearly is and we can't fill that gap from the domestic market then we should look at increasing the number of points you get for holding an HGV licence for being able to come here and work in that sector either on a permanent footing or a temporary measure."" We've been reporting on a lorry driver shortage in the UK which has been exacerbated by coronavirus. John Buckland gave up teaching to become an HGV driver in 2015 and says although he finds it ""a fun job"", he's now having second thoughts ""Long distance means I have to have nights out,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. ""So at the moment I'm spending four to five nights out a week and I just want to be home. The wages are also really pretty poor as well."" He says offering higher salaries will not be enough to get people into the job. ""They're going to say alright you're going to get Â£50,000 but you're never going to see home, you're going to be out at weekends, sleeping in the cab you're going to have to park in lay-bys. I don't think that's going to be very attractive to very many people at all,"" he says. Kieran Smith from specialist HGV training agency, Driver Require, says: ""We estimate 230,000 licence holders are not driving at the moment,"" he says. ""Of those, 50,000 left in the last six months, so some of those should be able to be attracted back and that's probably the most easy short-term fix."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Labour promises cap on foreign sales of new homesThe party will set out the plan at its annual conference, arguing it will help first-time buyers.","Labour says it would cap the amount of property overseas investors can purchase in new developments, in a bid to help first-time buyers. Under plans to be outlined at its annual conference, the party would also give first-time buyers ""first dibs"" on new builds for six months. It will also pledge to reform rules governing how developers contribute towards affordable housing. And it will pledge to give councils new powers to buy land for homes. The conference, starting in Brighton on Saturday, will give party leader Sir Keir Starmer his first chance to set out his stall to members in person. It comes amid an ongoing policy review, where the party will decide how much of its policy offering it should change from the Jeremy Corbyn era. Where can I afford to live? Are second home owners really pricing locals out? Party conferences: What to expect this year Keir Starmer is taking a big risk In a speech on Sunday, Labour's shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell will set out the party's plans to build ""more truly affordable homes"". ""Our country is facing a housing crisis with the link between hard work and getting on the housing ladder broken for many,"" she will say. She is expected to accuse the Conservatives of becoming the ""party of speculators and developers"", treating property ""as a commodity, not the bedrock of stable lives and life chances"". And in a move to occupy traditional Tory territory, she will call Labour the ""party of home ownership"". She will pledge to change England's planning rules, so that half of the homes in new developments cannot be sold to foreign investors. The party says this will help first-time buyers by preventing properties being sold off-plan to developers before local residents can buy them. The policy is an evolution of the party's position at the 2019 election under Jeremy Corbyn, when it proposed a new tax on foreign buyers. In its 2019 manifesto, the party also promised first-time buyers ""first dibs"" on new housing - but did not specify for how long. Boosting home ownership is expected to be a key focus of the conference this weekend Ms Powell will also recommit to several Corbyn-era housing policies, including linking the definition of ""affordable"" homes to average wages, not rents. The party is critical of the government's current definition, which allows affordable rents to be set at up to 80% of the local market rate. She will also set out plans to allow local authorities to buy land more cheaply from private owners when completing a compulsory purchase. Councils are currently not allowed to buy such land at agricultural value - instead having to factor in the prospect of future planning permission, which makes it more expensive. Labour believes changing this could enable councils to buy more land for affordable housing, and give them a stronger hand with developers. The party had proposals in this area under its previous leadership, when it proposed setting up a ""sovereign land trust"" to buy property. It will also renew its criticism of rules under which developers negotiate with councils to build affordable homes, or contribute cash towards them. The party has criticised the current system as too lax and favourable to developers. The government itself plans to replace the current system with a new levy as part of itswider proposals to change the planning systemin England. A Conservative spokesman said Ms Powell's housing speech ""amounts to a series of rehashed and failed policies from Jeremy Corbyn or Sadiq Khan"". ""It once again goes to show Labour under Keir Starmer have absolutely nothing new to offer our country,"" he added. Are second home owners really pricing locals out?

Seven out of 10 win benefits challenges in court,"James Oliver (right) ""gave up"" after he was refused benefit payments, his brother (left) said Seven out of ten people who appealed in court against a decision to deny them disability benefits were successful, analysis shows. In total, more than 293,000 people across the UK have overturned a government decision at tribunal in the past three years. Most hearings centred on Personal Independence Payment (PIP), the main disability benefit. The government said it made millions of PIP decisions and 5% were overturned. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act also reveal more than 1,000 people across the UK have died while formally challenging their benefit award. Daphne Hall, the vice chair of the National Association of Welfare Rights Advisers, said: ""It is heart-breaking that people die without having resolution."" Kerry Jones said her father Keith was trying to make her laugh while in hospital shortly before he died Keith Jones died weighing six stone (38kg) days before he was due to appeal a decision to refuse him benefits. The former electrician, from Wrexham, was awarded Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in 1997 after mouth cancer left him unable to eat solid food and struggling to walk more than 20 metres. In 2016, Mr Jones was told to apply for PIP - the benefit being introduced to replace DLA - but was refused. He never heard judges rule on his case as he died two days before his original tribunal date in August 2017. The eventual hearing ruled he had been entitled to PIP. ""I didn't really care about the money afterwards,"" his daughter Kerry Jones said. ""It was more justice for my dad and to prove them wrong."" ""It's heart-breaking for people to have to go through [tribunals] when they are so ill and they don't even know the ending. It needs highlighting."" James Oliver (left) scored zero points in his initial assessment for PIP, his brother David Smith (right) said James Oliver, from Hastings, East Sussex, had chronic liver disease caused by alcohol dependency but was refused PIP in May 2018.  His mandatory reconsideration was also refused. A letter inviting Mr Oliver to appeal the decision to deny him PIP was found by one of his children at his home four months after his death. It was not until October 2020 that his brother David Smith won a tribunal on his behalf.  It led to a payment backdated to when Mr Oliver first applied, up until the date of his death. ""The government know most people don't have the patience or the strength to keep going to tribunal,"" Mr Smith said. ""I was so worn down after 18 months - it was soul-destroying to be honest - but it was for the principle; his assessment defied belief."" The backdated benefit award covered the cost of Mr Oliver's funeral and for a bench in his memory in Alexandra Park, Hastings. David Smith said the remote hearing took 45 minutes as the DWP did not send a representative The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed figures from HM Courts and Tribunals Service, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and Northern Ireland's Department for Communities (DfC). It found: In England, Scotland and Wales, seven in ten tribunal appeals about benefits have been successful since 2018 Over the same period, some 500 people died before their initial challenge was decided. A further 421 tribunal cases were halted because the appellant died In Northern Ireland, six out of ten appeals were successful over the past two years. Sixty appeals have been lodged on behalf of people who died since 2013 In Julythe BBC reportedhow the DWP had held at least 268 internal reviews into cases where people claiming benefits died or came to serious harm since February 2012. The Labour Party then called for an ""urgent independent investigation"". Initial benefits assessments are carried out on behalf of the DWP by the private contractors Capita, the Independent Assessment Services (formerly called Atos) and Maximus. Since 2013, people seeking to overturn a benefits decision must start their challenge within a month, known as amandatory reconsideration,external. If unsuccessful, people can take their appeal to a tribunal. The DWP said mandatory reconsiderations were introduced to ensure claimants received the right decision without having to go to court. Critics say the process is distressing, does not give claimants enough time to gather evidence to support their appeal and many wrong decisions continue to be made. Both the DWP and Northern Ireland's DfC said their decisions were overturned on appeal mainly because of new evidence submitted to tribunals but charities said that evidence should have been captured earlier in applications. ""Narrow questions and a sense of being under suspicion [during assessments] can make it hard for people to give a full account of the barriers they face,"" former DWP senior mental health policy adviser Tom Pollard said. Mark Jackson, policy and public affairs manager at the end of life charity Marie Curie, said the system was ""clearly broken"". He said: ""It is driving people into financial hardship at the end of their lives and forcing bereaved relatives to fight an injustice at the most difficult time of their lives."" The DWP said it supported ""millions of people a year"" and ""the vast majority of PIP cases were not appealed"". Recent changes included giving decision-makers more time to contact people to ask for further information to support their benefit claim. A spokesperson said the PIP assessment process was carried out by experienced health professionals, who consider how people are affected by their disability, rather than just the disability itself. They said more than double the proportion of PIP claimants received the top rates of support compared to those who received Disability Living Allowance. Northern Ireland's DfC said the most recent report received from the President of Appeal Tribunalson the standard of decision-making by the department,externalshowed decisions about PIP were correct in 96% of cases. The DfC said it was ""not aware of any evidence to suggest there was a correlation between the number of people who had died before their tribunal hearing and the standard of the original assessment"".

Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutionsConsumers face a steep rise in energy bills as governments try to fund the move to renewable energy.Europe,"Supplies of Russian gas have fallen in recent weeks, and Europeans are looking to cut their reliance on it A surge in gas prices has hit consumers and energy firms in the UK, with knock-on effects for the food industry and supplies of carbon dioxide. Elsewhere in Europe, consumers are also facing a steep rise in energy bills, and governments are scrambling to help. The crisis has highlighted the difficulty for Europeans in funding the move to renewable energy. Here, five correspondents explain how different countries are responding. Consumers' bills have spiralled here in recent months, with the cost of electricity increasing 35% over the last year and nearly 8% in August alone. Energy prices in Spain are closely tied to the wholesale gas market, so the price per megawatt hour for consumers has repeatedly hit new highs recently. ""I was paying about â¬40 (Â£34) per month and now I'm paying around â¬60,"" said Amparo Vega, who has a newspaper kiosk in central Madrid. Earlier this month, the coalition government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez unveiled a series of measures aimed at bringing bills back down. They include tax cuts and a temporary reduction in extraordinary profits made by energy companies. The latter move has drawn criticism from the industry, although the government has clarified that renewable energy providers will be exempt. The government says its aim is to reduce electricity bills by over 20% by the end of the year. As winter approaches, consumers such as Ms Vega hope that happens. ""The outlook isn't very rosy,"" says Michele Fiorita, taking some air outside his shop in central Rome. ""My energy bills have gone up by about 15% but I've heard they'll rise by around 40% in the next few months."" Italy is particularly exposed to gas price hikes: 40% of its energy comes from natural gas and around half of that is imported from Russia. So lower Russian gas exports to Europe and an increase in the price of raw materials have hit hard. The Italian government has already spent some â¬1.2bn to cut the increase in energy prices for households and this week pledged another â¬3bn to help further in the coming months. Prime Minister Mario Draghi says for the next three months ""system costs"" will be eliminated from gas and electricity bills. They're the tariffs added to bills to help fund the transition to renewable energy. It's a short-term sticking plaster to help reduce the jump in energy prices for struggling households but removes an important financial incentive to help the switch to renewables. Fundamentally, Italy will need to diversify its energy sources, moving away from its dependence on gas and more towards green energy. ""That's surely the future,"" says Michele, ""it's the only way to reduce costs in the long-term."" As soaring energy costs present huge personal difficulties for families, they also pose some tricky politics for Brussels. EU leaders have been busy pushing their sweeping climate plan to cut carbon emissions by 55% by 2030 - a drive known as ""Fit for 55"". It's wide-ranging but includes proposals that, critics say, could lead to huge further price hikes. Even backers of the measures quietly admit the transition to a greener economy inevitably, one way or another, hits people in the pocket. On the current crisis, the European Commission says that price rises are a combination of several factors, particularly the global surge in demand. Increases in the price of CO2 permits under the EU's carbon pricing scheme are blamed for some of the rises, but the Commission says it's only a ""small percentage"". It wants to expand that scheme under ""Fit for 55"". But with calls from the Spanish government for the energy crisis to be on the table at the next EU leaders' summit, Brussels is facing questions over what it can or will do to help. Guidance is being worked on in terms of the mitigation measures member states can individually take within EU rules. But there's no sign of any significant, centralised intervention. The more the crisis heats up, the greater the backlash may be over the EU's climate plans. However, those in favour would argue that the faster the move to a green economy, the faster member states can escape this kind of volatility. Surging European gas prices have been felt by Polish consumers because the country's energy regulator has approved three price hikes this year, raising bills by more than 20%. But household gas bills are still regulated here, so customers are insulated from any sharp changes in market prices. Also, about half of Poland's gas demand is met by domestic production, which is typically cheaper than imported gas. That cheaper, domestic gas is used to cover the needs of households first, while industry is mostly supplied with more expensive imports. But here again, energy-intensive Polish companies are shielded from sky-rocketing market prices because they have long-term supply contracts with a fixed price. Poland is trying to move away from coal and has been ordered to pay a big fine for not closing this huge open mine In Poland, coal is still the main fuel driving the economy, with gas a long way behind. That is starting to change. The solar power market is one of the fastest growing in Europe and state-controlled power companies are planning huge investments in offshore wind. Gas will become more important then, because the government sees natural gas as a bridging fuel to replace ageing coal plants and ensure the lights remain on when the wind drops under cloudy skies. In Poland, the origin of the gas is a political issue. The government plans to cease its decades-old dependence on Russian gas next year and replace it with US and Norwegian gas, arguing it will no longer suffer Gazprom overcharging it for gas, because it can abuse its position as a monopoly supplier. POLAND'S COAL:The vast European mine infuriating the neighbours Non-EU Norway is one of the biggest producers of oil and natural gas in Europe, though very little of it is used for its own needs. Only 1.4% of electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels and waste, 5.8% by wind power and the remaining 92.9% is produced by hydroelectric power. Norway's Equinor energy company has agreed to allow a 2bn-cubic-metre increase in gas exports for the next year to support increased European and UK demand. Formerly known as Statoil, Equinor is two-thirds owned by the state. While bills are not as high as elsewhere in Europe, Norwegians are not immune from increasing energy prices. ""We currently pay 750 NOK (Â£63) a month for energy and warm water, but in Oslo prices are relatively low,"" says Magnus, 26, who lives in a studio apartment in the capital with his girlfriend. Norway's Equinor is Europe's second-largest gas supplier after Russia's Gazprom The couple are moving to a bigger flat in Bergen on the west coast and expect their bills to go up: ""When you live somewhere where fewer people are, then electricity is more expensive. That's why I'm thinking of just getting solar panels."" From 1 October, Norway will be able to export electricity to the UK via a ""North Sea link"" of underwater high-voltage electric cables connecting the two power grids. There have been concerns the recent UK price surge could spread to Norwegian households and industries. But one proposal to impose a tax on outgoing energy has been rejected, as Norway also needs to import energy in certain periods of the year.

Critics say the process is distressing, does not give claimants enough time to gather evidence to support their appeal and many wrong decisions continue to be made. Both the DWP and Northern Ireland's DfC said their decisions were overturned on appeal mainly because of new evidence submitted to tribunals but charities said that evidence should have been captured earlier in applications. ""Narrow questions and a sense of being under suspicion [during assessments] can make it hard for people to give a full account of the barriers they face,"" former DWP senior mental health policy adviser Tom Pollard said. Mark Jackson, policy and public affairs manager at the end of life charity Marie Curie, said the system was ""clearly broken"". He said: ""It is driving people into financial hardship at the end of their lives and forcing bereaved relatives to fight an injustice at the most difficult time of their lives."" The DWP said it supported ""millions of people a year"" and ""the vast majority of PIP cases were not appealed"". Recent changes included giving decision-makers more time to contact people to ask for further information to support their benefit claim. A spokesperson said the PIP assessment process was carried out by experienced health professionals, who consider how people are affected by their disability, rather than just the disability itself. They said more than double the proportion of PIP claimants received the top rates of support compared to those who received Disability Living Allowance. Northern Ireland's DfC said the most recent report received from the President of Appeal Tribunalson the standard of decision-making by the department,externalshowed decisions about PIP were correct in 96% of cases. The DfC said it was ""not aware of any evidence to suggest there was a correlation between the number of people who had died before their tribunal hearing and the standard of the original assessment"".

Children with Tourette's in Wales want more help,"This video can not be played Megan Jones has not been to school since June because of her tics and seizures Children and young people living with Tourette's syndrome in Wales say they need more support from the Welsh government. Megan Jones, 17, from Carmarthenshire, told BBC Wales there is a ""lack of knowledge and a lack of help"" for people like her. There is currently only one specialist in Wales, who does not treat children. The Welsh government said it was reviewing services and a new framework will improve access to support. Hywel Dda Health Board, which covers Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire, has been asked to comment. Sweet Anita: Tourette's queen of Twitch Meet TikTok's top voices of change 2020 What is Tourette Syndrome? Megan, from Llandysul, started experiencing tics in February last year. ""Head jerks... I whistle loads, when I say 'whitwoo' people know it's me. I punch things, I fall, I have loads of bruises... I click, I chat, I swear,"" she said. In May she started experiencing seizures, which now occur on a daily basis and are ""frustrating"". Megan Jones, 17, said there is not enough support for people with Tourette's Syndrome ""They're really bad, and it's really dangerous,"" she said. ""School don't let me go down town and off campus until I'm on the bus, and then on the bus I have friends who know everything they're supposed to do, and the bus driver knows everything too. ""It's really annoying, all of my friends are learning to drive, and I'm desperate but I can't, and that's the one thing I really want to do - I want to travel more, see the world, and I can't do that, I have no independence. ""It makes me sad and angry, I haven't asked for this."" Megan said she had been for ""loads"" of tests, but months later has had ""no answers"". ""I've had loads of tests, I ring and I ring and I ring, and there's no information,"" Megan explained. ""They still haven't had the results of my tests that I had months ago, and it took five months for me to even get the tests."" Helen Reeves-Graham has started a petition asking for a children's specialist in Wales Helen Reeves-Graham, from Pembrokeshire, has started a petition calling for a children's Tourette's syndrome specialist in Wales. She decided to start the petition after her 13-year-old daughter developed the condition during the first lockdown. ""Watching your child hitting themselves or not being able to hold a cup, or you know, be able to go to school, it's horrifying,"" she said. ""At the very least, we need access to a specialist in Wales. ""Our paediatrician is great, but she's asking me questions... I'm not a medical professional, I don't know what's what."" Speaking toBBC Radio Wales Breakfast, she said that ""for children, there is no specialist for Tourette's in Wales"". ""There is one for adults, he actually works part time as a GP and part time as an adult neurologist. ""Most of my information comes from trawling the internet, from charities and from other families who are going through the same thing."" She added she would like to see specific guidelines: ""I think that's probably the first thing that needs to happen, so people know where to go and what's going to happen - it doesn't matter where you live."" Ms Reeves-Graham has started a Facebook support group for people living with or caring for people with Tourette's syndrome in Wales. ""There's absolutely nothing,"" she said. ""I set up my own group... so I've got different other families that are willing to share their experiences, to help us and we'll help them. ""I don't know what to do without them."" Megan said a lack of support was stopping her from living the life she wanted to live. ""I want help really, I want a solution, to move forward, to go to university, and to go out into the world knowing what's wrong, knowing how to deal with it, especially when I'm on my own. It's really hard."" 'This is the real Tourette's' Tourette's sufferer 'wanted to cry with happiness' after treatment study Tourette's charity wants apology for Fringe joke The Welsh government said: ""We are committed to ensuring all children with a neurodevelopmental condition, including Tourette's syndrome, can access the services and care they need. ""Regional Partnership Boards are rolling out a new framework to improve access to the right support. ""As pressures on assessment and support services continue to increase, we are reviewing all children's and adults neurodevelopmental services, to identify where there are gaps in provision and the demand, capacity and design of services for children, young people and adults.

Petrol station closures spark lorry driver row,"This video can not be played ""The fuel is there, it can continue to flow"" â Transport Secretary Grant Shapps People should carry on buying petrol as normal, despite supply problems that have closed some stations, the government has said. A ""handful"" of BP stations, and a small number of Esso-owned Tesco Alliance stations, were closed on Thursday because of a lack of delivery drivers. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said refineries had ""plenty of petrol"". He told the BBC that the government could bring in the army to drive fuel tankers if it would help. It is estimated that the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers - with gaps made worse by the pandemic and Brexit. Other industries such as food processing have been impacted. Britain's biggest baker Warburtons has confirmed that the company is facing challenges recruiting lorry drivers and that the shortage is causing some disruption to its supply chain. The baker delivers to around 18,500 stores and says it can't deliver to a number of them. ""The national driver shortage continues to place a strain on the Warburtons distribution network but we are working incredibly hard to maintain a good level of service for our customers nationwide."" Reports in several newspapers have suggested that the government is considering getting soldiers to drive fuel tankers under emergency plans. When questioned about this on BBC Breakfast, Mr Shapps said: ""If it can actually help, we will bring them in."" However, he said there would be ""technicalities"" as to whether military personnel could switch to driving civilian vehicles. Why is there a shortage of lorry drivers? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Are there problems at the forecourt you use? Send your pictures toyourpics@bbc.co.uk,externalorupload your pictures/video here The AA said that most of the UK's forecourts were working as they should. ""There is no shortage of fuel and thousands of forecourts are operating normally with just a few suffering temporary supply chain problems,"" said AA president Edmund King. ""Fridays and the weekend always tend to be busier on forecourts, as drivers either combine filling up with shopping runs, prepare for weekend trips or refuel for the start of the new working week."" Mr King said drivers should not fill up outside their normal routines, because even if the occasional petrol station was temporarily closed, others just down the road would be open. ""It is now clear that there have been occasional delays over recent weeks that have been managed with hardly anyone noticing. This was a manageable problem."" There are about 8,380 petrol stations in the UK, according to the Petrol Retailers Association. Of these, about 1% are believed to be closed at the moment. It is understood that about 50 to 100 BP forecourts are affected by shortages, while Esso said ""a small number"" of its Tesco Alliance retail sites had been hit. Helena Wright is part of family firm W's Transport, based in north Norfolk Helena Wright, transport manager for Norfolk-based firm W's Transport, told the BBC her company had sold two lorries after advertising for HGV drivers and not getting a single applicant. ""Normally we would have people on record to call who had left their details,"" she said. ""This is the first time for our firm that that's happened, but it's a problem that has been a long time coming. ""I've got a lot of drivers that are over the age of 50, 55 and looking to retire and we are not attractive as an industry for the younger generation."" She said younger people were not prepared to spend four to five nights a week away from home and were not ready to put up with ""inhumane"" conditions. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has urged the government to relax visa restrictions for foreign workers in the short term to ease the driver shortage. But Mr Shapps told the BBC he did not want UK lorry drivers to ""drop out"" because of being ""undercut"" by cheaper EU labour. He said there were ""systemic problems"" in the haulage industry that needed to be resolved, pointing out that the profession was ""99% white male"" with an average age of 55, facing poor conditions and wages. Now, he said, pay was rising and there was ""a gradual increase"" in new drivers. While the UK does not lack petrol and diesel at refineries, getting it to forecourts has been difficult in some areas. It is the latest problem caused by driver shortages, which have already led to supply squeezes in other industries, including supermarkets. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""The supply issues affecting a small number of petrol forecourts shouldn't impact the prices drivers pay to fill up. ""But unfortunately the price of oil, which has the biggest influence on what drivers pay at the pumps, is continuing to rise at the moment. ""This may lead to fuel prices going up in the coming days, which would be yet more bad news for drivers, as a litre of unleaded is already over 21p a litre more expensive than a year ago."" The RHA's Rod McKenzie told BBC Breakfast more lorry drivers were leaving the profession each week than joining it. He said: ""It's as simple as this: everything we get in Britain comes on the back of a truck. ""So if there is a shortage of HGV drivers - and there is by 100,000 - then it is inevitable that we are not going to get all the things we want when we want them."" ""It is not a case of running out - and people should not panic buy,"" he added. He warned there would be glitches ""because the supply chain on which we all depend is creaking"". Supermarket Iceland - which is about 100 drivers short - joined Morrisons and Ocado in calling for the government to add HGV drivers tothe list of shortage occupations,external. That would allow foreign workers to apply for skilled worker visas to fill the current gaps. ""I think the solution - even if it's temporary - is very, very simple,"" said Iceland managing director Richard Walker. ""Let's get HGV drivers on to the skilled worker list."" The RHA's Mr McKenzie said that on top of a historic shortage of drivers, the industry had lost 20,000 European drivers because of Brexit, while the pandemic had forced 40,000 driver training tests to be cancelled. Ina recent RHA survey,externalof 616 hauliers, retiring colleagues and Brexit topped the list of reasons behind the driver shortages. Respondents also cited tax changes to rules known as IR35, which have made it more expensive for hauliers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. Businesses across the food, fuel and construction sectors have been warning about driver shortages for months. BP temporarily closed a number of petrol stations earlier in summer, when driver shortages also caused short-term supply problems for McDonald's, Nandos, and the pub chain Wetherspoons. Speaking on BBC Question Time on Thursday, Mr Shapps suggested visa changes would not solve the problem, but said nothing had been ruled out. But shadow justice secretary David Lammy said visas were needed in various sectors, telling Mr Shapps: ""You promised that immigration would come down and you know that it will need to go up if we are to deal with these problems."" Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said there was ""an endemic problem with retention and recruitment"" in the industry. ""We're actually not short of HGV drivers per se - we've got 600,000 people who are qualified to drive those big trucks, but only 300,000 people chose to work in the industry,"" he told the BBC. Mr Bridgen suggested the industry needed to modernise and improve working conditions to retain young drivers. In recent weeks, the Department for Transport has made it quicker for HGV drivers to get their licences, butthe RHA criticisedthe changes as a risk to road safety.

How can missing five million be persuaded to have the jab?,"Pop-up vaccine hubs have been set up in places such as south London The Covid debate has recently centred on whether teenagers should have the vaccine and when the most vulnerable will receive booster jabs. But a third group is of real concern among scientists and politicians - the five million or so adults yet to have a first dose. ""Amelia"", 34, has had about four months to get a coronavirus vaccine but so far has quietly refused. She does not want her identity revealed, because she is worried she will receive abuse. ""I do feel guilty,"" Amelia says. ""I never mention it to anyone, because I think they'll judge me or think I'm an anti-vaxxer. It does feel like I'm hiding from everyone. ""I am healthy and young and I don't like putting things in my body,"" she says, recalling refusing a flu jab when pregnant. ""I was fine, so I guess I think it'll be the same with coronavirus. ""I know I should get a vaccine. I thought I had built up the courage to do it on a few occasions. But then I saw something on social media which scared me and I couldn't - I'm petrified."" The UK has administered more than 48 million first doses so far. But attention is increasingly falling on those who haven't had it. Speculation has centred on which dancers on Strictly Come Dancing have so far not taken up the offer, as well as how many Premier League footballers are potentially unvaccinated. Exactly how many are yet to receive a Covid jab is unknown, but it's estimated it is more than five million people aged 16 and over in the UK. Multiple studies show coronavirus vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious illness and side-effects are rare. Immunologists say even if you have been infected naturally, vaccination will boost your immunity further. The reasons for not having the jab vary. A pop-up vaccine site in Newcastle upon Tyne A ""very small number"" of people are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons, according to the government, while behavioural psychologists say ""committed vaccine opponents"" who believe in conspiracy theories are unlikely to change their minds. But it's argued the unvaccinated who have safety concerns, or distrust institutions, those who are sceptical or indifferent, such as Amelia, could still be reached with the right support and access. So how do you convince someone to have the vaccine? Identifying a person's ""trigger"" motivation is seen as a highly effective way of tackling vaccine scepticism or indifference. ""This can be a wide range of things,"" says cognitive psychologist Stephan Lewandowsky, from Bristol University. Research suggests reminding people of the common good - protecting a grandparent or parent - helps them realise ""they have a social responsibility - and they may be more willing"". ""Some can't be bothered - but if it's around the corner and you give them a free hotdog, like in Germany, then that can be really successful."" Amelia says her trigger would be not being able to go on holiday without having had a vaccine. How many people have been vaccinated so far? Under-30s vaccine questions answered The vaccine fertility myths that just won't go away And in some areas of the UK, schemes have been running to find people like Amelia and work out what their trigger points may be. In South Tyneside, teams spent the summer going door to door and stopping people in the street to try to maximise vaccine take-up and reduce high coronavirus rates. They quickly noticed those failing to come forward were mostly young men from poorer areas. In one of the most deprived wards, Simonside and Rekendyke, only 48% of men aged 18-29 and 39% of men aged 16-17 have had a first dose. But in the least deprived, Cleadon and East Boldon, the proportions are 83% and 79%. ""The lesson is clear - there is a clear, direct relationship between the level of deprivation and vaccine uptake, among young men at least,"" Matt Brown, from the South Tyneside Clinical Commissioning Group, says. ""The gap between young women is far less dramatic. These young men don't understand Covid-19 can cause them serious harm and are also perhaps in jobs where you can't take an hour off work to get a vaccine."" To reach this group, pop-up vaccine sites have been set up in places such as pubs and outside Newcastle United's football stadium, St James' Park. The team also tries to have people on hand who can speak foreign languages, including Urdu and Polish, as well as clinicians who can deal with medical questions. ""Our focus is to help young people understand the risks,"" Matt says. A team in south London is also trying to locate the elusive vaccine hesitant. Lambeth is a young and diverse borough and data for England shows vaccine take-up is lower among younger age groups and those belonging to certain ethnic minorities. However, staff on the ground prefer to take a more universal approach. ""This is not about just one ethnicity,"" Lambeth Clinical Commission Group community pharmacist Ash Soni says. ""This is not about just one age - this is about reaching our entire population."" Ash Soni and the ""worry bus"" One of the borough's pop-up vaccine services is a blue bus with the word ""welcome"" dotted on it in different languages. Nicknamed the ""worry bus"", it parks outside mosques, Tube stations and supermarkets. Trained staff speak to passers-by who have not yet been vaccinated and ask them why, without judgement or pressure. ""We've heard so many reasons,"" Mr Soni says. ""Some people fear the vaccine is too new, so we talk about how it has been created and rigorously tested. ""We hear from people who fear the vaccine puts a microchip in them and we explain that is false - where would we even fit it?"" This ""cycle of change"", or finding a person's trigger, can take time, patience and multiple conversations - but experts say most do eventually come round. Earlier this month, the prime minister and his advisersannounced their winter plan, emphasising the importance of reaching those who had so far not taken up the offer of a jab. Pushing vaccination levels up was the key to maintaining lighter controls, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said. ""Trying to persuade those people it is the right thing to do to get vaccinated would make a significant difference."" For Amelia, ""the cons outweigh the pros"" - at least for now. ""If they said I couldn't go on holiday to Disneyland with my kids without a vaccine then that would sway it for me,"" she says. ""One morning I think I will wake up and decide to do it. I'm just not there yet."" How many people have had boosters so far? When can teenagers get a second dose?

Why are gas prices high and what's the energy price cap?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.
