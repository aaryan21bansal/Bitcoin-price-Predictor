Boohoo says clothes price differences 'a mistake',"This coat was advertised for Â£99 at Coast, left and Â£79 at Oasis Identical clothing was sold at different prices across Boohoo's brands due to a ""genuine mistake and not business practice"", the retailer says. The same coat was sold byDorothy Perkins at Â£55 and Coast at Â£89and the Coast item had the brand name cut off. Joanna Sikora ordered a skirt fromKaren Millen and found it had an Oasis labelwith that branding crossed out. Boohoo said it had not realised its companies had bought the same items and branded and priced them differently. It comes as the BBC was sent further examples of coats on the Oasis and Coast websites at different prices. Jess, who asked us not to use her last name, spotted the khaki coats pictured, which have since been removed from both sites. She said: ""You buy a brand in good faith that what you are getting is exclusive to the company. I initially assumed that the previous instances were a slight mix up, however after finding these myself I now realise that this is common practice in Boohoo. It doesn't speak well for the company if fooling the customer is their main method for turning a profit."" This coat was advertised at different prices on the Oasis website, left and Coast right Boohoo said these coats were part of an issue that arose when the coronavirus pandemic hit. The closure of non-essential stores to stop the spread of Covid sawthousands of High Street fashion chains shut their shops for good. Boohoo bought up the online businesses of some of the fashion brands that went into administration. Most recently, it boughtDorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton from Arcadia.It acquiredKaren Millen and Coast in August 2019. Retailers that were forced to close their doors cancelled their orders with suppliers, a statement from Boohoo said. These suppliers then offered products they had already made for sale to other retailers that were still trading, it said. Some of Boohoo's brands bought some of this excess stock to fill gaps in their ranges as clothing stock began to run down. ""Our mistake was not realising that some of our brands had purchased the same items from suppliers,"" the statement said. ""Therefore we failed to make sure prices were the same across our group of brands."" Boohoo said the problem affected ""about 10 lines out of thousands"", it was confident the issue was fixed and has apologised to customers. Boohoo and BoohooMan Coast Karen Millen Dorothy Perkins Warehouse Oasis Wallis Burton Debenhams PrettyLittleThing NastyGal MissPap It is not an offence for different retailers to sell the same item at different prices even if they are owned by the same company. But ""it could be misleading if consumers think they are buying a particular brand, when this is not the case,"" said Sylvia Rook, a lead officer from the Chartered Trading Standards institute. ""Consumers may expect that items from one retail outlet are superior to another, and therefore be willing to pay a premium for this,"" she said. A trader could be in breach of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 if an advert misleads consumers and causes them, either to make a purchase they would not have made, or to pay a higher price,"" she explained. Boohoo to probe price differences for same clothes Boohoo clothes pricing: 'I felt lied to' Boohoo slashes UK supplier network after Leicester failings Oli Townsend, assistant deals and features editor at MoneySavingExpert.com said irregular pricing was not unique to one group. In 2019, an MSE investigation foundshoppers were paying up to 34% more for the exact same item at Littlewoods compared to Very,external- even though both are owned by the same company. Mr Townsend said: ""There's a question of ethics when there's such a price disparity between retailers under the same parent company - especially when in some cases they may share the same warehouse, courier and returns department. ""These brands risk their customers feeling ripped off and losing trust in that brand."" He said MSE encouraged shoppers to do price comparisons online to make sure they were getting the best deal. ""But if some retailers are cutting off or obscuring the original brand name, it makes this difficult and puts consumers at a disadvantage,"" he said. Adam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said customers would ""understandably see this practice as dishonest"". He said: ""Companies who switch items between brands for different prices and cover up or remove the previous label risk losing consumer trust.""

'Woods crashed his car at 84-87mph',"This video can not be played Tiger Woods suffered serious injuries in the crash Tiger Woods was driving close to double the 45mph speed limit when he crashed in February, according to Los Angeles County's sheriff. The 15-time major champion, 45, had to be ""extricated from the wreck"" of his car by firefighters and paramedics. Woods' car left the road at about 84-87mph and flipped several times during the accident in California. Woods was released from hospital earlier this month after sustaining a number of serious injuries. There was no evidence Woods had been impaired by drugs or alcohol at the time of the crash. LA County sheriff Alex Villanueva said: ""The primary causal factor for this traffic collision was driving at a speed unsafe for the road conditions and the inability to negotiate the curve of the roadway."" Police await permission to share findings from Woods crash This video can not be played Tiger Woods: Car crashes and comebacks Woods' car crossed the centre-divider before coming to rest several hundred feet away, having hit a tree and rolling several times during the accident in Ranchos Palos Verdes. The American required surgery after suffering open leg fractures as well as injuries to his foot and ankle. In addition to the speed at the first area of impact occurring at up to 87mph, sheriff Villanueva added the ""estimated speed when the vehicle struck the tree was 75mph"". LASD Captain James Powers said: ""The car's so-called 'black box' data recorder showed Woods engaged the accelerator and never applied the brake during the incident. That could indicate he may have mistakenly hit the wrong pedal while trying to control the car."" Powers added: ""It's believed that when you panic or you have some sort of sudden interruption while you're driving, your initial thought is to hit the brake and it's believed he may have done that but hit the accelerator."" There were were no citations issued because there were no witnesses to the incident. Woods tweeted his thanks on Wednesday to those who assisted his rescue, adding: ""I will continue to focus on my recovery and family, and thank everyone for the overwhelming support and encouragement I've received throughout this very difficult time."" The former world number one and 2019 Masters champion, who the LASD said was ""fortunate to be alive"" following the incident on 23 February, was the sole occupant in his vehicle and was wearing his seatbelt. Woods was involved in a car crash in November 2009 which eventually led to admissions of infidelity and the breakdown of his marriage. He then took a break from golf but returned shortly afterwards. In 2017, he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence when he was found asleep at the wheel of his car. He later pleaded guilty to reckless driving.

Kardashian tries to get photo wiped off the web,"As a member of one of the most famous and glamorous families on the planet, Khloe Kardashian is rarely pictured looking less than a million dollars. The TV star and social media influencer and her team usually know how to produce the impossibly perfect image. So after an unfiltered picture was shared to her social media ""by mistake"" they were keen to have it taken down. They have asked social media platforms to remove it, although their efforts have spurred others to repost it. The natural-looking family photo showed the 36-year-old by a pool in a bikini. The star appeared unusually unairbrushed: more like an image you would see from your friend's lockdown lido swim session than from any of the Kardashians' previous personal campaign shots for their various brands. Kardashian's team said this week the photo infringed her copyright. Can celebrities control their image online? Kardashian says image pressure 'too much to bear' ""The color edited photo was taken of Khloe during a private family gathering and posted to social media without permission by mistake by an assistant,"" Tracy Romulus, chief marketing officer for KKW Brands, toldPage Six,external. ""Khloe looks beautiful but it is within the right of the copyright owner to not want an image not intended to be published taken down."" According to Twitter, the photo is subject to a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice. ""Per our copyright policy, we respond to valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorized representatives,"" a Twitter spokeswoman told BBC News on Wednesday. Some users who posted it found the picture had been replaced by a message saying: ""This image has been removed in response to a report from the copyright holder."" It also disappeared from Reddit, with a message saying it was ""removed in response to a copyright claim by a third party"". But others reposted it, while media websites including Page Six also published it. Elizabeth Ward, the boss of intellectual property lawyers Virtuoso Legal, said any attempts to remove the photo may only serve to draw more attention to it. ""Quite frankly they're trying to put the finger in the dike that's already broken,"" she told the BBC. ""If this is so widely spread they're never going to put the toothpaste back in the tube. ""What's quite interesting about it from a legal perspective is it doesn't actually say who was taking the photograph - it says she owns the copyright. The first owner of copyright is normally the photographer, so if I took a photo of Khloe Kardashian I own the copyright, so it would be my copyright to do as I wanted."" Sisters Kim, Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian Speaking as a mum of a teenage daughter, Ms Ward said she felt it was ""so sad"" this was an issue at all, due to the widespread use of approved images online that appear to have been ""tampered with"" in some way. ""They're not natural, they're all photoshopped, and every teenage girl that you ask seems to know,"" she said. ""But it's in their face day in, day out, so it must have an effect on them - that unnatural, unrealistic sort of image."" The complicated truth about social media and body image Eric Schiffer, chairman the Los Angeles-based Reputation Management Consultants, agreed that the key was to never let what he called ""digital spill"" happen in the first place. But once it has occurred, too much press attention, he said, ""can create an amplification that can [cause] tremendous heartache for a period of time"". ""Ultimately the law and the tools are on the side of a firm that is able to eviscerate any digital history, but not without some cycles, because the media can take a shot of it [and then] it becomes a public domain issue,"" Mr Schiffer added. ""And then the press is not likely to delete an image because it falls under fair use."" The issue of whether there was any problem with the image itself was down to how Khloe wished to be perceived, he added. ""Does she want to relate to fans on the most authentic level?"" he asked. ""Overall the brand is oriented that way, but she does have an aspect that is hyper glamorous and depending upon her own discretionary desires, this picture may just made bother her. ""I mean, there's a narcissistic element to these things and I suspect that this is one where it's just not the image she wants for a host of reasons.""

"Dialogue needed with police 'at all levels'The Policing Board chair calls for a redoubling of efforts to calm loyalist tensions, after recent violence.Northern Ireland","There was a police presence in parts of Larne on Tuesday night The NI Policing Board chairman has called for a redoubling of efforts to calm loyalist tensions and for dialogue with police at all levels of the force. First Minister Arlene Foster hascondemned the recent loyalist violence, but has not spoken to Chief Constable Simon Byrne. Mr Byrne briefed the Policing Board on Wednesday about the trouble over the Easter period in a private session. Forty-one police officers have been hurtand 10 people arrested. There were no reports of serious disorder on Tuesday night, but police maintained a presence in many areas. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken said the fact that Mrs Foster had not engaged with Mr Byrne in the wake of the violence was a mistake. ""I have issues with the chief constable because of past actions and decisions, but that should not be the cause for us to refuse to engage,"" Mr Aiken said. ""He is the head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and while he is in post, we should continue to work with him and all his officers."" Following the Policing Board meeting, chair Doug Garrett said members were unanimous in their condemnation of the recent disorder. Chief Constable Simon Byrne has come under pressure to step down in recent days ""At this time, there must be a redoubling of efforts to calm tensions and for continued dialogue between the community and police officers at all levels of the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland),"" Mr Garrett said. ""Nothing is achieved without talking, and leadership is needed from all those with influence so that any concerns can be addressed through the democratic structures in place; and through the board mechanisms for policing oversight and accountability."" Some have linked the violence in parts of greater Belfast and Londonderry in recent days to the decision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to prosecute anyone who attended the funeral of former IRA man Bobby Storey in June 2020. NI assembly to be recalled over loyalist violence PSNI say 41 officers injured during NI rioting It was attended by 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) is to examine the PSNI's role in the funeral, after being called in by Justice Minister Naomi Long at the request of the Policing Board. The Policing Board meeting was an opportunity in private session - it lasted about 90 minutes - for the chief constable to update the 19-member board on the events of the last number of days. It was a factual analysis. He pointed out that 41 officers had been injured in a range of violent incidents. This was not a re-examination or a questioning of policing around the Bobby Storey funeral, although I'm told that some members did express support for the chief constable, while others obviously didn't. Board chairman Doug Garrett said afterwards that members were unanimous in condemnation of the violence. He did say that there must be a redoubling of efforts to calm tensions and that nothing is achieved without talking. That will be seen, certainly in some quarters, as implied criticism of Arlene Foster's position in terms of not talking to the chief constable. Mrs Long has asked it to complete the inspection ""by no later than May 14"". Last week, Mr Byrneexpressed surpriseat the conclusion by the PPS. Mr Garrett told BBC's Evening Extra programme that it was ""not an ideal position"" for senior politicians and police not to talk. Mrs Foster earlier reiterated her calls for the chief constable to step down. The leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), UUP, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) and Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) have said Mr Byrne's position is untenable over the PSNI's handling of the funeral. On Wednesday, Jonathan Powell, the former adviser to Tony Blair at the time of the Good Friday Agreement, said politics has got ""quite hot"" again in Northern Ireland and people are ""playing with matches"". ""Politicians trying to second guess the police when they're making operational decisions is really a mistake and I hope that the first minister will back off on this and allow the police to proceed with their job,"" Mr Powell said. It was view shared by former NI Secretary Shaun Woodward, who said it was ""potentially a dangerous situation"". ""There's a moment here, where, to borrow Jonathan Powell's words, you need to state your position but now back off,"" he said. ""Continuing to needle this particular thing will undo much greater issues of community policing in Northern Ireland."" Petrol bombs were thrown at police in Carrickfergus on Monday night Mrs Foster said she had a duty to speak out about the PSNI's failure to uphold Covid restrictions during Bobby Storey's funeral. ""The police, of course, have my full support,"" Mrs Foster told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, but added that ordinary police officers had been let down by their senior management. Mrs Foster said Mr Byrne had not asked to meet her and she had not asked to meet him. ""I have spoken to him [Simon Byrne] on many occasions and told him that the differential treatment for Sinn FÃ©in has to stop,"" Mrs Foster said. ""He has been warned about it on a number of occasions. However, it continues to happen. That sort of specialised treatment for a political elite is very, very damaging."" A phone box was destroyed during disorder in Londonderry on Monday night Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Dowd said at a time when the police were ""under nightly attack"" from loyalists, it would be ""helpful and send out the right signals"" if the first minister would agree to meet the chief constable, along with the deputy first minister. Mr O'Dowd said such a meeting would ""show unity of purpose across the board, across the political spectrum"". He said it would ""ensure that those who are orchestrating this violence, those who are putting petrol bombs into the hands of 12-year-olds, get a very, very clear message that it's not acceptable"". DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell told BBC's Talkback programme that he had no doubt that Mrs Foster will speak to the chief constable. He said ongoing loyalist violence may be hampering unionist efforts to force Mr Byrne to resign. Justice Minister Naomi Long told the Today programme that policing had been ""undoubtedly"" politicised at a difficult time.""When any politician declares they have no confidence in the chief constable that is a very serious matter, and when that is the first minister of Northern Ireland, that becomes even more serious. ""It is incumbent on all of us in public life and those of us in positions of leadership not simply to declare whether or not we believe the chief constable has our confidence, but to work to ensure that he has the confidence of the public and of the community."" Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? Why a Brexit trade deal is different for NI The disorder has also been linked to loyalist frustrations over the Northern Ireland Protocol in the Brexit deal. HMIC was called in by Justice Minister Naomi Long at the request of the Policing Board The NI Protocol has increased checks and caused disruption for some goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, creating an Irish Sea border. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said politicians need to ""dial down"" the rhetoric around Brexit and policing. ""We can't use that kind of language, calling for people to resign, calling for protocols to be scrapped that are never going to be scrapped,"" he said.""Eleven year olds with petrol bombs don't understand the intricacies of the trading relationship between Northern Ireland and Britain or Northern Ireland and the EU, but tension has been whipped up by politicians."" Shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said the prime minister should be speaking out about the recent violence. ""The consequences of Brexit always had the potential to upset the very delicate balance of identities in Northern Ireland,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle.""I don't think enough consideration was given to the consequences of the border down the Irish Sea."" NI Secretary Brandon Lewis tweeted that he was being kept ""closely appraised"" of developments by the PSNI and that he was appalled that officers had been injured. Meanwhile, the HMIC review into the Bobby Storey policing operation will examine whether the PSNI's approach ""was within the parameters of national policing standards in the context of the Covid health protection regulations"", according to the Department of Justice. It will also ""offer relevant learning"" to assist policing the regulations going forward.

Imran Khan criticised for rape 'victim blaming',"Prime Minister Imran Khan said temptation should be removed as ""not everyone has willpower"" Human rights groups in Pakistan have accused Prime Minister Imran Khan of being a ""rape apologist"" after he blamed a rise in sexual assault cases on how women dress. During a live television interview, he advised women to cover up to prevent temptation. Mr Khan added ""in any society where vulgarity is prevalent, there are consequences."" Hundreds of people have signed a statement demanding an apology. Pakistan is ranked as one of the most dangerous countries in the world for women in terms of safety and equality. Sexual abuse,so-called ""honour"" killingsand forced marriage are common, and criminal complaints are rarely reported to police, or seriously investigated. In a two-hour-long, question-and-answer interview with the public on live television, Imran Khan was asked what steps his government had taken to prevent sexual abuse. After denouncing crimes against women and children, he said that sexual violence was a result of ""increasing obscenity"", adding it was a product of India, the West and Hollywood movies. The girl paraded naked for 'honour' How a rape was filmed and shared in Pakistan The prime minister said women in Pakistan should remove ""temptation"" because ""not everyone has willpower"". He said women should observe purdah - a term referring to women wearing modest clothes around men or segregation between sexes. This video can not be played Five things to know about Imran Khan (from 2018) Last year Imran Khan was criticised following a similar national television interview, where he failed to challenge a Muslim cleric's opinion that women were to blame for the coronavirus pandemic. A statement condemning the prime minister's comments,externaland demanding an apology has been co-signed by multiple human rights organisations and hundreds of individuals. It said his words were ""factually incorrect, insensitive and dangerous"" and ""actively fostered and promoted rape culture"". ""Such statements have the effect of further traumatizing and silencing survivors of sexual violence by placing the blame on them, instead of on those who carry out the crime and the system that enables rapists,"" it reads. Soon after his comments, there was widespread outrage on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Journalist Zahid Hussain wrote in his column in Pakistan's leading newspaper, Dawn,,externalthat ""Imran Khan's views on rape are not very different from the callous comments made by a former Lahore police chief about the Motorway gang rape last year. He blamed the victim for driving late at night. His comments reflected the thinking of a large segment of society that prefers to blame the victim."" Comments made by a police officer following the Motorway gang rape sparked protests across Pakistan TheMotorway gang rape, which sent shockwaves throughout Pakistan, has become a key example of the violence perpetrated against women, and the attitudes towards it by some senior officials. In September 2020, a Pakistani-French mother and her two children were parked on the side of a highway near Lahore, waiting for help after running out of fuel. Two men broke into the car, robbed them and raped the woman in front of her children. In several TV interviews, Lahore's most senior police officer, Umer Sheikh, questioned why the victim had not taken a busier road or checked her fuel before departing, implying the woman was to blame. The case sparked massive protests, as women took to the streets to voice their anger and demand change. The outcry led to new anti-rape measures, including the creation of a national sex offenders register, the protection of victims' identities, and allowing chemical castration of some offenders. There are at least 11 rape cases reported in Pakistan every day, according to official statistics. Over 22,000 rape cases were reported to police across the country in the past six years, however, only 77 accused have been convicted , which is 0.3% of the total figure.

Woods drove at almost double speed limit in crash,"This video can not be played Tiger Woods suffered serious injuries in the crash Tiger Woods was driving close to double the 45mph speed limit when he crashed in February, according to Los Angeles County's sheriff. The 15-time major champion, 45, had to be ""extricated from the wreck"" of his car by firefighters and paramedics. Woods' car left the road at about 84-87mph and flipped several times during the accident in California. Woods was released from hospital earlier this month after sustaining a number of serious injuries. There was no evidence Woods had been impaired by drugs or alcohol at the time of the crash. LA County sheriff Alex Villanueva said: ""The primary causal factor for this traffic collision was driving at a speed unsafe for the road conditions and the inability to negotiate the curve of the roadway."" Police await permission to share findings from Woods crash This video can not be played Tiger Woods: Car crashes and comebacks Woods' car crossed the centre-divider before coming to rest several hundred feet away, having hit a tree and rolling several times during the accident in Ranchos Palos Verdes. The American required surgery after suffering open leg fractures as well as injuries to his foot and ankle. In addition to the speed at the first area of impact occurring at up to 87mph, sheriff Villanueva added the ""estimated speed when the vehicle struck the tree was 75mph"". LASD Captain James Powers said: ""The car's so-called 'black box' data recorder showed Woods engaged the accelerator and never applied the brake during the incident. That could indicate he may have mistakenly hit the wrong pedal while trying to control the car."" Powers added: ""It's believed that when you panic or you have some sort of sudden interruption while you're driving, your initial thought is to hit the brake and it's believed he may have done that but hit the accelerator."" There were were no citations issued because there were no witnesses to the incident. Woods tweeted his thanks on Wednesday to those who assisted his rescue, adding: ""I will continue to focus on my recovery and family, and thank everyone for the overwhelming support and encouragement I've received throughout this very difficult time."" The former world number one and 2019 Masters champion, who the LASD said was ""fortunate to be alive"" following the incident on 23 February, was the sole occupant in his vehicle and was wearing his seatbelt. Woods was involved in a car crash in November 2009 which eventually led to admissions of infidelity and the breakdown of his marriage. He then took a break from golf but returned shortly afterwards. In 2017, he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence when he was found asleep at the wheel of his car. He later pleaded guilty to reckless driving.

Plaid promises independence vote in five years,"Adam Price says a Plaid Cymru government will ""empower the people of Wales"" Plaid Cymru would hold an independence referendum within five years if it came to power in May's Senedd election. Launching itsmanifesto,external, the party said it offered the ""most radical programme"" in ""any Welsh election since 1945"". Its plans include creating 60,000 green jobs, extending free school meals and social care free at the point of need. Economists cost checking the promises called them ""achievable"" but could not say if ""the spending is adequate to achieve the desired results"". Launching the manifesto, in Cardiff Bay, Plaid leader Adam Price said the ""practical, deliverable and fully costed policies"" would lead to a ""fairer, greener, and more prosperous future for Wales"". Plaid Cymru bids for indy-curious Labour votes Who is Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price? Plaid promises meals for all primary school pupils Mr Price said his party would deliver a referendum within the next Senedd term if it was in government after 6 May. ""We believe independence to be the only sure and sustainable means to achieving social and economic progress,"" he said. ""So, a Plaid Cymru government will empower the people of Wales to decide the future of our nation in an independence referendum."" He added: ""Wales has incredible potential as a nation. The problems that we have had for generations are not inevitable. ""We can solve these problems, together. But the first step is electing a new government that has the ambition to build a new Wales that's better than the old."" Adam Price has put independence front and centre of Plaid policy since becoming leader in 2018 Mr Price told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers that Wales needed new leadership after years of Welsh Labour-led governments. He said: ""I'm not prepared to accept defeat. The only way that we're going to put Wales on a different path is if we change the political leadership of Wales and have a government that has the vision and ambition for Wales that has sadly been lacking in the last two decades."" He said the ""central question"" for Wales is how to put the country on a ""different"" economic trajectory. He confirmed that if he was the next first minister, he would also take on the role of economy minister. ""For too long we have been under-delivering in terms of quality jobs and decent wages for our communities and that is the central task of the next government of Wales,"" he said. The manifesto's five main policies areas are: a Welsh Green Deal creating up to 60,000 new jobs; a youth jobs guarantee for 16 to 24-year-olds; zero interest loans to support small businesses to bounce back from the Covid pandemic and the creation of Prosperity Wales (an economic delivery agency) extending free school meals to all primary pupils; investing in 4,500 extra teachers and support staff, and providing free childcare from 24 months cutting average council tax bills; introducing a weekly child payment rising to Â£35 a week, and delivering 50,000 social and affordable homes providing social care free at the point of need; training and recruiting an extra 1,000 doctors and 5,000 nurses and allied health professionals and guaranteeing a Â£10 an hour minimum wage for care workers establishing an energy development company, Ynni Cymru, so that 100% of electricity in Wales comes from renewables by 2035, and introducing a Nature Act with statutory targets to restore biodiversity by 2050 The pledges include a promise to spend Â£6bn on a ""green economic stimulus"" to help create 60,000 new jobs, including Â£4bn on infrastructure. Other pledges include helping Wales take part in Eurovision, and working towards a country ""transformed"" with racism eradicated by 2030. Read more on the key points from the manifestohere. Plaid's manifesto is a hefty document, running to 126 pages, and is full of lofty pledges. It says it wants to ""transform"" Wales by 2030 with a long table of possible improvements to the country's economy and society. The document aims to set out a positive vision for Wales' future, and at its heart is significant constitutional change, pulling Wales out of the UK. But that would need the UK government to come to agreement on a referendum, and for Plaid to win a majority. The latter is something no party has ever done, outright, in the Senedd. If it was able to put the manifesto into practice, Plaid might have to pick and choose what to run with. So its handy for any future negotiations with other parties that Plaid's shopping list has a lot of options to choose from. The party says its ""fully costed"" manifesto pledges had been ""independently verified by two of Wales' leading economists"". According to Prof Brian Morgan and Prof Gerry Holtham, the party says it would borrow Â£4bn to support its Â£6bn economic stimulus. They concluded that Plaid's current spending commitments ""seem achievable"". But they go on to say that the ""areas of greatest uncertainty surround the borrowing target and the estimates of efficiency savings"". WALES ELECTION: THE BASICS What elections are happening?On 6 May, people across Wales will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party or parties that can command the support of a majority of members will form the Welsh government.Find out more here. What powers does the Welsh Parliament have?MSs pass laws on many aspects of day-to-day life in Wales, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes. Defence, foreign policy and immigration are decided by the UK Parliament. How do I vote?Anyone who lives in Wales and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election.You can register to vote online,external. The authors say Plaid Cymru's proposed efficiency savings of 1% per year - aimed at helping to fund some of the manifesto promises - ""have not been specified in any detail"". On the party's infrastructure proposals, the economists warn most borrowing would have to be through ""private finance"" which would be costly and take more time. ""We remain doubtful that the proposed borrowing programme could be completed within a single term of the Senedd,"" they say. They also note that the assumptions around the block grant, the sum of money received from the UK Treasury providing the majority of Welsh government funds, is ""optimistic"" but ""not unreasonable,"" with the savings target ""challenging"" but ""not impossible"". Some manifesto promises, they note, also depend on specific UK government decisions that ""cannot be taken for granted"". The document does not cost the independence referendum proposals.

Andy Marsh said it was a ""difficult decision"" but it was time for ""a new challenge"". He has held the role since February 2016 and will leave at the beginning of July. The past year has seen the force face large protests and disorder including the recentKill the Bill violence. Unrest following multiple protests against the government's new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill in Bristol led to claims that policing hadbeen too aggressive. Mr Marsh said dispersing protesters when gatherings were forbidden under lockdown rules was ""what our communities expect us to do"". Kill the Bill protests in Bristol have seen riot police deployed regularly over the past three weeks Avon and Somerset Police's senior management was also criticised for failing to intervene to stop Black Lives Matter protesters throwing astatue of slave trader Edward Colstoninto Bristol Harbour last summer. Defending his officers' actions that day, Mr Marsh said any intervention by them would have""risked a violent confrontation"". ""Had they [police officers] intervened the consequences might have been incredibly serious and we might have become the epicentre of a new wave of protests around the whole world,"" he said. ""It's been the honour of a lifetime to lead a force filled with officers, staff and volunteers who live and breathe our values,"" said Mr Marsh. He joined Avon and Somerset Police as a new recruit in 1987 before being appointed Assistant Chief Constable at Wiltshire Police in 2006. The statue of Edward Colston was torn down and thrown into Bristol Harbour in June 2020 After serving as Deputy Chief Constable and then Chief Constable at Hampshire Police, he returned to Avon and Somerset to take on his current role. ""To leave a force I first joined in 1987 has been a difficult decision to make, but I feel it is the right time for me to embark on a new challenge and for another person to take the helm,"" said Mr Marsh. Mr Marsh received the Queen's Police Medal in 2018 and said that he was proud of what the constabulary had achieved in his time as Chief Constable, describing his time with the force as ""the honour of a lifetime"".

Arlene Foster 'wrong' not to talk to police chief,"There was a police presence in parts of Larne on Tuesday night The NI Policing Board chairman has called for a redoubling of efforts to calm loyalist tensions and for dialogue with police at all levels of the force. First Minister Arlene Foster hascondemned the recent loyalist violence, but has not spoken to Chief Constable Simon Byrne. Mr Byrne briefed the Policing Board on Wednesday about the trouble over the Easter period in a private session. Forty-one police officers have been hurtand 10 people arrested. There were no reports of serious disorder on Tuesday night, but police maintained a presence in many areas. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken said the fact that Mrs Foster had not engaged with Mr Byrne in the wake of the violence was a mistake. ""I have issues with the chief constable because of past actions and decisions, but that should not be the cause for us to refuse to engage,"" Mr Aiken said. ""He is the head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and while he is in post, we should continue to work with him and all his officers."" Following the Policing Board meeting, chair Doug Garrett said members were unanimous in their condemnation of the recent disorder. Chief Constable Simon Byrne has come under pressure to step down in recent days ""At this time, there must be a redoubling of efforts to calm tensions and for continued dialogue between the community and police officers at all levels of the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland),"" Mr Garrett said. ""Nothing is achieved without talking, and leadership is needed from all those with influence so that any concerns can be addressed through the democratic structures in place; and through the board mechanisms for policing oversight and accountability."" Some have linked the violence in parts of greater Belfast and Londonderry in recent days to the decision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to prosecute anyone who attended the funeral of former IRA man Bobby Storey in June 2020. NI assembly to be recalled over loyalist violence PSNI say 41 officers injured during NI rioting It was attended by 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) is to examine the PSNI's role in the funeral, after being called in by Justice Minister Naomi Long at the request of the Policing Board. The Policing Board meeting was an opportunity in private session - it lasted about 90 minutes - for the chief constable to update the 19-member board on the events of the last number of days. It was a factual analysis. He pointed out that 41 officers had been injured in a range of violent incidents. This was not a re-examination or a questioning of policing around the Bobby Storey funeral, although I'm told that some members did express support for the chief constable, while others obviously didn't. Board chairman Doug Garrett said afterwards that members were unanimous in condemnation of the violence. He did say that there must be a redoubling of efforts to calm tensions and that nothing is achieved without talking. That will be seen, certainly in some quarters, as implied criticism of Arlene Foster's position in terms of not talking to the chief constable. Mrs Long has asked it to complete the inspection ""by no later than May 14"". Last week, Mr Byrneexpressed surpriseat the conclusion by the PPS. Mr Garrett told BBC's Evening Extra programme that it was ""not an ideal position"" for senior politicians and police not to talk. Mrs Foster earlier reiterated her calls for the chief constable to step down. The leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), UUP, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) and Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) have said Mr Byrne's position is untenable over the PSNI's handling of the funeral. On Wednesday, Jonathan Powell, the former adviser to Tony Blair at the time of the Good Friday Agreement, said politics has got ""quite hot"" again in Northern Ireland and people are ""playing with matches"". ""Politicians trying to second guess the police when they're making operational decisions is really a mistake and I hope that the first minister will back off on this and allow the police to proceed with their job,"" Mr Powell said. It was view shared by former NI Secretary Shaun Woodward, who said it was ""potentially a dangerous situation"". ""There's a moment here, where, to borrow Jonathan Powell's words, you need to state your position but now back off,"" he said. ""Continuing to needle this particular thing will undo much greater issues of community policing in Northern Ireland."" Petrol bombs were thrown at police in Carrickfergus on Monday night Mrs Foster said she had a duty to speak out about the PSNI's failure to uphold Covid restrictions during Bobby Storey's funeral. ""The police, of course, have my full support,"" Mrs Foster told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, but added that ordinary police officers had been let down by their senior management. Mrs Foster said Mr Byrne had not asked to meet her and she had not asked to meet him. ""I have spoken to him [Simon Byrne] on many occasions and told him that the differential treatment for Sinn FÃ©in has to stop,"" Mrs Foster said. ""He has been warned about it on a number of occasions. However, it continues to happen. That sort of specialised treatment for a political elite is very, very damaging."" A phone box was destroyed during disorder in Londonderry on Monday night Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Dowd said at a time when the police were ""under nightly attack"" from loyalists, it would be ""helpful and send out the right signals"" if the first minister would agree to meet the chief constable, along with the deputy first minister. Mr O'Dowd said such a meeting would ""show unity of purpose across the board, across the political spectrum"". He said it would ""ensure that those who are orchestrating this violence, those who are putting petrol bombs into the hands of 12-year-olds, get a very, very clear message that it's not acceptable"". DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell told BBC's Talkback programme that he had no doubt that Mrs Foster will speak to the chief constable. He said ongoing loyalist violence may be hampering unionist efforts to force Mr Byrne to resign. Justice Minister Naomi Long told the Today programme that policing had been ""undoubtedly"" politicised at a difficult time.""When any politician declares they have no confidence in the chief constable that is a very serious matter, and when that is the first minister of Northern Ireland, that becomes even more serious. ""It is incumbent on all of us in public life and those of us in positions of leadership not simply to declare whether or not we believe the chief constable has our confidence, but to work to ensure that he has the confidence of the public and of the community."" Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? Why a Brexit trade deal is different for NI The disorder has also been linked to loyalist frustrations over the Northern Ireland Protocol in the Brexit deal. HMIC was called in by Justice Minister Naomi Long at the request of the Policing Board The NI Protocol has increased checks and caused disruption for some goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, creating an Irish Sea border. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said politicians need to ""dial down"" the rhetoric around Brexit and policing. ""We can't use that kind of language, calling for people to resign, calling for protocols to be scrapped that are never going to be scrapped,"" he said.""Eleven year olds with petrol bombs don't understand the intricacies of the trading relationship between Northern Ireland and Britain or Northern Ireland and the EU, but tension has been whipped up by politicians."" Shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said the prime minister should be speaking out about the recent violence. ""The consequences of Brexit always had the potential to upset the very delicate balance of identities in Northern Ireland,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle.""I don't think enough consideration was given to the consequences of the border down the Irish Sea."" NI Secretary Brandon Lewis tweeted that he was being kept ""closely appraised"" of developments by the PSNI and that he was appalled that officers had been injured. Meanwhile, the HMIC review into the Bobby Storey policing operation will examine whether the PSNI's approach ""was within the parameters of national policing standards in the context of the Covid health protection regulations"", according to the Department of Justice. It will also ""offer relevant learning"" to assist policing the regulations going forward.

Welsh Lib Dems pledge to tackle 'climate emergency',"This video can not be played âThe planet needs our help right now,â party leader Jane Dodds said The Welsh Liberal Democrats promised to spend Â£1bn a year on tackling the ""climate emergency"",  as they launched their Senedd election campaign. Speaking at the event, the party's leader Jane Dodds said the Lib Dems are the ""only party"" that would ""put recovery first"". The Liberal Democrats head into the election having held one seat in the Senedd since 2016. Polling dayis on 6 May. The Liberal Democrats are the last of the main parties to launch their election campaign. Wales election 2021: Compare party policies A really simple guide to the Welsh elections At the event in Cardiff, Ms Dodds outlined some of the party's main policies. They include: Spending Â£1bn a year to tackle the climate emergency Building 30,000 new social housing properties A Â£500m investment in high streets, towns and city centres Undertaking a trial of Universal Basic Income in Wales Freezing business rates for five years and replacing them with a ""fairer, more supportive system"" Introducing universal free part-time childcare from nine months to school age, and expanding provision of before and after school care WALES ELECTION: THE BASICS What elections are happening?On 6 May, people across Wales will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs).

Ms Dodds said: ""The past year has been tough, life as we know it has changed, but I know Wales is a resilient country and we have the chance to build a better future for our children and our children's children. The Welsh Lib Dems plan to put recovery first says leader Jane Dodds ""The Welsh Liberal Democrats are the only party pledging to put recovery first. ""We will secure our economic recovery, an environmental recovery and a recovery for our mental health services. ""The next Welsh government will face a huge challenge in the problems that already existed in our country and which have been made worse as a result of Covid.Â ""With ambitious and fully achievable policies ranging from building 30,000 new homes, to investing in our high streets, and freezing the business rates which cripple so many small and medium sized firms, the Welsh Liberal Democrats are presenting radical yet realistic options for Wales' future.Â ""Wales cannot afford for any party or any government to put anything other than our recovery first."" The promise to spend Â£1bn a year on the ""climate emergency""meets a call made by the Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe. The Welsh Government's annual budget is about Â£18bn. Asked how the party would fund its pledge, Ms Dodds said: ""We're not going to cut anything"". She explained that the party would use money that is currently used ""in a different way"". ""We also want to be able to access private funding and entrepreneurship in order to make sure that we've got the infrastructure there to put the climate at the heart of everything we do. ""We have a well-costed, very clear-funded way of doing that,"" Ms Dodds added. Challenged on her claim that the Liberal Democrats are the only party that would prioritise post-pandemic recovery, Ms Dodds said: ""I don't think there's any other party that has as it's headline, 'put recovery first'. ""That is our very clear message right now in the middle of this pandemic."" The Liberal Democrats are defending one seat at this election. That was held by Kirsty Williams who has served as education minister in the Labour-led Welsh government since 2016. Ms Williams is standing down at this election. This is a big election for the Liberal Democrats, who are fighting to maintain a presence in the Senedd. They say the achievements of their single retiring Senedd member, Kirsty Williams, who has been education minister in the Labour government, prove that holding even one seat can still make a difference. The big question is whether that argument will convince their supporters to transfer their allegiance to Ms Williams' successor. This may be a national campaign launch, but the battle for the Lib Dems will be intensely local. BASICS:Simple guide to the Senedd election POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?

Teen saves boy after seeing crash live on TikTok,"A teenager in the US state of New Hampshire helped save a boy more than 800 miles (1,290km) away, after he saw him crash a quad bike live onTikTok. Caden Cotnoir, 13, was watching 12-year-old Trent Jarrett ride the four-wheeler in West Virginia. Trent crashed but the live feed continued. Trapped under the bike, Trent started yelling out a phone number, which Caden called and alerted Trent's family. He was rescued within about 20 minutes, and had only minor cuts and bruises. Caden has been praised for his quick thinking, and the pair met over Zoom on Monday. ""All of a sudden his phone goes kind of blank, you can see a little bit of light and you can just hear him yelling for help,"" he told local news station WMUR-TV. ""It was pretty, like, sad to hear, he's scared that he's not going to make it out,"" he added. ""I was yelling out my grandparents' house phone number,"" Trent said, as it was the only number he could remember. ""I couldn't hardly breathe... I'd just like to thank him for everything that he's done,"" he added. 'Hero' teenager rescues toddler from canal The teenage girl who helped design the Spitfire Caden's stepdad, Matt Currier, is the local police chief. ""He did what he was supposed to do and got the right people and it worked out. It was an Easter miracle,"" Mr Currier said.

Deliveroo shares rise as some riders strike,"Deliveroo riders held small protests around the UK on Tuesday Deliveroo shares have edged up on their first fully open day of trading on the London Stock Exchange. Shares rose more than2% to 286p at 12:00 on Wednesday, when 70,000 retail investors were allowed to trade. They are still well below the 390p paid as the sharesdived on their debut last weekamid big investors' concerns over workers' rights and profits. Hundreds of Deliveroo riders are expected to go on strike on Wednesday as they call for higher pay. Deliveroo said it was organised by a small ""union [that] does not represent the vast majority of riders"". The firm employs 50,000 riders, but only 400 are expected to take part in the strike. They are calling for riders to be paid the living wage after accounting for costs such as fuel, as well as an end to unpaid waiting times. Deliveroo said its own survey data showed 90% of riders were happy with firm. The food delivery firm's share sale marked London's biggest stock market launch for a decade, but the sharp fall seen saw it dubbed ""the worst IPO [initial public offering] in the history of London"". Deliveroo shares tumble on stock market debut Gig economy workers on what Uber changes could mean for them Smaller investors, known as retail investors, got their first chance to trade their shares on Wednesday as what is described as ""unconditional trading"" began. Despite small gains on Wednesday, the company's share price is still far below its 390p float price on its debut when big investors and Deliveroo customers could buy or sell shares. The company had initially hoped for a share price of up to 460p. Deliveroo, which has not yet made a profit, had to accept a lower price, saying it had chosen to ""price responsibly"" and sell its shares at the bottom of its planned price range due to ""volatile"" market conditions. Investment bank Goldman Sachs, which was an adviser to Deliveroo and was responsible for stabilising the share price, had to buy about Â£75m worth of Deliveroo shares to support the share price in the first few days,according to the Financial Times,external. An IPO is one way for private companies to raise cash. An initial public offering sees shares offered to major investors, including pension and insurance companies, as well, sometimes, as private small investors. They let the company know what they are prepared to pay for the shares, in conjunction with investment banks and other professional advisers hired by a company. The shares then launch on a stock market. Deliveroo shares were only tradeable over the first week by major investors who had bought large chunks. Full trading, allowing anyone to buy and sell, began a week later. Trading on a stock market allows the price to be set freely in the open market by supply and demand. The value of the shares, multiplied by how many there are, gives the market value of the company. Some of the UK's biggest investment fund managers, such as Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, charity fund manager CCLA, Legal and General Investment Management and M&G said they would not buy shares in Deliveroo, citing concerns, including over the working conditions of its riders. Analyst Susannah Streeter at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown said that retail investors don't appear to share the same worries. She said a surge of interest from smaller investors ""will be some comfort for Deliveroo customers who were encouraged to buy a slice of the company but appeared to have thrown the dice on a disastrous debut. ""They were locked out of selling their shares for a week, while the company's initial valuation fell sharply. Now they finally have a 'get out of jail' card, but it seems for now that many have kept it in their back pocket, waiting it out for prices to stabilise."" Neil Wilson, chief market analyst of Markets.com, warned that the strike action by hundreds of UK riders due to start on Wednesday ""underlines the regulatory risk attached to the stock"". About 400 of the food couriers in five towns and cities are also expected to stage socially-distanced protests over pay and conditions. ""I'm going on strike for my basic rights and those of all the other riders struggling to get by and support families on Deliveroo poverty pay,"" said Greg Howard, a Deliveroo rider and the chair of the IWGB's couriers and logistics branch. He said: ""I've seen conditions decline for years and then working through lockdown I contracted Covid-19 and got very little support from Deliveroo."" But Husain, a driver from Nottingham, told the Deliveroo survey: ""Deliveroo let you work whenever it suits you plus customers are so nice and respectful compared to other platforms. App is really easy to use and understand and shows you when to make good money."" Deliveroo said it had surveyed 8,500 riders on Tuesday, and found 89% were happy with the company and flexibility it offers. A spokesperson said the IWGB union did ""not represent the vast majority of riders who tell us they value the total flexibility they enjoy while working with Deliveroo alongside the ability to earn over Â£13 an hour. ""We are proud that rider satisfaction is at an all-time high and that thousands of people are applying to be Deliveroo riders each and every week. Riders are at the heart of our business and today we are beginning a new consultation with riders about how we should invest our new Â£50m community fund.""

City drivers 'should think twice' before SUV buys,"Drivers in crowded cities should think twice before buying a big SUV, says the head of a motoring organisation. Steve Gooding, from the RAC Foundation, said: ""We should all choose the right vehicle for the right trip to cut the size of our carbon footprint. ""It is right to question if suburban drivers need a car capable of ploughing over rivers, across fields and up steep hills just to pop to the shops."" His comments come as research confirms most SUVs are bought by urban drivers. It shows that large SUVs - often known as Chelsea tractors - are indeed most prevalent in places such as Chelsea. They are typically defined by their extreme size, and off-road features such as high ground clearance and four wheel drive. They often face complaints from other road users about their bulk and their pollution - especially during the school run. The report from the think-tank New Weather Institute said: ""The numbers stand up long-held suspicions that these vehicles ostensibly designed for off-road are actually marketed successfully to urban users where their big size and higher pollution levels are a worse problem."" The report says: Three quarters of all SUVs sold in the UK are registered to people living in towns and cities The largest SUVs are most popular in three London boroughs - Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith & Fulham, and Westminster One in three new private cars bought in these areas is a large SUV. These boroughs also top the league for popularity of most polluting cars by UK sales volume, all of which are SUVs The most likely large SUV to be owned by a city driver is the Lexus NX300 The report says,externalareas where SUV owners dominate are also the places where road space is most scarce, and where the highest proportion of cars are parked on the street. It says many large SUVs are too big for a standard UK parking space. Volvo Cars to go fully electric by 2030 Backlash grows against cut to electric car grants Andrew Simms, from the New Weather Institute, said: ""It turns out that the home of the 'Chelsea tractor' really is Chelsea. One of advertising's biggest manipulations has persuaded urban families that it's perfectly 'normal' to go shopping in a two-tonne truck. ""But the human health and climate damage done by SUVs is huge and needs to be undone. Just as tobacco advertising was successfully ended, it's time to stop promoting polluting SUV's."" The UK Citizens' Assembly on climate change has supported restrictions on SUVs. But motoring organisations said the analysis was too simplistic. While Mr Gooding supported the principle of making appropriate choices of vehicles, he told the BBC it was wrong to protest against medium sized cars that look like SUVs but don't clog the streets and are economical to run. ""The term SUV has become so broad as to be unhelpful,"" he said. ""(Some) motorists might just be seeking the comfort and convenience of relatively tall but still modestly-sized cars that come with the SUV badge but are economical to run. ""The popularity of the SUV body-style looks like it's going to be with us for some time as some auto companies have already released fully electric versions with more to come later this year."" Edmund King, from the AA, told the BBC: ""Talk of banning the advertising of SUVs is a naÃ¯ve approach. Some of the cleanest cars come in the SUV shape but are all electric such as the Jaguar I-Pace, Tesla Model X or Hyundai Kona. ""The auto industry is developing a wide range of cleaner, greener vehicles with some of the best in SUV styles,"" he said. ""Not all SUVs are large. Small SUVs are among the most popular cars on sale, because they usually offer the high-set driving position, practicality, safety and looks of more traditional off-roaders, but without the high price, running costs or emissions."" He added: ""Cars like the Nissan Juke are often the family car of choice in suburban areas."" The report says advertisers have misled consumers by pushing messages around SUVs such as 'get back to nature' and 'help the environment'. The authors have written to the advertising agency Spark44, which runs multiple SUV campaigns, asking them to outline how they plan to meet the UK government's climate change targets.

Kim Kardashian West joins billionaires' club,"Kim Kardashian West at Paris Fashion week last year US reality TV star Kim Kardashian West has joined the elite club of the super-rich (in case anyone had any doubts) by achieving billionaire status. Her net worth reached $1bn (Â£720m) thanks to her cosmetics and clothing interests as well as income from TV, endorsement deals and investments, Forbes business magazine says. She is now one of the 2,755 figures on Forbes' World's Billionaires List. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos leads the pack with a net worth of $177bn. Other Americans added over the past year include Bumble dating app founder Whitney Wolfe Herd ($1.3bn), filmmaker Tyler Perry ($1bn) and Miriam Adelson ($38.2bn), widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Kim Kardashian West's estranged husband Kanye West is already onthe list,external($1.8bn) buther half-sister, Kylie Jenner, was removed last May by Forbes. The magazine alleged her family had inflated the value of her cosmetics business. Forbes calculated that the 40-year-old'sworth had risen to $1bn from $780m in October,externalthanks especially to her stakes in the KKW Beauty cosmetics business and the Skims shapewear company. KKW Beauty was launched in 2017 and Skims just two years ago after the initial brand name Kimono wasdropped following accusations of cultural appropriation. Ms Kardashian West sold 20% of KKW Beauty to cosmetics giant Coty last year for $200m, in a deal valuing the business at $1bn. Her most recent project Skims offers underwear and loungewear in the founder's signature minimalist style, and has proven successful during the work-from-home era. The celebrity has used her huge social media presence (213m followers on Instagram; 69.7m followers on Twitter) during the coronavirus lockdowns to promote Skims loungewear. She first found fame in 2007 as the star of the E! Television reality series about her family, Keeping up with the Kardashians, and has remained hugely popular since. In February she reportedly filed for divorce from rapper Kanye Westafter being married for almost seven years and having four children together.

'Our refund battle for mum who can barely walk',"Clare and her mother Veronica have had plans disrupted by Covid An elderly grandmother who can ""barely walk"" has finally been sent a refund - a year after her flight was cancelled. Veronica Brown, aged 85, had hoped to visit her son and grandchildren in Munich last Easter, until Covid restrictions put an end to her plans. Her daughter Clare D'Agostino said, with little prospect of rearranging, there was ""no way on earth"" they would have chosen a voucher over a refund. But they were sent one anyway, until the BBC followed up the case. Mrs Brown visited her family in Germany as much as she could. In her advancing years, her daughter Clare booked her flights for her. The Easter trip was booked via Expedia, but then the Covid crisis intervened, and all such travel halted. For a variety of reasons including an apparent disagreement between agent and the airline, Lufthansa, Clare then found it impossible to get a refund, and was sent a flight voucher instead. She knew that was pointless, with the outlook suggesting little chance of travel - particularly for the elderly - for some time. ""My mum is now unable to walk properly and would never be able to use the voucher,"" she said. Two million not given flight refunds, Which? says Lastminute.com faces legal action over refunds She then heard a report on BBC 5 Live about issues with flight vouchers and, in her frustration, sent in a message explaining how she had been ""left in limbo"". After following up her case with Expedia, the BBC has now been told that a refund has finally been granted. ""We have looked into the case and can confirm that the customer is eligible for a full refund which has now been processed,"" a spokeswoman for the company said. ""We will contact them directly about this, and also, as a gesture of goodwill to apologise for any inconvenience, apply a Â£100 hotel coupon to their Expedia account."" Clare, and her mum, said the decision was ""really great news"". Although the cost of the flight was relatively small, at Â£170, they said it was a ""point of principle"" that the money should be returned. Other travellers have had similar difficulties securing a refund. With considerable uncertainty over when international leisure travel will resume, that has meant holding on to a voucher worth hundreds of pounds for some time. EasyJet: Two test travel plan would be too expensive What's the new traffic light system for holidays? There is also the potential for prices to have risen considerably by the time that voucher can be used so, in effect, the money will not go so far. Experts say that vouchers have re-emerged as an issue as it is a year on from many of those cancelled trips and some vouchers are set to expire, which could make them worthless if unused. Generally, anyone who accepted a voucher signed away the right to a refund. However, some airlines are allowing vouchers to be swapped for cash, and others are extending the validity of the voucher. Some holidaymakers say they were in a similar situation to Clare, not wanting a voucher but being sent one anyway, or having not been made aware that a cash refund was an option. In those cases, if an airline or agent refuses to refund, individuals may be able to take their case to an independent dispute resolution service. The travel industry has expressed its concern at the lack of clarity over the return of international travel. The Business Travel Association said the latest government announcementwas ""beyond disappointing"" and called for ""a clear pathway to international travel and trade"". If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines have struggled to meet that deadline. You can accept, or refuse, vouchers or a rebooking but a voucher will probably be invalid if the airline later goes bust If you decide against going on a future flight, which is not yet cancelled, then there is no right to a refund. Different airlines have different rules over what you can do but many are waiving any charges for changing to a later flight or having a voucher instead. If you have a package holiday, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days if it is cancelled Two million not given flight refunds, Which? says Lastminute.com faces legal action over refunds Test travel regime must be easy and cheap, says PM UK holidays: What are the rules?

Schools 'a lifeline to many students' in past year,"School staff have been giving clothing, food and furnishings to families that have been struggling financially in the coronavirus pandemic, teachers say. Some pupils have gone to school without winter coats, while others have been worried about having enough to eat, a National Education Union poll suggests. The findings come as the NEU begins its annual conference on Wednesday. The Department for Education says it has invested Â£2bn to help pupils in England in the wake of the pandemic. The NEU surveyed 10,696 members in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in March and concluded that schools and colleges had been a ""lifeline"" to many disadvantaged students during the past year. Asked about the poverty they had witnessed, one union member said: ""We have children that aren't clothed properly, without coats in winter, or have holes in shoes, and my school's inclusion team are excellent at working with the families to get them the support they need quickly and efficiently. ""We also have a stock of spare clothes that on occasion we can give to families."" School poverty cash at risk in date switch 'Worsening child poverty harms learning' Another NEU member said: ""I called home during the first lockdown and spoke to an older sibling who was panicking because the free school meals vouchers email hadn't arrived. ""It was the evening before a bank holiday weekend and there was no food in the house - I will never forget the panic in that girl's voice."" Another responded: ""We have had pupils and their families move into hostels during the pandemic when they were evicted. ""They were re-housed - but literally were given a house. No furniture, oven, fridge, washing machine, no carpets. Nothing. We rallied as a school and furnished two homes."" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: ""It is now beyond doubt that child poverty is on the rise. The effects can last a lifetime, and young people have one chance in education. ""There is no doubt, too, that schools and colleges have been going beyond the call of duty for them during this past year, as they always do. ""The government, by contrast, spent much of 2020 voicing warm words about its concern for the disadvantaged, including when mounting arguments for the wider opening of schools and colleges in September and January."" Yet it had ""persistently failed to deliver for the young people in poverty"", Dr Bousted said. The NEU survey also asked members about plans to help pupils catch up on lost learning over the past year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made Â£1.7bn of ""catch-up"" funding available in England to help children who have faced disruption from school and college closures during the pandemic. As part of the recovery package, summer schools will be introduced this year for pupils who need it most, and tutoring schemes will be expanded. But only one in five (21%) of NEU members surveyed thought tuition programmes were an important mechanism for supporting recovery, according to the teaching union poll. There are concerns that children have fallen behind academically during the pandemic Only 2% thought lengthening the school day or school term were important ways of supporting pupils who have missed in-person learning. More than four in five (82%) said schools and colleges should be given the flexibility to decide what is important for pupils' learning and well-being. Around two in three teachers believe pupils should be supported through sport and exercise (68%) and increased creative and practical learning (66%). Asked about the benefits that they feel have emerged from the pandemic and what should be retained, more than a third of union members (37%) appreciated the greater levels of communication they had experienced with families by telephone and video link, while 57% said online parents' evenings had been a positive step. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: ""We have already invested Â£1.7bn in ambitious catch-up plans, with the majority of this targeted towards those most in need, while giving schools the flexibility of funding to use as they believe best to support their pupils. ""We are working with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure all pupils have the chance to recover from the impact of the pandemic - and we have appointed Sir Kevan Collins as Education Recovery Commissioner to specifically oversee these issues.""

Deliveroo shares rise 2% on first full trading day,"Deliveroo riders held small protests around the UK on Tuesday Deliveroo shares have edged up on their first fully open day of trading on the London Stock Exchange. Shares rose more than2% to 286p at 12:00 on Wednesday, when 70,000 retail investors were allowed to trade. They are still well below the 390p paid as the sharesdived on their debut last weekamid big investors' concerns over workers' rights and profits. Hundreds of Deliveroo riders are expected to go on strike on Wednesday as they call for higher pay. Deliveroo said it was organised by a small ""union [that] does not represent the vast majority of riders"". The firm employs 50,000 riders, but only 400 are expected to take part in the strike. They are calling for riders to be paid the living wage after accounting for costs such as fuel, as well as an end to unpaid waiting times. Deliveroo said its own survey data showed 90% of riders were happy with firm. The food delivery firm's share sale marked London's biggest stock market launch for a decade, but the sharp fall seen saw it dubbed ""the worst IPO [initial public offering] in the history of London"". Deliveroo shares tumble on stock market debut Gig economy workers on what Uber changes could mean for them Smaller investors, known as retail investors, got their first chance to trade their shares on Wednesday as what is described as ""unconditional trading"" began. Despite small gains on Wednesday, the company's share price is still far below its 390p float price on its debut when big investors and Deliveroo customers could buy or sell shares. The company had initially hoped for a share price of up to 460p. Deliveroo, which has not yet made a profit, had to accept a lower price, saying it had chosen to ""price responsibly"" and sell its shares at the bottom of its planned price range due to ""volatile"" market conditions. Investment bank Goldman Sachs, which was an adviser to Deliveroo and was responsible for stabilising the share price, had to buy about Â£75m worth of Deliveroo shares to support the share price in the first few days,according to the Financial Times,external. An IPO is one way for private companies to raise cash. An initial public offering sees shares offered to major investors, including pension and insurance companies, as well, sometimes, as private small investors. They let the company know what they are prepared to pay for the shares, in conjunction with investment banks and other professional advisers hired by a company. The shares then launch on a stock market. Deliveroo shares were only tradeable over the first week by major investors who had bought large chunks. Full trading, allowing anyone to buy and sell, began a week later. Trading on a stock market allows the price to be set freely in the open market by supply and demand. The value of the shares, multiplied by how many there are, gives the market value of the company. Some of the UK's biggest investment fund managers, such as Aberdeen Standard, Aviva Investors, BMO Global, charity fund manager CCLA, Legal and General Investment Management and M&G said they would not buy shares in Deliveroo, citing concerns, including over the working conditions of its riders. Analyst Susannah Streeter at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown said that retail investors don't appear to share the same worries. She said a surge of interest from smaller investors ""will be some comfort for Deliveroo customers who were encouraged to buy a slice of the company but appeared to have thrown the dice on a disastrous debut. ""They were locked out of selling their shares for a week, while the company's initial valuation fell sharply. Now they finally have a 'get out of jail' card, but it seems for now that many have kept it in their back pocket, waiting it out for prices to stabilise."" Neil Wilson, chief market analyst of Markets.com, warned that the strike action by hundreds of UK riders due to start on Wednesday ""underlines the regulatory risk attached to the stock"". About 400 of the food couriers in five towns and cities are also expected to stage socially-distanced protests over pay and conditions. ""I'm going on strike for my basic rights and those of all the other riders struggling to get by and support families on Deliveroo poverty pay,"" said Greg Howard, a Deliveroo rider and the chair of the IWGB's couriers and logistics branch. He said: ""I've seen conditions decline for years and then working through lockdown I contracted Covid-19 and got very little support from Deliveroo."" But Husain, a driver from Nottingham, told the Deliveroo survey: ""Deliveroo let you work whenever it suits you plus customers are so nice and respectful compared to other platforms. App is really easy to use and understand and shows you when to make good money."" Deliveroo said it had surveyed 8,500 riders on Tuesday, and found 89% were happy with the company and flexibility it offers. A spokesperson said the IWGB union did ""not represent the vast majority of riders who tell us they value the total flexibility they enjoy while working with Deliveroo alongside the ability to earn over Â£13 an hour. ""We are proud that rider satisfaction is at an all-time high and that thousands of people are applying to be Deliveroo riders each and every week. Riders are at the heart of our business and today we are beginning a new consultation with riders about how we should invest our new Â£50m community fund.""

"Do more to tackle food poverty, MPs urge","The government should create a food security minister to ensure continued progress in helping to feed poverty-hit people, according to MPs. A report from the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee says progress made during the pandemic should be maintained as lockdown eases. Ministers mobilised their departments during the pandemic, ""but this impetus needs to be sustained,"" MPs say. And the government should consider enshrining in law a ""right to food"". Tory MP Neil Parish, who chairs the Commons committee, said the efforts to feed the most vulnerable people during the Covid-19 crisis should ""set a precedent"" for the future. There are 5.9 million adults in the UK who experienced food poverty in the six months up to February and 1.7 million children living in food-insecure households, according to the report. To ensure people continue to get help, the MPs called for the introduction of a food security minister who would be backed by ""robust"" cross-government structures to ensure all relevant departments ""prioritise the issue of food insecurity"". The government should also consult on how the right to food could be introduced in England, the report urges, in a bid to ""drive action"" across Whitehall. Other recommendations in the report include: Ensure that families with children eligible for free school meals continue to be able to feed their children Learn from the ""unacceptable"" food parcels provided by some suppliers in January and improve standards Urge retailers to ""recognise their responsibility"" to help people shielding due to health vulnerabilities to access food, including by removing delivery charges and minimum online spends for them The MPs also warned that taxpayer support to the hospitality industry ""will have been wasted"" if its supply chain collapses because suppliers have not received the same level of support. Therefore, they said, the government must ""urgently assess the impact"" of the closures of hospitality to its suppliers and provide additional financial support as the lockdown is eased. Mr Parish said: ""During the Covid crisis, different government departments pulled together to make sure that the most vulnerable in our society were fed. This should set a precedent. ""We have a duty to ensure that access to enough nutritious food is a fundamental right for everyone in the UK, which is why, for the second time in a year, our committee urges the government to appoint a new minister specifically to address food security."" A government spokesman responded that ""the recent pandemic has proven that the UK has a large, diverse and highly resilient food supply chain that has coped well in responding to unprecedented challenges - and we will review the recommendations set out within this report and respond accordingly"". ""Since March last year, we have spent more than Â£280bn to deliver an impressive package of economic and welfare support to protect and support the incomes and needs of families and children - and we continue to work closely with the food industry to ensure people across the country have the food and supplies they need,"" he added.

Wales' over-50s success disputed,"This video can not be played Claims all over-50s in Wales have been offered a Covid jab have been questioned Claims all over-50s and at-risk adults with underlying health conditions have been offered a Covid vaccine in Wales have been disputed. Some people in those groups have said they are still waiting to be contacted to have their jab. It comes after the Welsh government said on Monday it had alreadymet the mid-April milestone targetset for all UK governments. On Tuesday, it said ""plans are in place to make sure no-one is left behind"". Public Health Wales (PHW) has said people should contact their health board. Garry Edwards, 51, from Anglesey, is registered as asthmatic and said he was still waiting for his invitation. He said he was previously told by his surgery only second jabs were being given, so he called Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board which confirmed he was on the list and would be called. When will I get the vaccine? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many people have died with Covid in Wales? ""I know a lot of people who have had, and a lot of people younger than me who have had it - I know people in their 40s who have had it,"" Mr Edwards said on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers. ""It's going to be done when it's done but when you are told you are going to be invited to have it... and it hasn't happened, then the statistics are wrong somewhere."" Other listeners to the programme messaged to say they were also still waiting for a first vaccine. Beverley Williams, 57, from Tonypandy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she was still waiting to hear about her vaccine through Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board. ""I've had Covid before so I'm a bit stressed,"" she said. ""I rang them this morning and they are going to send me another letter and if I don't hear anything by next week, I've got to ring them again. ""My husband's [vaccine] was late and he only found out he missed his because they rang him to find out why he hadn't turned up."" She added he was then booked in for the jab the same day as the call. Graham Thomas said it was ""really annoying"" his 84-year-old mother Marion Price was still waiting for her vaccine in Caerphilly. ""She has asthma and [lung disease] COPD. She's disabled and can't get out of the house."" He said she had received an offer to come to the surgery, but it was known she was housebound: ""She has to have a home visit. She's got a letter saying she is on the priority list but she hasn't had a vaccine."" Sonja Milano's mother Manuela Levi moved to Bangor, Gwynedd, last summer from Italy. The 50-year-old is registered with a GP but has been told to wait two more weeks for news of a vaccine appointment. Ms Milano said: ""I phoned her GP surgery today and was told if nothing has happened by then, to call again. ""Everybody else around us over 50 has been offered one. I just want to make sure she will get a call."" Sonja Milano's mother Manuela Levi, 50, has been told to wait two more weeks for news of a vaccine appointment Dr Giri Shankar, incident director for the Covid-19 response at PHW, said vaccinations were delivered by health boards. ""I can't think of any systematic issue that would have led to several people having not received their vaccinations,"" he said. ""There may be isolated cases where that has happened, which obviously needs to be looked into, and the health boards are best placed to do that. ""Without looking into the specific details of each of those cases, it's difficult to say what might have happened, but I think the main thing to say is it's never too late. ""If you feel you haven't been given an appointment, you should immediately make contact with the health board."" In a statement, the Welsh government said: ""Any person aged 50 or over will have had at least their first vaccination or been sent an appointment, and plans are in in place to make sure no-one is left behind. ""If health boards have been unable to contact someone on the list, or if an appointment has been missed, systems are in place to go back and check and re-arrange a new appointment for anyone who wants to be vaccinated."" Information is available onthe Welsh government website,externalfor people who think they should have had an appointment but have not received one. Dr Mair Hopkin said she thought cases of people not being offered the vaccine were ""few and far between"" Dr Mair Hopkin, joint chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners Wales, said she did not think there was ""potentially a problem"" with delivering the vaccine. She said she had heard cases of people not being offered the vaccine were ""few and far between"". ""There may be very many reasons why people have been left off a list,"" Dr Hopkin said, citing people moving house and records not being updated. Dr Hopkin expressed concern younger people could be harder to reach for vaccination since they could be in education or at work and not ""sitting there waiting for that phone call"". She said it was important the young were vaccinated even if they thought they were not at risk. ""You have to remember that you are putting everyone one else at risk,"" she said. On Monday,PHW said 1,493,192 people had received a first doseof the vaccine and 469,251 people were fully vaccinated, having had both jabs. The Welsh government also said on Monday it had achieved its ""second milestone"" of offering a vaccine to everyone over the age of 50 and those with underlying health issues. But Hywel Dda University Health Board, which covers Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, said it was on track to meet the UK's mid-April target by 18 April. Chief executive Steve Moore encouraged people to get in touch to secure their first vaccine dose if they have not yet had an appointment. He added: ""We have seen an overwhelming response from our wonderful communities across the three counties who have turned up in storms, snow, rain and sunshine to receive their vaccine."" Betsi Cadwaladr health board's primary and community care boss, Dr Chris Stockport, said the ""vast majority"" of appointments for unvaccinated people in groups five to nine were now booked. Invitation letters, he said, were ""sent in the post last week"". ""Most of these letters have been delivered, but a small number may arrive in the coming days, because of bank holiday postal arrangements,"" Dr Stockport said. A ""significant number"" of invitations had also been sent to people in their 40s, he said. ""We are determined to not leave anybody behind,"" he said. The uptake of first doses of those in their early 50s across Wales on average was up to 67.2%, while for those in their late 50s, the figure stands at more than 84%. The top four priority groups in Wales, which is made up of all over-70s, including care home residents,were offered a jab by mid-February.

PSNI chief to update Policing Board on NI violence,"There was a police presence in parts of Larne on Tuesday night The NI Policing Board chairman has called for a redoubling of efforts to calm loyalist tensions and for dialogue with police at all levels of the force. First Minister Arlene Foster hascondemned the recent loyalist violence, but has not spoken to Chief Constable Simon Byrne. Mr Byrne briefed the Policing Board on Wednesday about the trouble over the Easter period in a private session. Forty-one police officers have been hurtand 10 people arrested. There were no reports of serious disorder on Tuesday night, but police maintained a presence in many areas. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken said the fact that Mrs Foster had not engaged with Mr Byrne in the wake of the violence was a mistake. ""I have issues with the chief constable because of past actions and decisions, but that should not be the cause for us to refuse to engage,"" Mr Aiken said. ""He is the head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and while he is in post, we should continue to work with him and all his officers."" Following the Policing Board meeting, chair Doug Garrett said members were unanimous in their condemnation of the recent disorder. Chief Constable Simon Byrne has come under pressure to step down in recent days ""At this time, there must be a redoubling of efforts to calm tensions and for continued dialogue between the community and police officers at all levels of the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland),"" Mr Garrett said. ""Nothing is achieved without talking, and leadership is needed from all those with influence so that any concerns can be addressed through the democratic structures in place; and through the board mechanisms for policing oversight and accountability."" Some have linked the violence in parts of greater Belfast and Londonderry in recent days to the decision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to prosecute anyone who attended the funeral of former IRA man Bobby Storey in June 2020. NI assembly to be recalled over loyalist violence PSNI say 41 officers injured during NI rioting It was attended by 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) is to examine the PSNI's role in the funeral, after being called in by Justice Minister Naomi Long at the request of the Policing Board. The Policing Board meeting was an opportunity in private session - it lasted about 90 minutes - for the chief constable to update the 19-member board on the events of the last number of days. It was a factual analysis. He pointed out that 41 officers had been injured in a range of violent incidents. This was not a re-examination or a questioning of policing around the Bobby Storey funeral, although I'm told that some members did express support for the chief constable, while others obviously didn't. Board chairman Doug Garrett said afterwards that members were unanimous in condemnation of the violence. He did say that there must be a redoubling of efforts to calm tensions and that nothing is achieved without talking. That will be seen, certainly in some quarters, as implied criticism of Arlene Foster's position in terms of not talking to the chief constable. Mrs Long has asked it to complete the inspection ""by no later than May 14"". Last week, Mr Byrneexpressed surpriseat the conclusion by the PPS. Mr Garrett told BBC's Evening Extra programme that it was ""not an ideal position"" for senior politicians and police not to talk. Mrs Foster earlier reiterated her calls for the chief constable to step down. The leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), UUP, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) and Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) have said Mr Byrne's position is untenable over the PSNI's handling of the funeral. On Wednesday, Jonathan Powell, the former adviser to Tony Blair at the time of the Good Friday Agreement, said politics has got ""quite hot"" again in Northern Ireland and people are ""playing with matches"". ""Politicians trying to second guess the police when they're making operational decisions is really a mistake and I hope that the first minister will back off on this and allow the police to proceed with their job,"" Mr Powell said. It was view shared by former NI Secretary Shaun Woodward, who said it was ""potentially a dangerous situation"". ""There's a moment here, where, to borrow Jonathan Powell's words, you need to state your position but now back off,"" he said. ""Continuing to needle this particular thing will undo much greater issues of community policing in Northern Ireland."" Petrol bombs were thrown at police in Carrickfergus on Monday night Mrs Foster said she had a duty to speak out about the PSNI's failure to uphold Covid restrictions during Bobby Storey's funeral. ""The police, of course, have my full support,"" Mrs Foster told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, but added that ordinary police officers had been let down by their senior management. Mrs Foster said Mr Byrne had not asked to meet her and she had not asked to meet him. ""I have spoken to him [Simon Byrne] on many occasions and told him that the differential treatment for Sinn FÃ©in has to stop,"" Mrs Foster said. ""He has been warned about it on a number of occasions. However, it continues to happen. That sort of specialised treatment for a political elite is very, very damaging."" A phone box was destroyed during disorder in Londonderry on Monday night Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Dowd said at a time when the police were ""under nightly attack"" from loyalists, it would be ""helpful and send out the right signals"" if the first minister would agree to meet the chief constable, along with the deputy first minister. Mr O'Dowd said such a meeting would ""show unity of purpose across the board, across the political spectrum"". He said it would ""ensure that those who are orchestrating this violence, those who are putting petrol bombs into the hands of 12-year-olds, get a very, very clear message that it's not acceptable"". DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell told BBC's Talkback programme that he had no doubt that Mrs Foster will speak to the chief constable. He said ongoing loyalist violence may be hampering unionist efforts to force Mr Byrne to resign. Justice Minister Naomi Long told the Today programme that policing had been ""undoubtedly"" politicised at a difficult time.""When any politician declares they have no confidence in the chief constable that is a very serious matter, and when that is the first minister of Northern Ireland, that becomes even more serious. ""It is incumbent on all of us in public life and those of us in positions of leadership not simply to declare whether or not we believe the chief constable has our confidence, but to work to ensure that he has the confidence of the public and of the community."" Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? Why a Brexit trade deal is different for NI The disorder has also been linked to loyalist frustrations over the Northern Ireland Protocol in the Brexit deal. HMIC was called in by Justice Minister Naomi Long at the request of the Policing Board The NI Protocol has increased checks and caused disruption for some goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, creating an Irish Sea border. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said politicians need to ""dial down"" the rhetoric around Brexit and policing. ""We can't use that kind of language, calling for people to resign, calling for protocols to be scrapped that are never going to be scrapped,"" he said.""Eleven year olds with petrol bombs don't understand the intricacies of the trading relationship between Northern Ireland and Britain or Northern Ireland and the EU, but tension has been whipped up by politicians."" Shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said the prime minister should be speaking out about the recent violence. ""The consequences of Brexit always had the potential to upset the very delicate balance of identities in Northern Ireland,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle.""I don't think enough consideration was given to the consequences of the border down the Irish Sea."" NI Secretary Brandon Lewis tweeted that he was being kept ""closely appraised"" of developments by the PSNI and that he was appalled that officers had been injured. Meanwhile, the HMIC review into the Bobby Storey policing operation will examine whether the PSNI's approach ""was within the parameters of national policing standards in the context of the Covid health protection regulations"", according to the Department of Justice. It will also ""offer relevant learning"" to assist policing the regulations going forward.

"'Our refund battle for mum who can barely walk'The family was sent a voucher, rather than the refund they wanted - until BBC News followed up the case.Business","Clare and her mother Veronica have had plans disrupted by Covid An elderly grandmother who can ""barely walk"" has finally been sent a refund - a year after her flight was cancelled. Veronica Brown, aged 85, had hoped to visit her son and grandchildren in Munich last Easter, until Covid restrictions put an end to her plans. Her daughter Clare D'Agostino said, with little prospect of rearranging, there was ""no way on earth"" they would have chosen a voucher over a refund. But they were sent one anyway, until the BBC followed up the case. Mrs Brown visited her family in Germany as much as she could. In her advancing years, her daughter Clare booked her flights for her. The Easter trip was booked via Expedia, but then the Covid crisis intervened, and all such travel halted. For a variety of reasons including an apparent disagreement between agent and the airline, Lufthansa, Clare then found it impossible to get a refund, and was sent a flight voucher instead. She knew that was pointless, with the outlook suggesting little chance of travel - particularly for the elderly - for some time. ""My mum is now unable to walk properly and would never be able to use the voucher,"" she said. Two million not given flight refunds, Which? says Lastminute.com faces legal action over refunds She then heard a report on BBC 5 Live about issues with flight vouchers and, in her frustration, sent in a message explaining how she had been ""left in limbo"". After following up her case with Expedia, the BBC has now been told that a refund has finally been granted. ""We have looked into the case and can confirm that the customer is eligible for a full refund which has now been processed,"" a spokeswoman for the company said. ""We will contact them directly about this, and also, as a gesture of goodwill to apologise for any inconvenience, apply a Â£100 hotel coupon to their Expedia account."" Clare, and her mum, said the decision was ""really great news"". Although the cost of the flight was relatively small, at Â£170, they said it was a ""point of principle"" that the money should be returned. Other travellers have had similar difficulties securing a refund. With considerable uncertainty over when international leisure travel will resume, that has meant holding on to a voucher worth hundreds of pounds for some time. EasyJet: Two test travel plan would be too expensive What's the new traffic light system for holidays? There is also the potential for prices to have risen considerably by the time that voucher can be used so, in effect, the money will not go so far. Experts say that vouchers have re-emerged as an issue as it is a year on from many of those cancelled trips and some vouchers are set to expire, which could make them worthless if unused. Generally, anyone who accepted a voucher signed away the right to a refund. However, some airlines are allowing vouchers to be swapped for cash, and others are extending the validity of the voucher. Some holidaymakers say they were in a similar situation to Clare, not wanting a voucher but being sent one anyway, or having not been made aware that a cash refund was an option. In those cases, if an airline or agent refuses to refund, individuals may be able to take their case to an independent dispute resolution service. The travel industry has expressed its concern at the lack of clarity over the return of international travel. The Business Travel Association said the latest government announcementwas ""beyond disappointing"" and called for ""a clear pathway to international travel and trade"". If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines have struggled to meet that deadline. You can accept, or refuse, vouchers or a rebooking but a voucher will probably be invalid if the airline later goes bust If you decide against going on a future flight, which is not yet cancelled, then there is no right to a refund. Different airlines have different rules over what you can do but many are waiving any charges for changing to a later flight or having a voucher instead. If you have a package holiday, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days if it is cancelled Two million not given flight refunds, Which? says Lastminute.com faces legal action over refunds Test travel regime must be easy and cheap, says PM UK holidays: What are the rules?

New UK regulator takes on tech giants,"The big tech firms are under scrutiny from regulators around the world A new regulator aiming to curb the dominance of tech giants has started work in the UK. The Digital Markets Unit (DMU) will first look to create new codes of conduct for companies such as Facebook and Google and their relationship with content providers and advertisers. The new unit will be based inside the Competition and Markets Authority. The regime will be ""unashamedly pro-competition"", said the business secretary. The DMU's first job will be to think about codes of conduct to govern the relationships between the tech firms and their users, whether that is small businesses wanting to advertise or news organisations looking to distribute their journalism. Between them, Facebook, Google and Amazon control the lion's share of digital advertising revenue. Before taking action, the new regulator will have to wait for such codes to be put into law. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""Today is a major milestone on the path to creating the world's most competitive online markets, with consumers, entrepreneurs and content publishers at their heart."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the pro-competition regime would ""help curb the dominance of the tech giants"". Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, added: ""People shopping on the internet and sharing information online should be able to enjoy the choice, secure data and fair prices that come with a dynamic and competitive industry.""
