Spain to stop quarantining arrivals from 1 July,"Foreign visitors to Spain will no longer have to undergo a two-week quarantine from 1 July, the government has announced. It said the measure had been finalised in a cabinet meeting on Monday. Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya had previously said the requirement would be lifted in July, without giving a date. The news comes as the UK government prepares to bring in its own 14-day quarantine policy from 8 June. Travel firms and other industry bodies say the UK should relax the measure for visitors arriving from countries where people are at a lower risk of contracting the coronavirus. Spain normally attracts 80 million tourists a year, with the sector providing more than 12% of the country's GDP. Opening up the holiday market again before the summer season is over is seen as crucial to the Spanish economy. But under the UK's new policy, any tourists returning home after taking holidays in Spain and most other foreign destinations would have to spend two weeks in self-isolation. Several airlines including EasyJet, Jet2 and Ryanair have announced that they plan to resume flights and holidays soon. Easyjet will be resuming flights from 22 airports across Europe from 15 June, as well as regional flights across the UK. But there will only be one international flight from the UK - from Gatwick to Nice in France. Jet2 is planning to resume full services from 1 July, and will fly to several Spanish and Italian destinations, before opening up to Greece and Croatia later in the year. And Ryanair will be restoring 40% of its flights from 1 July and will resume flights from most of the 80 airports it flies from across Europe. Business groups wrote to Boris Johnson on Sunday saying the quarantine would have ""serious consequences"" for the economy andcalling for ""air bridge"" deals to be struck with other nations. In their letter to the prime minister, bosses of airlines EasyJet, Tui, Jet2 and Virgin Atlantic, as well as industry bodies Airlines UK, the British Chambers of Commerce, UK Hospitality and manufacturing association Made UK said they had ""serious reservations"" about a ""blanket approach"" to all arrivals into Britain. Instead, they are asking for a more ""targeted, risk-based"" approach when establishing air links with countries that have high infection rates from the pandemic. ""The alternative risks major damage to the arteries of UK trade with key industry supply chains, whilst pushing the UK to the back of the queue as states begin conversations for opening up their borders,"" says the letter.

Thanks
for staying with us. Before we go, hereâs a round-up of some of the biggest
stories so far.  And finally, quite a few of us have worked all day to bring the latest developments to you, including Owen Amos, Krutika Pathi, Aparna Alluri, Andreas Illmer, Anna Jones, Saira Asher, Frances Mao, Victoria Bisset, Ben Collins, Sean Fanning, Raffi Berg, Joshua Nevett, Shamaan Freeman-Powell, Neil Johnston, Gary Kitchener, Michael Emons, Sophie Williams, Hazel Shearing, Victoria Lindrea, Jennifer Scott, Holly Honderich and Paulin Kola. Coronavirus has been described as an invisible killer and what can be more terrifying than that? It's unsurprising, therefore, that many people are fearful of going out, returning life to normal or even letting children go back to school. Our Reality Check team has spoken to experts who explain the risks and how to quantify them. Read more here Europe is opening up further, with citizens tasting freedoms they have missed during the coronavirus pandemic. In the Czech Republic, people can finally get back into pubs, albeit with social distancing and mask-wearing indoors. It is the country with the highest per capita beer consumption in the world. BBC correspondent Rob Cameron visited a brewery in Prague to see how the measures are working in pubs. Read more about the ways Europe is easing the lockdown here. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Czechs return to bars and restaurants - in masks Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Political advisers are meant occasionally perhaps to be seen and not heard. Dominic Cummings, the UK prime ministerâs right hand man, took a dramatic step today explaining why the decision to leave London during the lockdown could be justified. He majored on the small print, unusual for a man used to painting political campaigns in bold primary colours, but knowing that so many members of the public were incensed by what had happened. He spent a long time answering as many questions as there were, trying to explain something that many in the Tory Party felt could not be explained, trying to make the best of a very bad situation for the prime minister. But it's far from clear tonight whether Dominic Cummings has managed to save himself for the long term.   Our Reality Check team spoke to intensive care doctors across the UK about their observations from the front line. One of the phrases that emerged time after time is, ""We've never seen anything like this before"". And as the number of cases increased, doctors up and down the UK were reading first-hand accounts from colleagues in China, and then in Italy - in scientific journals and on social media - about the intensity of infection. ""It felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the D-Day landings,"" says Barbara Miles, clinical director of intensive care at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, ""with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing"". But what arrived in the UK as winter turned into spring took even the most experienced ICU specialists by surprise. Read more here Iceland took a different approach than most countries caught in the coronavirus pandemic and, after extensive testing of its population of around 328,000, public gatherings of up to 200 people are allowed while night clubs and gyms are to reopen. Anyone who wanted a test received one, while schools and day care centresremained open. It has confirmed 1,804 infections and 10 deaths but there have been only five new cases reported in May. Coronavirus tests have been performed on more than 16% of its people - a greater proportion than in almost any other country thanks in part to its small population. Patrick Ewing, former NBA star and Georgetown basketball coach, has been released from hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, his son confirmed on Monday. The former New York Knicks player announced that he had tested positive for the virus on Friday. His son, Patrick Ewing Jr. said on Twitter: ""My father is now home and getting better. We'll continue to watch his symptoms and follow the CDC guidelines. I hope everyone continues to stay safe and protect yourselves and your loved ones."" Ewing features in the recent The Last Dance documentary, which is based onMichael Jordan's all-conquering Chicago Bullsand their hunt for a sixth NBA title in the 1997-98 season.  There have been small protests against the lockdown across Germany Germany has been widely praised for its response to the coronavirus.
The government quickly implemented a mass testing programme, and the death toll
is far lower by population than in many other European nations. Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a relaxation of national lockdown measuresthis month after discussions with leaders of the  16 states. Each controls the timing of reopenings, and can also reimpose
restrictions. But divisions are growing as some states favour easing
lockdown faster than others. Bodo Ramelow, premier of the eastern state of
Thuringia, has announced plans to drop compulsory social distancing and face mask
use as early as 6 June. The health minister in the neighbouring state of Saxony
said it was planning a âparadigm
changeâ with similar rules on the same day. But the government in Berlin fears what could happen if lockdown measures are eased too much. âUnder no
circumstances should the impression be given that the pandemic is over,â federal Health Minister Jens Spahn reportedly told Bild. The Star Drive-In Theater in Colorado has been opened since the start of May, with social distancing restrictions in place As of last week,all 50 US states have begun to partially reopenafter a two-month shutdown. On 20 May, Connecticut became the final state to loosen restrictions when it gave the green light to shops and restaurants under certain restrictions. So what's the latest? Allow Twitter content?

Toronto's Trinity Bellwoods Park was packed with 10,000 Sun worshippers on
Saturday, when temperatures soared above 20 C (68 F) after several weeks of bad
weather. Mayor John Tory was there himself, ostensibly to educate people about safe
social distancing. But itâs his behaviour that became a cause for concern when photos surfaced of
him speaking closely with others with his mask off his face. He has since apologised. ""I fully intended to properly physically distance, but it was very
difficult to do,â he said. He has also been criticised for not sending police to the park to ticket
rule breakers and maintain crowd control. Ontario reported 404 new cases of coronavirus on Monday, a 1.6% jump from
the day before. The uptick means government officials will keep groups limited
to five people longer than expected. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he was ""disappointed"" by peoples'
""reckless"" behaviour and urged those who were at the park to get
tested. Jyoti Kumari travelled to a suburb of the Indian capital Delhi to take care of her father after he was injured in an accident. But when the lockdown was introduced, the 15-year-old knew she had to get her father home to Bihar, a 1,200km-long (745 mile) journey. With no transport services due to the lockdown, she decided to cycle home with her father on the back of her bike. The pair also managed to hitch rides with lorries along the way. Learn more about the pair in this video. This video can not be played India coronavirus: The girl who cycled to save her father Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Sweden's Public Health Agency has
published official advice on dating and sexual relationships for the first time
since the start of the pandemic. The advice came as the agency announced that the Covid-19 death toll had passed 4,000. The agency has updated its online
guidelines to state that ""dating and temporary sexual relationships with
new partners...pose a risk of getting infected or infecting others"". However, it advises that
""closeness, intimacy and sex are good for well-being and public health"" and says that for those who are in relationships ""sex is no obstacle if you and
your partner, or partners, show no symptoms of illness"". Last month, Denmark
said that its social distancing guidelines did not extend to sexual
relationships, whether serious or casual. Sweden never had a lockdown and
has kept larger parts of society open than many countries, including bars and
restaurants. However, venues have already been asked to make efforts to avoid
mingling or hook-ups between strangers, for example by offering table-service
only and spacing out seating. Captain Sir Tom Moore raised Â£32.8m by walking laps of his garden before his 100th birthday The extraordinary fundraising achievement of Capt Tom Moore - now Sir Tom Moore - has been well documented. But what has the money he raised been spent on? The Â£32.8m raised by centenarian Sir Tom was in aid of the health service's charitable wing, NHS Charities Together. It is part of an overall Â£116m collected for the fund as part of its Covid-19 Urgent Appeal. Some Â£20m has been spent so far. Despite publicity given to shortages of protective clothing for staff, and the need for medical apparatus, these are classed as ""core"" equipment and funded by taxpayers. The focus of Charities Together is the comfort and wellbeing of staff and patients - things that, in the words of one NHS worker, ""make their working lives easier"". Among the NHS areas that will benefit include snacks for medical staff in County Durham, pop-up shops being funded in hospitals in London, improvements to NHS staff ""welfare"" areas and further catering provisions being brought into kitchenettes. Haroon Mota during one of his daily runs in Coventry A man who ran 260km (161.5 miles) whilefasting during Ramadan has raised Â£52,000 ($63,000) for charity. Haroon Mota, of Coventry, said thanks to ""overwhelming support"" he doubled his Â£25,000 target in the final week of his challenge. Before lockdown, the 34-year-old planned to run four major world marathons for the Penny Appeal - a charity that helps people in poverty around the world. He then decided to run 10km each evening during a 16- to 18-hour fast and said: ""I'm enjoying putting my feet up and resting and feel proud and pleased with the money raised."" Spain has revised its coronavirus death toll down by nearly 2,000 due to some fatalities being counted twice. The toll now stands at more than 26,800 rather than the 28,700 reported before. In addition to some deaths being counted twice, others had originally been notified as suspected or probably cases of Covid-19 which were subsequently not confirmed, officials said. Spain - one of the worst affected countries - continues to relax its lockdown measures. From 1 July, foreign visitors to the country will no longer have to undergo a two-week quarantine. Former Vice-President Joe Biden made his first public appearance since mid-March to visit a veterans memorial in his home state of Delaware. The presumptive Democratic nominee and his wife, Jill, donned black masks as they laid a wreath to mark Memorial Day - the American holiday dedicated to honouring military personnel who have died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. President Donald Trump also made a Memorial Day appearance, visiting Arlington National Cemetery with First Lady Melania before traveling to Fort McHenry in Baltimore. Neither wore masks. Mr Trump was criticised on Sunday for playing a round of gold at his club in Virginia, as the US death toll from coronavirus nears 100,000. There are now more than 1.5 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the US and more than 97,000 deaths. But the rates of the sick and dying are not spread evenly: the hardest hit areas are disproportionately Democrat-leaning. According to analysis by the New York Times, counties won by Republican President Donald Trump in 2016 have reported just 27% of infections and 21% of deaths, even though 45% of Americans live in these areas. Why? Part of the answer is linked to population density. The virus has wreaked most havoc in densely populated counties and urban America has long been Democrat-dominated. Overall, infections in some Republican-leaning counties are rising, while Democratic-led states like New York and New Jersey are seeing cases fall - but not at a rate fast enough to close the gap, the Times reports. The country's divides - urban/rural, Democrat/Republican - are exacerbated by wide discrepancies between states in their economic reopening. On the whole, Republican-led states have taken more aggressive steps to loosen social distancing, while Democratic governors have been more cautious. Coronavirus lockdown measures are being eased across the country - to the great relief of many. But the government has stressed that it is still important to maintain social distancing to avoid a second peak.

The closure of restaurants and the retreat of humans indoors is making it hard for rats to find meals Without the leftovers from restaurants, events and other non-socially distanced activities, rats are exhibiting some ""unusual or aggressive rodent behaviour"", according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But the rats are not becoming aggressive towards people. Instead, they're turning on themselves. As urban rodentologist Robert Corrigantold the BBC last month, cannibalism is very pervasive in stressed colonies - and rats are stressed under coronavirus conditions.

"Women's Super League season brought to immediate endThe Women's Super League and Women's Championship seasons are ended immediately, but sporting outcomes are still to be decided.BBC Sport","Arsenal and Chelsea, along with leaders Manchester City, were the three clubs challenging for the title when the WSL season was halted The Women's Super League and Women's Championship seasons have been ended immediately, with the outcome of the WSL title and promotion and relegation issues still to be decided. The joint WSL and Women's Championship board has sent various recommendations to the Football Association board to ""determine the most appropriate sporting outcome for the season"". An FA statement said the decision came after ""overwhelming feedback from clubs"" and was made ""in the best interest of the women's game"". It continued: ""This will also enable clubs, the Women's Super League and Women's Championship board and the FA to plan, prepare and focus on next season when football returns for the 2020-21 campaign."" It means all divisions of women's football in England have now been cancelled for the 2019-20 campaign. Clubs had been assuming their season would not resume, several sources had told BBC Sport, leaving the 45 remaining fixtures in the WSL - and 36 in the Championship - outstanding. Monday's joint leagues board meeting came after a formal consultation process with clubs last week. The FA wrote to clubs on Wednesday to seek their formal views on whether to end the season and how to do so. Manchester City were top of the table when the season was suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, although second-placed Chelsea had a game in hand on the leaders. Reigning champions Arsenal were three points further back in third place. Should final places in the Women's Super League be decided by an unweighted points-per-game ratio, Chelsea would climb above City to go top. Also still to be confirmed are England's two representatives to take part in next season's Women's Champions League, which, the FA said in their statement, ""would be based on sporting merit"" from the WSL season. At the foot of the WSL, Liverpool remain in danger of being relegated. The Reds are a point below second-from-bottom Birmingham and have played a game more. Aston Villa are six points clear of Sheffield United at the top of the second-tier Championship. It is understood no decision has yet been made regarding the conclusion of the Women's FA Cup, which had reached the quarter-final stage before March's suspension of elite football in England. Points-per-game is 'fairest way' to settle final WSL places - Beard Manchester Citysaid they ""now await the outcome of discussions regarding the final standings of the league table"". On their website, the club added: ""While disappointed that we are unable to complete the season, we understand the complexities of the situation and support the FA's decision. ""Our priority remains the safety and wellbeing of our players and staff, and we will now move forward with preparations for next season."" Manchester City took 40 points from their 16 matches in this season's Women's Super League Liverpoolsaid they believed they ""would have been able to meet the operational and financial obligations associated with a return to play, once detailed drafts and accurate protocols had been shared with clubs"", However, the club said they now ""await an equitable solution to those issues still to be decided in a campaign where a third of our league games were still to be played"". Manchester Unitedwere fourth in their first season at WSL level, and said they ""understood"" and ""accepted"" the decision to bring the campaign to an early conclusion. United manager Casey Stoney said: ""It's obviously disappointing not to be able complete the season, but it is the right decision for the safety of everyone involved. ""Our focus now moves to our development for next season, which we have been continuously planning for throughout the year, and we can't wait to be back on the pitch again when it is safe to do so."" West Ham Unitedboss Matt Beard said: ""While the preference was always to return to the pitch to determine the campaign if safe to do so, we completely understand the unique situation that we, and football, finds itself in. ""As always, the health and safety of our players, staff and fantastic supporters remains the priority at all times."" Bristol Citymanager Tanya Oxtoby added: ""The safety of the players, staff and public is the most important thing and, while it's disappointing that we cannot finish our eight remaining games, we appreciate that a decision has now been made."" Crystal Palace,who were eighth in the 11-team Championship, posted on Twitter: ""Obviously a disappointing end to the season but the safety of our players and staff is paramount.

Branson space rocket fails on debut flight,"Cosmic Girl pulls away as LauncherOne ignites: The rocket's flight terminated shortly after Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit company has tried unsuccessfully to launch a rocket over the Pacific Ocean. The booster was released from under the wing of one of the UK entrepreneur's old jumbos which had been specially converted for the task. The rocket ignited its engine seconds later but an anomaly meant the flight was terminated early. Virgin Orbit's goal is to try to capture a share of the emerging market for the launch of small satellites. It's not clear at this stage precisely what went wrong but the firm had warned beforehand that the chances of success might be only 50:50. The history of rocketry shows that maiden outings very often encounter technical problems. ""Test flights are instrumented to yield data and we now have a treasure trove of that. We accomplished many of the goals we set for ourselves, though not as many as we would have liked,"" said Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart. ""Nevertheless, we took a big step forward today. Our engineers are already poring through the data. Our next rocket is waiting. We will learn, adjust, and begin preparing for our next test, which is coming  up soon."" Virgin spaceship moves to operational base Virgin presses 747 into space action The next rocket on the production line is in the late stages of integration The company is sure to be back for another attempt pretty soon - depending on the outcome of the post-mission analysis. The second rocket is undergoing final integration at the company's Long Beach factory in California and could be ready to fly within weeks. Most publicity about Sir Richard's space activities has focussed on the tourist plane he is developing to take fare-paying passengers on joy rides above the atmosphere. His satellite-launch venture is entirely separate. Orbit is chasing the growing interest in small spacecraft that are being designed for telecommunications and Earth observation. New manufacturing techniques, often involving ""off-the-shelf"" components from the consumer electronics industry, mean these satellites can now be turned out for a fraction of their historic cost. But they need matching, inexpensive means of getting into space - and the air-launched system from Virgin Orbit is intended to meet this demand. Sunday's flight illustrated the basic launch concept. The 747, known as Cosmic Girl, left Mojave Air and Space Port to the north of Los Angeles shortly before midday Pacific time (19:00 GMT / 20:00 BST), carrying the rocket, dubbed LauncherOne, under its left wing. At 35,000ft (10km), just west of the Channel Islands, the jet unlatched the liquid-fuelled booster to let it go into freefall. LauncherOne ignited its NewtonThree engine four seconds later to start the climb to orbit. But it seems it didn't get very far. ""LauncherOne maintained stability after release, and we ignited our first-stage engine, NewtonThree. An anomaly then occurred early in first-stage flight. We'll learn more as our engineers analyse the mountain of data we collected today,""the company's Twitter feed reported,external. Allow Twitter content?

Sir Richard was not in attendance, but he was following events very closely, Orbit executives said. Although his space start-up is headquartered in California currently, he is keen to bring it to the UK also. Orbit is working through the possibilities with the US and British governments, the UK Space Agency and the local authorities in the southwest of England. Newquay Airport in Cornwall has been identified as an ideal location from which to base operations. Britain's enthusiasm is tied closely to that of its satellite manufacturing sector. The country is one of the biggest producers in the world of compact spacecraft. Will Whitehorn is president of the trade body UKSpace. He also initiated early design work on an air-launched rocket system when working for Sir Richard in the late 2000s. ""Everyone's attention right now is on the astronauts launching this week on a SpaceX rocket, but from an industrial perspective [Virgin Orbit] is just as significant,"" he told BBC News. ""If the coronavirus has taught us anything it is that our world is changing and space is going to be a big part of that. We could put so much industry outside the atmosphere.

Prince Charles issues warning on the artsThe Prince says it is important that theatres and orchestras flourish after the coronavirus.Entertainment & Arts,"The prince is patron of the Royal Opera and president of the Royal Ballet amongst other positions The Prince of Wales has raised concerns about how orchestras and theatres will survive the coronavirus crisis. Many theatres and concert halls are struggling after closing their doors during lockdown, with no clear indication of when shows might resume, Prince Charles said it was important to ""find a way of keeping these orchestras and other arts bodies going"". The prince, who is patron of dozens of arts institutions, noted they were of ""enormous importance"" to the economy. ""It's absolutely crucial that they can come back twice as enthusiastic as before,"" he said in an interview with Classic FM. Theatres 'could be closed until next year' Why 2020 'is a write-off' for gigs and festivals National Theatre 'haemorrhaging money' The heads of the National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company and the Southbank Centre have all warned they are facing financial collapse without additional government assistance due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Royal Opera House, of which Prince Charles is a patron, says it has seen 60% of house income fall away since the start of the crisis. ""They're in terrible difficulties, of course, because how are they going to be able to restart?"" said the prince. ""It is a very expensive art form, but it is crucial because it has such a worldwide impact... and so we have to find a way to make sure these marvellous people and organisations are going to survive through all this."" The 71-year-old, who spent a week in self-isolation aftertesting positive for coronavirus in March, was talking to Alan Titchmarsh for a specialClassic FM programme,externalcelebrating his life-long love of classical music. He recalled his first visit to the Royal Opera House, in 1956, to see the Bolshoi Ballet perform The Fountain of Bakhchisarai in their debut tour of the UK. ""The music was unbelievably exciting,"" he said. ""It was all Tartar dancing and cracking the whips and leaping in the air and doing unbelievably energetic things, which only the Bolshoi could do. ""I was completely inspired by that... Which is why it's so important, I think, for grandparents and other relations to take children at about the age of seven to experience some form of the arts in performance."" The prince said he had helped choose the music for his son's wedding to Kate Middleton Elsewhere in the interview, the prince revealed he had helped Prince William curate the musical choices for his 2011 wedding to Kate Middleton. ""I love trying to organise some interesting, I hope, pieces of music for certain occasionsâ¦particularly for weddings if people want,"" he said. ""I know my eldest son was quite understanding and was perfectly happy for me to suggest a few pieces for their wedding."" ""I hope that gave some people pleasure, but it's rather fun having orchestras in for great occasions like that, and why not suggest a few pieces occasionally?  Anyway... I do enjoy it."" The 2011 Royal Wedding service included pieces from Bach, Elgar, Britten and Vaughan Williams. Three of the pieces - Farewell to Stromness, Touch Her Soft Lips and Part and Romance for String Orchestra Op. 11 - were chosen specifically because they were played at the service of prayer and dedication at Charles and Camilla's wedding in 2005.

Branson space rocket fails on debut flightA California company owned by UK businessman Sir Richard Branson fails to launch a rocket to orbit.Science & Environment,"Cosmic Girl pulls away as LauncherOne ignites: The rocket's flight terminated shortly after Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit company has tried unsuccessfully to launch a rocket over the Pacific Ocean. The booster was released from under the wing of one of the UK entrepreneur's old jumbos which had been specially converted for the task. The rocket ignited its engine seconds later but an anomaly meant the flight was terminated early. Virgin Orbit's goal is to try to capture a share of the emerging market for the launch of small satellites. It's not clear at this stage precisely what went wrong but the firm had warned beforehand that the chances of success might be only 50:50. The history of rocketry shows that maiden outings very often encounter technical problems. ""Test flights are instrumented to yield data and we now have a treasure trove of that. We accomplished many of the goals we set for ourselves, though not as many as we would have liked,"" said Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart. ""Nevertheless, we took a big step forward today. Our engineers are already poring through the data. Our next rocket is waiting. We will learn, adjust, and begin preparing for our next test, which is coming  up soon."" Virgin spaceship moves to operational base Virgin presses 747 into space action The next rocket on the production line is in the late stages of integration The company is sure to be back for another attempt pretty soon - depending on the outcome of the post-mission analysis. The second rocket is undergoing final integration at the company's Long Beach factory in California and could be ready to fly within weeks. Most publicity about Sir Richard's space activities has focussed on the tourist plane he is developing to take fare-paying passengers on joy rides above the atmosphere. His satellite-launch venture is entirely separate. Orbit is chasing the growing interest in small spacecraft that are being designed for telecommunications and Earth observation. New manufacturing techniques, often involving ""off-the-shelf"" components from the consumer electronics industry, mean these satellites can now be turned out for a fraction of their historic cost. But they need matching, inexpensive means of getting into space - and the air-launched system from Virgin Orbit is intended to meet this demand. Sunday's flight illustrated the basic launch concept. The 747, known as Cosmic Girl, left Mojave Air and Space Port to the north of Los Angeles shortly before midday Pacific time (19:00 GMT / 20:00 BST), carrying the rocket, dubbed LauncherOne, under its left wing. At 35,000ft (10km), just west of the Channel Islands, the jet unlatched the liquid-fuelled booster to let it go into freefall. LauncherOne ignited its NewtonThree engine four seconds later to start the climb to orbit. But it seems it didn't get very far. ""LauncherOne maintained stability after release, and we ignited our first-stage engine, NewtonThree. An anomaly then occurred early in first-stage flight. We'll learn more as our engineers analyse the mountain of data we collected today,""the company's Twitter feed reported,external. Allow Twitter content?

Sir Richard was not in attendance, but he was following events very closely, Orbit executives said. Although his space start-up is headquartered in California currently, he is keen to bring it to the UK also. Orbit is working through the possibilities with the US and British governments, the UK Space Agency and the local authorities in the southwest of England. Newquay Airport in Cornwall has been identified as an ideal location from which to base operations. Britain's enthusiasm is tied closely to that of its satellite manufacturing sector. The country is one of the biggest producers in the world of compact spacecraft. Will Whitehorn is president of the trade body UKSpace. He also initiated early design work on an air-launched rocket system when working for Sir Richard in the late 2000s. ""Everyone's attention right now is on the astronauts launching this week on a SpaceX rocket, but from an industrial perspective [Virgin Orbit] is just as significant,"" he told BBC News. ""If the coronavirus has taught us anything it is that our world is changing and space is going to be a big part of that. We could put so much industry outside the atmosphere. Take just the example of server farms. We know we could put them in space to harness solar power. It all comes down to the cost of access to space and that will be revolutionised by this kind of system.""

Large numbers of visitors travelled to the south coast on Monday and pictures from Birling Gap in East Sussex show people standing on the chalk cliffs. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it was ""more important than ever"" to stay away from the crumbling coastline. ""Coronavirus hasn't gone away and your choices might put our frontline responders at risk,"" it said. ""We really can't stress enough how important it is to keep back from cliff edges, There is no 'safe' place to be and the cliffs along the UK coastline are continuously eroding. "" The chalk cliffs at Birling Gap are prone to collapse Rescue teams have been deployed to beaches, cliff and marinas across the country to ""look out for anyone in trouble and offer safety advice where needed,"" the agency said. It said its pre-emptive measures were especially important whileRNLI lifeguards provide a limited service due to coronavirus.

Non-essential shops to reopen from 15 June - PMBoris Johnson says all shops can reopen in England next month if they meet certain Covid-19 guidelines.UK,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces date for non-essential shops in England to reopen All non-essential retailers will be able to reopen in England from 15 June, Boris Johnson has announced, as part of plans to further ease the lockdown. However, the move is ""contingent on progress in the fight against coronavirus"", and retailers will have to adhere to new guidelines to protect shoppers and workers, the PM added. Outdoor markets and car showrooms will be able to reopen from 1 June. It comes as the number of coronavirus deaths in the UK rose by 121 to 36,914. Mr Johnson saidnew guidance had been published,externalfor the retail sector ""detailing the measures they should take to meet the necessary social distancing and hygiene standards"". ""Shops now have the time to implement this guidance before they reopen,"" he said. ""This will ensure there can be no doubt about what steps they should take."" He added: ""I want people to be confident that they can shop safely, provided they follow the social distancing rules for all premises."" Commenting on the development, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""Enabling these businesses to open will be a critical step on the road to rebuilding our economy, and will support millions of jobs across the UK."" The British Retail Consortium said it welcomed the announcement, adding it provided ""much-needed clarity on the route ahead"". This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping A spokesman for the Confederation of British Industry added that the new guidance would help retailers to open ""safely and securely"". However, not all businesses are pleased with the announcement. The British Association of Independent Retailers said many small shops had been preparing to open from next week, adding: ""It is therefore a little disappointing for the smaller retailers not to be able to open until June  15, especially as they can make it safe to do so."" And analyst Catherine Shuttleworth, from the Savvy retail marketing agency, told the Today programme: ""It is fine saying the stores can open, but are we going to have the appetite to go back? ""Shopping is a social, fun experience a lot of the time and social distancing takes that away. It's going to be a very different way of shopping from what we're used to."" This is extremely welcome news for a sector that was struggling even before the pandemic. The problem of falling footfall on the High Street looked like a walk in the park compared to months of shuttered windows. When 15 June comes around, shops will look rather different to what we've been used to, with limits to the number of people allowed in, and restrictions on how people move around shops. There might also be screens in place, and hygiene products on arrival. However, some of these measures will be harder to implement than others - such as encouraging customers to avoid handling products while browsing. I don't regret what I did, says Cummings What did Dominic Cummings do during lockdown? 'Virus may be here for year' so schools must open The announcement at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing came after a lengthy press conference involving the PM's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. Mr Cummings has been facing calls to resign after it emerged he had driven his child and ill wife 260 miles from London to County Durham during lockdown. But at the press conference, the former Vote Leave chief saidhe did not regret his actions and believed he had acted ""reasonably"" within the law. This video can not be played Dominic Cummings' full statement on lockdown row On the subject of why he then drove his family to the town of Barnard Castle - 15 days after he had displayed symptoms - he said he was testing his eyesight to see if he could make the trip back down to London.

Government draws up rescue plan for key companiesThe government could aid strategically important firms affected by the coronavirus pandemic.Business,"The UK government has indicated it is prepared to rescue large British companies severely affected by the coronavirus crisis. The Treasury said ""last resort"" support could be made available if a firm's failure would ""disproportionately harm the UK economy"". The move follows indications that a number of big firms are seeking government help to survive the crisis. These includeJaguar Land Rover, which is in talks to secure a Â£1bn loan. The government has already put in place various initiatives to help companies weather the pandemic, including loan programmes, deferring of tax payments and the furlough scheme, which allows workers to receive 80% of their salary paid by the government. According to latest figures, eight million workers are covered by the furlough scheme which has been extended until the end of October. But from August, businesses will be expected to meet part of the cost of the scheme. Concern is growing that some big firms are still in difficulties even after making use of these options. The bailout plan, named ""Project Birch"",was mentioned by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps,externalin Parliament last week when discussing the future of the aviation industry. It could involve the state taking stakes in companies, although extending existing loans would be preferable. Unite the union welcomed the plan but urged the government to act quickly. ""There is no more time to lose if we are to prevent a tsunami of job losses from sweeping through communities this summer,"" said Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner. ""We still need to ensure that proposed changes to the job retention scheme do not undermine a plan to recover and rebuild and that workers continue to get their wages."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We have put in place unprecedented levels of support to help businesses get through this crisis. ""Beyond that, many firms are getting support from established market mechanisms, such as existing shareholders, bank lending and commercial finance. ""In exceptional circumstances, where a viable company has exhausted all options and its failure would disproportionately harm the economy, we may consider support on a 'last resort' basis. ""As the British public would expect, we are putting in place sensible contingency planning and any such support would be on terms that protect the taxpayer."" Coronavirus: How will airlines get flying again? Coronavirus: Self-employed grant claims top two million The BBC understands the Treasury would have to notify Parliament of any spend incurred, and although companies might seek financial assistance, this does not mean such support will be given. On Saturday,Sky News reported,externalthat Tata Steel, Britain's biggest steel producer, had approached both the Welsh and UK governments for financial aid that could run into hundreds of millions. Tata Steel says there has been a sudden drop in European steel demand Earlier this week, Welsh MP Stephen Kinnock told parliament that Tata Steel, which owns the steelworks in Port Talbot, needs around Â£500m in order to survive the pandemic. And according to the Financial Times, aviation industry bosses have been asking the government for a ""long-term investment facility"" that would help to support supply chains. Jim O'Neill, former Treasury minister and ex-chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told the newspaper he had been in discussion with government officials about creating a public sector-owned funding body to take stakes in firms that would be ""inherently stable"" in times of normal economic activity.

Prince Charles issues warning on the arts,"The prince is patron of the Royal Opera and president of the Royal Ballet amongst other positions The Prince of Wales has raised concerns about how orchestras and theatres will survive the coronavirus crisis. Many theatres and concert halls are struggling after closing their doors during lockdown, with no clear indication of when shows might resume, Prince Charles said it was important to ""find a way of keeping these orchestras and other arts bodies going"". The prince, who is patron of dozens of arts institutions, noted they were of ""enormous importance"" to the economy. ""It's absolutely crucial that they can come back twice as enthusiastic as before,"" he said in an interview with Classic FM. Theatres 'could be closed until next year' Why 2020 'is a write-off' for gigs and festivals National Theatre 'haemorrhaging money' The heads of the National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company and the Southbank Centre have all warned they are facing financial collapse without additional government assistance due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Royal Opera House, of which Prince Charles is a patron, says it has seen 60% of house income fall away since the start of the crisis. ""They're in terrible difficulties, of course, because how are they going to be able to restart?"" said the prince. ""It is a very expensive art form, but it is crucial because it has such a worldwide impact... and so we have to find a way to make sure these marvellous people and organisations are going to survive through all this."" The 71-year-old, who spent a week in self-isolation aftertesting positive for coronavirus in March, was talking to Alan Titchmarsh for a specialClassic FM programme,externalcelebrating his life-long love of classical music. He recalled his first visit to the Royal Opera House, in 1956, to see the Bolshoi Ballet perform The Fountain of Bakhchisarai in their debut tour of the UK. ""The music was unbelievably exciting,"" he said. ""It was all Tartar dancing and cracking the whips and leaping in the air and doing unbelievably energetic things, which only the Bolshoi could do. ""I was completely inspired by that... Which is why it's so important, I think, for grandparents and other relations to take children at about the age of seven to experience some form of the arts in performance."" The prince said he had helped choose the music for his son's wedding to Kate Middleton Elsewhere in the interview, the prince revealed he had helped Prince William curate the musical choices for his 2011 wedding to Kate Middleton. ""I love trying to organise some interesting, I hope, pieces of music for certain occasionsâ¦particularly for weddings if people want,"" he said. ""I know my eldest son was quite understanding and was perfectly happy for me to suggest a few pieces for their wedding."" ""I hope that gave some people pleasure, but it's rather fun having orchestras in for great occasions like that, and why not suggest a few pieces occasionally?  Anyway... I do enjoy it."" The 2011 Royal Wedding service included pieces from Bach, Elgar, Britten and Vaughan Williams. Three of the pieces - Farewell to Stromness, Touch Her Soft Lips and Part and Romance for String Orchestra Op. 11 - were chosen specifically because they were played at the service of prayer and dedication at Charles and Camilla's wedding in 2005.

Government draws up rescue plan for key companies,"The UK government has indicated it is prepared to rescue large British companies severely affected by the coronavirus crisis. The Treasury said ""last resort"" support could be made available if a firm's failure would ""disproportionately harm the UK economy"". The move follows indications that a number of big firms are seeking government help to survive the crisis. These includeJaguar Land Rover, which is in talks to secure a Â£1bn loan. The government has already put in place various initiatives to help companies weather the pandemic, including loan programmes, deferring of tax payments and the furlough scheme, which allows workers to receive 80% of their salary paid by the government. According to latest figures, eight million workers are covered by the furlough scheme which has been extended until the end of October. But from August, businesses will be expected to meet part of the cost of the scheme. Concern is growing that some big firms are still in difficulties even after making use of these options. The bailout plan, named ""Project Birch"",was mentioned by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps,externalin Parliament last week when discussing the future of the aviation industry. It could involve the state taking stakes in companies, although extending existing loans would be preferable. Unite the union welcomed the plan but urged the government to act quickly. ""There is no more time to lose if we are to prevent a tsunami of job losses from sweeping through communities this summer,"" said Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner. ""We still need to ensure that proposed changes to the job retention scheme do not undermine a plan to recover and rebuild and that workers continue to get their wages."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We have put in place unprecedented levels of support to help businesses get through this crisis. ""Beyond that, many firms are getting support from established market mechanisms, such as existing shareholders, bank lending and commercial finance. ""In exceptional circumstances, where a viable company has exhausted all options and its failure would disproportionately harm the economy, we may consider support on a 'last resort' basis. ""As the British public would expect, we are putting in place sensible contingency planning and any such support would be on terms that protect the taxpayer."" Coronavirus: How will airlines get flying again? Coronavirus: Self-employed grant claims top two million The BBC understands the Treasury would have to notify Parliament of any spend incurred, and although companies might seek financial assistance, this does not mean such support will be given. On Saturday,Sky News reported,externalthat Tata Steel, Britain's biggest steel producer, had approached both the Welsh and UK governments for financial aid that could run into hundreds of millions. Tata Steel says there has been a sudden drop in European steel demand Earlier this week, Welsh MP Stephen Kinnock told parliament that Tata Steel, which owns the steelworks in Port Talbot, needs around Â£500m in order to survive the pandemic. And according to the Financial Times, aviation industry bosses have been asking the government for a ""long-term investment facility"" that would help to support supply chains. Jim O'Neill, former Treasury minister and ex-chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told the newspaper he had been in discussion with government officials about creating a public sector-owned funding body to take stakes in firms that would be ""inherently stable"" in times of normal economic activity.

Grenfell fears prevent timber building boomPlans to reduce the height of wood-based properties contradicts advice to increase construction.Business,"Fears of another Grenfell-type fire are stunting the spread of wood-based buildings in England. The government is planning to reduce the maximum height of wood-framed buildings from six storeys to four. The moveâs been recommended by the emergency services in order to reduce fire risk. But it contradicts other advice to increase timber construction because trees lock up climate-heating carbon emissions. In France, President Macron has ruled all new publicly-funded buildings should be at least 50% timber or other natural materials by 2022. And in Norway a new âply-scraperâ stretches fully 18 storeys â  thatâs the height recently deemed safe by standards authorities in North America. 18-storey ""ply-scraper"" Members of the timber trade say the Government in England has misunderstood the science behind timber construction. They say timber walls can be made safe by methods including flame-retardant treatments and fire-resistant claddings. They point out that it is futile planting millions of trees if they are left to rot and release the CO2 they previously captured. Plans for Forest Green Rover's new wood-based football stadium have been approved In a consultation ending on Monday, ministers propose the height of timber-based flats, hotels, and boarding houses should be limited to 11 metres â thatâs 3-4 storeys. In higher buildings timber would be permitted in floors but banned from outside walls. This further tightens rules introduced after the Grenfell disaster, following representation from fire authorities. Matt Linegar from the Finnish timber giant Stora Enso told BBC News: âObviously no-one wants to see another tragedy like Grenfell; protecting life is the main concern. âBut the government is over-reacting. Properly-constructed timber buildings can be safe in a fire â it depends on the design. âEven with the current guidelines introduced after Grenfell there has been a chilling effect on the industry. People commissioning buildings think âIâd better not use timberâ. The market has virtually dried up.â A study from the Germanyâs Potsdam Institute,external(PIK), found that a global boom in wood buildings could lock in up to 700 million tons of carbon a year. It said a five-story residential building structured in laminated timber can store up to 180 kilos of carbon per square metre - three times more than in the trunk, branches and leaves of natural forests. PIKâs Hans Schellnhuber said: âSocieties have made good use of wood for buildings for many centuries, yet now the challenge of climate stabilisation calls for a very serious up-scaling. ""If we engineer the wood into modern building materials and smartly manage harvest and construction, we humans can build ourselves a safe home on Earth.â The head of the Committee on Climate Change, Chris Stark, told BBC News: âTimber buildings can be tall and safe. Displacing cement, brick and steel with wood means more than double the carbon savings in buildings overall. âWith encouragement from the Government, we could triple the amount of carbon locked into buildings â one of the simplest steps we can take to help meet the UKâs climate goals.â A government spokesperson said the consultation responses would be studied before final decisions were made.

"School reopening plan will go ahead, says PM","This video can not be played PM: Phased reopening of schools to begin from June 1 Parents and teachers should prepare for the phased reopening of schools in England to start on 1 June as planned, the prime minister has confirmed. Boris Johnson said the government intended to reopen then for early years pupils, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. On June 15, up to a quarter of Year 10 and Year 12 will be allowed ""some contact"" to help prepare for exams. Schools closed on 20 March, except for key workers' children and vulnerable children, as Covid-19 spread in the UK. Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson said he was setting out the government's intention so teachers and parents could ""plan in earnest"" for school to resume in just over a week. He said the formal decision would be taken as part of the three-week review into the lockdown measures, which the government is legally required to carry out by Thursday. With many teachers expressing concerns about wider reopening, Mr Johnson said he acknowledged that it ""may not be possible"" for all schools, adding that the government will support those ""experiencing difficulties"" to reopen as soon as possible. More councils warn over opening schools on 1 June Key evidence on opening schools revealed Is your local authority reopening schools? Mr Johnson said reopening schools was a crucial part of the next phase of the government's response to the pandemic because ""the education of our children is crucial for their welfare, their health, their long-term future and for social justice"". ""So in line with the decisions taken in many other countries, we want to start getting our children back into the classroom in a way that is as manageable and as safe as possible,"" he said. Schools have been preparing measures to teach safely during the pandemic The proposal had prompted concerns from teaching unions, head teachers and many local authorities. Speaking after the prime minister's announcement, Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the union did not agree that it would be right to reopen more widely. He called on the government to ""engage meaningfully"" with unions to address concerns over issues such such as protective equipment for staff and procedures for dealing with an outbreak. A BBC Breakfast survey with responses from 99 councils found that only 20 were advising schools to open more widely on 1 June. Another 15 said they would not be advising schools to reopen to more pupils and 68 said they could not guarantee reopening for Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 as the government intended. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? The timetable also sets England apart from other parts of the UK, where schools are not expected to open until later. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted,externalafter the prime minister's briefing ""to avoid a resurgence we must move carefully"". Schools in Scotland are scheduled to begin to reopen on 11 August, the beginning of the autumn term. In Northern Ireland, they are not expected to reopen before September. And Wales has ruled out a return to school on 1 June, with the education minister saying only that they will reopen ""when it is safe to do so"". The government ""has not done a good job in building confidence"", said head teachers' leaders. This tough report card wasn't about political events - but the way that reopening schools in England is being handled. Boris Johnson repeated the aim for opening primary schools on 1 June - although at the same time acknowledging the reality that many will not really open, with teachers' unions and some local authorities and parents not convinced of its safety. There are some adjustments. Secondary school pupils in Years 10 and 12 will now go back from 15 June. The first few primary year groups are still set to return on 1 June. But heads still have no explanation for how for the last month of term they are meant to fit all their primary years into school full-time, while at the same time only allowing 15 children per classroom. A lack of trust still seems to be confusing plans for a return to school - only a week before children should be getting ready for their first day back since March. Mr Johnson said teaching unions, head teachers and local authorities in England would be able to ""ask questions and probe the evidence"" further over the coming days and said that""detailed guidance"" had been published,externalsetting out how to ensure safety. That included smaller classes, staggered times for breaks, drop-offs and pick-ups, and reducing the use of shared items, the prime minister said. Staff and students would have access to coronavirus testing, he said, and ""if they test positive we will take the appropriate reactive measures"".

Spain to stop quarantining arrivals from 1 JulyThe country hopes to save the summer season but UK tourists face quarantine in their own country.Business,"Foreign visitors to Spain will no longer have to undergo a two-week quarantine from 1 July, the government has announced. It said the measure had been finalised in a cabinet meeting on Monday. Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya had previously said the requirement would be lifted in July, without giving a date. The news comes as the UK government prepares to bring in its own 14-day quarantine policy from 8 June. Travel firms and other industry bodies say the UK should relax the measure for visitors arriving from countries where people are at a lower risk of contracting the coronavirus. Spain normally attracts 80 million tourists a year, with the sector providing more than 12% of the country's GDP. Opening up the holiday market again before the summer season is over is seen as crucial to the Spanish economy. But under the UK's new policy, any tourists returning home after taking holidays in Spain and most other foreign destinations would have to spend two weeks in self-isolation. Several airlines including EasyJet, Jet2 and Ryanair have announced that they plan to resume flights and holidays soon. Easyjet will be resuming flights from 22 airports across Europe from 15 June, as well as regional flights across the UK. But there will only be one international flight from the UK - from Gatwick to Nice in France. Jet2 is planning to resume full services from 1 July, and will fly to several Spanish and Italian destinations, before opening up to Greece and Croatia later in the year. And Ryanair will be restoring 40% of its flights from 1 July and will resume flights from most of the 80 airports it flies from across Europe. Business groups wrote to Boris Johnson on Sunday saying the quarantine would have ""serious consequences"" for the economy andcalling for ""air bridge"" deals to be struck with other nations. In their letter to the prime minister, bosses of airlines EasyJet, Tui, Jet2 and Virgin Atlantic, as well as industry bodies Airlines UK, the British Chambers of Commerce, UK Hospitality and manufacturing association Made UK said they had ""serious reservations"" about a ""blanket approach"" to all arrivals into Britain. Instead, they are asking for a more ""targeted, risk-based"" approach when establishing air links with countries that have high infection rates from the pandemic. ""The alternative risks major damage to the arteries of UK trade with key industry supply chains, whilst pushing the UK to the back of the queue as states begin conversations for opening up their borders,"" says the letter.

Drivers 'to walk more' to keep lockdown clean air,"Many British towns and cities are making more road space available for pedestrians and cyclists British drivers are ready to change their behaviour to maintain the cleaner air of the lockdown and protect the environment, a survey suggests. Of the 20,000 motorists polled for the AA, half said they would walk more and 40% intended to drive less. Four in five would take some action to reduce their impact on air quality. It comes after researchers warned thedramatic improvements in air qualityin recent weeks could be quickly reversed as the coronavirus restrictions ease. Car surge could see CO2 rebound after Covid-19 How coronavirus is driving a revolution in travel Air pollution plummets across UK amid lockdown As well as walking more and driving less, a quarter of motorists said they planned to work from home more, another quarter said they would be flying less, while one in five plan to cycle more. ""We have all enjoyed the benefits of cleaner air during lockdown and it is gratifying that the vast majority of drivers want to do their bit to maintain the cleaner air,"" said AA president Edmund King. ""Walking and cycling more, coupled with less driving and more working from home, could have a significant effect on both reducing congestion and maintaining cleaner air."" Meanwhile, the AA is warning drivers in England -now able to drive to destinations for exercise or open-air recreation- against travelling to tourist destinations this Bank Holiday Monday. ""Drivers should think about how far they need to travel to enjoy the great outdoors,"" Mr King said. The UK government has pledged Â£250m for improvements in cycling and walking infrastructure and many British towns and cities are alreadymaking more road space available for pedestrians and those on bikes. It is the first part of a Â£5bn investment announced in February, the Department for Transport said. But the official advice from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps as some people start to go back to work is that people should drive rather than use public transport, when walking or cycling is not a viable option. This video can not be played How will commuting change after lockdown? Researchers warned thattraffic could surge back onto the roads, in astudy published last week,external. They found the dramatic fall in traffic has been key to the 17% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that was recorded at the peak of the coronavirus crisis in early April. Surface transport emissions emissions - including vehicles and industry - declined by 43%, the same as the drop from industry and power generation combined. By contrast, the fall in the emission from aviation only accounted for 10% of the decrease. Roadside wildflowers bloom under lockdown Top 10 tips for combating climate change revealed To avoid increases in traffic the AA is urging the government to find solutions to help people get around on journeys where walking and cycling are not an option. It is calling for emergency park and cycle sites to be set up on the edge of cities. But, the organisation warns, even if motorists want to get back in their cars, they may find getting them started after the weeks of lockdown difficult. It reports an uptick in breakdowns since restrictions have been eased, as many vehicles left unused throughout lockdown were started for the first time. The main cause, the AA says, is flat batteries. If you are going to drive, it advises, check the tyre pressure, oil and coolant levels and top up washer fluid if needed.

Could you have to pay your bank to save money?,"High street banks in countries with negative interest rates have so far been reluctant to pass them on to customers The Bank of England has taken another step towards adding negative interest rates to its crisis-fighting toolbox. It's givenHigh Street banks six monthsto be operationally ready for them. Policymakers stressed that this did not mean that sub-zero borrowing costs were ""imminent, or indeed in prospect"". But what exactly are negative interest rates? And could a world where savers are penalised and borrowers rewarded end up doing more harm than good? The term ""interest rates"" is often used interchangeably with the Bank of England base rate. Described as the ""single most important interest rate,externalin the UK"", the base rate determines how much interest the Bank of England pays to financial institutions that hold money with it, and what it charges them to borrow. High street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers, as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage. The Bank of England usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less. It cut them to afresh low of 0.1% in March 2020to try to stimulate the economy amid thecoronavirus pandemic. In theory, taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect. But in practice, it's a bit more complicated. After all, why would anyone pay to stash money in a savings account or lend someone money, when they can keep the cash at home for free? The Bank of England's number one job is to keep prices across the economy rising steadily every year. This is known as the Bank's inflation target, which is set at 2% by the government. Inflation measures how quickly the cost of living is rising. And, measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), itstood at 0.6% in December, up from 0.3% in November 2020. While low inflation means prices aren't rising quickly, if it remains low for too long, bosses start factoring that into pay reviews. This can then dampen consumer confidence and spending. Central banks have been cutting interest rates to spur inflation for years. But as rates approached zero across the developed world, a handful went a step further. Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and the 19 nations of the eurozone all took interest rates below zero. In Switzerland, negative interest rates have also helped to discourage investors from pouring money into the country during times of uncertainty. British savers have already seen their returns dwindle in recent years. The average UK instant access account pays just 0.12%, according to the Bank of England, while accounts that require you to lock your money away currently offer an average return of 0.51%. In countries with sub-zero interest rates, commercial banks have passed them on to big companies. However, the evidence suggests there is a very high bar to pass the pain on to ordinary savers. Christina Nyman, chief economist at Swedish lender Handelsbanken, says charging savers to put money in their own accounts is seen as ""taboo"" in Sweden. She says: ""Competition is fierce, and households are ready to move their money to another bank, so nobody wants to lose business."" Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse only impose negative rates on deposits of more than 2 million Swiss francs. In Germany, where some banks impose charges on deposits of more than â¬100,000 (Â£90,000), some people have started stashing their money in vaults. German demand for bank vaults has risen since the European Central Bank introduced negative interest rates. According to Germany's central bank, physical cash holdings by families and businesses there have almost trebled to â¬43.4bn since the European Central Bank (ECB) introduced a negative deposit rate in 2014. But David Oxley at Capital Economics says there hasn't been a wider shift towards cash because most people still prefer the security and convenience of keeping it in the bank. Putting it in a vault ""runs the risk of the money either being lost, stolen, or damaged,"" he says. ""Bank deposits cannot catch fire, but banknotes can."" What is the UK's inflation rate? What is GDP? How will we pay for the coronavirus crisis? Negative rate mortgages already exist. In 2019, Danish bank Jyske announced that it would effectively pay borrowers 0.5% a year to take out a 10-year loan. James Pomeroy, an economist at HSBC, says this was only possible because of the nature of the mortgage market. When someone in Denmark applies for a home loan, Danish banks act as a middleman between potential borrowers and investors. ""In Denmark the banks don't take the hit, investors do,"" says Mr Pomeroy. ""Banks are then charging higher product fees, so have actually made money off of this."" But negative rate mortgages are unlikely to be offered in the UK any time soon. When UK interest rates were slashed to 0.5% in March 2009, some borrowers thought they could be in line for a payment. Around 1,500 Cheltenham and Gloucester customers,externalhad a mortgage that tracked 1.01 percentage points below the Bank of England base rate. But any prospect of a windfall was quickly dashed when financial regulators described interest payments as ""a one-way obligation on the borrower"". Around 1,500 Cheltenham & Gloucester borrowers did not benefit from negative interest rates when the Bank of England slashed rates to 0.5% in 2009. In a letter to UK bank bosses,external, Sam Woods, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), said some lenders would need up to 18 months to make permanent changes needed to deal with negative rates. While ""short-term fixes"" could be implemented within six months, upgrading systems not built to deal with a negative Bank of England base rate would take longer, especially for some mortgage customers. Banks said they would find it easier to explain and implement changes to big corporate clients, because many already had international experience with negative rates. What are the side effects of negative interest rates? Negative interest rates hit bank earnings by squeezing the gap between the money they make on loans and what they pay to savers. ""If not passed on to customers, negative rates would hurt bank profitability, especially at a time when they are expected to be hit by crisis-related loan losses,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou, chief economist at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF). Building societies like the Nationwide look after Â£1 in every Â£5 of British savings Negative interest rates pose a particular challenge to building societies, which hold around Â£1 of every Â£5 in British savings accounts. While commercial banks can access cheaper borrowing by tapping financial markets, building societies must raise at least half their funding from individual savers.

Thanks
for staying with us. Before we go, hereâs a round-up of some of the biggest
stories so far.  And finally, quite a few of us have worked all day to bring the latest developments to you, including Owen Amos, Krutika Pathi, Aparna Alluri, Andreas Illmer, Anna Jones, Saira Asher, Frances Mao, Victoria Bisset, Ben Collins, Sean Fanning, Raffi Berg, Joshua Nevett, Shamaan Freeman-Powell, Neil Johnston, Gary Kitchener, Michael Emons, Sophie Williams, Hazel Shearing, Victoria Lindrea, Jennifer Scott, Holly Honderich and Paulin Kola. Coronavirus has been described as an invisible killer and what can be more terrifying than that? It's unsurprising, therefore, that many people are fearful of going out, returning life to normal or even letting children go back to school. Our Reality Check team has spoken to experts who explain the risks and how to quantify them. Read more here Europe is opening up further, with citizens tasting freedoms they have missed during the coronavirus pandemic. In the Czech Republic, people can finally get back into pubs, albeit with social distancing and mask-wearing indoors. It is the country with the highest per capita beer consumption in the world. BBC correspondent Rob Cameron visited a brewery in Prague to see how the measures are working in pubs. Read more about the ways Europe is easing the lockdown here. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Czechs return to bars and restaurants - in masks Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Political advisers are meant occasionally perhaps to be seen and not heard. Dominic Cummings, the UK prime ministerâs right hand man, took a dramatic step today explaining why the decision to leave London during the lockdown could be justified. He majored on the small print, unusual for a man used to painting political campaigns in bold primary colours, but knowing that so many members of the public were incensed by what had happened. He spent a long time answering as many questions as there were, trying to explain something that many in the Tory Party felt could not be explained, trying to make the best of a very bad situation for the prime minister. But it's far from clear tonight whether Dominic Cummings has managed to save himself for the long term.   Our Reality Check team spoke to intensive care doctors across the UK about their observations from the front line. One of the phrases that emerged time after time is, ""We've never seen anything like this before"". And as the number of cases increased, doctors up and down the UK were reading first-hand accounts from colleagues in China, and then in Italy - in scientific journals and on social media - about the intensity of infection. ""It felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the D-Day landings,"" says Barbara Miles, clinical director of intensive care at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, ""with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing"". But what arrived in the UK as winter turned into spring took even the most experienced ICU specialists by surprise. Read more here Iceland took a different approach than most countries caught in the coronavirus pandemic and, after extensive testing of its population of around 328,000, public gatherings of up to 200 people are allowed while night clubs and gyms are to reopen. Anyone who wanted a test received one, while schools and day care centresremained open. It has confirmed 1,804 infections and 10 deaths but there have been only five new cases reported in May. Coronavirus tests have been performed on more than 16% of its people - a greater proportion than in almost any other country thanks in part to its small population. Patrick Ewing, former NBA star and Georgetown basketball coach, has been released from hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, his son confirmed on Monday. The former New York Knicks player announced that he had tested positive for the virus on Friday. His son, Patrick Ewing Jr. said on Twitter: ""My father is now home and getting better. We'll continue to watch his symptoms and follow the CDC guidelines. I hope everyone continues to stay safe and protect yourselves and your loved ones."" Ewing features in the recent The Last Dance documentary, which is based onMichael Jordan's all-conquering Chicago Bullsand their hunt for a sixth NBA title in the 1997-98 season.  There have been small protests against the lockdown across Germany Germany has been widely praised for its response to the coronavirus.
The government quickly implemented a mass testing programme, and the death toll
is far lower by population than in many other European nations. Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a relaxation of national lockdown measuresthis month after discussions with leaders of the  16 states. Each controls the timing of reopenings, and can also reimpose
restrictions. But divisions are growing as some states favour easing
lockdown faster than others. Bodo Ramelow, premier of the eastern state of
Thuringia, has announced plans to drop compulsory social distancing and face mask
use as early as 6 June. The health minister in the neighbouring state of Saxony
said it was planning a âparadigm
changeâ with similar rules on the same day. But the government in Berlin fears what could happen if lockdown measures are eased too much. âUnder no
circumstances should the impression be given that the pandemic is over,â federal Health Minister Jens Spahn reportedly told Bild. The Star Drive-In Theater in Colorado has been opened since the start of May, with social distancing restrictions in place As of last week,all 50 US states have begun to partially reopenafter a two-month shutdown. On 20 May, Connecticut became the final state to loosen restrictions when it gave the green light to shops and restaurants under certain restrictions. So what's the latest? Allow Twitter content?

Toronto's Trinity Bellwoods Park was packed with 10,000 Sun worshippers on
Saturday, when temperatures soared above 20 C (68 F) after several weeks of bad
weather. Mayor John Tory was there himself, ostensibly to educate people about safe
social distancing. But itâs his behaviour that became a cause for concern when photos surfaced of
him speaking closely with others with his mask off his face. He has since apologised. ""I fully intended to properly physically distance, but it was very
difficult to do,â he said. He has also been criticised for not sending police to the park to ticket
rule breakers and maintain crowd control. Ontario reported 404 new cases of coronavirus on Monday, a 1.6% jump from
the day before. The uptick means government officials will keep groups limited
to five people longer than expected. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he was ""disappointed"" by peoples'
""reckless"" behaviour and urged those who were at the park to get
tested. Jyoti Kumari travelled to a suburb of the Indian capital Delhi to take care of her father after he was injured in an accident. But when the lockdown was introduced, the 15-year-old knew she had to get her father home to Bihar, a 1,200km-long (745 mile) journey. With no transport services due to the lockdown, she decided to cycle home with her father on the back of her bike. The pair also managed to hitch rides with lorries along the way. Learn more about the pair in this video. This video can not be played India coronavirus: The girl who cycled to save her father Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Sweden's Public Health Agency has
published official advice on dating and sexual relationships for the first time
since the start of the pandemic. The advice came as the agency announced that the Covid-19 death toll had passed 4,000. The agency has updated its online
guidelines to state that ""dating and temporary sexual relationships with
new partners...pose a risk of getting infected or infecting others"". However, it advises that
""closeness, intimacy and sex are good for well-being and public health"" and says that for those who are in relationships ""sex is no obstacle if you and
your partner, or partners, show no symptoms of illness"". Last month, Denmark
said that its social distancing guidelines did not extend to sexual
relationships, whether serious or casual. Sweden never had a lockdown and
has kept larger parts of society open than many countries, including bars and
restaurants. However, venues have already been asked to make efforts to avoid
mingling or hook-ups between strangers, for example by offering table-service
only and spacing out seating. Captain Sir Tom Moore raised Â£32.8m by walking laps of his garden before his 100th birthday The extraordinary fundraising achievement of Capt Tom Moore - now Sir Tom Moore - has been well documented. But what has the money he raised been spent on? The Â£32.8m raised by centenarian Sir Tom was in aid of the health service's charitable wing, NHS Charities Together. It is part of an overall Â£116m collected for the fund as part of its Covid-19 Urgent Appeal. Some Â£20m has been spent so far. Despite publicity given to shortages of protective clothing for staff, and the need for medical apparatus, these are classed as ""core"" equipment and funded by taxpayers. The focus of Charities Together is the comfort and wellbeing of staff and patients - things that, in the words of one NHS worker, ""make their working lives easier"". Among the NHS areas that will benefit include snacks for medical staff in County Durham, pop-up shops being funded in hospitals in London, improvements to NHS staff ""welfare"" areas and further catering provisions being brought into kitchenettes. Haroon Mota during one of his daily runs in Coventry A man who ran 260km (161.5 miles) whilefasting during Ramadan has raised Â£52,000 ($63,000) for charity. Haroon Mota, of Coventry, said thanks to ""overwhelming support"" he doubled his Â£25,000 target in the final week of his challenge. Before lockdown, the 34-year-old planned to run four major world marathons for the Penny Appeal - a charity that helps people in poverty around the world. He then decided to run 10km each evening during a 16- to 18-hour fast and said: ""I'm enjoying putting my feet up and resting and feel proud and pleased with the money raised."" Spain has revised its coronavirus death toll down by nearly 2,000 due to some fatalities being counted twice. The toll now stands at more than 26,800 rather than the 28,700 reported before. In addition to some deaths being counted twice, others had originally been notified as suspected or probably cases of Covid-19 which were subsequently not confirmed, officials said. Spain - one of the worst affected countries - continues to relax its lockdown measures. From 1 July, foreign visitors to the country will no longer have to undergo a two-week quarantine. Former Vice-President Joe Biden made his first public appearance since mid-March to visit a veterans memorial in his home state of Delaware. The presumptive Democratic nominee and his wife, Jill, donned black masks as they laid a wreath to mark Memorial Day - the American holiday dedicated to honouring military personnel who have died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. President Donald Trump also made a Memorial Day appearance, visiting Arlington National Cemetery with First Lady Melania before traveling to Fort McHenry in Baltimore. Neither wore masks. Mr Trump was criticised on Sunday for playing a round of gold at his club in Virginia, as the US death toll from coronavirus nears 100,000. There are now more than 1.5 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the US and more than 97,000 deaths. But the rates of the sick and dying are not spread evenly: the hardest hit areas are disproportionately Democrat-leaning. According to analysis by the New York Times, counties won by Republican President Donald Trump in 2016 have reported just 27% of infections and 21% of deaths, even though 45% of Americans live in these areas. Why? Part of the answer is linked to population density. The virus has wreaked most havoc in densely populated counties and urban America has long been Democrat-dominated. Overall, infections in some Republican-leaning counties are rising, while Democratic-led states like New York and New Jersey are seeing cases fall - but not at a rate fast enough to close the gap, the Times reports. The country's divides - urban/rural, Democrat/Republican - are exacerbated by wide discrepancies between states in their economic reopening. On the whole, Republican-led states have taken more aggressive steps to loosen social distancing, while Democratic governors have been more cautious. Coronavirus lockdown measures are being eased across the country - to the great relief of many. But the government has stressed that it is still important to maintain social distancing to avoid a second peak.

Since 13 March's suspension of elite football across the country, the FA - which runs England's women's leagues - has been determined to try to finish the season if safe to do so. Astatement from the FA,externalsaid the decision came after ""overwhelming feedback from clubs"" and was made ""in the best interest of the women's game"". Manchester City Women were top of the WSL table, one point clear of Chelsea, who had a  game in hand. The closure of restaurants and the retreat of humans indoors is making it hard for rats to find meals Without the leftovers from restaurants, events and other non-socially distanced activities, rats are exhibiting some ""unusual or aggressive rodent behaviour"", according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But the rats are not becoming aggressive towards people. Instead, they're turning on themselves. As urban rodentologist Robert Corrigantold the BBC last month, cannibalism is very pervasive in stressed colonies - and rats are stressed under coronavirus conditions. ""These rats will completely eat every scrap of meat off the victim's bones,"" Dr Corrigan said. Â© 2025 BBC.

Video 4 minutes 1 secondThe South Korean protester living in the skyKim Yong-hee has spent nearly a year on a 20m traffic tower to protest against Samsung's zero-union policy.,"This video can not be played For nearly a year, 61-year-old Kim Yong-hee, has being living on a 20m high traffic tower in the centre of Seoul, South Korea. Itâs the latest in a quarter-century of protests Mr Kim has made, fighting for workersâ rights at Samsung. Kim Yong-hee says he was fired by the global tech giant nearly 30 years ago, when he tried to form a trade union.  Heâs been protesting ever since and vows not to come down until the company improves workersâ rights. In a statement Samsung said: ""The safety of Mr Kim is of our highest priority and we have engaged in negotiations. Contrary to certain allegations, Mr Kim was dismissed according to standing company regulations.

Government draws up rescue plan for key companiesThe government could aid strategically important firms affected by the coronavirus pandemic.,"The UK government has indicated it is prepared to rescue large British companies severely affected by the coronavirus crisis. The Treasury said ""last resort"" support could be made available if a firm's failure would ""disproportionately harm the UK economy"". The move follows indications that a number of big firms are seeking government help to survive the crisis. These includeJaguar Land Rover, which is in talks to secure a Â£1bn loan. The government has already put in place various initiatives to help companies weather the pandemic, including loan programmes, deferring of tax payments and the furlough scheme, which allows workers to receive 80% of their salary paid by the government. According to latest figures, eight million workers are covered by the furlough scheme which has been extended until the end of October. But from August, businesses will be expected to meet part of the cost of the scheme. Concern is growing that some big firms are still in difficulties even after making use of these options. The bailout plan, named ""Project Birch"",was mentioned by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps,externalin Parliament last week when discussing the future of the aviation industry. It could involve the state taking stakes in companies, although extending existing loans would be preferable. Unite the union welcomed the plan but urged the government to act quickly. ""There is no more time to lose if we are to prevent a tsunami of job losses from sweeping through communities this summer,"" said Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner. ""We still need to ensure that proposed changes to the job retention scheme do not undermine a plan to recover and rebuild and that workers continue to get their wages."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We have put in place unprecedented levels of support to help businesses get through this crisis. ""Beyond that, many firms are getting support from established market mechanisms, such as existing shareholders, bank lending and commercial finance. ""In exceptional circumstances, where a viable company has exhausted all options and its failure would disproportionately harm the economy, we may consider support on a 'last resort' basis. ""As the British public would expect, we are putting in place sensible contingency planning and any such support would be on terms that protect the taxpayer."" Coronavirus: How will airlines get flying again? Coronavirus: Self-employed grant claims top two million The BBC understands the Treasury would have to notify Parliament of any spend incurred, and although companies might seek financial assistance, this does not mean such support will be given. On Saturday,Sky News reported,externalthat Tata Steel, Britain's biggest steel producer, had approached both the Welsh and UK governments for financial aid that could run into hundreds of millions. Tata Steel says there has been a sudden drop in European steel demand Earlier this week, Welsh MP Stephen Kinnock told parliament that Tata Steel, which owns the steelworks in Port Talbot, needs around Â£500m in order to survive the pandemic. And according to the Financial Times, aviation industry bosses have been asking the government for a ""long-term investment facility"" that would help to support supply chains. Jim O'Neill, former Treasury minister and ex-chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told the newspaper he had been in discussion with government officials about creating a public sector-owned funding body to take stakes in firms that would be ""inherently stable"" in times of normal economic activity.

Drivers 'to walk more' to keep lockdown clean airSurvey suggests British motorists are ready to change their behaviour to protect the environment.,"Many British towns and cities are making more road space available for pedestrians and cyclists British drivers are ready to change their behaviour to maintain the cleaner air of the lockdown and protect the environment, a survey suggests. Of the 20,000 motorists polled for the AA, half said they would walk more and 40% intended to drive less. Four in five would take some action to reduce their impact on air quality. It comes after researchers warned thedramatic improvements in air qualityin recent weeks could be quickly reversed as the coronavirus restrictions ease. Car surge could see CO2 rebound after Covid-19 How coronavirus is driving a revolution in travel Air pollution plummets across UK amid lockdown As well as walking more and driving less, a quarter of motorists said they planned to work from home more, another quarter said they would be flying less, while one in five plan to cycle more. ""We have all enjoyed the benefits of cleaner air during lockdown and it is gratifying that the vast majority of drivers want to do their bit to maintain the cleaner air,"" said AA president Edmund King. ""Walking and cycling more, coupled with less driving and more working from home, could have a significant effect on both reducing congestion and maintaining cleaner air."" Meanwhile, the AA is warning drivers in England -now able to drive to destinations for exercise or open-air recreation- against travelling to tourist destinations this Bank Holiday Monday. ""Drivers should think about how far they need to travel to enjoy the great outdoors,"" Mr King said. The UK government has pledged Â£250m for improvements in cycling and walking infrastructure and many British towns and cities are alreadymaking more road space available for pedestrians and those on bikes.

They found the dramatic fall in traffic has been key to the 17% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that was recorded at the peak of the coronavirus crisis in early April.

By contrast, the fall in the emission from aviation only accounted for 10% of the decrease.

UK draws up rescue plan for key companiesThe government could aid strategically important firms impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.Business,"The UK government has indicated it is prepared to rescue large British companies severely affected by the coronavirus crisis. The Treasury said ""last resort"" support could be made available if a firm's failure would ""disproportionately harm the UK economy"". The move follows indications that a number of big firms are seeking government help to survive the crisis. These includeJaguar Land Rover, which is in talks to secure a Â£1bn loan. The government has already put in place various initiatives to help companies weather the pandemic, including loan programmes, deferring of tax payments and the furlough scheme, which allows workers to receive 80% of their salary paid by the government. According to latest figures, eight million workers are covered by the furlough scheme which has been extended until the end of October. But from August, businesses will be expected to meet part of the cost of the scheme. Concern is growing that some big firms are still in difficulties even after making use of these options. The bailout plan, named ""Project Birch"",was mentioned by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps,externalin Parliament last week when discussing the future of the aviation industry. It could involve the state taking stakes in companies, although extending existing loans would be preferable. Unite the union welcomed the plan but urged the government to act quickly. ""There is no more time to lose if we are to prevent a tsunami of job losses from sweeping through communities this summer,"" said Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner. ""We still need to ensure that proposed changes to the job retention scheme do not undermine a plan to recover and rebuild and that workers continue to get their wages."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We have put in place unprecedented levels of support to help businesses get through this crisis. ""Beyond that, many firms are getting support from established market mechanisms, such as existing shareholders, bank lending and commercial finance.

Drivers 'want to keep' clean air of lockdown,"Many British towns and cities are making more road space available for pedestrians and cyclists British drivers are ready to change their behaviour to maintain the cleaner air of the lockdown and protect the environment, a survey suggests. Of the 20,000 motorists polled for the AA, half said they would walk more and 40% intended to drive less. Four in five would take some action to reduce their impact on air quality. It comes after researchers warned thedramatic improvements in air qualityin recent weeks could be quickly reversed as the coronavirus restrictions ease. Car surge could see CO2 rebound after Covid-19 How coronavirus is driving a revolution in travel Air pollution plummets across UK amid lockdown As well as walking more and driving less, a quarter of motorists said they planned to work from home more, another quarter said they would be flying less, while one in five plan to cycle more. ""We have all enjoyed the benefits of cleaner air during lockdown and it is gratifying that the vast majority of drivers want to do their bit to maintain the cleaner air,"" said AA president Edmund King. ""Walking and cycling more, coupled with less driving and more working from home, could have a significant effect on both reducing congestion and maintaining cleaner air."" Meanwhile, the AA is warning drivers in England -now able to drive to destinations for exercise or open-air recreation- against travelling to tourist destinations this Bank Holiday Monday. ""Drivers should think about how far they need to travel to enjoy the great outdoors,"" Mr King said. The UK government has pledged Â£250m for improvements in cycling and walking infrastructure and many British towns and cities are alreadymaking more road space available for pedestrians and those on bikes. It is the first part of a Â£5bn investment announced in February, the Department for Transport said.

"US suspends travel from Brazil for foreignersBrazil has recently become a new coronavirus hotspot with more than 300,000 known cases.","Brazil is the country with the second highest number of cases The US has imposed travel restrictions on foreign nationals who have been to Brazil in the last 14 days. The South American nation recently became the world's second major hotspot for coronavirus cases. Brazil has recorded more than 360,000 cases, the country's health ministry announced on Sunday, while over 22,000 people have died with the virus. A White House spokeswoman said the restrictions would help ensure new cases are not brought into the US. ""Today's action will help ensure foreign nationals who have been in Brazil do not become a source of additional infections in our country,"" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement. Non-Americans who have been in Brazil in the two weeks before they request entry to the US will be denied that entry. The restriction will not affect trade between the two countries. The suspension is to take effect on 28 May at 23:59 EDT (03:59 GMT). Is Latin America the next coronavirus epicentre? Disease meets deforestation at heart of Brazil's Amazon 'Undocumented virus explosion' sweeps Brazil The travel ban will not apply to US citizens, or to the spouse, parent, legal guardian, or child of a US citizen or lawful permanent resident, and most siblings under the age of 21. ""The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from [Brazil] threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security,"" said the suspension order published by the White House on Sunday. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? ON FRONTLINE:The young doctors being asked to play god REASON TO HOPE:The good that may come out of this crisis AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories Earlier on Sunday, White House National security adviser Robert O'Brien told CBS ""Face the Nation"" that travel restriction for Brazil were expected shortly. ""We hope that'll be temporary, but because of the situation in Brazil, we're going to take every step necessary to protect the American people,"" Mr O'Brien said. This video can not be played Sao Paulo: Latin America's biggest graveyard from the sky He added that ""we'll take a look at the other countries on a country-by-country basis for sure"". US President Donald Trump suggested earlier this week that he was considering imposing a ban on travel from Brazil. The US currently leads the world in coronavirus cases. It has over 1.6 million known cases and is nearing 100,000 deaths linked to the virus. Sunday's announcement is the latest travel restriction imposed by the US in a bid to combat the spread of the virus. Foreign nationals who have recently visited China, Iran, the European Schengen area, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland are already barred from entry to the US. Canada and the US also recently agreed to extend the closure of their shared border to non-essential travel. Brazil recently overtook Russia with regards to known cases of the virus. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the risks posed by the virus. President Bolsonaro hugged a young child while meeting supporters on Sunday The number of deaths in Brazil has been doubling roughly every two weeks, compared to about every two months in the UK, four months in France, and five months in Italy. Experts have warned that the real figure may be far higher due to a lack of testing. The rising death toll and infections in Brazil are clearly worrying the rest of the world, but President Jair Bolsonaro shows no signs of treating it seriously. On Sunday, he was out once again, mingling with hundreds of supporters in Brasilia - and once again he was not wearing a mask. President Bolsonaro seems more caught up in fighting political battles - he's facing accusations of political interference to protect his family - than looking at how to rein in the country's spiralling health crisis. These past few days have revealed some ugly truths here. Not only has Brazil become one of the epicentres of the coronavirus crisis, but it's clear that the president and his team are unable - or even willing - to lead the country out of it. There's no doubt this decision by President Trump, a man whom President Bolsonaro has always openly admired, will sting - but the question is, will it do anything to change the Brazilian leader's approach?
