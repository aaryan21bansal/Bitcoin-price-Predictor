UK makes free-trade offer to Australia,"Australia's mining industry is a major driver of exports to the UK The UK has offered trade deal terms to Australia under which both countries would phase out taxes on imports over 15 years. The cabinet was reportedly split on what terms to propose, amid concerns UK beef and lamb farmers could be undercut by larger Australian producers. But the dispute was apparently resolved after Boris Johnson pushed for unity. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss formally made the UK offer to her Australian counterpart on Friday. If accepted, it would also lead to quotas - limits - on tax-free trade between the two countries to be phased out. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned that freeing up the UK-Australian trade in meat will lead to hundreds of British cow and sheep breeders going out of business. Why is an Australia trade deal controversial? How many trade deals has the UK done? Ministers are keen to strike as many trade deals as possible following Brexit, and Ms Truss wants one in place with Australia by the time the UK hosts the G7 summit - of leading economies - in June. But she had reportedly been at odds with Environment Secretary George Eustice over the possible impact on farmers of removing import taxes, called tariffs, that are normally paid to the government. With these differences seemingly resolved at a Downing Street meeting chaired by the prime minister on Thursday, Ms Truss put the UK's terms for a deal to Australian counterpart Dan Tehan at an online meeting on Friday. Speaking on a visit to Portsmouth, Mr Johnson said: ""We are certainly looking at doing free trade deals around the world. ""They present a fantastic opportunity for our farmers, for businesses of all kinds, for our manufacturers. We should see these new openings not as threats but as opportunities."" Mr Tehan said he was ""confident"" of reaching an agreement with the UK by early June, having had ""very positive discussions"" with Ms Truss,the news.com.au website,externalreported. Farmers have raised concerns over competition from larger-scale Australian operators In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK wasvalued at Â£20.1bn,,externaland both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably. Currently,metals, wine and machines,externalform the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia'smain UK imports,externalare cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks. Trade in meat between the two countries is small, with 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK and 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia. NFU president Minette Batters said removing tariffs on these products would ""have a massive impact"" on British farms, which would be unable to compete, in terms of scale, with Australia's vast cattle and sheep stations. She added: ""We continue to maintain that a tariff-free trade deal with Australia will jeopardise our own farming industry and will cause the demise of many, many beef and sheep farms throughout the UK. This is true whether tariffs are dropped immediately or in 15 years' time."" The Scottish and Welsh governments have both urged Mr Johnson to ensure UK farmers are not left exposed. And Northern Ireland's agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, said he was ""strongly opposed"" to ending tariffs and quotas. But Conservative MP Neil Parish, chairman of the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, said UK farmers could succeed in the beef market by exporting more ""higher-end"" cuts, such as sirloin, to Australia. A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: ""Any deal we sign with Australia will include protections for the agriculture industry and will not undercut UK farmers or compromise our high standards. ""Typically, any tariff liberalisation is staged over time, with safeguards built in. We will continue to work with the industry, keeping them involved throughout the process and helping it capture the full benefits of trade."" Are you a farmer in the UK?

Hancock in blood inquiry compensation pledge,"This video can not be played Su Gormanâs husband Steve was diagnosed with hepatitis C 21 years after first receiving contaminated blood products The health secretary has acknowledged the pain and suffering of victims of the contaminated blood scandal, saying the government would pay compensation if recommended to. Matt Hancock was facing questions at a public inquiry into what's been called the worst NHS treatment disaster. Around 3,000 people died after being given blood products containing HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970s and 1980s. Mr Hancock said he wanted ""to make sure their voices are heard"". And he said the government would pay compensation if the inquiry decided it should. Currently, victims and families get financial support but have not been compensated for loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood Annual payments for contaminated blood bereaved Two-month delay in telling patients they had HIV Ministers announced a public inquiry in 2017 after decades of campaigning by victims and their families. Nearly 5,000 people with the blood disorder haemophilia were infected with potentially fatal viruses after being given a clotting agent called Factor VIII. Much of the drug was imported from the US, where prisoners and other at-risk groups were often paid to donate the plasma used to make it. Victims included dozens of young haemophiliacs at a boarding school in Hampshire who died after contracting HIV as a result. Tens of thousands more victims may have been exposed to viral hepatitis through blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth. Factor VIII was often imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s Families of victims of the scandal have long fought for annual support payments to be increased and full compensation to be paid. In March ministers said that families in England who lost relatives as a result of the scandal will receive the same support payments as those in other parts of the UK. Treasury minister Penny Mordaunt said bereaved partners would automatically get a Â£10,000 lump sum. But campaigners say some families have been excluded from the scheme, including children who lost parents to HIV at the time. The UK government has now said that full compensation could be paid in the future, depending on the outcome of the inquiry. That is likely to pave the way for much larger payments covering lifetime loss of earnings and ongoing care costs. Ministers have appointed the retired barrister Sir Robert Francis to carry out a study looking at different options for compensation, and to report back with recommendations, before the inquiry publishes its conclusions. ""This is a huge move but if they decide to base compensation on what the inquiry decides, that gives them another two or three years before they have to find a penny,"" said Su Gorman, whose husband Steve Dymond died aged 62 in December 2018 of organ failure linked to hepatitis C. ""If they really wanted to pay compensation, they could find a way of doing it which would not prejudge the inquiry."" This video can not be played Video statements were played at the start of the public inquiry in September 2018 The public inquiry, led by Sir Brian Langstaff, has been examining the circumstances surrounded the contaminated blood scandal since 2018. Hundreds of people who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C or their family members have already given evidence, with hearings held at sites across the UK. The inquiry is examining how and why the infections occurred, what was known at the time about the risks of the treatments, and whether patients were given sufficient warnings about the dangers involved. Evidence hearings are scheduled to continue into next year with a final report likely to be published in 2022 or 2023. A book of remembrance for haemophiliacs who died in the contaminated blood scandal is displayed at St Botolph's Church in the City of London A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""The infected blood tragedy should never have happened. The ongoing public inquiry was set up to establish the truth and give individuals and families the answers they rightly deserve. ""We've always been clear that those who have been affected by this tragedy should be supported by a fair and transparent support scheme focused on their welfare, providing some security and consistency. ""The government has listened to the call for parity of support across UK and in March announced a package for the whole of the UK which will bring greater uniformity to the four National support schemes.""

Seven officers injured by missiles at riot,"This video can not be played Rioters 'smashed through my windows and door' Seven police officers were injured when rioters threw bricks at houses and torched cars in Swansea. A major clean-up is under way after cars were burnt out and windowssmashed during the violence in the Mayhill area on Thursday. Families spoke of being trapped in houses, with police ""pelted with rocks"" as they tried to break up the violence. South Wales Police said seven officers suffered minor injuries when they were hit by missiles. The force's Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said he would ""stop at nothing to find"" those responsible. Clean-up starts after riots 'like a war zone' Shocking footage as 'yobs' set cars on fire Officers said they were using CCTV and social media footage to identify those responsible and urged people to send in any photos or videos. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the scenes were ""disgraceful"" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the scenes were ""completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated anywhere in Wales"". This video can not be played Mayhill rioters throw bricks at police van Home Secretary Priti Patel said the scenes were ""disgraceful"" and thanked ""brave officers for bringing it under control.""

Alun Michael, South Wales police commissioner, said Thursday's events were ""unusual and extreme"". ""Things developed very quickly and in a totally unacceptable manner last night and it's very important that we understand what's happened to make sure that it doesn't happen again,"" he said. This video can not be played ""I'm packing up, I'm not willing to live in fear,"" says Mayhill resident after riot The force's response has been criticised by some residents who said they were faced by violent ""yobs"" outside their homes with no-one coming to their aid. But South Wales Police said its response was ""immediate and officers trained to deal with public order incidents were deployed to the scene"". Officers believe the disorder in Waun-Wen Road, which saw groups roll a car down the middle of the street into a burning car, started as a vigil for 19-year-old Ethan Powell who collapsed and died suddenly on Wednesday. Adam Romain says he stood behind his front door hoping no-one would try and get into his house where his children were ""terrified"" Adam Romain said he feared a ""mob"" would enter his home and attack his family when he tried to stop them setting fire to his car. He told BBC Radio Wales he was out making deliveries when he got a panicked phone call from his girlfriend and could hear his children screaming in the background. ""I went back as quickly as I could, I drove up to my house, literally into a riot,"" he said. He said he had to ride his motorbike through the middle of ""about 100 lads"" throwing bricks. Mr Romain stood at the window, smashed in the riot, where his baby's cot is placed Mr Romain said he tried to stop a car being set on fire but was set upon. ""The bricks were starting to be lobbed at me and my house... my children were in the house, my girlfriend was in the back screaming, scared for their lives. ""I was standing at the front, hoping, praying, that they wouldn't come inside the house. ""They were coming to the front door, lobbing these bricks, straight through the glass door, straight at me - they had no fear whatsoever,"" he said. Mr Romain said he rang police three times, but was told ""we already know about the incident"" and no-one came to help. Shocking footage as 'yobs' set cars on fire Mr Romain said only last month a van was rolled down the hill and smashed into his neighbours' van and his car. In the aftermath people took to the streets to help with the clean up, and photographers captured the burnt out cars He filmed the rioters on a helmet camera, capturing the faces of many of the culprits, and said he would share the footage with the force. Volunteers helped with the clean-up on Friday morning, sweeping up burnt plastic and broken glass All that's left of the cars are their charred remains with melted plastic, broken glass, and molten metal on Waun-Wen Road. The clean-up operation got under way at just after 07:00 with council workers arriving to clean up the mess. A glazier firm arrived to look at homes which have several smashed windows. There's a lot of anger about what happened. A lot of people are upset that this was meant to be a vigil for a young local lad who died recently. People are angry that children were terrified after seeing this happen. They are upset it was just too dangerous for the police and fire service to attend or stay at the scene because of the crowds here. This video can not be played Social Media footage of Swansea 'yobs' setting cars on fire The council said it was continuing to support residents and has also now installed temporary concrete blocks on Waun-Wen Road to replace bollards that were damaged during the disorder. Council area co-ordinator Bethan McGregor said: ""What happened last night is not a true reflection of the Mayhill and Waun Wen community. ""This is a close-knit community where the vast majority of people care about one-another, as the amount of residents helping the council with the clean-up operation today has shown."" Concrete blocks have been placed on the street - but one resident says these were requested in February Despite being a ""lovely"" community, vehicles had been rolled down the hill in a similar fashion ""at least twice"" in the past three years, according to Sam Bennett, a community campaigner from the area. Mr Bennett told Radio Wales residents had written to the council to request concrete blocks on the street back in February. He added residents ""don't have the confidence that something is going to be done anymore and that's why they're choosing to move"". Owen Pillai, who works with young people in Swansea, said ""outrage and disgust"" was an understandable reaction to the ""inexcusable behaviour"" but added he could see why the riot had broken out. He called on authorities to realise ""we all play a part in this"". Mr Pillai told BBC Radio Wales: ""This is the result of decades and decades of a multifaceted undermining of resources, societal breakdown, generations of unemployment - you can't look at it in isolation unfortunately."" The community was thanked for helping those in need during the violence He said it was ""a scientific fact young people want to engage in risky behaviour"", and argued a lack of access to positive activities like sport could lead to problems. Mr Pillai added: ""We need to channel huge amounts of resource into listening, looking at restorative practice, involving these young people rather than just locking them away - they need to confront the reality of what they have done.""

Israel-Gaza ceasefire holds despite Jerusalem clash,"This video can not be played Further clashes in Jerusalem after ceasefire A ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip appeared to be holding hours after coming into effect. It began early on Friday, bringing to an end 11 days of fighting in which more than 250 people were killed, most of them in Gaza. Both Israel and Hamas claimed victory in the conflict. Fresh clashes broke out at the al-Aqsa mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem on Friday, testing the truce. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP news agency that Palestinians had thrown rocks and petrol bombs at officers, and that ""riot"" suppressing measures had been taken in response. But the ceasefire seemed to be holding on Friday night. Israel has temporarily opened a crossing into Gaza, allowing food, fuel and medicine into the territory. The country has also lifted emergency restrictions inside its own borders. In pictures: The destruction in Gaza and Israel The fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza began on 10 May after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at al-Aqsa, located at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. At least 243 people, including more than 100 women and children, were killed in Gaza, according to its health ministry. Israel has said it killed at least 225 militants during the fighting. Hamas has not given casualty figures for fighters. In Israel 12 people, including two children, were killed, its medical service says. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Life in the Gaza Strip The Israeli military says more than 4,300 rockets were fired towards its territory by militants and that it struck more than 1,000 militant targets in Gaza. An Israeli man inspects damage in the kitchen of his house A mother and son embrace in their ruined home in Beit Hanoun, Gaza Gaza's streets are bursting back into life with the truce only hours old. It's the first time in nearly a fortnight people have been able to go outside in relative safety. Entire families step over rubble and children tiptoe through smashed glass. They look up at wrecked buildings but seem to take it in their stride. Perhaps seeing the aftermath is easy compared with the terrifying experience of living through the airstrikes themselves. On one street in the heart of downtown Gaza City is the remnants of al-Sharouq building. Its name means sunrise. It lies in charred ruins. The block was the third high-rise bombed by Israel which said militants used it. A car drives past and a child in a keffiyeh - a Palestinian headscarf - stands out of the sunroof with his fingers in a victory sign. Hamas is hailing its ""defence of Jerusalem"".  Israel says its airstrikes have set the group back strategically.  People here are welcoming calm, but know it probably just means a countdown to the next inevitable conflict. The Israeli Political Security Cabinet said on Thursday night it had ""unanimously accepted the recommendation"" for a ceasefire. ""The political leaders emphasised that the reality on the ground will determine the future of the campaign,"" it said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced criticism from some in Israel who said he had halted the conflict too soon. The mayors of Sderot and Ashkelon - two of the Israeli towns hardest hit by rockets from Gaza - were among those to voice their disappointment, saying Hamas should have been eliminated. At a news conference on Friday, the prime minister said Israel had ""exacted a heavy price from Hamas"". ""Not everything is known to the public yet, nor to Hamas, but the full range of achievements will be revealed over time,"" he said. The children who have died in the conflict Why is Gaza blurry on Google Maps? A Hamas official told the Associated Press news agency the ceasefire announced by Israel amounted to a ""victory"" for the Palestinian people. This view was shared by people celebrating on the streets of Gaza. ""This is the day of victory, the day of freedom, and it is the most beautiful day that we've experienced,"" one said. This video can not be played Palestinians took to the streets to celebrate the ceasefire Top Hamas political leader Ismail Haniya told reporters on Friday that the fighting had ""defeated the illusions of negotiations, and described resistance as the ""best strategic choice for liberation"". ""We, as a movement and movement's leadership, with all our people and the good people of this nation and the world, will rebuild Gaza,"" he added. Basem Naim, from the Hamas Council on International Relations, told the BBC he was sceptical about whether the truce would last ""without justice for Palestinians, without stopping the Israeli aggression and Israeli atrocities"". A member of Hamas's political bureau, Izzat al-Reshiq, issued a warning to Israel. ""It's true that the battle ends today but Netanyahu and the whole world should know that our finger is on the trigger and we will continue to ramp up the capabilities of this resistance,"" he told Reuters. President Joe Biden said the ceasefire had brought a ""genuine opportunity"" for progress, and commended Mr Netanyahu in a phone call after the agreement was announced. He said the US - Israel's closest and most important ally - fully supported the country's ""right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks"". Anthony Zurcher: The Democrats' 'tectonic' shift on the conflict He also praised Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi for brokering the ceasefire, before turning to the human cost of the conflict. ""I send my sincere condolences to all the families, Israeli and Palestinian, who have lost loved ones and my hope for a full recovery for the wounded,"" he said. The president said the US remained committed to working with the UN in providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza and in reconstruction efforts in the enclave. He added that this would be done ""in full partnership"" with the Palestinian Authority, which is run by Hamas's rival, Mahmoud Abbas, and based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Egypt's president said he had received a phone call from Mr Biden with ""utter happiness"", adding that they had ""exchanged visions around reaching a formula that would calm the current conflict between Israel and Gaza"". British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also welcomed the ceasefire, but said both sides must now find a ""durable solution"" to the conflict. The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

Apple boss Tim Cook testified in Epic legal row,"Epic makes Fortnite and its colourful characters - but is at odds with Apple boss Tim Cook Apple boss Tim Cook took the witness stand for the first time in his company's major legal battle with Epic Games over an alleged monopoly. Epic, maker of the hit video game Fortnite, claims Apple's tight control over iPhone apps hurts competition. During his appearance, Mr Cook argued that keeping control of the App Store helped keep iPhones secure. He also said he did not know if the App Store made a profit, telling the court Apple did not break down the figures. Facing questions about the level of profit the App Store generates from the 30% commission it takes on sales, he said: ""We don't have a separate profit and loss statement for the App Store."" Instead, he said that he had a ""feeling"" that it was profitable - but could not share figures with the court. Mr Cook was being questioned about his oversight of top-level decisions around the App Store's policies. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also questioned Mr Cook, asking about a survey that showed 39% of developers are dissatisfied with the app store. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Cook said he was not familiar with the survey but said there was a ""friction"" because Apple rejected 40% of apps weekly. The judge also asked him if he was a gamer, to which he admitted that he was not. Mr Cook's opposite number in the case - Epic Games chief Tim Sweeney - has already appeared on the stand in the opening days of the long-running legal battle. Two main things are at the centre of the case: the 30% commission Apple takes on in-app purchases, and the fact that no other app stores are allowed to exist on the iPhone and iPad to offer an alternative. Epic's Fortnite is one of the most popular games in the world and makes its money through in-game purchases of character costumes and other digital items. A 30% cut on millions of such purchases adds up to a lot - but Apple's rules forbid the company from circumventing its payment methods if a sale is made in the iPhone app. This video can not be played Epic Games v Apple: What is going on? In August last year, Fortnite offered players a 20% discount if they paid Epic Games directly, in direct violation of Apple's rules. Apple quickly removed the appfrom its store - as did Google, which enforces a similar policy. Epic had clearly expected that to happen. The firm immediately launched a PR blitz to mobilise its fanbase and win support, painting Apple as a dominating force suppressing freedom of choice. Within hours, Epic lodged prepared legal complaints in the US against both Apple and Google. But the debate goes beyond the 30% cut, to wider questions about competitiveness. Epic has made no secret of the fact that it would like to run its own app stores on both iOS and Android, avoiding Apple's and Google's payment and delivery systems entirely. This was Tim Cook's first time giving evidence at trial. There's no video footage of the court case but journalists can listen in to a terrible audio line that sounds like the trial is taking place under water. It's therefore hard to get a feel for the atmosphere of court. Still, it's pretty clear that Mr Cook is having a tough day. I'm used to hearing him asked questions in Congress. Usually he has a relaxed air - it takes a lot to get him flustered. However a cross examination in court is a very different beast. Grilled by an expert legal team, Mr Cook appeared more evasive. He was asked, for example, how much profit Apple makes from its App Store. He replied that he didn't know. Considering the App Store is a massive money spinner for Apple, that is a surprise. Google also pays a huge amount to Apple to have its search preloaded onto iPhones. Asked about this deal (believed to be worth around $10bn, or Â£7bn) Mr Cook didn't seem to know much about it, unable - or unwilling - to confirm how much this contract was worth. Mr Cook may be reluctant to unveil commercially sensitive data. However, he came across as vague on detail. And that's not a good look when you're giving evidence in court. Most experts believe this is Apple's to lose but anti-trust cases are notoriously difficult to predict. And we're unlikely to get a judgement soon - there is a lot of evidence the judge has to wade through. The legal cases against Apple and Google are separate, and Apple has been the first in court. Apple is accused of running a monopoly, subjecting all apps to a cumbersome review process, and rejecting them for all sorts of reasons. Epic contends that is unfair, while Apple says it protects customers from dodgy apps. Much of the early debate has been over definitions, with Epic arguing that Fortnite is more than a game, but rather a ""metaverse"" within which all sorts of experiences -including concerts and film screenings- are held. But outside of the wrangling over technical definitions, there have also been some significant revelations.

Apple boss Tim Cook testified in Epic legal rowApple's boss Tim Cook appeared on the witness stand in the high-profile legal row with Epic Games.Technology,"Epic makes Fortnite and its colourful characters - but is at odds with Apple boss Tim Cook Apple boss Tim Cook took the witness stand for the first time in his company's major legal battle with Epic Games over an alleged monopoly. Epic, maker of the hit video game Fortnite, claims Apple's tight control over iPhone apps hurts competition. During his appearance, Mr Cook argued that keeping control of the App Store helped keep iPhones secure. He also said he did not know if the App Store made a profit, telling the court Apple did not break down the figures. Facing questions about the level of profit the App Store generates from the 30% commission it takes on sales, he said: ""We don't have a separate profit and loss statement for the App Store."" Instead, he said that he had a ""feeling"" that it was profitable - but could not share figures with the court. Mr Cook was being questioned about his oversight of top-level decisions around the App Store's policies. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also questioned Mr Cook, asking about a survey that showed 39% of developers are dissatisfied with the app store. Allow Twitter content?

What can Cornwall learn from Wallyâs Welsh trip?,"Linda Compton and her daughter Amy watched over Wally the whole time he was in Tenby Wales has said goodbye to Wally the walrus, but as he goes words of advice have been sent to his new Cornish home. The Arctic Walrushas been spotted near Padstow,after the tusked-tourist spent weeks sunbathing in Pembrokeshire. Animal lovers in Tenby had pleaded with people to stop getting dangerously close to Wally to pose for selfies. But Wally's presence spent also paid dividends for local businesses, who have created a range of memorabilia to remember the marine mammal's visit. Dozens of people though, were recorded causing the animal distress, whichthe RSPCA said could constitute a criminal offence. Linda Compton and her daughter Amy spent six weeks watching over Wally, monitoring him for up to 14 hours a day. This video can not be played Why did Wally the walrus ended up in Wales? Linda said that 99% of onlookers were fine, ""but you've got 1% who want to push it and get that bit too close"". The pair, who live in nearby Carew, Pembrokeshire, volunteer with Welsh Marine Life Rescue (WMLR) and tirelessly guarded the walrus,after it appeared in the Welsh coastal town in March, from unwanted attention. Linda, a 59-year-old learning support assistant, told BBC Wales she had seen people trying to swim, paddleboard, kayak, jet ski and even sail up to Wally to pose for selfies. One woman even told her two children to swim out to Wally while others have flown drones just feet above the marine mammal's head, she said. People used various methods of getting close to Wally - sometimes dangerously close Amy, a trampoline instructor who is unable to work because of lockdown, recorded incidents on camera which were initially passed on to Tenby's harbour master. In total, the 22-year-old estimates she took more than 20,000 images of Wally. The pair contacted the RSPCA before they began dealing directly with Dyfed-Powys Police earlier this month. The force told BBC Wales it had received reports from the WMLR and ""inquiries are ongoing"". When confronting onlookers, Linda said she and Amy would first try to ""warn them off"", but ""unfortunately we get the abuse - but everything is filmed and sent to the authorities"". She warned people that getting too close to the creature could put them in danger. ""He's a very powerful animal,"" she said. ""He's an unknown entity. We don't know how he would actually react to somebody going that close."" Linda revealed that when challenged about getting too close to Wally, some people reacted abusively While a minority of people have distressed the walrus, Linda explained that ""99% of the people have been amazing. They just want the experience to see a walrus in our waters"". Now that Wally has moved on, Tenby no longer has its local celebrity, but Linda said ""it's been great for the town since Wally's been here"". ""After the difficult times of Covid and lockdown Wally appearing here has just been fantastic,"" she added. Arctic walrus seen for first time in Cornwall Have crowds driven Wally out of Tenby? Lifeboat crew use horn to budge Wally the walrus This view was shared by many of the towns small businesses - who rely almost solely on the 4.2m visitors who flock to the area each year, according to Visit Pembrokeshire. John Mather, who owns The Nook gift shop, said: ""It's just been great after the difficult times of Covid and lockdown Wally appearing here has just been fantastic."" Just a few days after Wally arrived in March, one of Mr Mather's suppliers suggested making cushions featuring a walrus. He agreed and when they ""flew off the shelves"" he immediately ordered more. Wally's arrival has been great for Tenby's tourism industry with him featuring on postcards, cushions and even beer He and other shops have since branched out into postcards, pictures, mugs and T-shirts, which all feature Wally. He told BBC Wales: ""We've had people coming here from all over the country just solely to see the walrus. ""And then coming and visiting our shops which has been fantastic. ""It's good for the whole town. People come, they stay here, they're eating in the restaurants, they're using the takeaways - it's really good."" As well as memorabilia, Wally's fame has led to Tenby's Harbwr brewery to name a beer in his honour. Tamar's Tusk also pays tribute to the Tamar class of lifeboat which the town's RNLI station uses.

Israel-Gaza ceasefire holds despite Jerusalem clashThe truce brings to an end 11 days of fighting in which more than 250 people were killed.,"This video can not be played Further clashes in Jerusalem after ceasefire A ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip appeared to be holding hours after coming into effect. It began early on Friday, bringing to an end 11 days of fighting in which more than 250 people were killed, most of them in Gaza. Both Israel and Hamas claimed victory in the conflict. Fresh clashes broke out at the al-Aqsa mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem on Friday, testing the truce. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP news agency that Palestinians had thrown rocks and petrol bombs at officers, and that ""riot"" suppressing measures had been taken in response. But the ceasefire seemed to be holding on Friday night. Israel has temporarily opened a crossing into Gaza, allowing food, fuel and medicine into the territory. The country has also lifted emergency restrictions inside its own borders. In pictures: The destruction in Gaza and Israel The fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza began on 10 May after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at al-Aqsa, located at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. At least 243 people, including more than 100 women and children, were killed in Gaza, according to its health ministry. Israel has said it killed at least 225 militants during the fighting. Hamas has not given casualty figures for fighters. In Israel 12 people, including two children, were killed, its medical service says. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Life in the Gaza Strip The Israeli military says more than 4,300 rockets were fired towards its territory by militants and that it struck more than 1,000 militant targets in Gaza. An Israeli man inspects damage in the kitchen of his house A mother and son embrace in their ruined home in Beit Hanoun, Gaza Gaza's streets are bursting back into life with the truce only hours old. It's the first time in nearly a fortnight people have been able to go outside in relative safety. Entire families step over rubble and children tiptoe through smashed glass. They look up at wrecked buildings but seem to take it in their stride. Perhaps seeing the aftermath is easy compared with the terrifying experience of living through the airstrikes themselves. On one street in the heart of downtown Gaza City is the remnants of al-Sharouq building. Its name means sunrise. It lies in charred ruins. The block was the third high-rise bombed by Israel which said militants used it. A car drives past and a child in a keffiyeh - a Palestinian headscarf - stands out of the sunroof with his fingers in a victory sign. Hamas is hailing its ""defence of Jerusalem"".  Israel says its airstrikes have set the group back strategically.  People here are welcoming calm, but know it probably just means a countdown to the next inevitable conflict. The Israeli Political Security Cabinet said on Thursday night it had ""unanimously accepted the recommendation"" for a ceasefire. ""The political leaders emphasised that the reality on the ground will determine the future of the campaign,"" it said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced criticism from some in Israel who said he had halted the conflict too soon. The mayors of Sderot and Ashkelon - two of the Israeli towns hardest hit by rockets from Gaza - were among those to voice their disappointment, saying Hamas should have been eliminated. At a news conference on Friday, the prime minister said Israel had ""exacted a heavy price from Hamas"". ""Not everything is known to the public yet, nor to Hamas, but the full range of achievements will be revealed over time,"" he said. The children who have died in the conflict Why is Gaza blurry on Google Maps? A Hamas official told the Associated Press news agency the ceasefire announced by Israel amounted to a ""victory"" for the Palestinian people. This view was shared by people celebrating on the streets of Gaza. ""This is the day of victory, the day of freedom, and it is the most beautiful day that we've experienced,"" one said. This video can not be played Palestinians took to the streets to celebrate the ceasefire Top Hamas political leader Ismail Haniya told reporters on Friday that the fighting had ""defeated the illusions of negotiations, and described resistance as the ""best strategic choice for liberation"". ""We, as a movement and movement's leadership, with all our people and the good people of this nation and the world, will rebuild Gaza,"" he added. Basem Naim, from the Hamas Council on International Relations, told the BBC he was sceptical about whether the truce would last ""without justice for Palestinians, without stopping the Israeli aggression and Israeli atrocities"". A member of Hamas's political bureau, Izzat al-Reshiq, issued a warning to Israel. ""It's true that the battle ends today but Netanyahu and the whole world should know that our finger is on the trigger and we will continue to ramp up the capabilities of this resistance,"" he told Reuters. President Joe Biden said the ceasefire had brought a ""genuine opportunity"" for progress, and commended Mr Netanyahu in a phone call after the agreement was announced. He said the US - Israel's closest and most important ally - fully supported the country's ""right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks"". Anthony Zurcher: The Democrats' 'tectonic' shift on the conflict He also praised Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi for brokering the ceasefire, before turning to the human cost of the conflict. ""I send my sincere condolences to all the families, Israeli and Palestinian, who have lost loved ones and my hope for a full recovery for the wounded,"" he said. The president said the US remained committed to working with the UN in providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza and in reconstruction efforts in the enclave. He added that this would be done ""in full partnership"" with the Palestinian Authority, which is run by Hamas's rival, Mahmoud Abbas, and based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Egypt's president said he had received a phone call from Mr Biden with ""utter happiness"", adding that they had ""exchanged visions around reaching a formula that would calm the current conflict between Israel and Gaza"". British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also welcomed the ceasefire, but said both sides must now find a ""durable solution"" to the conflict. The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

"UK makes free-trade offer to AustraliaThe UK offers to phase out import taxes over 15 years, as UK farmers warn they could go bust.UK Politics","Australia's mining industry is a major driver of exports to the UK The UK has offered trade deal terms to Australia under which both countries would phase out taxes on imports over 15 years. The cabinet was reportedly split on what terms to propose, amid concerns UK beef and lamb farmers could be undercut by larger Australian producers. But the dispute was apparently resolved after Boris Johnson pushed for unity. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss formally made the UK offer to her Australian counterpart on Friday. If accepted, it would also lead to quotas - limits - on tax-free trade between the two countries to be phased out. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned that freeing up the UK-Australian trade in meat will lead to hundreds of British cow and sheep breeders going out of business. Why is an Australia trade deal controversial? How many trade deals has the UK done? Ministers are keen to strike as many trade deals as possible following Brexit, and Ms Truss wants one in place with Australia by the time the UK hosts the G7 summit - of leading economies - in June. But she had reportedly been at odds with Environment Secretary George Eustice over the possible impact on farmers of removing import taxes, called tariffs, that are normally paid to the government. With these differences seemingly resolved at a Downing Street meeting chaired by the prime minister on Thursday, Ms Truss put the UK's terms for a deal to Australian counterpart Dan Tehan at an online meeting on Friday. Speaking on a visit to Portsmouth, Mr Johnson said: ""We are certainly looking at doing free trade deals around the world. ""They present a fantastic opportunity for our farmers, for businesses of all kinds, for our manufacturers. We should see these new openings not as threats but as opportunities."" Mr Tehan said he was ""confident"" of reaching an agreement with the UK by early June, having had ""very positive discussions"" with Ms Truss,the news.com.au website,externalreported. Farmers have raised concerns over competition from larger-scale Australian operators In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK wasvalued at Â£20.1bn,,externaland both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably. Currently,metals, wine and machines,externalform the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia'smain UK imports,externalare cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks. Trade in meat between the two countries is small, with 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK and 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia. NFU president Minette Batters said removing tariffs on these products would ""have a massive impact"" on British farms, which would be unable to compete, in terms of scale, with Australia's vast cattle and sheep stations. She added: ""We continue to maintain that a tariff-free trade deal with Australia will jeopardise our own farming industry and will cause the demise of many, many beef and sheep farms throughout the UK. This is true whether tariffs are dropped immediately or in 15 years' time."" The Scottish and Welsh governments have both urged Mr Johnson to ensure UK farmers are not left exposed. And Northern Ireland's agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, said he was ""strongly opposed"" to ending tariffs and quotas. But Conservative MP Neil Parish, chairman of the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, said UK farmers could succeed in the beef market by exporting more ""higher-end"" cuts, such as sirloin, to Australia. A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: ""Any deal we sign with Australia will include protections for the agriculture industry and will not undercut UK farmers or compromise our high standards. ""Typically, any tariff liberalisation is staged over time, with safeguards built in. We will continue to work with the industry, keeping them involved throughout the process and helping it capture the full benefits of trade."" Are you a farmer in the UK?

Harry: Heavy drinking masked pain of mumâs death,"The Duke of Sussex has said he was willing to drink and take drugs to try to cope with his mother's death. He has also spoken about his family's unwillingness to talk about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and how he was expected to ""suffer"" in silence. Prince Harry was talking to US talk show host Oprah Winfrey in their new streaming series on mental health. He also talked about anxiety and panic attacks, his ""biggest regret"" and his experience of his mother's funeral. Princess Diana died in a car crash while being pursued by photographers in Paris in August 1997. What is the Diana interview row all about? Harry: I want to break cycle of pain for my family Who's in the UK Royal Family and how does it work? Speaking to Winfrey for the Apple TV+ series The Me You Can't See, Harry described being aged 28 to 32 as ""a nightmare time in my life"", in which he had panic attacks and severe anxiety. ""I was just all over the place mentally,"" he said. ""Every time I put a suit on and tie on... having to do the role, and go, 'right, game face,' look in the mirror and say, 'let's go'. Before I even left the house I was pouring with sweat. I was in fight or flight mode."" He added: ""I was willing to drink, I was willing to take drugs, I was willing to try and do the things that made me feel less like I was feeling."" He said he would drink a week's worth of alcohol on a Friday or Saturday night, ""not because I was enjoying it but because I was trying to mask something"". The duke also told Winfrey his family did not talk about his mother's death and expected him to deal with the resulting press attention and mental distress. He said: ""My father used to say to me when I was younger, he used to say to both William and I: 'Well it was like that for me so it's going to be like that for you.' ""That doesn't make sense. Just because you suffered doesn't mean that your kids have to suffer, in fact quite the opposite - if you suffered, do everything you can to make sure that whatever negative experiences you had, that you can make it right for your kids."" Princess Diana's funeral was nine days before Harry's 13th birthday Prince Harry famously walked behind his mother's coffin at her funeral, alongside his brother, father, uncle and grandfather. ""For me the thing I remember the most was the sound of the horses' hooves going along the Mall,"" he said. ""It was like I was outside of my body and just walking along doing what was expected of me. Showing one-tenth of the emotion that everybody else was showing: this was my mum - you never even met her."" In addition to his own unhappiness, Harry told Winfrey about his anger and regret at the way his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, was treated by sections of the media. ""My biggest regret is not making more of a stance earlier on in my relationship with my wife, calling out the racism when I did,"" he said. ""History was repeating itself. ""My mother was chased to her death while she was in a relationship with someone that wasn't white - and now look what's happened. ""You want to talk about history repeating itself? They're not gonna stop until she dies."" Talking about his mother, Prince Harry said he ""no doubt"" she would be ""incredibly proud"" of him for living the life she would have wanted and added that one of his son Archie's first words was ""grandma"". ""I got a photo up in his nursery and it was one of the first words that he said, apart from 'mama', 'papa' it was then 'grandma', Grandma Diana,"" he said. ""It's the sweetest thing, but at the same time it makes me really sad, because she should be here."" Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, being interviewed by Oprah Winfrey earlier this year The prince, 36, has campaigned for discussions around mental health to be normalised, and started speaking in detail about his personal experiences recently. In March, he and his wife Meghan were interviewed by Winfreyabout their life in the Royal Family, and its impact on their mental health. And on a podcast last week, Prince Harry said he was determined to""break the cycle of pain"" of his upbringingwhen parenting his own children, and shared that he had gone to therapy. The duke said the happiest time of his life was his 10 years in the Army, as there was no ""special treatment"" for him. He left the Army aged 30, and met his wife-to-be Meghan on a blind date a year later. The duke said family members previously told him ""just play the game and your life will be easier"". ""But I've got a hell of a lot of my mum in me,"" he said. ""I feel as though I am outside of the system - but I'm still stuck there. The only way to free yourself and break out is to tell the truth."" The streaming series sees Prince Harry, Winfrey, Lady Gaga, Glenn Close and others tell their own stories about mental health and wellbeing. It wasfirst announced in April 2019, almost a year before Harry and Meghan announced they werestepping back as senior royals in January 2020.

Manager Nuno to leave Wolves in summer,"Nuno managed Valencia and Porto before taking over at Wolves Manager Nuno Espirito Santo will leave Wolves at the end of the season by mutual agreement. The 47-year-old Portuguese, who left Porto to take charge in 2017, won the Championship title in his first season. Wolves finished seventh in the Premier League in the past two seasons, and in September Nunosigned a three-year contract extensionto 2023. ""We achieved our goals, we did it with passion and we did it together,"" he said. Wolves are 12th heading into the final game of the season at home to Manchester United on Sunday. ""Since the first day we arrived at Compton [training ground], our ambition was to make a positive change and push this football club forward,"" said Nuno. ""I am proud to say that we did that every single day. ""Sunday will be a very emotional day but I am so happy that the fans will be back in Molineux and we can share one last special moment together, as one pack."" What next for Wolves and Nuno? Wolves expect injured Jimenez 'to play a full part' next season Nuno led Wolves to the quarter-finals of the Europa League in their second season in the Premier League Under Nuno, Wolves collected 99 points on their way to the Championship title in 2017-18, finishing nine points clear of second-placed Cardiff with 30 wins from 46 games. They continued to impress in the top flight with their slick, attacking football. Wolves went on to win their Europa League qualifiers to secure a place in the group stage - and a return to European football for the first time in 39 years. Despite starting their season earlier that most sides and playing 59 games in all competitions, they again finished seventh in the Premier League while reaching the Europa League quarter-finals. Under Nuno and aided by the influence of agent Jorge Mendes, Wolves signed several Portuguese players, including Joao Moutinho, Diogo Jota, Ruben Neves and Fabio Silva. ""Nuno has brought us some incredibly special moments at Wolves that will never be forgotten but every chapter comes to an end,"" said Wolves chairman Jeff Shi. ""His loyalty and dedication over the last four years has been immeasurable and we cannot thank him enough for the progress he has made for Wolves. ""Sunday was already going to be a very special day, welcoming our supporters back for the first time in more than a year, but it will also now be a fitting goodbye for someone who will forever remain an important part of Wolves history."" Simon Stone, BBC Sport The shock of Nuno's departure comes more from the timing rather than the fact it is actually happening. It has been clear all season he has not found it easy working in a pandemic, away from his family and trying to find answers to unexpected problems on the pitch. There was concern he might walk away at the end of last season, but the club funded an expensive rebuilding exercise, partly through thesale of Diogo Jota to Liverpool. That was supposed to usher in a more expansive style of play compared to that which had taken the club to successive seventh-placed finishes. It didn't work. Switches between the trusted three-man back-line to a four, inconsistency in midfield and the horrendous, season-ending injury for Raul Jimenez all combined to create a disappointing campaign that led to grumbles from many Wolves fans that Nuno had taken the team as far as he could. That judgement seems harsh. In the past 60 years, Wolves have only finished above their present 12th spot in the top flight on seven occasions - and two of them were the past two seasons under Nuno. Given chief executive Laurie Dalrymple and director of football Kevin Thelwell have already gone, Wolves will have lost three major figures in their rise from the Championship to theEuropa League quarter-finalsin the space of two years. Chairman Jeff Shi now has a major task on his hands but, given the influence of agent Jorge Mendes at Molineux, don't be surprised if there is a familiarity of nationality at least about Nuno's successor.

Speaking virtually to the Global Health Summit hosted by Italy and the EU in Rome, the UK prime minister says just as World War Two ""forged global co-operation"" on defence, he hoped to establish a fresh treaty with the World Health Organization that would set out steps every country should take to prevent another deadly outbreak. He says this could include zero-tariffs on important medical equipment and a worldwide network of research hubs ""so we can identify dangerous pathogens likely to jump from animal to human"". ""Now is the time to move away from the temptations of competing nationalism... and instead reassert the power, the duty, the necessity for nations to act together, building collective defence against the common enemy of disease, and protecting all our people for generations to come,"" Johnson says. Johnson also references Homer's Iliad as he draws comparisons between the coronavirus outbreak and the plague in the ancient Greek epic. ""My point is that almost 2,800 years later, the world has been just as disunited, I'm afraid, as Achilles and Agamemnon,"" he says. The business on Bishopthorpe Road was initially ordered to close from 13 to 20 May A barbershop in York that was given fines totalling Â£33,000 has been ordered to close until mid-July unless it can prove it is following Covid safety rules. City of York Council has issued 12 fixed penalty notices to Q Gentlemens Barbers, with the fines not yet paid, the council said. The council action followed complaints from residents about the business not abiding by Covid rules. The local authority initially ordered it to close between 13 and 20 May. Read morehere. The UK's richest man has seen his wealth surge more than Â£7bn during the pandemic. Sir Leonard Blavatnik has topped this year's latest Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of Â£23bn. The Ukranian-born oil and media magnate, who also owns Warner Music, took the title from inventor Sir James Dyson, whose wealth rose by Â£100m to Â£16.3bn, placing him in fourth place. There are now a record 171 billionaires in UK, with their wealth rising 21.7% during the pandemic to Â£597.2bn. Property investor brothers David and Simon Reuben were in second place after their fortune grew by Â£5.46bn to Â£21.46bn, and Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who run the Mumbai-based conglomerate Hinduja Group, took third spot after their wealth rose by Â£1bn to Â£17bn. Meanwhile, Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford, 23, became the youngest person ever to top the Sunday Times giving list - calculated by ranking the amount donated or raised relative to a person's overall wealth. His high-profile campaign calling for children who are eligible for free school meals to be fed during coronavirus lockdowns was estimated to have raised Â£20m to support the scheme, more than the Â£16m he is thought to be worth.

Until now, socialising has been restricted to outdoors only It's the first weekend this year that people in England, Wales and Scotland have the chance to socialise indoors, with restrictions having eased on Monday. But what are the new rules? Well, it depends which country you are in.

Guernsey has announced it will return to normal travel with the UK, Jersey, Isle of Man and Republic of Ireland from 1 July. For arrivals coming from within those four Common Travel Area destinations. there will be no testing or self-isolation requirement, the States of Guernsey says. It comes as part of a transition to atraffic light system of travel, which is largely based on the UK system of categorising countries according to their infection rates. However, the States emphasised they are continuing to monitor the global coronavirus situation and might amend the timing of introducing the relaxed system. Read more here. This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: 'We haven't turned the corner in Glasgow yet' First Minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier confirmed Glasgow is remaining in level three coronavirus restrictions. Sturgeon says she knows how unwelcome the news will be - not least because she lives in Glasgow herself - but she hopes it will not be for too much longer. Watch her make the announcement above. Lockdowns have forced people to spend the past year and more learning, working, and socialising online - but in many countries, women have been missing out. They are less likely than men to have access to the internet in nearly every region of the world, according to the latest figures from UN agency the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The so-called digital gender gap is most noticeable in Africa, where the ITU estimates 37% of men have internet access but only 20% of women. Regina Honu, founder of Soronko Academy, a tech school for women and girls in Ghana, says: ""Before Covid, if we put out an invitation for people to sign up, we would have 100 or 200 women. After Covid, we had more than 2,000 women signing up. ""Covid has made people realise that if you don't have digital skills, you're going to be left behind."" Read more here. People aged over 16 who live in North Tyneside will be able get tested for Covid from Saturday as part of a programme to try and stop the spread of the Indian variant. Increased testing - orsurge testingas it's known - will be carried out at units in North Shields and Wallsend for residents who aren't showing symptoms, including those who've had their vaccine. It follows a rise in cases of the so-called Indian variant. Covid-19 cases in the borough have risen from 22 to 53 per 100,000 people in the last week and North Tyneside Council believes the 19 confirmed cases of the variant in the region will increase. Public Health Director Wendy Burke said: ""We will be offering additional testing to identify any further cases of Covid-19 and in particular the variant, so that we can support people to self-isolate and identify their contacts. ""In addition, we will also be making available better accessibility to the vaccination programme and we will be doing more work to try to get those who haven't yet accessed their first dose of vaccine  to come forward. ""What we're trying to do is identify over-50s and those in the 'at risk' category who haven't yet had a first dose."" Nearly 690,000 UK adults received either the first or second dose of a Covid vaccine on Thursday. The latest government data shows 268,251 first doses were given, taking the total number of people to have received their initial jab to 37,518,614. A total of 420,312 people were given a second vaccination, meaning 21,659,783, or 41.1% of adults, have now had both jabs. For context, the highest number of vaccinations given in a single day was the 844,285 administered on 20 March. But yesterday's total was the highest since 24 April.

Last Friday there were 2,193 cases and 17 deaths. The decision by the Scottish Government to move Moray to level two restrictions has been described as ""hugely welcome"" by the chief executive of the local council. The area had been kept in level three over concerns about its infection rate but that had dropped in recent days. Roddy Burns says: ""I pay tribute to the community, NHS and council colleagues for their response to the increased and enhanced testing and accelerated vaccination programmes."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who is the MP for Moray, says he was delighted by the announcement, adding: ""We've got to look at what has worked here and in other areas of the country to get any spike in cases down.""

Heathrow's Terminal 5 has signs on seats to enforce social distancing Heathrow Airport says it will open a dedicated arrivals facility for passengers from red-list countries in Terminal 3 from 1 June. The terminal has been closed for the past year, but from that date it will be exclusively used for direct flights from countries deemed to have the highest risk of Covid infection. Passengers on those flights, who have to be British nationals or residents, will have to quarantine in dedicated hotels. Both the government and Heathrow have come under fire in recent days over reports travellers from red list areas were forced to mix with other passengers in immigration halls, where passengers could be waiting for several hours at times. Heathrow says opening the facility will be logistically very challenging, adding that ""our hope is that it will enable Border Force to carry out its duties more efficiently as passenger volumes increase in line with the green list"". Staff and customers at a West Yorkshire pub are marking reopening bycelebrating Christmasfive months late. The Green Dragon in Pontefract put up decorations in December but when tier 3 rules forced the venue to remain closed, the tinsel was left up on the walls. The pub did not reopen when restrictions were first eased, for outdoor drinkers and diners, in April - so regulars were met with baubles and Christmas songs when the doors finally did reopen this Monday. The pub is holding a Christmas party this weekend as well as a New Year's Eve night, with a countdown to midnight and a rendition of Auld Lang Syne. And anyone wearing a Christmas jumper today has been promised a free drink. The Olympic Games will go ahead even if Tokyo remains in a state of emergency due to the pandemic, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee says. Tokyo is one of nine prefectures of Japan to be under emergency measures, which will stay in place until at least 31 May. John Coates, the chair of the IOC's coordination commission, says this will not affect the Games - even if the capital is still under the measures by the time they open on 23 July. ""We've successfully seen five sports hold their test events during the state of emergency,"" he says. ""All of the plans that we have in place to protect the safety and security of athletes and the people of Japan are based around the worst possible circumstances, so the answer (to whether a Games could take place during a state of emergency) is absolutely yes."" The Japanese government has called on Games organisers to further reduce the number of overseas visitors, insisting that only those essential to the operation of the event come into the country. Overseas spectators have already been barred, and a decision on how many - if any - Japanese fans can attend will be taken next month. Wider surge testing has been rolled out in five west London boroughs due to a surge in coronavirus cases linked to the Indian variant. Testing in Ealing, Hillingdon, Brent, Harrow and Hounslow will begin on Monday, the BBC has been told. It wasalready taking placein Hillingdon and Hounslow. The testing will target secondary schools in the five boroughs, with PCR tests also offered to anyone else in the area who does not have any symptoms. Cases of the new variant in west London have increased from 400 to 720. You can read more here. The European Union intends to invest 1bn euros (Â£859m, US$1.2bn) to build Covid vaccine-manufacturing hubs in Africa. It will also donate at least 100 million doses of coronavirus vaccines to low and middle income countries by the end of the year, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, says. She has been speaking at a Covid summit in Rome, where one of the leading vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer/BioNTech, announced it would make two billion doses available at cost to poorer countries over the next 18 months. The partly virtual meeting in the Italian capital wants to coordinate global efforts to combat the pandemic. There is ""very high potential"" for the Indian Covid variant of concern to ""establish community transmission"" in Wales, a top health official has said. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said there was evidence of infections unrelated to travel. But PHW has said most cases are still related to travel or to close contacts of people who have been abroad. If community infections became severe, putting pressure on the NHS, lockdown easing would be reconsidered, he said. Wales currently has a low number of cases of the variant of concern, with atotal of 28 reported on Thursday. Read more here. Case rates across Wales are low, but the dominant variant is still the Kent variant More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 180 countries worldwide. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress. Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but some are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Turkey, Russia and the UK. Very few places have been left untouched. Â© 2025 BBC.

Missiles thrown at riot injured seven officers,"This video can not be played Rioters 'smashed through my windows and door' Seven police officers were injured when rioters threw bricks at houses and torched cars in Swansea. A major clean-up is under way after cars were burnt out and windowssmashed during the violence in the Mayhill area on Thursday. Families spoke of being trapped in houses, with police ""pelted with rocks"" as they tried to break up the violence. South Wales Police said seven officers suffered minor injuries when they were hit by missiles. The force's Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said he would ""stop at nothing to find"" those responsible. Clean-up starts after riots 'like a war zone' Shocking footage as 'yobs' set cars on fire Officers said they were using CCTV and social media footage to identify those responsible and urged people to send in any photos or videos. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the scenes were ""disgraceful"" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the scenes were ""completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated anywhere in Wales"". This video can not be played Mayhill rioters throw bricks at police van Home Secretary Priti Patel said the scenes were ""disgraceful"" and thanked ""brave officers for bringing it under control.""

Alun Michael, South Wales police commissioner, said Thursday's events were ""unusual and extreme"". ""Things developed very quickly and in a totally unacceptable manner last night and it's very important that we understand what's happened to make sure that it doesn't happen again,"" he said. This video can not be played ""I'm packing up, I'm not willing to live in fear,"" says Mayhill resident after riot The force's response has been criticised by some residents who said they were faced by violent ""yobs"" outside their homes with no-one coming to their aid. But South Wales Police said its response was ""immediate and officers trained to deal with public order incidents were deployed to the scene"". Officers believe the disorder in Waun-Wen Road, which saw groups roll a car down the middle of the street into a burning car, started as a vigil for 19-year-old Ethan Powell who collapsed and died suddenly on Wednesday. Adam Romain says he stood behind his front door hoping no-one would try and get into his house where his children were ""terrified"" Adam Romain said he feared a ""mob"" would enter his home and attack his family when he tried to stop them setting fire to his car. He told BBC Radio Wales he was out making deliveries when he got a panicked phone call from his girlfriend and could hear his children screaming in the background. ""I went back as quickly as I could, I drove up to my house, literally into a riot,"" he said. He said he had to ride his motorbike through the middle of ""about 100 lads"" throwing bricks. Mr Romain stood at the window, smashed in the riot, where his baby's cot is placed Mr Romain said he tried to stop a car being set on fire but was set upon. ""The bricks were starting to be lobbed at me and my house... my children were in the house, my girlfriend was in the back screaming, scared for their lives. ""I was standing at the front, hoping, praying, that they wouldn't come inside the house. ""They were coming to the front door, lobbing these bricks, straight through the glass door, straight at me - they had no fear whatsoever,"" he said. Mr Romain said he rang police three times, but was told ""we already know about the incident"" and no-one came to help. Shocking footage as 'yobs' set cars on fire Mr Romain said only last month a van was rolled down the hill and smashed into his neighbours' van and his car. In the aftermath people took to the streets to help with the clean up, and photographers captured the burnt out cars He filmed the rioters on a helmet camera, capturing the faces of many of the culprits, and said he would share the footage with the force. Volunteers helped with the clean-up on Friday morning, sweeping up burnt plastic and broken glass All that's left of the cars are their charred remains with melted plastic, broken glass, and molten metal on Waun-Wen Road. The clean-up operation got under way at just after 07:00 with council workers arriving to clean up the mess. A glazier firm arrived to look at homes which have several smashed windows. There's a lot of anger about what happened. A lot of people are upset that this was meant to be a vigil for a young local lad who died recently. People are angry that children were terrified after seeing this happen. They are upset it was just too dangerous for the police and fire service to attend or stay at the scene because of the crowds here. This video can not be played Social Media footage of Swansea 'yobs' setting cars on fire The council said it was continuing to support residents and has also now installed temporary concrete blocks on Waun-Wen Road to replace bollards that were damaged during the disorder. Council area co-ordinator Bethan McGregor said: ""What happened last night is not a true reflection of the Mayhill and Waun Wen community. ""This is a close-knit community where the vast majority of people care about one-another, as the amount of residents helping the council with the clean-up operation today has shown."" Concrete blocks have been placed on the street - but one resident says these were requested in February Despite being a ""lovely"" community, vehicles had been rolled down the hill in a similar fashion ""at least twice"" in the past three years, according to Sam Bennett, a community campaigner from the area. Mr Bennett told Radio Wales residents had written to the council to request concrete blocks on the street back in February. He added residents ""don't have the confidence that something is going to be done anymore and that's why they're choosing to move"". Owen Pillai, who works with young people in Swansea, said ""outrage and disgust"" was an understandable reaction to the ""inexcusable behaviour"" but added he could see why the riot had broken out. He called on authorities to realise ""we all play a part in this"". Mr Pillai told BBC Radio Wales: ""This is the result of decades and decades of a multifaceted undermining of resources, societal breakdown, generations of unemployment - you can't look at it in isolation unfortunately."" The community was thanked for helping those in need during the violence He said it was ""a scientific fact young people want to engage in risky behaviour"", and argued a lack of access to positive activities like sport could lead to problems.

UK to make free-trade offer to Australia,"Australia's mining industry is a major driver of exports to the UK The UK has offered trade deal terms to Australia under which both countries would phase out taxes on imports over 15 years. The cabinet was reportedly split on what terms to propose, amid concerns UK beef and lamb farmers could be undercut by larger Australian producers. But the dispute was apparently resolved after Boris Johnson pushed for unity. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss formally made the UK offer to her Australian counterpart on Friday. If accepted, it would also lead to quotas - limits - on tax-free trade between the two countries to be phased out. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned that freeing up the UK-Australian trade in meat will lead to hundreds of British cow and sheep breeders going out of business. Why is an Australia trade deal controversial? How many trade deals has the UK done? Ministers are keen to strike as many trade deals as possible following Brexit, and Ms Truss wants one in place with Australia by the time the UK hosts the G7 summit - of leading economies - in June. But she had reportedly been at odds with Environment Secretary George Eustice over the possible impact on farmers of removing import taxes, called tariffs, that are normally paid to the government. With these differences seemingly resolved at a Downing Street meeting chaired by the prime minister on Thursday, Ms Truss put the UK's terms for a deal to Australian counterpart Dan Tehan at an online meeting on Friday. Speaking on a visit to Portsmouth, Mr Johnson said: ""We are certainly looking at doing free trade deals around the world. ""They present a fantastic opportunity for our farmers, for businesses of all kinds, for our manufacturers. We should see these new openings not as threats but as opportunities."" Mr Tehan said he was ""confident"" of reaching an agreement with the UK by early June, having had ""very positive discussions"" with Ms Truss,the news.com.au website,externalreported. Farmers have raised concerns over competition from larger-scale Australian operators In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK wasvalued at Â£20.1bn,,externaland both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably. Currently,metals, wine and machines,externalform the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia'smain UK imports,externalare cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks. Trade in meat between the two countries is small, with 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK and 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia. NFU president Minette Batters said removing tariffs on these products would ""have a massive impact"" on British farms, which would be unable to compete, in terms of scale, with Australia's vast cattle and sheep stations. She added: ""We continue to maintain that a tariff-free trade deal with Australia will jeopardise our own farming industry and will cause the demise of many, many beef and sheep farms throughout the UK. This is true whether tariffs are dropped immediately or in 15 years' time."" The Scottish and Welsh governments have both urged Mr Johnson to ensure UK farmers are not left exposed. And Northern Ireland's agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, said he was ""strongly opposed"" to ending tariffs and quotas. But Conservative MP Neil Parish, chairman of the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, said UK farmers could succeed in the beef market by exporting more ""higher-end"" cuts, such as sirloin, to Australia. A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: ""Any deal we sign with Australia will include protections for the agriculture industry and will not undercut UK farmers or compromise our high standards. ""Typically, any tariff liberalisation is staged over time, with safeguards built in. We will continue to work with the industry, keeping them involved throughout the process and helping it capture the full benefits of trade."" Are you a farmer in the UK?

"Rioters face robust action, police vow","This video can not be played Rioters 'smashed through my windows and door' Seven police officers were injured when rioters threw bricks at houses and torched cars in Swansea. A major clean-up is under way after cars were burnt out and windowssmashed during the violence in the Mayhill area on Thursday. Families spoke of being trapped in houses, with police ""pelted with rocks"" as they tried to break up the violence. South Wales Police said seven officers suffered minor injuries when they were hit by missiles. The force's Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said he would ""stop at nothing to find"" those responsible. Clean-up starts after riots 'like a war zone' Shocking footage as 'yobs' set cars on fire Officers said they were using CCTV and social media footage to identify those responsible and urged people to send in any photos or videos. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the scenes were ""disgraceful"" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the scenes were ""completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated anywhere in Wales"". This video can not be played Mayhill rioters throw bricks at police van Home Secretary Priti Patel said the scenes were ""disgraceful"" and thanked ""brave officers for bringing it under control.""

Alun Michael, South Wales police commissioner, said Thursday's events were ""unusual and extreme"". ""Things developed very quickly and in a totally unacceptable manner last night and it's very important that we understand what's happened to make sure that it doesn't happen again,"" he said. This video can not be played ""I'm packing up, I'm not willing to live in fear,"" says Mayhill resident after riot The force's response has been criticised by some residents who said they were faced by violent ""yobs"" outside their homes with no-one coming to their aid. But South Wales Police said its response was ""immediate and officers trained to deal with public order incidents were deployed to the scene"". Officers believe the disorder in Waun-Wen Road, which saw groups roll a car down the middle of the street into a burning car, started as a vigil for 19-year-old Ethan Powell who collapsed and died suddenly on Wednesday. Adam Romain says he stood behind his front door hoping no-one would try and get into his house where his children were ""terrified"" Adam Romain said he feared a ""mob"" would enter his home and attack his family when he tried to stop them setting fire to his car. He told BBC Radio Wales he was out making deliveries when he got a panicked phone call from his girlfriend and could hear his children screaming in the background. ""I went back as quickly as I could, I drove up to my house, literally into a riot,"" he said. He said he had to ride his motorbike through the middle of ""about 100 lads"" throwing bricks. Mr Romain stood at the window, smashed in the riot, where his baby's cot is placed Mr Romain said he tried to stop a car being set on fire but was set upon. ""The bricks were starting to be lobbed at me and my house... my children were in the house, my girlfriend was in the back screaming, scared for their lives. ""I was standing at the front, hoping, praying, that they wouldn't come inside the house. ""They were coming to the front door, lobbing these bricks, straight through the glass door, straight at me - they had no fear whatsoever,"" he said. Mr Romain said he rang police three times, but was told ""we already know about the incident"" and no-one came to help. Shocking footage as 'yobs' set cars on fire Mr Romain said only last month a van was rolled down the hill and smashed into his neighbours' van and his car. In the aftermath people took to the streets to help with the clean up, and photographers captured the burnt out cars He filmed the rioters on a helmet camera, capturing the faces of many of the culprits, and said he would share the footage with the force. Volunteers helped with the clean-up on Friday morning, sweeping up burnt plastic and broken glass All that's left of the cars are their charred remains with melted plastic, broken glass, and molten metal on Waun-Wen Road. The clean-up operation got under way at just after 07:00 with council workers arriving to clean up the mess. A glazier firm arrived to look at homes which have several smashed windows. There's a lot of anger about what happened. A lot of people are upset that this was meant to be a vigil for a young local lad who died recently. People are angry that children were terrified after seeing this happen. They are upset it was just too dangerous for the police and fire service to attend or stay at the scene because of the crowds here. This video can not be played Social Media footage of Swansea 'yobs' setting cars on fire The council said it was continuing to support residents and has also now installed temporary concrete blocks on Waun-Wen Road to replace bollards that were damaged during the disorder. Council area co-ordinator Bethan McGregor said: ""What happened last night is not a true reflection of the Mayhill and Waun Wen community. ""This is a close-knit community where the vast majority of people care about one-another, as the amount of residents helping the council with the clean-up operation today has shown."" Concrete blocks have been placed on the street - but one resident says these were requested in February Despite being a ""lovely"" community, vehicles had been rolled down the hill in a similar fashion ""at least twice"" in the past three years, according to Sam Bennett, a community campaigner from the area. Mr Bennett told Radio Wales residents had written to the council to request concrete blocks on the street back in February. He added residents ""don't have the confidence that something is going to be done anymore and that's why they're choosing to move"". Owen Pillai, who works with young people in Swansea, said ""outrage and disgust"" was an understandable reaction to the ""inexcusable behaviour"" but added he could see why the riot had broken out. He called on authorities to realise ""we all play a part in this"". Mr Pillai told BBC Radio Wales: ""This is the result of decades and decades of a multifaceted undermining of resources, societal breakdown, generations of unemployment - you can't look at it in isolation unfortunately."" The community was thanked for helping those in need during the violence He said it was ""a scientific fact young people want to engage in risky behaviour"", and argued a lack of access to positive activities like sport could lead to problems. Mr Pillai added: ""We need to channel huge amounts of resource into listening, looking at restorative practice, involving these young people rather than just locking them away - they need to confront the reality of what they have done.""

Blavatnik tops UK rich list with Â£23bn fortune,"Sir Leonard Blavatnik and wife Emily Appelson at the Grammy Awards in 2018. Sir Leonard Blavatnik has topped the latest Sunday Times Rich List, having seen his fortune swell to Â£23bn. The Ukranian-born oil and media magnate, who also owns Warner Music, saw his wealth surge by Â£7.2bn during the year. He took the title from Sir James Dyson, whose wealth rose by only Â£100m to Â£16.3bn, leaving him in fourth place. There are now a record 171 billionaires in UK, with their wealth rising 21.7% during the pandemic to Â£597.2bn. Mr Blavatnik made his fortune in Russia where he owned stakes worth billions of pounds in companies selling metal and oil. He is a notoriously-private man, and holds both US and UK citizenship. His wealth was boosted by the proceeds of a Â£1.37bn stake in Warner, which he received when it listed on the stock market in the US last year. ""The fact many of the super-rich grew so much wealthier at a time when thousands of us have buried loved ones and millions of us worried for our livelihoods makes this a very unsettling boom,"" said Robert Watts, compiler of the annual index of the country's wealthiest residents. ""The global pandemic created lucrative opportunities for many online retailers, social networking apps and computer games tycoons."" Property investor brothers David and Simon Reuben were in second place after their fortune grew by Â£5.46bn to Â£21.46bn. Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who run the Mumbai-based conglomerate Hinduja Group, took third spot after their wealth rose by Â£1bn. Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, in fifth place, saw the biggest rise in wealth of any billionaire in the past 12 months, with gains of around Â£7.9bn, largely based on the rise in value of his ArcelorMittal steel-making business. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich was in eighth position after his fortune rose by Â£1.9bn to Â£12.1bn. The total of 171 billionairesin the latest Rich List is higher than the previous record of 151 set in 2019,external. The study found the richest 250 people in the UK this year are worth Â£658.1bn, up from Â£565.7bn last year, a rise of 16.3%. There are also more entrepreneurs behind unicorns - start-up businesses with a valuation higher than $1bn - to be found in the Rich List than before. They include Farfetch, the luxury online fashion retailer, whose founder Jose Neves is a new entry at 82 in this year's Rich List with a Â£2bn fortune. Alex Chesterman, founder of online car dealing service Cazoo makes his first appearance at 215th with an estimated worth of Â£750m. ""The valuations of many rich listers' companies have soared over the past year - especially the pack of tech businesses known as unicorns,"" said Mr Watts. ""I worry about the strength of the foundations. No-one wants to see a re-run of the dotcom boom-and-bust of 20 years ago."" The Sunday Times does not just track how much money the mega-wealthy have accumulated each year. It also monitors how much of their fortune they give to charity. Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford became the youngest person ever to top the paper's giving list, which is calculated by ranking the amount donated or raised relative to a person's overall wealth. The 23-year old was behind a high-profile campaign calling for children who are eligible for free school meals to be fed during coronavirus lockdowns. He was estimated to have raised Â£20m to support the scheme, more than the Â£16m he is thought to be worth.

Before we go, here is a summary of the stories in the headlines: Earlier today Boris Johnson visited the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier in Portsmouth Boris Johnson is calling for a new international treaty on pandemic preparedness, aimed at tackling not just the current pandemic but any future global threat too. Speaking virtually to the Global Health Summit hosted by Italy and the EU in Rome, the UK prime minister says just as World War Two ""forged global co-operation"" on defence, he hoped to establish a fresh treaty with the World Health Organization that would set out steps every country should take to prevent another deadly outbreak. He says this could include zero-tariffs on important medical equipment and a worldwide network of research hubs ""so we can identify dangerous pathogens likely to jump from animal to human"". ""Now is the time to move away from the temptations of competing nationalism... and instead reassert the power, the duty, the necessity for nations to act together, building collective defence against the common enemy of disease, and protecting all our people for generations to come,"" Johnson says. Johnson also references Homer's Iliad as he draws comparisons between the coronavirus outbreak and the plague in the ancient Greek epic. ""My point is that almost 2,800 years later, the world has been just as disunited, I'm afraid, as Achilles and Agamemnon,"" he says. The business on Bishopthorpe Road was initially ordered to close from 13 to 20 May A barbershop in York that was given fines totalling Â£33,000 has been ordered to close until mid-July unless it can prove it is following Covid safety rules. City of York Council has issued 12 fixed penalty notices to Q Gentlemens Barbers, with the fines not yet paid, the council said. The council action followed complaints from residents about the business not abiding by Covid rules. The local authority initially ordered it to close between 13 and 20 May. Read morehere.

Guernsey has announced it will return to normal travel with the UK, Jersey, Isle of Man and Republic of Ireland from 1 July. For arrivals coming from within those four Common Travel Area destinations. there will be no testing or self-isolation requirement, the States of Guernsey says. It comes as part of a transition to atraffic light system of travel, which is largely based on the UK system of categorising countries according to their infection rates. However, the States emphasised they are continuing to monitor the global coronavirus situation and might amend the timing of introducing the relaxed system. Read more here.

Sturgeon says she knows how unwelcome the news will be - not least because she lives in Glasgow herself - but she hopes it will not be for too much longer. Watch her make the announcement above. Lockdowns have forced people to spend the past year and more learning, working, and socialising online - but in many countries, women have been missing out. They are less likely than men to have access to the internet in nearly every region of the world, according to the latest figures from UN agency the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The so-called digital gender gap is most noticeable in Africa, where the ITU estimates 37% of men have internet access but only 20% of women. Regina Honu, founder of Soronko Academy, a tech school for women and girls in Ghana, says: ""Before Covid, if we put out an invitation for people to sign up, we would have 100 or 200 women. After Covid, we had more than 2,000 women signing up. ""Covid has made people realise that if you don't have digital skills, you're going to be left behind."" Read more here. People aged over 16 who live in North Tyneside will be able get tested for Covid from Saturday as part of a programme to try and stop the spread of the Indian variant. Increased testing - orsurge testingas it's known - will be carried out at units in North Shields and Wallsend for residents who aren't showing symptoms, including those who've had their vaccine. It follows a rise in cases of the so-called Indian variant. Covid-19 cases in the borough have risen from 22 to 53 per 100,000 people in the last week and North Tyneside Council believes the 19 confirmed cases of the variant in the region will increase. Public Health Director Wendy Burke said: ""We will be offering additional testing to identify any further cases of Covid-19 and in particular the variant, so that we can support people to self-isolate and identify their contacts. ""In addition, we will also be making available better accessibility to the vaccination programme and we will be doing more work to try to get those who haven't yet accessed their first dose of vaccine  to come forward. ""What we're trying to do is identify over-50s and those in the 'at risk' category who haven't yet had a first dose."" Nearly 690,000 UK adults received either the first or second dose of a Covid vaccine on Thursday. The latest government data shows 268,251 first doses were given, taking the total number of people to have received their initial jab to 37,518,614. A total of 420,312 people were given a second vaccination, meaning 21,659,783, or 41.1% of adults, have now had both jabs. For context, the highest number of vaccinations given in a single day was the 844,285 administered on 20 March. But yesterday's total was the highest since 24 April. There have been a further 2,829 cases of Covid in the UK, thelatest government figures,externalshow. Another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced. Last Friday there were 2,193 cases and 17 deaths. The decision by the Scottish Government to move Moray to level two restrictions has been described as ""hugely welcome"" by the chief executive of the local council. The area had been kept in level three over concerns about its infection rate but that had dropped in recent days. Roddy Burns says: ""I pay tribute to the community, NHS and council colleagues for their response to the increased and enhanced testing and accelerated vaccination programmes."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who is the MP for Moray, says he was delighted by the announcement, adding: ""We've got to look at what has worked here and in other areas of the country to get any spike in cases down.""

Heathrow's Terminal 5 has signs on seats to enforce social distancing Heathrow Airport says it will open a dedicated arrivals facility for passengers from red-list countries in Terminal 3 from 1 June. The terminal has been closed for the past year, but from that date it will be exclusively used for direct flights from countries deemed to have the highest risk of Covid infection. Passengers on those flights, who have to be British nationals or residents, will have to quarantine in dedicated hotels. Both the government and Heathrow have come under fire in recent days over reports travellers from red list areas were forced to mix with other passengers in immigration halls, where passengers could be waiting for several hours at times. Heathrow says opening the facility will be logistically very challenging, adding that ""our hope is that it will enable Border Force to carry out its duties more efficiently as passenger volumes increase in line with the green list"". Staff and customers at a West Yorkshire pub are marking reopening bycelebrating Christmasfive months late. The Green Dragon in Pontefract put up decorations in December but when tier 3 rules forced the venue to remain closed, the tinsel was left up on the walls. The pub did not reopen when restrictions were first eased, for outdoor drinkers and diners, in April - so regulars were met with baubles and Christmas songs when the doors finally did reopen this Monday. The pub is holding a Christmas party this weekend as well as a New Year's Eve night, with a countdown to midnight and a rendition of Auld Lang Syne. And anyone wearing a Christmas jumper today has been promised a free drink. The Olympic Games will go ahead even if Tokyo remains in a state of emergency due to the pandemic, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee says. Tokyo is one of nine prefectures of Japan to be under emergency measures, which will stay in place until at least 31 May. John Coates, the chair of the IOC's coordination commission, says this will not affect the Games - even if the capital is still under the measures by the time they open on 23 July. ""We've successfully seen five sports hold their test events during the state of emergency,"" he says. ""All of the plans that we have in place to protect the safety and security of athletes and the people of Japan are based around the worst possible circumstances, so the answer (to whether a Games could take place during a state of emergency) is absolutely yes."" The Japanese government has called on Games organisers to further reduce the number of overseas visitors, insisting that only those essential to the operation of the event come into the country. Overseas spectators have already been barred, and a decision on how many - if any - Japanese fans can attend will be taken next month. Wider surge testing has been rolled out in five west London boroughs due to a surge in coronavirus cases linked to the Indian variant.

There is ""very high potential"" for the Indian Covid variant of concern to ""establish community transmission"" in Wales, a top health official has said. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said there was evidence of infections unrelated to travel. But PHW has said most cases are still related to travel or to close contacts of people who have been abroad. If community infections became severe, putting pressure on the NHS, lockdown easing would be reconsidered, he said. Wales currently has a low number of cases of the variant of concern, with atotal of 28 reported on Thursday. Read more here. Case rates across Wales are low, but the dominant variant is still the Kent variant More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 180 countries worldwide.

Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but some are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Turkey, Russia and the UK. Very few places have been left untouched. Â© 2025 BBC.

Speaking virtually to the Global Health Summit hosted by Italy and the EU in Rome, the UK prime minister says just as World War Two ""forged global co-operation"" on defence, he hoped to establish a fresh treaty with the World Health Organization that would set out steps every country should take to prevent another deadly outbreak. He says this could include zero-tariffs on important medical equipment and a worldwide network of research hubs ""so we can identify dangerous pathogens likely to jump from animal to human"". ""Now is the time to move away from the temptations of competing nationalism... and instead reassert the power, the duty, the necessity for nations to act together, building collective defence against the common enemy of disease, and protecting all our people for generations to come,"" Johnson says. Johnson also references Homer's Iliad as he draws comparisons between the coronavirus outbreak and the plague in the ancient Greek epic. ""My point is that almost 2,800 years later, the world has been just as disunited, I'm afraid, as Achilles and Agamemnon,"" he says.

Lockdowns have forced people to spend the past year and more learning, working, and socialising online - but in many countries, women have been missing out. They are less likely than men to have access to the internet in nearly every region of the world, according to the latest figures from UN agency the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The so-called digital gender gap is most noticeable in Africa, where the ITU estimates 37% of men have internet access but only 20% of women. Regina Honu, founder of Soronko Academy, a tech school for women and girls in Ghana, says: ""Before Covid, if we put out an invitation for people to sign up, we would have 100 or 200 women.

Public Health Director Wendy Burke said: ""We will be offering additional testing to identify any further cases of Covid-19 and in particular the variant, so that we can support people to self-isolate and identify their contacts. ""In addition, we will also be making available better accessibility to the vaccination programme and we will be doing more work to try to get those who haven't yet accessed their first dose of vaccine  to come forward. ""What we're trying to do is identify over-50s and those in the 'at risk' category who haven't yet had a first dose."" Nearly 690,000 UK adults received either the first or second dose of a Covid vaccine on Thursday. The latest government data shows 268,251 first doses were given, taking the total number of people to have received their initial jab to 37,518,614.

Heathrow's Terminal 5 has signs on seats to enforce social distancing Heathrow Airport says it will open a dedicated arrivals facility for passengers from red-list countries in Terminal 3 from 1 June. The terminal has been closed for the past year, but from that date it will be exclusively used for direct flights from countries deemed to have the highest risk of Covid infection. Passengers on those flights, who have to be British nationals or residents, will have to quarantine in dedicated hotels. Both the government and Heathrow have come under fire in recent days over reports travellers from red list areas were forced to mix with other passengers in immigration halls, where passengers could be waiting for several hours at times. Heathrow says opening the facility will be logistically very challenging, adding that ""our hope is that it will enable Border Force to carry out its duties more efficiently as passenger volumes increase in line with the green list"". Staff and customers at a West Yorkshire pub are marking reopening bycelebrating Christmasfive months late. The Green Dragon in Pontefract put up decorations in December but when tier 3 rules forced the venue to remain closed, the tinsel was left up on the walls.

The pub is holding a Christmas party this weekend as well as a New Year's Eve night, with a countdown to midnight and a rendition of Auld Lang Syne. And anyone wearing a Christmas jumper today has been promised a free drink.

John Coates, the chair of the IOC's coordination commission, says this will not affect the Games - even if the capital is still under the measures by the time they open on 23 July. ""We've successfully seen five sports hold their test events during the state of emergency,"" he says. ""All of the plans that we have in place to protect the safety and security of athletes and the people of Japan are based around the worst possible circumstances, so the answer (to whether a Games could take place during a state of emergency) is absolutely yes."" The Japanese government has called on Games organisers to further reduce the number of overseas visitors, insisting that only those essential to the operation of the event come into the country. Overseas spectators have already been barred, and a decision on how many - if any - Japanese fans can attend will be taken next month.

Until now, socialising has been restricted to outdoors only It's the first weekend this year that people in England, Wales and Scotland have the chance to socialise indoors, with restrictions having eased on Monday. But what are the new rules? Well, it depends which country you are in. In England, rules include:  And in Scotland, for those in level two or level one areas - which is everywhere other than Glasgow:  While in Wales: Read more here. Guernsey has announced it will return to normal travel with the UK, Jersey, Isle of Man and Republic of Ireland from 1 July. For arrivals coming from within those four Common Travel Area destinations. there will be no testing or self-isolation requirement, the States of Guernsey says. It comes as part of a transition to atraffic light system of travel, which is largely based on the UK system of categorising countries according to their infection rates. However, the States emphasised they are continuing to monitor the global coronavirus situation and might amend the timing of introducing the relaxed system. Read more here. This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: 'We haven't turned the corner in Glasgow yet' First Minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier confirmed Glasgow is remaining in level three coronavirus restrictions. Sturgeon says she knows how unwelcome the news will be - not least because she lives in Glasgow herself - but she hopes it will not be for too much longer. Watch her make the announcement above. Lockdowns have forced people to spend the past year and more learning, working, and socialising online - but in many countries, women have been missing out. They are less likely than men to have access to the internet in nearly every region of the world, according to the latest figures from UN agency the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The so-called digital gender gap is most noticeable in Africa, where the ITU estimates 37% of men have internet access but only 20% of women. Regina Honu, founder of Soronko Academy, a tech school for women and girls in Ghana, says: ""Before Covid, if we put out an invitation for people to sign up, we would have 100 or 200 women. After Covid, we had more than 2,000 women signing up. ""Covid has made people realise that if you don't have digital skills, you're going to be left behind."" Read more here. People aged over 16 who live in North Tyneside will be able get tested for Covid from Saturday as part of a programme to try and stop the spread of the Indian variant. Increased testing - orsurge testingas it's known - will be carried out at units in North Shields and Wallsend for residents who aren't showing symptoms, including those who've had their vaccine. It follows a rise in cases of the so-called Indian variant. Covid-19 cases in the borough have risen from 22 to 53 per 100,000 people in the last week and North Tyneside Council believes the 19 confirmed cases of the variant in the region will increase. Public Health Director Wendy Burke said: ""We will be offering additional testing to identify any further cases of Covid-19 and in particular the variant, so that we can support people to self-isolate and identify their contacts. ""In addition, we will also be making available better accessibility to the vaccination programme and we will be doing more work to try to get those who haven't yet accessed their first dose of vaccine  to come forward. ""What we're trying to do is identify over-50s and those in the 'at risk' category who haven't yet had a first dose."" Nearly 690,000 UK adults received either the first or second dose of a Covid vaccine on Thursday. The latest government data shows 268,251 first doses were given, taking the total number of people to have received their initial jab to 37,518,614. A total of 420,312 people were given a second vaccination, meaning 21,659,783, or 41.1% of adults, have now had both jabs. For context, the highest number of vaccinations given in a single day was the 844,285 administered on 20 March. But yesterday's total was the highest since 24 April. There have been a further 2,829 cases of Covid in the UK, thelatest government figures,externalshow. Another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced. Last Friday there were 2,193 cases and 17 deaths. The decision by the Scottish Government to move Moray to level two restrictions has been described as ""hugely welcome"" by the chief executive of the local council. The area had been kept in level three over concerns about its infection rate but that had dropped in recent days. Roddy Burns says: ""I pay tribute to the community, NHS and council colleagues for their response to the increased and enhanced testing and accelerated vaccination programmes."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who is the MP for Moray, says he was delighted by the announcement, adding: ""We've got to look at what has worked here and in other areas of the country to get any spike in cases down.""

Heathrow's Terminal 5 has signs on seats to enforce social distancing Heathrow Airport says it will open a dedicated arrivals facility for passengers from red-list countries in Terminal 3 from 1 June. The terminal has been closed for the past year, but from that date it will be exclusively used for direct flights from countries deemed to have the highest risk of Covid infection. Passengers on those flights, who have to be British nationals or residents, will have to quarantine in dedicated hotels. Both the government and Heathrow have come under fire in recent days over reports travellers from red list areas were forced to mix with other passengers in immigration halls, where passengers could be waiting for several hours at times. Heathrow says opening the facility will be logistically very challenging, adding that ""our hope is that it will enable Border Force to carry out its duties more efficiently as passenger volumes increase in line with the green list"". Staff and customers at a West Yorkshire pub are marking reopening bycelebrating Christmasfive months late. The Green Dragon in Pontefract put up decorations in December but when tier 3 rules forced the venue to remain closed, the tinsel was left up on the walls. The pub did not reopen when restrictions were first eased, for outdoor drinkers and diners, in April - so regulars were met with baubles and Christmas songs when the doors finally did reopen this Monday. The pub is holding a Christmas party this weekend as well as a New Year's Eve night, with a countdown to midnight and a rendition of Auld Lang Syne. And anyone wearing a Christmas jumper today has been promised a free drink. The Olympic Games will go ahead even if Tokyo remains in a state of emergency due to the pandemic, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee says. Tokyo is one of nine prefectures of Japan to be under emergency measures, which will stay in place until at least 31 May. John Coates, the chair of the IOC's coordination commission, says this will not affect the Games - even if the capital is still under the measures by the time they open on 23 July. ""We've successfully seen five sports hold their test events during the state of emergency,"" he says. ""All of the plans that we have in place to protect the safety and security of athletes and the people of Japan are based around the worst possible circumstances, so the answer (to whether a Games could take place during a state of emergency) is absolutely yes."" The Japanese government has called on Games organisers to further reduce the number of overseas visitors, insisting that only those essential to the operation of the event come into the country. Overseas spectators have already been barred, and a decision on how many - if any - Japanese fans can attend will be taken next month. Wider surge testing has been rolled out in five west London boroughs due to a surge in coronavirus cases linked to the Indian variant. Testing in Ealing, Hillingdon, Brent, Harrow and Hounslow will begin on Monday, the BBC has been told. It wasalready taking placein Hillingdon and Hounslow. The testing will target secondary schools in the five boroughs, with PCR tests also offered to anyone else in the area who does not have any symptoms. Cases of the new variant in west London have increased from 400 to 720. You can read more here. The European Union intends to invest 1bn euros (Â£859m, US$1.2bn) to build Covid vaccine-manufacturing hubs in Africa. It will also donate at least 100 million doses of coronavirus vaccines to low and middle income countries by the end of the year, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, says. She has been speaking at a Covid summit in Rome, where one of the leading vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer/BioNTech, announced it would make two billion doses available at cost to poorer countries over the next 18 months. The partly virtual meeting in the Italian capital wants to coordinate global efforts to combat the pandemic. There is ""very high potential"" for the Indian Covid variant of concern to ""establish community transmission"" in Wales, a top health official has said. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said there was evidence of infections unrelated to travel. But PHW has said most cases are still related to travel or to close contacts of people who have been abroad. If community infections became severe, putting pressure on the NHS, lockdown easing would be reconsidered, he said. Wales currently has a low number of cases of the variant of concern, with atotal of 28 reported on Thursday. Read more here. Case rates across Wales are low, but the dominant variant is still the Kent variant More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 180 countries worldwide. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress. Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but some are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Turkey, Russia and the UK. Very few places have been left untouched. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Blavatnik tops UK rich list with Â£23bn fortuneSir Leonard Blavatnik topples Sir James Dyson as the UK's richest person, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.","Sir Leonard Blavatnik and wife Emily Appelson at the Grammy Awards in 2018. Sir Leonard Blavatnik has topped the latest Sunday Times Rich List, having seen his fortune swell to Â£23bn. The Ukranian-born oil and media magnate, who also owns Warner Music, saw his wealth surge by Â£7.2bn during the year. He took the title from Sir James Dyson, whose wealth rose by only Â£100m to Â£16.3bn, leaving him in fourth place. There are now a record 171 billionaires in UK, with their wealth rising 21.7% during the pandemic to Â£597.2bn. Mr Blavatnik made his fortune in Russia where he owned stakes worth billions of pounds in companies selling metal and oil. He is a notoriously-private man, and holds both US and UK citizenship. His wealth was boosted by the proceeds of a Â£1.37bn stake in Warner, which he received when it listed on the stock market in the US last year. ""The fact many of the super-rich grew so much wealthier at a time when thousands of us have buried loved ones and millions of us worried for our livelihoods makes this a very unsettling boom,"" said Robert Watts, compiler of the annual index of the country's wealthiest residents. ""The global pandemic created lucrative opportunities for many online retailers, social networking apps and computer games tycoons."" Property investor brothers David and Simon Reuben were in second place after their fortune grew by Â£5.46bn to Â£21.46bn. Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who run the Mumbai-based conglomerate Hinduja Group, took third spot after their wealth rose by Â£1bn. Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, in fifth place, saw the biggest rise in wealth of any billionaire in the past 12 months, with gains of around Â£7.9bn, largely based on the rise in value of his ArcelorMittal steel-making business. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich was in eighth position after his fortune rose by Â£1.9bn to Â£12.1bn. The total of 171 billionairesin the latest Rich List is higher than the previous record of 151 set in 2019,external. The study found the richest 250 people in the UK this year are worth Â£658.1bn, up from Â£565.7bn last year, a rise of 16.3%. There are also more entrepreneurs behind unicorns - start-up businesses with a valuation higher than $1bn - to be found in the Rich List than before. They include Farfetch, the luxury online fashion retailer, whose founder Jose Neves is a new entry at 82 in this year's Rich List with a Â£2bn fortune. Alex Chesterman, founder of online car dealing service Cazoo makes his first appearance at 215th with an estimated worth of Â£750m. ""The valuations of many rich listers' companies have soared over the past year - especially the pack of tech businesses known as unicorns,"" said Mr Watts. ""I worry about the strength of the foundations. No-one wants to see a re-run of the dotcom boom-and-bust of 20 years ago."" The Sunday Times does not just track how much money the mega-wealthy have accumulated each year. It also monitors how much of their fortune they give to charity. Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford became the youngest person ever to top the paper's giving list, which is calculated by ranking the amount donated or raised relative to a person's overall wealth. The 23-year old was behind a high-profile campaign calling for children who are eligible for free school meals to be fed during coronavirus lockdowns.

Speaking virtually to the Global Health Summit hosted by Italy and the EU in Rome, the UK prime minister says just as World War Two ""forged global co-operation"" on defence, he hoped to establish a fresh treaty with the World Health Organization that would set out steps every country should take to prevent another deadly outbreak. He says this could include zero-tariffs on important medical equipment and a worldwide network of research hubs ""so we can identify dangerous pathogens likely to jump from animal to human"". ""Now is the time to move away from the temptations of competing nationalism... and instead reassert the power, the duty, the necessity for nations to act together, building collective defence against the common enemy of disease, and protecting all our people for generations to come,"" Johnson says. Johnson also references Homer's Iliad as he draws comparisons between the coronavirus outbreak and the plague in the ancient Greek epic. ""My point is that almost 2,800 years later, the world has been just as disunited, I'm afraid, as Achilles and Agamemnon,"" he says. The business on Bishopthorpe Road was initially ordered to close from 13 to 20 May A barbershop in York that was given fines totalling Â£33,000 has been ordered to close until mid-July unless it can prove it is following Covid safety rules.

"Clothes sales fuel retail boom as shops reopenRetail sales jump 9.2% in April as people returning to work and going out ""update their wardrobes"".Business","A surge in spending on clothes helped to boost retail sales last month, as lockdown measures eased and non-essential shops reopened. Retail sales jumped 9.2% in April,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external, with sales of clothing soaring by nearly 70% compared with March. Sales overall were more than 10% higher than pre-pandemic levels, although online sales dipped. Economist Paul Dales called the surge in clothing sales ""astonishing"". The Capital Economics chief UK economist said the April data ""showed that households were particularly keen to update their wardrobes"". Further evidence of the rebound in the UK economy came in a separate survey,an IHS/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index,external, which suggested that activity among private business during May has expanded at the fastest pace for more than two decades. Retailers such as clothing and furniture stores, which the government classed as non-essential, reopened to shoppers in England on 12 April after shutting in early January. Aled Jones, head of retail at Lloyds Bank, said: ""Fashion retailers [were] the ultimate beneficiaries of beer gardens reopening and the 'rule of six' night out returning."" Silvia Rindone, EY UK & Ireland retail leader, said April had seen ""significant pent-up consumer demand"". ""With consumers keen to return to the in-store shopping experience and indulge in retail therapy, we saw a sales boost across most categories."" The reopening of non-essential shops led to a boost for many small businesses. Delia Prudence, owner of The Art Room, an art supplies shop in Scarborough, said: ""We were expecting to be busy in April but not that busy. ""The tills were ringing non-stop. One customer even came in with a bottle of Prosecco to celebrate us reopening."" UK inflation rate more than doubles in April UK economy picks up as lockdown restrictions ease Industry body the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that April had given ""a welcome boost for thousands of retailers in England and Wales"" due to pent up demand. ""Improved weather during April meant greater sales of fashion, particularly in outerwear and knitwear, as the public renewed their wardrobe and made plans to meet friends and family outdoors,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. However, she said that while the figures were ""a step in the right direction"", demand ""remains fragile"". ""Footfall is still down by 40% on the pre-pandemic period, and there are still 530,000 people who work in retail still on furlough,"" she said, adding that the end of the full business rates relief in England ""poses a significant threat to retailers"". Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that there were signs that sales might rise further in May. However, he predicted that the recovery in household spending ""will stall as it approaches its pre-Covid level later this year"". The winding-up of the furlough scheme at the end of September is likely to trigger a renewed fall in employment, while rising inflation will push down real wages, he said. In addition, the end of the stamp-duty holiday on 30 September will probably lead to a ""sharp decline"" in housing market activity, leading to less demand for ""big-ticket"" household goods. The latest survey of private sector businesses from IHS Markit/CIPS found the recent rebound continuing strongly as lockdown restrictions are eased. Its ""flash"" - or preliminary - Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 62.0 in May, up from 60.7 in April. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. The figure was the highest since the survey began in January 1998 and reflected ""strong contributions"" from both the manufacturing and services sectors. ""The UK is enjoying an unprecedented growth spurt as the economy reopens,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, ""Factory orders are surging at a record pace as global demand for goods continues to revive, and the service sector is reporting near-record growth as the opening up of the economy allows more businesses to trade."" However, the recent economic rebound has raised fears that inflation could pick up. The PMI survey found that cost pressures were at a 13-year high, leading firms to raise their prices. ""A direct consequence of demand running ahead of supply was a steep rise in prices, hinting strongly that consumer price inflation has much further to rise after lifting to 1.5% in April,"" Mr Williamson said.

"NI unlikely to go back to full lockdown, says Murphy","Indoor hospitality can operate from Monday Northern Ireland has likely seen ""the end"" of the most stringent coronavirus restrictions, the finance minister has said. On Thursday, the executive agreed to ease some restrictions, allowing hospitality to operate indoors, and hotels and B&Bs to reopen from Monday. Conor Murphy said he ""sincerely believed"" there would not be a return to full lockdowns. He said even the worst case modelling showed the health service could cope. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered Executive allocates Â£316m to Covid-recovery fund Asked on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster programme if Northern Ireland would see the same scale of regulations brought in again, Mr Murphy said: ""I believe it's the end of the restrictions as we have seen them. ""Even in the modelling we have seen, in the worst case scenario the health service can continue to cope, albeit it needs ongoing support. Conor Murphy says he ""sincerely believes"" Northern Ireland has seen the end of the most stringent restrictions ""Of course we can't, with a huge degree of accuracy, project into the future, we know there are other variants out in the world, we know they are having an impact in other places, we have to continue to protect ourselves and that's why the message remains that Covid is still with us."" However, he said restrictions and mitigation measures would continue for some time. On Thursday, Stormont announced it had allocated Â£316m in pandemic-recovery funding. Mr Murphy said it would take more than reopening to get businesses back on their feet. ""It is going to be a difficult time ahead for business so the executive now is going to focus more on economic recovery rather than businesses that have been closed."" Indoor household visits allowed, with up to six people from no more than two households (this does not include children under 12); Overnight stays permitted; Indoor hospitality allowed with six people allowed to sit together from unlimited households (children under 12 not counted in the six); Hotels, B&Bs and other travel and tourism venues to reopen; Post wedding and civil partnership receptions permitted, with no restriction on top table but restriction of 10 at other tables; Removal of stay local message; Schools can resume extra-curricular activities, with indoor sports and outdoor inter-schools sports allowed; Indoor visitor attractions can reopen with mitigations, including amusement arcades, bingo halls, museums, galleries and cinemas; Libraries can reopen; All outdoor and indoor sport and leisure venues are permitted to open and indoor group exercise and training can resume, including soft play areas, leisure centres, gyms, swimming pools, equestrian centres, venues relating to motor sport and activity centres; Up to 500 spectators allowed at outdoor sport events or gatherings; Increase in number allowed for indoor (non-domestic) gatherings, subject to venue risk assessment. Sinead and Gerard Keenan, who own and manage Dan's Bar in west Belfast,thought they may be forced to sell-up due to lockdown. On Monday, they will reopen with a fresh coat of paint. Pubs that only sell drinks were among the first to close, and the last to reopen. Mrs Keenan told Good Morning Ulster: ""I'm super excited but super nervous. I'm hoping I still remember how to pull the perfect pint."" The Keenans have given their pub a fresh coat of paint ahead of reopening Michael Stewart, from House Hotel in Belfast, said it was not just about money. He said: ""It's been five months since hospitality closed its doors on Christmas Eve and it's been a long five months so it's very, very welcome. ""It's about getting the place back open, getting the tills ringing again but also getting people back into employment."" Kiera Duddy, owner of the Pickled Duck in Londonderry, said that it was ""full steam ahead"" for indoor dining. ""We were ecstatic when we heard the news on Monday that we could open indoors, because our weather here isn't what you would really call Mediterranean. ""The weather this time in May has been unfavourable to us, but we have made good of a bad situation and we've got our wind-breakers on and our gas heaters,"" Ms Duddy told BBC Radio Foyle. Twelve countries are onNorthern Ireland's so-called ""green list"" for foreign travel,external, including Portugal. People going to countries that appear on the green list do not need to quarantine on their return. But those returning from the likes of Portugal will be asked to take a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test for Covid in the days after they arrive home. Twelve countries are on Northern Ireland's so-called ""green list"" for foreign travel, including Portugal Brenda Cassidy runs Paddy's Irish Bar in Albufeira on Portugal's south coast with her husband and son. She told Good Morning Ulster the business may not have survived losing a second holiday season to Covid-19. ""There's an awful lots of places that haven't made it through. If it kept going, there's only so many local people who can keep the local bars going. Maybe some of the bigger bars can afford to close, the small local ones [can't] so we have to have tourism."" England, Scotland and Wales have already implemented similar systems, with the first travellers heading off on holiday earlier this week. People travelling from England who have had both Covid jabs candemonstrate their vaccination,externalstatus via the NHS app or a letter. However,the NHS app,externalthat proves a person is vaccinated so they can travel is incompatible with Northern Ireland's health and social care system, the NI Department of Health (DoH) has confirmed. Speaking at Stormont on Thursday, outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster said the apps in England and Wales did not ""speak to"" the apps in Northern Ireland and Scotland. She said a short-term ""paper trail"" solution was being considered to prove vaccination, adding: ""That is not just a letter but you cannot just turn up with a letter that somebody from your office has typed out for you."" She said work was under way to have all apps in the UK connected. A DoH spokesman said: ""The NHS App uses information from NHS England computer systems. ""It is not directly compatible with NI Health and Social Care systems. Work is currently ongoing across the devolved administrations in regards to vaccine and testing certification, in order to support international travel when restrictions are eased."" DoH has set aside Â£3m in resources and a Â£1.5m capital allocation for Covid status certification, which includes digital ID. A very limited number of countries are set to make NI's green list Non-essential travel from Northern Ireland to other parts of the Common Travel Area (CTA) is to be allowed from Monday and people will not be required to isolate on return if they have visited family or friends in other parts of the area. The CTA is the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man. At Thursday's executive meeting, ministers also backed the attendance of spectators at outdoor sport events - up to 500 may be permitted. Indoor household visits will also be allowed from that date, with six people from two households allowed at one time. Children under 12 do not count towards the total. Overnight stays will also be allowed. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to trade indoors with a maximum of six people per table from a maximum of six households, or up to 10 people provided they are all from the same household. Up to 1,000 fans will be able to attend the Irish Cup Final on Friday Other measures easing from Monday include increased numbers permitted for indoor gatherings - not including domestic settings - to allow for community events such as mother-and-toddler groups to resume. Up to 1,000 fans will also be allowed to attend Friday's Irish Cupfinal at Mourneview Park in Lurgan, County Armagh.

"Rioters face robust action, police vowOne man spoke of how a ""mob"" turned on him, throwing bricks at his family and their home in Swansea.Wales","This video can not be played Rioters 'smashed through my windows and door' Seven police officers were injured when rioters threw bricks at houses and torched cars in Swansea. A major clean-up is under way after cars were burnt out and windowssmashed during the violence in the Mayhill area on Thursday. Families spoke of being trapped in houses, with police ""pelted with rocks"" as they tried to break up the violence. South Wales Police said seven officers suffered minor injuries when they were hit by missiles. The force's Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said he would ""stop at nothing to find"" those responsible. Clean-up starts after riots 'like a war zone' Shocking footage as 'yobs' set cars on fire Officers said they were using CCTV and social media footage to identify those responsible and urged people to send in any photos or videos. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the scenes were ""disgraceful"" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the scenes were ""completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated anywhere in Wales"". This video can not be played Mayhill rioters throw bricks at police van Home Secretary Priti Patel said the scenes were ""disgraceful"" and thanked ""brave officers for bringing it under control.""

Alun Michael, South Wales police commissioner, said Thursday's events were ""unusual and extreme"". ""Things developed very quickly and in a totally unacceptable manner last night and it's very important that we understand what's happened to make sure that it doesn't happen again,"" he said. This video can not be played ""I'm packing up, I'm not willing to live in fear,"" says Mayhill resident after riot The force's response has been criticised by some residents who said they were faced by violent ""yobs"" outside their homes with no-one coming to their aid. But South Wales Police said its response was ""immediate and officers trained to deal with public order incidents were deployed to the scene"". Officers believe the disorder in Waun-Wen Road, which saw groups roll a car down the middle of the street into a burning car, started as a vigil for 19-year-old Ethan Powell who collapsed and died suddenly on Wednesday. Adam Romain says he stood behind his front door hoping no-one would try and get into his house where his children were ""terrified"" Adam Romain said he feared a ""mob"" would enter his home and attack his family when he tried to stop them setting fire to his car. He told BBC Radio Wales he was out making deliveries when he got a panicked phone call from his girlfriend and could hear his children screaming in the background. ""I went back as quickly as I could, I drove up to my house, literally into a riot,"" he said. He said he had to ride his motorbike through the middle of ""about 100 lads"" throwing bricks. Mr Romain stood at the window, smashed in the riot, where his baby's cot is placed Mr Romain said he tried to stop a car being set on fire but was set upon. ""The bricks were starting to be lobbed at me and my house... my children were in the house, my girlfriend was in the back screaming, scared for their lives. ""I was standing at the front, hoping, praying, that they wouldn't come inside the house. ""They were coming to the front door, lobbing these bricks, straight through the glass door, straight at me - they had no fear whatsoever,"" he said. Mr Romain said he rang police three times, but was told ""we already know about the incident"" and no-one came to help. Shocking footage as 'yobs' set cars on fire Mr Romain said only last month a van was rolled down the hill and smashed into his neighbours' van and his car. In the aftermath people took to the streets to help with the clean up, and photographers captured the burnt out cars He filmed the rioters on a helmet camera, capturing the faces of many of the culprits, and said he would share the footage with the force. Volunteers helped with the clean-up on Friday morning, sweeping up burnt plastic and broken glass All that's left of the cars are their charred remains with melted plastic, broken glass, and molten metal on Waun-Wen Road. The clean-up operation got under way at just after 07:00 with council workers arriving to clean up the mess. A glazier firm arrived to look at homes which have several smashed windows. There's a lot of anger about what happened. A lot of people are upset that this was meant to be a vigil for a young local lad who died recently. People are angry that children were terrified after seeing this happen. They are upset it was just too dangerous for the police and fire service to attend or stay at the scene because of the crowds here. This video can not be played Social Media footage of Swansea 'yobs' setting cars on fire The council said it was continuing to support residents and has also now installed temporary concrete blocks on Waun-Wen Road to replace bollards that were damaged during the disorder. Council area co-ordinator Bethan McGregor said: ""What happened last night is not a true reflection of the Mayhill and Waun Wen community. ""This is a close-knit community where the vast majority of people care about one-another, as the amount of residents helping the council with the clean-up operation today has shown."" Concrete blocks have been placed on the street - but one resident says these were requested in February Despite being a ""lovely"" community, vehicles had been rolled down the hill in a similar fashion ""at least twice"" in the past three years, according to Sam Bennett, a community campaigner from the area. Mr Bennett told Radio Wales residents had written to the council to request concrete blocks on the street back in February. He added residents ""don't have the confidence that something is going to be done anymore and that's why they're choosing to move"". Owen Pillai, who works with young people in Swansea, said ""outrage and disgust"" was an understandable reaction to the ""inexcusable behaviour"" but added he could see why the riot had broken out. He called on authorities to realise ""we all play a part in this"". Mr Pillai told BBC Radio Wales: ""This is the result of decades and decades of a multifaceted undermining of resources, societal breakdown, generations of unemployment - you can't look at it in isolation unfortunately."" The community was thanked for helping those in need during the violence He said it was ""a scientific fact young people want to engage in risky behaviour"", and argued a lack of access to positive activities like sport could lead to problems. Mr Pillai added: ""We need to channel huge amounts of resource into listening, looking at restorative practice, involving these young people rather than just locking them away - they need to confront the reality of what they have done.""

"'Work was my escape from abuse until they fired me'""Eva"" is calling on employers to support victims of domestic abuse rather than punish them.Wales","""Eva"" worked in customer services for a large national retailer A woman who endured years of domestic abuse from her husband ended up being fired after he drugged and locked her in a room to stop her going to work. Eva has called on employers to support to staff who are abuse victims - rather than punish them. ""Work was the only place I was safe,"" Eva, not her real name, told BBC Wales. ""They knew, because sometimes I would turn up with a black eye - I would try to hide it, but colleagues saw it and asked if he did it to me."" She said some colleagues tried to protect her but ""The employer didn't want to deal with things like that - they were too busy, so they just pushed me to the side."" Eva was working in customer services for a large, national retailer, when her husband stopped her turning up for shifts. ""That job was my escape. I could partially be myself - see other people, talk to other people. It was a bit of happiness in my life,"" Eva continued. ""When I returned home happy from work, talking about how much I enjoyed it, he didn't like that. ""He wanted to know when I had break times, and I had to spend them with him."" ""Sometimes he would stay until I finished work."" She explained that in the end every minute of her life was controlled. ""Eva"" said that after her husband stopped her from going to work her employer just said, ""Thank you very much, goodbye"" ""He controlled every phone call, every email. If I didn't give him the password to my phone he threw it at the wall, or out of the window,"" she continued. ""I missed a lot of time off work because I was locked in a room. He controlled my phone and took it from me, so I couldn't even phone work to explain. ""How do you explain a situation like that? In the end my husband didn't let me go and the company just said, 'Thank you very much, goodbye'."" Eva eventually got support from charity Llamau, who have been working with firms to provide training on the best ways to support victims of abuse. Nicola Fitzpatrick, from the charity, said if an employer can get it right ""they are saving someone's life."" ""We had one employer that helped a victim save money, unbeknown to the perpetrator,"" Ms Fitzpatrick said. ""The victim was planning to leave but was completely financially controlled by that perpetrator, so the employer helped them save by deducting money out of their wages and keeping it safe in the workplace, so that when she was ready, she could go."" Domestic abuse an 'epidemic beneath a pandemic' Domestic abusers to be tagged on prison release Could delivery drivers help spot domestic abuse? But she cited another example where a victim told her employer she was at risk because her perpetrator might turn up at work. ""Her employers' response was, 'If you leave, you'll be sacked'."" Eva said she would urge employers to start by simply asking whether staff members are okay. ""Sometimes it's hard to admit what's happening to you. It's embarrassing,"" she said. Ms Fitzpatrick said a lot of businesses ""might notice a significant change in behaviour"" in a member of staff who is suffering domestic abuse. ""They might be more withdrawn, less focused in the workplace, or the complete opposite - they don't want to go home or take their annual leave,"" she said ""But opening up that conversation in a supportive way, rather than somebody thinking they're walking into disciplinary measures, allows you then to start exploring, what is going on for that person."" Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe announced that any of her staff who suffer abuse would get financial support and time off work if they need it Last year, Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe announced financial support for any of her staff needing to escape an abusive relationship, as well as paid leave to deal with emergencies arising from domestic abuse. She's now calling on other public sector employers to do the same. ""I want to see the Welsh government showing some real leadership around this - they've got a real strong track record on it, but let's go that next step further,"" she said. ""Every public sector employer in Wales should be offering the same type of provision that I'm offering for my employees for victims of domestic abuse. ""People don't live their lives in isolation, what happens at home affects their work. ""We've got to be ready to ask those questions sensitively and then we've got to be ready to support them. ""As an employer it's much better for me to have my employees in work feeling safe, feeling supported and doing the best they possibly can. That makes business sense, apart from anything else. ""This isn't a problem that can be passed off to the police to deal with. It's not a problem that can be passed off to A&E to repair wounds. This has to be all of society."" ""We don't like to have awkward conversations. But we need to get over that because an awkward conversation could save someone's life."" The Welsh Government said it already offers ""paid leave for victims of domestic abuse"". ""Our 'Home shouldn't be a place of fear' campaign includes training for employers, offering free e-learning on the signs to look out for and how to offer support,"" added a government spokesperson. ""We actively encourage all public sector organisations in Wales to offer paid leave for victims of domestic abuse.""

Before we go, here is a summary of the stories in the headlines: Earlier today Boris Johnson visited the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier in Portsmouth Boris Johnson is calling for a new international treaty on pandemic preparedness, aimed at tackling not just the current pandemic but any future global threat too. Speaking virtually to the Global Health Summit hosted by Italy and the EU in Rome, the UK prime minister says just as World War Two ""forged global co-operation"" on defence, he hoped to establish a fresh treaty with the World Health Organization that would set out steps every country should take to prevent another deadly outbreak. He says this could include zero-tariffs on important medical equipment and a worldwide network of research hubs ""so we can identify dangerous pathogens likely to jump from animal to human"". ""Now is the time to move away from the temptations of competing nationalism... and instead reassert the power, the duty, the necessity for nations to act together, building collective defence against the common enemy of disease, and protecting all our people for generations to come,"" Johnson says. Johnson also references Homer's Iliad as he draws comparisons between the coronavirus outbreak and the plague in the ancient Greek epic. ""My point is that almost 2,800 years later, the world has been just as disunited, I'm afraid, as Achilles and Agamemnon,"" he says. The business on Bishopthorpe Road was initially ordered to close from 13 to 20 May A barbershop in York that was given fines totalling Â£33,000 has been ordered to close until mid-July unless it can prove it is following Covid safety rules. City of York Council has issued 12 fixed penalty notices to Q Gentlemens Barbers, with the fines not yet paid, the council said. The council action followed complaints from residents about the business not abiding by Covid rules. The local authority initially ordered it to close between 13 and 20 May. Read morehere. The UK's richest man has seen his wealth surge more than Â£7bn during the pandemic. Sir Leonard Blavatnik has topped this year's latest Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of Â£23bn. The Ukranian-born oil and media magnate, who also owns Warner Music, took the title from inventor Sir James Dyson, whose wealth rose by Â£100m to Â£16.3bn, placing him in fourth place. There are now a record 171 billionaires in UK, with their wealth rising 21.7% during the pandemic to Â£597.2bn.

Sturgeon says she knows how unwelcome the news will be - not least because she lives in Glasgow herself - but she hopes it will not be for too much longer. Watch her make the announcement above. Lockdowns have forced people to spend the past year and more learning, working, and socialising online - but in many countries, women have been missing out. They are less likely than men to have access to the internet in nearly every region of the world, according to the latest figures from UN agency the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The so-called digital gender gap is most noticeable in Africa, where the ITU estimates 37% of men have internet access but only 20% of women. Regina Honu, founder of Soronko Academy, a tech school for women and girls in Ghana, says: ""Before Covid, if we put out an invitation for people to sign up, we would have 100 or 200 women. After Covid, we had more than 2,000 women signing up. ""Covid has made people realise that if you don't have digital skills, you're going to be left behind."" Read more here. People aged over 16 who live in North Tyneside will be able get tested for Covid from Saturday as part of a programme to try and stop the spread of the Indian variant. Increased testing - orsurge testingas it's known - will be carried out at units in North Shields and Wallsend for residents who aren't showing symptoms, including those who've had their vaccine. It follows a rise in cases of the so-called Indian variant. Covid-19 cases in the borough have risen from 22 to 53 per 100,000 people in the last week and North Tyneside Council believes the 19 confirmed cases of the variant in the region will increase. Public Health Director Wendy Burke said: ""We will be offering additional testing to identify any further cases of Covid-19 and in particular the variant, so that we can support people to self-isolate and identify their contacts. ""In addition, we will also be making available better accessibility to the vaccination programme and we will be doing more work to try to get those who haven't yet accessed their first dose of vaccine  to come forward. ""What we're trying to do is identify over-50s and those in the 'at risk' category who haven't yet had a first dose."" Nearly 690,000 UK adults received either the first or second dose of a Covid vaccine on Thursday. The latest government data shows 268,251 first doses were given, taking the total number of people to have received their initial jab to 37,518,614. A total of 420,312 people were given a second vaccination, meaning 21,659,783, or 41.1% of adults, have now had both jabs. For context, the highest number of vaccinations given in a single day was the 844,285 administered on 20 March. But yesterday's total was the highest since 24 April. There have been a further 2,829 cases of Covid in the UK, thelatest government figures,externalshow. Another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced. Last Friday there were 2,193 cases and 17 deaths. The decision by the Scottish Government to move Moray to level two restrictions has been described as ""hugely welcome"" by the chief executive of the local council. The area had been kept in level three over concerns about its infection rate but that had dropped in recent days. Roddy Burns says: ""I pay tribute to the community, NHS and council colleagues for their response to the increased and enhanced testing and accelerated vaccination programmes."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who is the MP for Moray, says he was delighted by the announcement, adding: ""We've got to look at what has worked here and in other areas of the country to get any spike in cases down.""

Heathrow's Terminal 5 has signs on seats to enforce social distancing Heathrow Airport says it will open a dedicated arrivals facility for passengers from red-list countries in Terminal 3 from 1 June. The terminal has been closed for the past year, but from that date it will be exclusively used for direct flights from countries deemed to have the highest risk of Covid infection. Passengers on those flights, who have to be British nationals or residents, will have to quarantine in dedicated hotels. Both the government and Heathrow have come under fire in recent days over reports travellers from red list areas were forced to mix with other passengers in immigration halls, where passengers could be waiting for several hours at times. Heathrow says opening the facility will be logistically very challenging, adding that ""our hope is that it will enable Border Force to carry out its duties more efficiently as passenger volumes increase in line with the green list"". Staff and customers at a West Yorkshire pub are marking reopening bycelebrating Christmasfive months late. The Green Dragon in Pontefract put up decorations in December but when tier 3 rules forced the venue to remain closed, the tinsel was left up on the walls. The pub did not reopen when restrictions were first eased, for outdoor drinkers and diners, in April - so regulars were met with baubles and Christmas songs when the doors finally did reopen this Monday. The pub is holding a Christmas party this weekend as well as a New Year's Eve night, with a countdown to midnight and a rendition of Auld Lang Syne. And anyone wearing a Christmas jumper today has been promised a free drink. The Olympic Games will go ahead even if Tokyo remains in a state of emergency due to the pandemic, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee says. Tokyo is one of nine prefectures of Japan to be under emergency measures, which will stay in place until at least 31 May. John Coates, the chair of the IOC's coordination commission, says this will not affect the Games - even if the capital is still under the measures by the time they open on 23 July. ""We've successfully seen five sports hold their test events during the state of emergency,"" he says. ""All of the plans that we have in place to protect the safety and security of athletes and the people of Japan are based around the worst possible circumstances, so the answer (to whether a Games could take place during a state of emergency) is absolutely yes."" The Japanese government has called on Games organisers to further reduce the number of overseas visitors, insisting that only those essential to the operation of the event come into the country. Overseas spectators have already been barred, and a decision on how many - if any - Japanese fans can attend will be taken next month. Wider surge testing has been rolled out in five west London boroughs due to a surge in coronavirus cases linked to the Indian variant. Testing in Ealing, Hillingdon, Brent, Harrow and Hounslow will begin on Monday, the BBC has been told. It wasalready taking placein Hillingdon and Hounslow. The testing will target secondary schools in the five boroughs, with PCR tests also offered to anyone else in the area who does not have any symptoms. Cases of the new variant in west London have increased from 400 to 720. You can read more here. The European Union intends to invest 1bn euros (Â£859m, US$1.2bn) to build Covid vaccine-manufacturing hubs in Africa. It will also donate at least 100 million doses of coronavirus vaccines to low and middle income countries by the end of the year, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, says. She has been speaking at a Covid summit in Rome, where one of the leading vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer/BioNTech, announced it would make two billion doses available at cost to poorer countries over the next 18 months. The partly virtual meeting in the Italian capital wants to coordinate global efforts to combat the pandemic. There is ""very high potential"" for the Indian Covid variant of concern to ""establish community transmission"" in Wales, a top health official has said. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said there was evidence of infections unrelated to travel. But PHW has said most cases are still related to travel or to close contacts of people who have been abroad. If community infections became severe, putting pressure on the NHS, lockdown easing would be reconsidered, he said. Wales currently has a low number of cases of the variant of concern, with atotal of 28 reported on Thursday. Read more here. Case rates across Wales are low, but the dominant variant is still the Kent variant More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 180 countries worldwide. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress. Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but some are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Turkey, Russia and the UK. Very few places have been left untouched. Â© 2025 BBC.

"NI unlikely to go back to full lockdown, says minister","Indoor hospitality can operate from Monday Northern Ireland has likely seen ""the end"" of the most stringent coronavirus restrictions, the finance minister has said. On Thursday, the executive agreed to ease some restrictions, allowing hospitality to operate indoors, and hotels and B&Bs to reopen from Monday. Conor Murphy said he ""sincerely believed"" there would not be a return to full lockdowns. He said even the worst case modelling showed the health service could cope. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered Executive allocates Â£316m to Covid-recovery fund Asked on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster programme if Northern Ireland would see the same scale of regulations brought in again, Mr Murphy said: ""I believe it's the end of the restrictions as we have seen them. ""Even in the modelling we have seen, in the worst case scenario the health service can continue to cope, albeit it needs ongoing support. Conor Murphy says he ""sincerely believes"" Northern Ireland has seen the end of the most stringent restrictions ""Of course we can't, with a huge degree of accuracy, project into the future, we know there are other variants out in the world, we know they are having an impact in other places, we have to continue to protect ourselves and that's why the message remains that Covid is still with us."" However, he said restrictions and mitigation measures would continue for some time. On Thursday, Stormont announced it had allocated Â£316m in pandemic-recovery funding. Mr Murphy said it would take more than reopening to get businesses back on their feet. ""It is going to be a difficult time ahead for business so the executive now is going to focus more on economic recovery rather than businesses that have been closed."" Indoor household visits allowed, with up to six people from no more than two households (this does not include children under 12); Overnight stays permitted; Indoor hospitality allowed with six people allowed to sit together from unlimited households (children under 12 not counted in the six); Hotels, B&Bs and other travel and tourism venues to reopen; Post wedding and civil partnership receptions permitted, with no restriction on top table but restriction of 10 at other tables; Removal of stay local message; Schools can resume extra-curricular activities, with indoor sports and outdoor inter-schools sports allowed; Indoor visitor attractions can reopen with mitigations, including amusement arcades, bingo halls, museums, galleries and cinemas; Libraries can reopen; All outdoor and indoor sport and leisure venues are permitted to open and indoor group exercise and training can resume, including soft play areas, leisure centres, gyms, swimming pools, equestrian centres, venues relating to motor sport and activity centres; Up to 500 spectators allowed at outdoor sport events or gatherings; Increase in number allowed for indoor (non-domestic) gatherings, subject to venue risk assessment. Sinead and Gerard Keenan, who own and manage Dan's Bar in west Belfast,thought they may be forced to sell-up due to lockdown. On Monday, they will reopen with a fresh coat of paint. Pubs that only sell drinks were among the first to close, and the last to reopen. Mrs Keenan told Good Morning Ulster: ""I'm super excited but super nervous. I'm hoping I still remember how to pull the perfect pint."" The Keenans have given their pub a fresh coat of paint ahead of reopening Michael Stewart, from House Hotel in Belfast, said it was not just about money. He said: ""It's been five months since hospitality closed its doors on Christmas Eve and it's been a long five months so it's very, very welcome. ""It's about getting the place back open, getting the tills ringing again but also getting people back into employment."" Kiera Duddy, owner of the Pickled Duck in Londonderry, said that it was ""full steam ahead"" for indoor dining. ""We were ecstatic when we heard the news on Monday that we could open indoors, because our weather here isn't what you would really call Mediterranean. ""The weather this time in May has been unfavourable to us, but we have made good of a bad situation and we've got our wind-breakers on and our gas heaters,"" Ms Duddy told BBC Radio Foyle. Twelve countries are onNorthern Ireland's so-called ""green list"" for foreign travel,external, including Portugal. People going to countries that appear on the green list do not need to quarantine on their return. But those returning from the likes of Portugal will be asked to take a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test for Covid in the days after they arrive home. Twelve countries are on Northern Ireland's so-called ""green list"" for foreign travel, including Portugal Brenda Cassidy runs Paddy's Irish Bar in Albufeira on Portugal's south coast with her husband and son. She told Good Morning Ulster the business may not have survived losing a second holiday season to Covid-19. ""There's an awful lots of places that haven't made it through. If it kept going, there's only so many local people who can keep the local bars going. Maybe some of the bigger bars can afford to close, the small local ones [can't] so we have to have tourism."" England, Scotland and Wales have already implemented similar systems, with the first travellers heading off on holiday earlier this week. People travelling from England who have had both Covid jabs candemonstrate their vaccination,externalstatus via the NHS app or a letter. However,the NHS app,externalthat proves a person is vaccinated so they can travel is incompatible with Northern Ireland's health and social care system, the NI Department of Health (DoH) has confirmed. Speaking at Stormont on Thursday, outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster said the apps in England and Wales did not ""speak to"" the apps in Northern Ireland and Scotland. She said a short-term ""paper trail"" solution was being considered to prove vaccination, adding: ""That is not just a letter but you cannot just turn up with a letter that somebody from your office has typed out for you."" She said work was under way to have all apps in the UK connected. A DoH spokesman said: ""The NHS App uses information from NHS England computer systems. ""It is not directly compatible with NI Health and Social Care systems. Work is currently ongoing across the devolved administrations in regards to vaccine and testing certification, in order to support international travel when restrictions are eased."" DoH has set aside Â£3m in resources and a Â£1.5m capital allocation for Covid status certification, which includes digital ID. A very limited number of countries are set to make NI's green list Non-essential travel from Northern Ireland to other parts of the Common Travel Area (CTA) is to be allowed from Monday and people will not be required to isolate on return if they have visited family or friends in other parts of the area. The CTA is the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man. At Thursday's executive meeting, ministers also backed the attendance of spectators at outdoor sport events - up to 500 may be permitted. Indoor household visits will also be allowed from that date, with six people from two households allowed at one time. Children under 12 do not count towards the total. Overnight stays will also be allowed. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to trade indoors with a maximum of six people per table from a maximum of six households, or up to 10 people provided they are all from the same household. Up to 1,000 fans will be able to attend the Irish Cup Final on Friday Other measures easing from Monday include increased numbers permitted for indoor gatherings - not including domestic settings - to allow for community events such as mother-and-toddler groups to resume. Up to 1,000 fans will also be allowed to attend Friday's Irish Cupfinal at Mourneview Park in Lurgan, County Armagh.

UK set to offer Australia free-trade deal,"Australia's mining industry is a major driver of exports to the UK The UK has offered trade deal terms to Australia under which both countries would phase out taxes on imports over 15 years. The cabinet was reportedly split on what terms to propose, amid concerns UK beef and lamb farmers could be undercut by larger Australian producers. But the dispute was apparently resolved after Boris Johnson pushed for unity. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss formally made the UK offer to her Australian counterpart on Friday. If accepted, it would also lead to quotas - limits - on tax-free trade between the two countries to be phased out. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned that freeing up the UK-Australian trade in meat will lead to hundreds of British cow and sheep breeders going out of business. Why is an Australia trade deal controversial? How many trade deals has the UK done? Ministers are keen to strike as many trade deals as possible following Brexit, and Ms Truss wants one in place with Australia by the time the UK hosts the G7 summit - of leading economies - in June. But she had reportedly been at odds with Environment Secretary George Eustice over the possible impact on farmers of removing import taxes, called tariffs, that are normally paid to the government. With these differences seemingly resolved at a Downing Street meeting chaired by the prime minister on Thursday, Ms Truss put the UK's terms for a deal to Australian counterpart Dan Tehan at an online meeting on Friday. Speaking on a visit to Portsmouth, Mr Johnson said: ""We are certainly looking at doing free trade deals around the world. ""They present a fantastic opportunity for our farmers, for businesses of all kinds, for our manufacturers. We should see these new openings not as threats but as opportunities."" Mr Tehan said he was ""confident"" of reaching an agreement with the UK by early June, having had ""very positive discussions"" with Ms Truss,the news.com.au website,externalreported. Farmers have raised concerns over competition from larger-scale Australian operators In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK wasvalued at Â£20.1bn,,externaland both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably. Currently,metals, wine and machines,externalform the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia'smain UK imports,externalare cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks. Trade in meat between the two countries is small, with 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK and 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia. NFU president Minette Batters said removing tariffs on these products would ""have a massive impact"" on British farms, which would be unable to compete, in terms of scale, with Australia's vast cattle and sheep stations. She added: ""We continue to maintain that a tariff-free trade deal with Australia will jeopardise our own farming industry and will cause the demise of many, many beef and sheep farms throughout the UK. This is true whether tariffs are dropped immediately or in 15 years' time."" The Scottish and Welsh governments have both urged Mr Johnson to ensure UK farmers are not left exposed. And Northern Ireland's agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, said he was ""strongly opposed"" to ending tariffs and quotas. But Conservative MP Neil Parish, chairman of the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, said UK farmers could succeed in the beef market by exporting more ""higher-end"" cuts, such as sirloin, to Australia. A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: ""Any deal we sign with Australia will include protections for the agriculture industry and will not undercut UK farmers or compromise our high standards. ""Typically, any tariff liberalisation is staged over time, with safeguards built in. We will continue to work with the industry, keeping them involved throughout the process and helping it capture the full benefits of trade."" Are you a farmer in the UK?

UK billionaires see jump in wealth during pandemic,"Sir Leonard Blavatnik and wife Emily Appelson at the Grammy Awards in 2018. Sir Leonard Blavatnik has topped the latest Sunday Times Rich List, having seen his fortune swell to Â£23bn. The Ukranian-born oil and media magnate, who also owns Warner Music, saw his wealth surge by Â£7.2bn during the year. He took the title from Sir James Dyson, whose wealth rose by only Â£100m to Â£16.3bn, leaving him in fourth place. There are now a record 171 billionaires in UK, with their wealth rising 21.7% during the pandemic to Â£597.2bn. Mr Blavatnik made his fortune in Russia where he owned stakes worth billions of pounds in companies selling metal and oil. He is a notoriously-private man, and holds both US and UK citizenship. His wealth was boosted by the proceeds of a Â£1.37bn stake in Warner, which he received when it listed on the stock market in the US last year. ""The fact many of the super-rich grew so much wealthier at a time when thousands of us have buried loved ones and millions of us worried for our livelihoods makes this a very unsettling boom,"" said Robert Watts, compiler of the annual index of the country's wealthiest residents. ""The global pandemic created lucrative opportunities for many online retailers, social networking apps and computer games tycoons."" Property investor brothers David and Simon Reuben were in second place after their fortune grew by Â£5.46bn to Â£21.46bn. Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who run the Mumbai-based conglomerate Hinduja Group, took third spot after their wealth rose by Â£1bn. Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, in fifth place, saw the biggest rise in wealth of any billionaire in the past 12 months, with gains of around Â£7.9bn, largely based on the rise in value of his ArcelorMittal steel-making business. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich was in eighth position after his fortune rose by Â£1.9bn to Â£12.1bn. The total of 171 billionairesin the latest Rich List is higher than the previous record of 151 set in 2019,external. The study found the richest 250 people in the UK this year are worth Â£658.1bn, up from Â£565.7bn last year, a rise of 16.3%. There are also more entrepreneurs behind unicorns - start-up businesses with a valuation higher than $1bn - to be found in the Rich List than before. They include Farfetch, the luxury online fashion retailer, whose founder Jose Neves is a new entry at 82 in this year's Rich List with a Â£2bn fortune. Alex Chesterman, founder of online car dealing service Cazoo makes his first appearance at 215th with an estimated worth of Â£750m. ""The valuations of many rich listers' companies have soared over the past year - especially the pack of tech businesses known as unicorns,"" said Mr Watts. ""I worry about the strength of the foundations. No-one wants to see a re-run of the dotcom boom-and-bust of 20 years ago."" The Sunday Times does not just track how much money the mega-wealthy have accumulated each year. It also monitors how much of their fortune they give to charity. Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford became the youngest person ever to top the paper's giving list, which is calculated by ranking the amount donated or raised relative to a person's overall wealth. The 23-year old was behind a high-profile campaign calling for children who are eligible for free school meals to be fed during coronavirus lockdowns. He was estimated to have raised Â£20m to support the scheme, more than the Â£16m he is thought to be worth.

Clothes sales fuel retail boom as shops reopen,"A surge in spending on clothes helped to boost retail sales last month, as lockdown measures eased and non-essential shops reopened. Retail sales jumped 9.2% in April,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external, with sales of clothing soaring by nearly 70% compared with March. Sales overall were more than 10% higher than pre-pandemic levels, although online sales dipped. Economist Paul Dales called the surge in clothing sales ""astonishing"". The Capital Economics chief UK economist said the April data ""showed that households were particularly keen to update their wardrobes"". Further evidence of the rebound in the UK economy came in a separate survey,an IHS/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index,external, which suggested that activity among private business during May has expanded at the fastest pace for more than two decades. Retailers such as clothing and furniture stores, which the government classed as non-essential, reopened to shoppers in England on 12 April after shutting in early January. Aled Jones, head of retail at Lloyds Bank, said: ""Fashion retailers [were] the ultimate beneficiaries of beer gardens reopening and the 'rule of six' night out returning."" Silvia Rindone, EY UK & Ireland retail leader, said April had seen ""significant pent-up consumer demand"". ""With consumers keen to return to the in-store shopping experience and indulge in retail therapy, we saw a sales boost across most categories."" The reopening of non-essential shops led to a boost for many small businesses. Delia Prudence, owner of The Art Room, an art supplies shop in Scarborough, said: ""We were expecting to be busy in April but not that busy. ""The tills were ringing non-stop. One customer even came in with a bottle of Prosecco to celebrate us reopening."" UK inflation rate more than doubles in April UK economy picks up as lockdown restrictions ease Industry body the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that April had given ""a welcome boost for thousands of retailers in England and Wales"" due to pent up demand. ""Improved weather during April meant greater sales of fashion, particularly in outerwear and knitwear, as the public renewed their wardrobe and made plans to meet friends and family outdoors,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. However, she said that while the figures were ""a step in the right direction"", demand ""remains fragile"". ""Footfall is still down by 40% on the pre-pandemic period, and there are still 530,000 people who work in retail still on furlough,"" she said, adding that the end of the full business rates relief in England ""poses a significant threat to retailers"". Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that there were signs that sales might rise further in May. However, he predicted that the recovery in household spending ""will stall as it approaches its pre-Covid level later this year"". The winding-up of the furlough scheme at the end of September is likely to trigger a renewed fall in employment, while rising inflation will push down real wages, he said. In addition, the end of the stamp-duty holiday on 30 September will probably lead to a ""sharp decline"" in housing market activity, leading to less demand for ""big-ticket"" household goods. The latest survey of private sector businesses from IHS Markit/CIPS found the recent rebound continuing strongly as lockdown restrictions are eased. Its ""flash"" - or preliminary - Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 62.0 in May, up from 60.7 in April. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. The figure was the highest since the survey began in January 1998 and reflected ""strong contributions"" from both the manufacturing and services sectors. ""The UK is enjoying an unprecedented growth spurt as the economy reopens,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, ""Factory orders are surging at a record pace as global demand for goods continues to revive, and the service sector is reporting near-record growth as the opening up of the economy allows more businesses to trade."" However, the recent economic rebound has raised fears that inflation could pick up. The PMI survey found that cost pressures were at a 13-year high, leading firms to raise their prices. ""A direct consequence of demand running ahead of supply was a steep rise in prices, hinting strongly that consumer price inflation has much further to rise after lifting to 1.5% in April,"" Mr Williamson said.

Retail sales soar in April as shops reopen,"A surge in spending on clothes helped to boost retail sales last month, as lockdown measures eased and non-essential shops reopened. Retail sales jumped 9.2% in April,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external, with sales of clothing soaring by nearly 70% compared with March. Sales overall were more than 10% higher than pre-pandemic levels, although online sales dipped. Economist Paul Dales called the surge in clothing sales ""astonishing"". The Capital Economics chief UK economist said the April data ""showed that households were particularly keen to update their wardrobes"". Further evidence of the rebound in the UK economy came in a separate survey,an IHS/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index,external, which suggested that activity among private business during May has expanded at the fastest pace for more than two decades. Retailers such as clothing and furniture stores, which the government classed as non-essential, reopened to shoppers in England on 12 April after shutting in early January. Aled Jones, head of retail at Lloyds Bank, said: ""Fashion retailers [were] the ultimate beneficiaries of beer gardens reopening and the 'rule of six' night out returning."" Silvia Rindone, EY UK & Ireland retail leader, said April had seen ""significant pent-up consumer demand"". ""With consumers keen to return to the in-store shopping experience and indulge in retail therapy, we saw a sales boost across most categories."" The reopening of non-essential shops led to a boost for many small businesses.

Before we go, here is a summary of the stories in the headlines: Earlier today Boris Johnson visited the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier in Portsmouth Boris Johnson is calling for a new international treaty on pandemic preparedness, aimed at tackling not just the current pandemic but any future global threat too. Speaking virtually to the Global Health Summit hosted by Italy and the EU in Rome, the UK prime minister says just as World War Two ""forged global co-operation"" on defence, he hoped to establish a fresh treaty with the World Health Organization that would set out steps every country should take to prevent another deadly outbreak. He says this could include zero-tariffs on important medical equipment and a worldwide network of research hubs ""so we can identify dangerous pathogens likely to jump from animal to human"". ""Now is the time to move away from the temptations of competing nationalism... and instead reassert the power, the duty, the necessity for nations to act together, building collective defence against the common enemy of disease, and protecting all our people for generations to come,"" Johnson says. Johnson also references Homer's Iliad as he draws comparisons between the coronavirus outbreak and the plague in the ancient Greek epic. ""My point is that almost 2,800 years later, the world has been just as disunited, I'm afraid, as Achilles and Agamemnon,"" he says. The business on Bishopthorpe Road was initially ordered to close from 13 to 20 May A barbershop in York that was given fines totalling Â£33,000 has been ordered to close until mid-July unless it can prove it is following Covid safety rules. City of York Council has issued 12 fixed penalty notices to Q Gentlemens Barbers, with the fines not yet paid, the council said. The council action followed complaints from residents about the business not abiding by Covid rules. The local authority initially ordered it to close between 13 and 20 May. Read morehere. The UK's richest man has seen his wealth surge more than Â£7bn during the pandemic. Sir Leonard Blavatnik has topped this year's latest Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of Â£23bn. The Ukranian-born oil and media magnate, who also owns Warner Music, took the title from inventor Sir James Dyson, whose wealth rose by Â£100m to Â£16.3bn, placing him in fourth place. There are now a record 171 billionaires in UK, with their wealth rising 21.7% during the pandemic to Â£597.2bn. Property investor brothers David and Simon Reuben were in second place after their fortune grew by Â£5.46bn to Â£21.46bn, and Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who run the Mumbai-based conglomerate Hinduja Group, took third spot after their wealth rose by Â£1bn to Â£17bn. Meanwhile, Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford, 23, became the youngest person ever to top the Sunday Times giving list - calculated by ranking the amount donated or raised relative to a person's overall wealth. His high-profile campaign calling for children who are eligible for free school meals to be fed during coronavirus lockdowns was estimated to have raised Â£20m to support the scheme, more than the Â£16m he is thought to be worth.

Until now, socialising has been restricted to outdoors only It's the first weekend this year that people in England, Wales and Scotland have the chance to socialise indoors, with restrictions having eased on Monday. But what are the new rules? Well, it depends which country you are in. In England, rules include:  And in Scotland, for those in level two or level one areas - which is everywhere other than Glasgow:  While in Wales: Read more here. Guernsey has announced it will return to normal travel with the UK, Jersey, Isle of Man and Republic of Ireland from 1 July. For arrivals coming from within those four Common Travel Area destinations. there will be no testing or self-isolation requirement, the States of Guernsey says. It comes as part of a transition to atraffic light system of travel, which is largely based on the UK system of categorising countries according to their infection rates. However, the States emphasised they are continuing to monitor the global coronavirus situation and might amend the timing of introducing the relaxed system. Read more here. This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: 'We haven't turned the corner in Glasgow yet' First Minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier confirmed Glasgow is remaining in level three coronavirus restrictions. Sturgeon says she knows how unwelcome the news will be - not least because she lives in Glasgow herself - but she hopes it will not be for too much longer. Watch her make the announcement above. Lockdowns have forced people to spend the past year and more learning, working, and socialising online - but in many countries, women have been missing out. They are less likely than men to have access to the internet in nearly every region of the world, according to the latest figures from UN agency the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The so-called digital gender gap is most noticeable in Africa, where the ITU estimates 37% of men have internet access but only 20% of women. Regina Honu, founder of Soronko Academy, a tech school for women and girls in Ghana, says: ""Before Covid, if we put out an invitation for people to sign up, we would have 100 or 200 women. After Covid, we had more than 2,000 women signing up. ""Covid has made people realise that if you don't have digital skills, you're going to be left behind."" Read more here. People aged over 16 who live in North Tyneside will be able get tested for Covid from Saturday as part of a programme to try and stop the spread of the Indian variant. Increased testing - orsurge testingas it's known - will be carried out at units in North Shields and Wallsend for residents who aren't showing symptoms, including those who've had their vaccine. It follows a rise in cases of the so-called Indian variant. Covid-19 cases in the borough have risen from 22 to 53 per 100,000 people in the last week and North Tyneside Council believes the 19 confirmed cases of the variant in the region will increase. Public Health Director Wendy Burke said: ""We will be offering additional testing to identify any further cases of Covid-19 and in particular the variant, so that we can support people to self-isolate and identify their contacts. ""In addition, we will also be making available better accessibility to the vaccination programme and we will be doing more work to try to get those who haven't yet accessed their first dose of vaccine  to come forward. ""What we're trying to do is identify over-50s and those in the 'at risk' category who haven't yet had a first dose."" Nearly 690,000 UK adults received either the first or second dose of a Covid vaccine on Thursday. The latest government data shows 268,251 first doses were given, taking the total number of people to have received their initial jab to 37,518,614. A total of 420,312 people were given a second vaccination, meaning 21,659,783, or 41.1% of adults, have now had both jabs. For context, the highest number of vaccinations given in a single day was the 844,285 administered on 20 March. But yesterday's total was the highest since 24 April. There have been a further 2,829 cases of Covid in the UK, thelatest government figures,externalshow. Another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced. Last Friday there were 2,193 cases and 17 deaths. The decision by the Scottish Government to move Moray to level two restrictions has been described as ""hugely welcome"" by the chief executive of the local council. The area had been kept in level three over concerns about its infection rate but that had dropped in recent days. Roddy Burns says: ""I pay tribute to the community, NHS and council colleagues for their response to the increased and enhanced testing and accelerated vaccination programmes."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who is the MP for Moray, says he was delighted by the announcement, adding: ""We've got to look at what has worked here and in other areas of the country to get any spike in cases down."" Read more about the situation with cases in Scotland here. Heathrow's Terminal 5 has signs on seats to enforce social distancing Heathrow Airport says it will open a dedicated arrivals facility for passengers from red-list countries in Terminal 3 from 1 June. The terminal has been closed for the past year, but from that date it will be exclusively used for direct flights from countries deemed to have the highest risk of Covid infection. Passengers on those flights, who have to be British nationals or residents, will have to quarantine in dedicated hotels. Both the government and Heathrow have come under fire in recent days over reports travellers from red list areas were forced to mix with other passengers in immigration halls, where passengers could be waiting for several hours at times. Heathrow says opening the facility will be logistically very challenging, adding that ""our hope is that it will enable Border Force to carry out its duties more efficiently as passenger volumes increase in line with the green list"". Staff and customers at a West Yorkshire pub are marking reopening bycelebrating Christmasfive months late. The Green Dragon in Pontefract put up decorations in December but when tier 3 rules forced the venue to remain closed, the tinsel was left up on the walls. The pub did not reopen when restrictions were first eased, for outdoor drinkers and diners, in April - so regulars were met with baubles and Christmas songs when the doors finally did reopen this Monday. The pub is holding a Christmas party this weekend as well as a New Year's Eve night, with a countdown to midnight and a rendition of Auld Lang Syne. And anyone wearing a Christmas jumper today has been promised a free drink. The Olympic Games will go ahead even if Tokyo remains in a state of emergency due to the pandemic, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee says. Tokyo is one of nine prefectures of Japan to be under emergency measures, which will stay in place until at least 31 May. John Coates, the chair of the IOC's coordination commission, says this will not affect the Games - even if the capital is still under the measures by the time they open on 23 July. ""We've successfully seen five sports hold their test events during the state of emergency,"" he says. ""All of the plans that we have in place to protect the safety and security of athletes and the people of Japan are based around the worst possible circumstances, so the answer (to whether a Games could take place during a state of emergency) is absolutely yes."" The Japanese government has called on Games organisers to further reduce the number of overseas visitors, insisting that only those essential to the operation of the event come into the country. Overseas spectators have already been barred, and a decision on how many - if any - Japanese fans can attend will be taken next month. Wider surge testing has been rolled out in five west London boroughs due to a surge in coronavirus cases linked to the Indian variant. Testing in Ealing, Hillingdon, Brent, Harrow and Hounslow will begin on Monday, the BBC has been told. It wasalready taking placein Hillingdon and Hounslow. The testing will target secondary schools in the five boroughs, with PCR tests also offered to anyone else in the area who does not have any symptoms. Cases of the new variant in west London have increased from 400 to 720. You can read more here. The European Union intends to invest 1bn euros (Â£859m, US$1.2bn) to build Covid vaccine-manufacturing hubs in Africa. It will also donate at least 100 million doses of coronavirus vaccines to low and middle income countries by the end of the year, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, says. She has been speaking at a Covid summit in Rome, where one of the leading vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer/BioNTech, announced it would make two billion doses available at cost to poorer countries over the next 18 months. The partly virtual meeting in the Italian capital wants to coordinate global efforts to combat the pandemic. There is ""very high potential"" for the Indian Covid variant of concern to ""establish community transmission"" in Wales, a top health official has said. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said there was evidence of infections unrelated to travel. But PHW has said most cases are still related to travel or to close contacts of people who have been abroad. If community infections became severe, putting pressure on the NHS, lockdown easing would be reconsidered, he said. Wales currently has a low number of cases of the variant of concern, with atotal of 28 reported on Thursday. Read more here. Case rates across Wales are low, but the dominant variant is still the Kent variant More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 180 countries worldwide. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress. Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but some are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Turkey, Russia and the UK. Very few places have been left untouched. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Higher plastic bag charge comes into forceSingle-use plastic carrier bags in English shops now cost 10p, twice the previous price.Business","The cost of a single-use plastic carrier bag in English shops has gone up from 5p to 10p. All stores, big and small, have to apply the charge from Friday. Until now, smaller retailers were exempt. The original 5p levy was introduced in England in 2015. Since then, the use of the bags has declined by more than 95%. Campaign group Friends of the Earth urged the government to go even further, saying the bags were part of a bigger plastic problem. The group welcomed the scheme, but said it still had ""significant shortcomings"". Campaigners said the charge should be extended to paper carrier bags, while so-called ""bags for life"", which are designed to be reused but contain greater amounts of plastic, were posing a ""growing problem"". Co-op to scrap plastic 'bags for life' Morrisons to stop selling plastic carrier bags Plastic or paper: Which bag is greener? ""It seems that many plastic 'bags for life' are being used just once and not reused for the bag's lifetime, as is their purpose,"" said the group's plastics campaigner, Camilla Zerr. ""If ministers want to get to the root of this problem, they need to take a tougher stand against all single-use plastics."" The environmental group's warning has already been heeded by supermarkets including Morrisons and the Co-op, which have discontinued the sale of plastic bags for life. Friends of the Earth said the government's forthcoming Environment Bill should include ""legally binding targets"" to phase out the use of all unnecessary single-use plastic products. This video can not be played Family of the inventor of the plastic carrier bag says they were supposed to help protect the planet The average person in England now buys just four single-use carrier bags a year from the main supermarkets, compared with 140 in 2014. By extending the charge to all retailers, the government hopes the use of single-use carrier bags will fall by 70-80% in small and medium-sized businesses. Environment minister Rebecca Pow said: ""Everyone wants to play their part in reducing the scourge of plastic waste that blights our environment and oceans. ""The 5p bag charge has been hugely successful, but we can go further."" She added that the new higher charge in England would ""support the ambitious action"" the UK has already taken in its fight against plastic, ""as we build back greener"".

The so-called digital gender gap is most noticeable in Africa, where the ITU estimates 37% of men have internet access but only 20% of women. Regina Honu, founder of Soronko Academy, a tech school for women and girls in Ghana, says: ""Before Covid, if we put out an invitation for people to sign up, we would have 100 or 200 women. After Covid, we had more than 2,000 women signing up. ""Covid has made people realise that if you don't have digital skills, you're going to be left behind."" Read more here. People aged over 16 who live in North Tyneside will be able get tested for Covid from Saturday as part of a programme to try and stop the spread of the Indian variant. Increased testing - orsurge testingas it's known - will be carried out at units in North Shields and Wallsend for residents who aren't showing symptoms, including those who've had their vaccine. It follows a rise in cases of the so-called Indian variant. Covid-19 cases in the borough have risen from 22 to 53 per 100,000 people in the last week and North Tyneside Council believes the 19 confirmed cases of the variant in the region will increase. Public Health Director Wendy Burke said: ""We will be offering additional testing to identify any further cases of Covid-19 and in particular the variant, so that we can support people to self-isolate and identify their contacts. ""In addition, we will also be making available better accessibility to the vaccination programme and we will be doing more work to try to get those who haven't yet accessed their first dose of vaccine  to come forward. ""What we're trying to do is identify over-50s and those in the 'at risk' category who haven't yet had a first dose."" Nearly 690,000 UK adults received either the first or second dose of a Covid vaccine on Thursday. The latest government data shows 268,251 first doses were given, taking the total number of people to have received their initial jab to 37,518,614. A total of 420,312 people were given a second vaccination, meaning 21,659,783, or 41.1% of adults, have now had both jabs. For context, the highest number of vaccinations given in a single day was the 844,285 administered on 20 March. But yesterday's total was the highest since 24 April. There have been a further 2,829 cases of Covid in the UK, thelatest government figures,externalshow. Another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced. Last Friday there were 2,193 cases and 17 deaths. The decision by the Scottish Government to move Moray to level two restrictions has been described as ""hugely welcome"" by the chief executive of the local council. The area had been kept in level three over concerns about its infection rate but that had dropped in recent days. Roddy Burns says: ""I pay tribute to the community, NHS and council colleagues for their response to the increased and enhanced testing and accelerated vaccination programmes."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who is the MP for Moray, says he was delighted by the announcement, adding: ""We've got to look at what has worked here and in other areas of the country to get any spike in cases down.""

Heathrow's Terminal 5 has signs on seats to enforce social distancing Heathrow Airport says it will open a dedicated arrivals facility for passengers from red-list countries in Terminal 3 from 1 June. The terminal has been closed for the past year, but from that date it will be exclusively used for direct flights from countries deemed to have the highest risk of Covid infection. Passengers on those flights, who have to be British nationals or residents, will have to quarantine in dedicated hotels. Both the government and Heathrow have come under fire in recent days over reports travellers from red list areas were forced to mix with other passengers in immigration halls, where passengers could be waiting for several hours at times. Heathrow says opening the facility will be logistically very challenging, adding that ""our hope is that it will enable Border Force to carry out its duties more efficiently as passenger volumes increase in line with the green list"". Staff and customers at a West Yorkshire pub are marking reopening bycelebrating Christmasfive months late. The Green Dragon in Pontefract put up decorations in December but when tier 3 rules forced the venue to remain closed, the tinsel was left up on the walls. The pub did not reopen when restrictions were first eased, for outdoor drinkers and diners, in April - so regulars were met with baubles and Christmas songs when the doors finally did reopen this Monday. The pub is holding a Christmas party this weekend as well as a New Year's Eve night, with a countdown to midnight and a rendition of Auld Lang Syne. And anyone wearing a Christmas jumper today has been promised a free drink. The Olympic Games will go ahead even if Tokyo remains in a state of emergency due to the pandemic, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee says. Tokyo is one of nine prefectures of Japan to be under emergency measures, which will stay in place until at least 31 May. John Coates, the chair of the IOC's coordination commission, says this will not affect the Games - even if the capital is still under the measures by the time they open on 23 July. ""We've successfully seen five sports hold their test events during the state of emergency,"" he says. ""All of the plans that we have in place to protect the safety and security of athletes and the people of Japan are based around the worst possible circumstances, so the answer (to whether a Games could take place during a state of emergency) is absolutely yes."" The Japanese government has called on Games organisers to further reduce the number of overseas visitors, insisting that only those essential to the operation of the event come into the country. Overseas spectators have already been barred, and a decision on how many - if any - Japanese fans can attend will be taken next month. Wider surge testing has been rolled out in five west London boroughs due to a surge in coronavirus cases linked to the Indian variant. Testing in Ealing, Hillingdon, Brent, Harrow and Hounslow will begin on Monday, the BBC has been told. It wasalready taking placein Hillingdon and Hounslow. The testing will target secondary schools in the five boroughs, with PCR tests also offered to anyone else in the area who does not have any symptoms. Cases of the new variant in west London have increased from 400 to 720. You can read more here. The European Union intends to invest 1bn euros (Â£859m, US$1.2bn) to build Covid vaccine-manufacturing hubs in Africa. It will also donate at least 100 million doses of coronavirus vaccines to low and middle income countries by the end of the year, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, says. She has been speaking at a Covid summit in Rome, where one of the leading vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer/BioNTech, announced it would make two billion doses available at cost to poorer countries over the next 18 months. The partly virtual meeting in the Italian capital wants to coordinate global efforts to combat the pandemic. There is ""very high potential"" for the Indian Covid variant of concern to ""establish community transmission"" in Wales, a top health official has said. Dr Giri Shankar, from Public Health Wales, said there was evidence of infections unrelated to travel. But PHW has said most cases are still related to travel or to close contacts of people who have been abroad. If community infections became severe, putting pressure on the NHS, lockdown easing would be reconsidered, he said. Wales currently has a low number of cases of the variant of concern, with atotal of 28 reported on Thursday. Read more here. Case rates across Wales are low, but the dominant variant is still the Kent variant More than 1.5 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 180 countries worldwide. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress. Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but some are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Turkey, Russia and the UK. Very few places have been left untouched. Â© 2025 BBC.

Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire comes into effectThe ceasefire brings to an end 11 days of fighting in which more than 240 people were killed.,"This video can not be played Further clashes in Jerusalem after ceasefire A ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip appeared to be holding hours after coming into effect. It began early on Friday, bringing to an end 11 days of fighting in which more than 250 people were killed, most of them in Gaza. Both Israel and Hamas claimed victory in the conflict. Fresh clashes broke out at the al-Aqsa mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem on Friday, testing the truce. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP news agency that Palestinians had thrown rocks and petrol bombs at officers, and that ""riot"" suppressing measures had been taken in response. But the ceasefire seemed to be holding on Friday night. Israel has temporarily opened a crossing into Gaza, allowing food, fuel and medicine into the territory. The country has also lifted emergency restrictions inside its own borders. In pictures: The destruction in Gaza and Israel The fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza began on 10 May after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at al-Aqsa, located at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. At least 243 people, including more than 100 women and children, were killed in Gaza, according to its health ministry. Israel has said it killed at least 225 militants during the fighting. Hamas has not given casualty figures for fighters. In Israel 12 people, including two children, were killed, its medical service says. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained Life in the Gaza Strip The Israeli military says more than 4,300 rockets were fired towards its territory by militants and that it struck more than 1,000 militant targets in Gaza. An Israeli man inspects damage in the kitchen of his house A mother and son embrace in their ruined home in Beit Hanoun, Gaza Gaza's streets are bursting back into life with the truce only hours old. It's the first time in nearly a fortnight people have been able to go outside in relative safety. Entire families step over rubble and children tiptoe through smashed glass. They look up at wrecked buildings but seem to take it in their stride. Perhaps seeing the aftermath is easy compared with the terrifying experience of living through the airstrikes themselves. On one street in the heart of downtown Gaza City is the remnants of al-Sharouq building. Its name means sunrise. It lies in charred ruins. The block was the third high-rise bombed by Israel which said militants used it. A car drives past and a child in a keffiyeh - a Palestinian headscarf - stands out of the sunroof with his fingers in a victory sign. Hamas is hailing its ""defence of Jerusalem"".  Israel says its airstrikes have set the group back strategically.  People here are welcoming calm, but know it probably just means a countdown to the next inevitable conflict. The Israeli Political Security Cabinet said on Thursday night it had ""unanimously accepted the recommendation"" for a ceasefire. ""The political leaders emphasised that the reality on the ground will determine the future of the campaign,"" it said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced criticism from some in Israel who said he had halted the conflict too soon. The mayors of Sderot and Ashkelon - two of the Israeli towns hardest hit by rockets from Gaza - were among those to voice their disappointment, saying Hamas should have been eliminated. At a news conference on Friday, the prime minister said Israel had ""exacted a heavy price from Hamas"". ""Not everything is known to the public yet, nor to Hamas, but the full range of achievements will be revealed over time,"" he said. The children who have died in the conflict Why is Gaza blurry on Google Maps? A Hamas official told the Associated Press news agency the ceasefire announced by Israel amounted to a ""victory"" for the Palestinian people. This view was shared by people celebrating on the streets of Gaza. ""This is the day of victory, the day of freedom, and it is the most beautiful day that we've experienced,"" one said. This video can not be played Palestinians took to the streets to celebrate the ceasefire Top Hamas political leader Ismail Haniya told reporters on Friday that the fighting had ""defeated the illusions of negotiations, and described resistance as the ""best strategic choice for liberation"". ""We, as a movement and movement's leadership, with all our people and the good people of this nation and the world, will rebuild Gaza,"" he added. Basem Naim, from the Hamas Council on International Relations, told the BBC he was sceptical about whether the truce would last ""without justice for Palestinians, without stopping the Israeli aggression and Israeli atrocities"". A member of Hamas's political bureau, Izzat al-Reshiq, issued a warning to Israel. ""It's true that the battle ends today but Netanyahu and the whole world should know that our finger is on the trigger and we will continue to ramp up the capabilities of this resistance,"" he told Reuters. President Joe Biden said the ceasefire had brought a ""genuine opportunity"" for progress, and commended Mr Netanyahu in a phone call after the agreement was announced. He said the US - Israel's closest and most important ally - fully supported the country's ""right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks"". Anthony Zurcher: The Democrats' 'tectonic' shift on the conflict He also praised Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi for brokering the ceasefire, before turning to the human cost of the conflict. ""I send my sincere condolences to all the families, Israeli and Palestinian, who have lost loved ones and my hope for a full recovery for the wounded,"" he said. The president said the US remained committed to working with the UN in providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza and in reconstruction efforts in the enclave. He added that this would be done ""in full partnership"" with the Palestinian Authority, which is run by Hamas's rival, Mahmoud Abbas, and based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Egypt's president said he had received a phone call from Mr Biden with ""utter happiness"", adding that they had ""exchanged visions around reaching a formula that would calm the current conflict between Israel and Gaza"". British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also welcomed the ceasefire, but said both sides must now find a ""durable solution"" to the conflict. The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

A traffic light system for foreign travel will also take effect from then, subject to ministerial approval. Twelve countries are onNorthern Ireland's so-called ""green list"" for foreign travel,external. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill confirmed on Thursday that Portugal is among those countries. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered People going to countries that appear on the green list do not need to quarantine on their return. But those returning from the likes of Portugal will be asked to take a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test for Covid in the days after they arrive home. Indoor household visits allowed, with up to six people from no more than two households (this does not include children under 12); Overnight stays permitted; Indoor hospitality allowed with six people allowed to sit together from unlimited households (children under 12 not counted in the six); Hotels, B&Bs and other travel and tourism venues to reopen; Post wedding and civil partnership receptions permitted, with no restriction on top table but restriction of 10 at other tables; Removal of stay local message; Schools can resume extra-curricular activities, with indoor sports and outdoor inter-schools sports allowed; Indoor visitor attractions can reopen with mitigations, including amusement arcades, bingo halls, museums, galleries and cinemas; Libraries can reopen; All outdoor and indoor sport and leisure venues are permitted to open and indoor group exercise and training can resume, including soft play areas, leisure centres, gyms, swimming pools, equestrian centres, venues relating to motor sport and activity centres; Up to 500 spectators allowed at outdoor sport events or gatherings; Increase in number allowed for indoor (non-domestic) gatherings, subject to venue risk assessment. England, Scotland and Wales have already implemented similar systems, with the first travellers heading off on holiday earlier this week. It is understood that Stormont health officials had recommended Portugal should be on Northern Ireland's amber list, which would still require people to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival in Northern Ireland. At present, the executive's advice is that people should only travel to or outside of Northern Ireland for essential purposes. If returning from a country on the UK's red list, passengers must book and enter hotel quarantine. A very limited number of countries are set to make NI's green list International travellers visiting or returning to Northern Ireland must also currently provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test result, provide journey and contact details and also isolate for 10 days. It is all systems go for Monday, when we'll take some of our biggest steps yet back to normality. Stormont ministers are allowing pubs and restaurants to trade indoors again - a move that couldn't come soon enough given the recent bad weather. While there's a further unlocking of the local economy, just as important are the relaxations to help reunite families and friends who have faced many months with severely limited social contact. People also keen on a holiday can now start planning for this, albeit the so-called green list is limited and anyone hoping to head abroad will face higher costs and extra paperwork. Things have been rolling steadily for some time. Now it appears the executive is preparing to take off its stabilisers and speed up our journey out of lockdown. Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster, who attended the executive meeting virtually from London as she had been meeting Boris Johnson, said it was great news for the economy. ""Now is a time to look ahead and to enjoy these hard won freedoms safely,"" Mrs Foster said. ""We must continue to do all we can as a community to keep ourselves and each other safe and I appeal to everyone to be cautious to help ensure we can keep heading in the right direction."" Ms O'Neill said the moves were another positive step but she urged caution. ""I'd remind people to still be careful, be cautious, because we do have the new variants that are there, but we need to keep going steady as we go and follow the public health advice,"" Ms O'Neill said. The deputy first minister accepted that some people would be disappointed that certain countries had not made it on to the green list. ""This is about trying to keep the virus under control,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""We've got to such a good point, the community transmission is low, but there's a real danger and a real threat being posed by new variants, in particular the Indian variant,"" Ms O'Neill added. ""So we're watching that very carefully. We're in a good place right now, there isn't widespread community transmission, but the health advice is very clear in saying it's a matter of when, not if. So we have to bear that in mind in terms of the limitations of travel."" Non-essential travel from Northern Ireland to other parts of the Common Travel Area (CTA) is to be allowed from Monday and people will not be required to isolate on return if they have visited family or friends in other parts of the area. The CTA is the UK, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and Isle of Man. At Thursday's executive meeting, ministers backed the reopening of hotels and B&Bs from Monday and the attendance of spectators at outdoor sport events - up to 500 may be permitted. Indoor household visits will also be allowed from that date, with six people from two households allowed at one time. Children under 12 do not count towards the total. Overnight stays will also be allowed. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to trade indoors with a maximum of six people per table from a maximum of six households, or up to 10 people provided they are all from the same household. Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said the announcement will ""bring back hope to businesses"". ""As we now look towards Monday's reopening, the health and wellbeing of customers, staff and the wider public will be the priority for all the hospitality sector business owners,"" he said. Londonderry Chamber president Dawn McLaughlin said businesses ""can now begin to look towards the busy summer period and our economic recovery"". But she added there was some ""ambiguity and grey areas"" within the hospitality industry over ""what is exactly required of them to reopen, especially in the absence of any published regulations or guidelines yet"". Up to 1,000 fans will be able to attend the Irish Cup Final on Friday Other measures easing from Monday include increased numbers permitted for indoor gatherings - not including domestic settings - to allow for community events such as mother-and-toddler groups to resume. Up to 1,000 fans will also be allowed to attend Friday's Irish Cupfinal at Mourneview Park in Lurgan, County Armagh. But spectators will not be allowed back for Derry City's game against St Patrick's Athletic on Monday night. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The child victims of the conflict,"At least 63 children are said to have been killed in Gaza, and two have been killed in Israel Of the 219 people who have been killed in Gaza, at least 63 are children, according to its health ministry. Of the 10 people killed in Israel, two children are among the dead, the country's medical service says. Here are the stories of some of the children who have been killed. Nine-year-old Yara (left) and five-year-old Rula (right) were killed alongside several family members on Sunday When an Israeli strike hit al-Wihda street in central Gaza City early on Sunday, at least 13 members of the extended al-Kawalek family are believed to have been killed, buried in the rubble of their own home. Many of the victims were children, with one said to be as young as six months. ""We saw nothing but smoke,"" one of the surviving members of the family, Sanaa al-Kawalek, told Felesteen Online. ""I couldn't see my son next to me and I was hugging him, but I could see nothing."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the bombing as ""abnormal"" and said the civilian casualties were unintended. A spokesman said air strikes had caused a tunnel to collapse, bringing houses down with it. Among those killed were sisters Yara, 9, and Rula, 5. Both had been receiving treatment for trauma from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). The al-Kawaleks were polite girls who always did their homework on time, one of their teachers, who did not want be named, told the BBC. A picture circulating online is said to show 10-year-old Aziz al-Kawalek, the only surviving member of his direct family, sitting by his mother's body. Allow Twitter content?

Ido Avigal, five, who was killed in a Hamas rocket attack The youngest victim on the Israeli side is thought to be Ido Avigal, a five-year-old boy killed last Wednesday in the southern town of Sderot. Ido was killed inside a fortified room in what the Israeli military described as an ""incredibly rare"" incident. His mother grabbed him and took him to the fortified room when incoming rocket sirens sounded on Wednesday evening in Sderot, the Times of Israel reports. Rocket shrapnel pierced the protective metal plating used to cover the window of the room he was in, also injuring his mother and seven-year-old sister. He died of his injuries several hours later. ""It was a piece of the rocket that came in at a very specific angle, at a very specific speed and at a very specific point,""IDF spokesman Hidai Zilberman said of the incident,external. ""We were at home and the kids were a little bored, so my wife Shani went with them to her sister's house two buildings over,"" Ido's father, Asaf Avigal, told Channel 13. ""I'm sorry I did not take the shrapnel in your place,""Mr Avigal said at his son's funeral,external. ""A few days ago, you asked me: 'Dad, what will happen if the siren goes off while we are outdoors?' I told you that so long as you were with me you would be protected. I lied."" A few months ago,Mr Avigal and his wife had spoken,externalabout what an especially bright child Ido was, as if he was a 50-year-old in the body of a five-year-old.  He would often urge his father to leave the computer and spend more time with him. ""Enough with the screens - be with me,"" he would say. Ido's mother remains in hospital. Allow Twitter content?

Nadine Awad, a 16-year-old Arab-Israeli schoolgirl, was with her 52-year-old father in the early hours of last Wednesday, when a rocket struck their car and home, killing them both. Her mother, who was also in the car, was seriously injured, medics said. Nadine's cousin, Ahmad Ismail, says he heard the sound of a rocket hitting from inside the family home, in the city of Lod, close to Tel Aviv, where Arab and Jewish Israelis live together. ""It happened so quickly,"" he told the public broadcaster Kan. ""Even if we had wanted to run somewhere, we don't have a safe room."" Nadine was a ""very special girl"" in her first year of high school, who dreamed of becoming a doctor, those who knew her said. Her school principal said she ""had dreams of changing the world"". ""She was such a special girl, such a talented girl. She wanted to conquer the world,"" Shirin Natur Hafi told local radio,the Times of Israel reports,external. Nadine had been involved in a number of science-related and social projects with Jewish schools in the area, and she had planned to participate in a biomedical studies programme, Ms Hafi said. Baby Omar was the only one of his family to survive in the strike that killed his mother and siblings On Friday, Muhammad al-Hadidi's four children - Suhayb, 13, Yahya, 11, Abderrahman, eight, and Osama, six - put on their finest clothes and went to visit their cousins nearby, in the Shati refugee camp outside Gaza City, to celebrate Eid, which marks the end of Ramadan. ""The kids put on their Eid clothes, took their toys and headed off to their uncle's house to celebrate,"" their 37-year-old father told reporters. ""They called in the evening to beg to stay the night and I said OK."" The next day, the building where they had been staying was hit. Only their five-month-old baby brother, Omar, survived, after being dragged from the rubble where he lay next to his dead mother. ""They were safe in their homes, they did not carry weapons, they did not fire rockets,"" Mr Hadidi said of his children. ""What did they do to deserve this? We're civilians."" Amid the wreckage,externalwere children's toys, a Monopoly board game and, sitting on the kitchen counter, unfinished plates of food from the holiday gathering. ""When my children went to sleep, they were hoping that when they woke up it would all be over. But they are gone now.

McIlroy falters on Kiawah Island return,"Rory McIlroy won the second of his four majors at Kiawah Island in 2012 US PGA Championship first-round leaderboard -5C Conners (Can);-3B Koepka (US), K Bradley (US), V Hovland (Nor), A Wise (US), S Horsfield (Eng), C Davis (Aus);-2C Morikawa (US), M Laird (Sco), C Tringale (US) Selected others: -1P Casey (Eng), P Harrington (Ire), R Fowler (US), T Hatton (Eng), T Lewis (Eng);LevelB DeChambeau (US), J Rose (Eng);+1L Westwood (Eng), J Spieth (US);+3R McIlroy (NI) Rory McIlroy faltered on his return to Kiawah Island's Ocean Course as Corey Conners moved into a two-shot lead on day one of the US PGA Championship. McIlroy won the last time the event was staged at the South Carolina venue in 2012 but signed for a three-over 75. Canadian Conners edged clear at the top with an impressive five-under-par 67. England's Sam Horsfield and former world number one Brooks Koepka are part of a six-strong chasing pack who sit two off the 29-year-old's early pace. Norway's Viktor Hovland, Australia's Cam Davis and Americans Keegan Bradley and Aaron Wise are also at three under. Scotland's Martin Laird, one of the early starters, held top spot heading to the 17th tee but carded successive bogeys and sits one further back. Defending champion Collin Morikawa looked set to join the group on three under but bogeyed his final hole to also finish at two under on a breezy opening day. Relive day one of the PGA Championship Round two tee times Conners' best major finish before this year was joint 64th at the 2019 PGA Championship, but he finished in a share of eighth at the Masters last month and now leads at Kiawah Island. The world number 39 was three under through seven and he atoned for his only bogey of the day at nine with a birdie at 11 and then emerged from the group gathered at three under par with successive birdies on the 15th and 16th holes. Horsfield, making his debut at the tournament, is within touching distance after a 69 that featured five birdies and two bogeys. ""To be playing well in a major is fun, it's a new thing for me, to play against the best guys in the world is the best thing you can do,"" said the 24-year-old, who also watched a birdie putt on the last lip out. Alongside the Englishman is Koepka, who said before the tournament he was up to six months away from full fitness following surgery on 16 March to deal with a knee cap dislocation and ligament damage. That appeared to ring true as the four-time major champion made a double-bogey start, but he immediately pulled one of those shots back and further birdies either side of a bogey saw the American hit the turn at level par. The 2018 and 2019 winner added three birdies on his back nine to join 23-year-old Hovland, who cancelled out an opening bogey with a birdie on the second before adding three more in a terrific round, in the early clubhouse lead. Another former champion Bradley claimed his only major at the PGA Championship a decade ago and had just one bogey on a card that included four birdies as he signed for a 69. Sam Horsfield's three previous major appearances all came at the US Open Scotland's Laird strung together four successive birdies to lead at four under par with two to play, but back-to-back bogeys saw the 38-year-old head into the clubhouse at two under. Paul Casey was also piecing together a promising round as he moved to three under but the Englishman was pegged back by a bogey-bogey finish to end the day one under par. ""I'd have taken one under at the start of the day because this is one of the most difficult golf courses I have ever played. It has my respect,"" said Casey. ""They are one of the best [putting] surfaces we have experienced in major championship golf, they are incredibly true. The ball does not deviate, they barely leave a mark."" Compatriot Tyrrell Hatton birdied his final hole, the ninth, to also finish at one under after a round that included four birdies and three bogeys, alongside Tom Lewis. Lee Westwood would have joined them but for a double bogey on the notoriously tricky 223-yard par three 17th, which left the 48-year-old at one over instead. Justin Rose had a costly double bogey at 15, his only dropped shots of the day, to finish at level par, while Ian Poulter was two under through seven before a run of five dropped shots in five holes eventually saw the Englishman sign for a two-over 74. Tommy Fleetwood had a triple bogey on the 15th and a bogey-bogey finish as he ended four over. Northern Ireland's McIlroy started with a bogey at the 10th after leaking his opening drive into water but followed that with successive birdies, and was unlucky to see an eagle putt lip out. He hit the turn at level par after another dropped shot on the 608-yard par-five 16th. McIlroy won here the last time Kiawah Island hosted the event but said he did not feel that would give him an advantage nine years on. He did arrive in South Carolina as the favourite, however, after ending a 19-month winless streak with victory at Quail Hollow two weeks ago and having seemingly corrected his swing troubles after recruiting coach Pete Cowen. Back-to-back bogeys followed after the turn and another at five, his 14th, saw the 32-year-old slide to three over par before sinking a 12-foot birdie putt on the next. But there was further trouble for McIlroy when his drive on the par-five sixth found a tuft of long grass in one of the wasteland areas to the left and that resulted in another dropped shot as he signed for a 75. Bryson DeChambeau won the US Open at Winged Foot last year Big-hitting US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who said he planned to ""unleash the beast"" in a bid to tame the longest course in major championship history, stuttered to the turn with four successive bogeys after edging to two under through three holes. The world number five traded a birdie and a bogey after the turn but made two birdies on his way in to post a level-par 72. Jordan Spieth needs the PGA Championship to become just the sixth player to complete the career Grand Slam by winning all four majors. The American carded an opening one-over 73 in which he bogeyed the 18th. None of the world's top three broke par, with Dustin Johnson finishing four over, Jon Rahm level par and Justin Thomas three over. Meanwhile, Europe Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington, who teamed up with Paul McGinley to win the 1997 World Cup for Ireland at this venue, kept himself in the mix with an eagle at 11 on his way to a one-under-par 71. Phil Mickelson, who at the age of 50 is a year older than 2008 winner Harrington, also remains in contention after an entertaining 70 that included six birdies and four bogeys.

"Tackling NHS waiting lists 'a gargantuan task'Minister announces Â£100m for health boards to fund equipment, staff and ""new ways of working"".Wales","Last month NHS Wales statistics showed more people were on waiting lists than ever before Wales' new health minister says she faces ""a gargantuan task"" to tackle ""record high"" NHS waiting lists caused by the Covid pandemic. Eluned Morgan has announced an initial Â£100m to deal with the record backlog. Latest Welsh government figures show more people than ever - the equivalent of 18% of the Welsh population - are waiting for planned treatments. There were 568,367 people on waiting lists in March, up 24.4% on the same time last year. All health boards will get a share of the funding for new equipment, staff and promoting ""new ways of working"". Ms Morgan toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""I'm very aware of the gargantuan task ahead of me as health minister, and really confronting the NHS. ""We've got to understand that we're in a very unique situation, the pandemic has meant that obviously those waiting lists have really hit record highs and I think we've got to be aware that those people on the front line, the NHS staff, have worked tirelessly through the pandemic and so they're going to need a little bit of time and support to recover. ""I am very aware that there are literally hundreds of thousands of people across Wales who are suffering and are in pain and it is our responsibility to move as fast as we can to try and relieve that suffering. ""But it is going to be, I'm afraid, a task that is going to take a substantial amount of time."" Half a million on record Welsh NHS waiting lists Covid recovery plan announced for 'exhausted' NHS 'Years' before NHS waiting lists back to normal Gaye Moran has been waiting for surgery for over two years and says she is in constant pain Gaye Moran, from Llandudno in Conwy, has been waiting for hip surgery, despite being on a priority list since December 2018. She toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""Sometimes I swear a lot because it hurts so much, sometimes I sit and have a cry. ""But generally I just have to live with it because the only painkillers I can take make me sleep and I really don't want to spend my life sleeping all the time."" Cancer charities have concerns about the impact of the pandemic on waiting times for both patients and staff. Richard Pugh, head of Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, told BBC Wales: ""The backlog is a worry because people are coming in to the system. ""These incredible staff are fatigued. We weren't in the best place with cancer before this. The complications are that more people are coming in and the system can't cope. ""We warned about this months ago. The key thing is supporting the staff but our worry is the new numbers coming in."" Staff are ""exhausted"", says NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall Vice President for the Royal College of Physicians in Wales Dr Olwen Williams also said she was concerned about staff. She said: ""I think this isn't necessarily about the money... we welcome this investment, it's about the fact that, firstly, we're not out to the pandemic. ""We've had an incredibly difficult year for all our staff across the NHS and they're really fatigued, so it's about actually thinking around how we deal with delivering services in that context."" She said a lot of jobs had not been filled before the pandemic, adding: ""It's really urgent that those jobs are filled, because actually our clinicians do need to actually be able to work in an environment where they've got safe rotas."" Mr Richard Johnson, director in Wales of the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS), said it was important to remember that behind the statistics were ordinary ""people waiting in pain and suffering for an operation"". He said the waiting list had to be a priority for the new health minister and Covid-light sites should be introduced across Wales, to ensure patients without the virus could be safely treated. ""This is the best way we can keep treating people who need operations, regardless of future pandemics and winter pressures.  However, it requires being open to doing things differently,"" he said.Tackling NHS waiting lists 'a gargantuan task' He added: ""Although we welcome the additional funding announced, we won't be able to deal with the backlog overnight. It will take many years to achieve, and we need to see sustained investment to increase overall capacity. ""Furthermore, significant changes will be required to how we deliver services in Wales."" Cardiff & Vale will get Â£13m to increase capacity for a range of therapies and diagnostics, including staff recruitment and two new mobile theatres. Powys will get Â£2.5m to transform patient services and increase capacity for a range of services. Cwm Taf Morgannwg will use Â£16m for recruitment and investment in surgical and diagnostic capacity. Hywel Dda is to receive Â£13m to improve capacity for planned care, including hospital redesign and investment in diagnostics. Aneurin Bevan will get Â£17m for projects to increased capacity in planned care, diagnostics, therapies and mental health. Swansea Bay will use Â£16m to increase capacity in a wide range of areas, including theatres, recruitment and ophthalmology. Betsi Cadwaldr will get Â£20m to increase capacity in planned care, cancer, dental, diagnostics and endoscopy Velindre will use Â£2.5m to increase capacity for radiotherapy. The initial Â£100m fundingwas announced in March by Vaughan Gething,the previous health minister, ahead of the Senedd election. During the subsequent election campaign, Labour promised Â£1bn would be spent over a number of years on an NHS recovery plan. NHS Wales chief executiveDr Andrew Goodall had previously warned staff were ""exhausted""and said tackling the NHS could take ""years to recover"". Of the 568,367 on the list in March, 216,418 had been waiting more than 36 weeks - 38% of the total number waiting, more than seven times more than during the same period last year.

Matt Hancock to face contaminated blood inquiryThe health secretary will face questions about compensation for victims of contaminated blood on Friday.Health,"This video can not be played Su Gormanâs husband Steve was diagnosed with hepatitis C 21 years after first receiving contaminated blood products The health secretary has acknowledged the pain and suffering of victims of the contaminated blood scandal, saying the government would pay compensation if recommended to. Matt Hancock was facing questions at a public inquiry into what's been called the worst NHS treatment disaster. Around 3,000 people died after being given blood products containing HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970s and 1980s. Mr Hancock said he wanted ""to make sure their voices are heard"". And he said the government would pay compensation if the inquiry decided it should. Currently, victims and families get financial support but have not been compensated for loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood Annual payments for contaminated blood bereaved Two-month delay in telling patients they had HIV Ministers announced a public inquiry in 2017 after decades of campaigning by victims and their families. Nearly 5,000 people with the blood disorder haemophilia were infected with potentially fatal viruses after being given a clotting agent called Factor VIII. Much of the drug was imported from the US, where prisoners and other at-risk groups were often paid to donate the plasma used to make it. Victims included dozens of young haemophiliacs at a boarding school in Hampshire who died after contracting HIV as a result. Tens of thousands more victims may have been exposed to viral hepatitis through blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth. Factor VIII was often imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s Families of victims of the scandal have long fought for annual support payments to be increased and full compensation to be paid. In March ministers said that families in England who lost relatives as a result of the scandal will receive the same support payments as those in other parts of the UK. Treasury minister Penny Mordaunt said bereaved partners would automatically get a Â£10,000 lump sum. But campaigners say some families have been excluded from the scheme, including children who lost parents to HIV at the time. The UK government has now said that full compensation could be paid in the future, depending on the outcome of the inquiry. That is likely to pave the way for much larger payments covering lifetime loss of earnings and ongoing care costs. Ministers have appointed the retired barrister Sir Robert Francis to carry out a study looking at different options for compensation, and to report back with recommendations, before the inquiry publishes its conclusions. ""This is a huge move but if they decide to base compensation on what the inquiry decides, that gives them another two or three years before they have to find a penny,"" said Su Gorman, whose husband Steve Dymond died aged 62 in December 2018 of organ failure linked to hepatitis C. ""If they really wanted to pay compensation, they could find a way of doing it which would not prejudge the inquiry."" This video can not be played Video statements were played at the start of the public inquiry in September 2018 The public inquiry, led by Sir Brian Langstaff, has been examining the circumstances surrounded the contaminated blood scandal since 2018. Hundreds of people who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C or their family members have already given evidence, with hearings held at sites across the UK. The inquiry is examining how and why the infections occurred, what was known at the time about the risks of the treatments, and whether patients were given sufficient warnings about the dangers involved. Evidence hearings are scheduled to continue into next year with a final report likely to be published in 2022 or 2023. A book of remembrance for haemophiliacs who died in the contaminated blood scandal is displayed at St Botolph's Church in the City of London A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""The infected blood tragedy should never have happened. The ongoing public inquiry was set up to establish the truth and give individuals and families the answers they rightly deserve. ""We've always been clear that those who have been affected by this tragedy should be supported by a fair and transparent support scheme focused on their welfare, providing some security and consistency. ""The government has listened to the call for parity of support across UK and in March announced a package for the whole of the UK which will bring greater uniformity to the four National support schemes.""
