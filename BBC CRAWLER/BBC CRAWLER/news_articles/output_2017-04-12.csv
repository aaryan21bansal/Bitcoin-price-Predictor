'Clean eating': How good is it for you?,"Young people are being warned that faddy diets are putting their health at risk. The National Osteoporosis Society foundthat a fifth of under-25s were cutting out or reducing dairy in their diet, which can affect their bones. One diet that - in its extreme form - recommends avoiding dairy is ""clean eating"". The idea is to only eat ""clean"" foods by cooking from scratch, choosing foods in their natural state, and eliminating refined sugar. More extreme versions might exclude gluten, grains, dairy - or even encourage a raw food diet. Pippa Selby, a clean eater for three years, starts the day with a bowl of smoothie, frozen fruit, fresh fruit, oats and a nut butter. Lunch might be a homemade soup or a mozzarella salad. For dinner a sweet potato bake or grass-fed, free range meat and homemade chips. Other clean-eating classics are the kale smoothie, smashed avocado, chia seeds and quinoa. It's been around for about a decade, says dietician Catherine Collins. A-list celebrities Gwyneth Paltrow, Katy Perry, Miranda Kerr and Jessica Alba are all reportedly fans. But it's foodie vloggers and bloggers who have given the concept wings. Clean Eating Alice, also known as Alice Liveing, has half a million Instagram followers and two cookbooks to her name. Ina recent interview with the Sun,,externalshe said she chose the term ""clean eating"" because it ""perfectly encapsulated everything I wanted to do to my own diet - clean it up, get rid of a lot of the processed rubbish and begin eating real food again. ""I never once thought about restricting whole food groups from my diet, or placing metaphorical labels on foods and seeing them as either clean or unclean."" Ella Mills - Deliciously Ella - thinks the word ""clean"" has come to mean something negative Food blogger Ella Mills - better known as Deliciously Ella - has distanced herself from the ""clean-eating"" label. In BBC documentary ""Clean Eating: The Dirty Truth"" she said the word ""clean"" had become too ""loaded"". ""Clean now implies dirty and that's negative,"" she said. ""When I first read the term, it meant natural, kind of unprocessed, and now it doesn't mean that at all. It means diet. It means fad."" It's unclear. Catherine Collins says it's more of a lifestyle choice than a diet, which seems to appeal to teenage girls and women in their 20s. It requires attention to detail and a certain attitude - you won't find many 40-year-old mums with children doing it, she adds. Pippa Selby started clean eating after suffering joint pain and dizzy spells following the birth of her daughter. The 29-year-old picture researcher from east London says it was expensive changing her diet, but it has made a difference to how she feels. Pippa Selby find she feels better when she ""clean-eats"" But there was a point when she had to ""step away"" from it. ""It's easy to become obsessive about it,"" she says. ""It can be so restrictive and there's so much on social media that you can feel under attack if you don't eat the right foods."" Collins says the inference of ""clean eating"" is that a vegetable-based diet will make you slimmer, fitter, more attractive, and make you live longer. But she worries when bloggers recommend cutting out major food groups like dairy and wheat without suggesting an alternative. If you don't look like Miranda Kerr now, says Collins, it's probably not going to happen - her looks are down to good genes, a strict diet and exercise. ""Outwardly, you can look vibrant and beautiful, but inwardly your body can be crying out for nutrition,"" she says. Collins points toGwyneth Paltrow,externalsaying in 2010 she had the early stages of osteopenia, a precursor to the brittle bone disease osteoporosis, usually seen in women after the menopause. Osteopenia can occur when someone cuts out food groups such as dairy, especially if it is a lifelong habit. The most recentNational Diet and Nutrition Study,externalfound the calcium intake of one in six women under 24 was deemed to be worryingly low. A Mediterranean diet is the ""nutritional blueprint for all ages"", says Collins Collins advises young women to think about what's missing from those delicious-looking plates, posted on Instagram by the skinny and beautiful. It's a snapshot of their diet, she says. ""There might have been a load of chocolate biscuits and purging in between."" The best diet is a varied one, says Collins. A Mediterranean-style one of olive oil, vegetables, lean meat and a handful of nuts to snack on is a ""nutritional blueprint for people of all ages"". The more restrictive and the more caveats, the less healthy the diet, she concludes. The NHS website offerseight tips for healthy eating:,external Base your meals on starchy carbohydrates Eat lots of fruit and veg Eat more fish - including a portion of oily fish Cut down on saturated fat and sugar Eat less salt - no more than 6g a day for adults Get active and be a healthy weight Don't get thirsty Don't skip breakfast Dairy-free diets 'can risk bone health' Fasting diet 'regenerates diabetic organ' Is 10-a-day diet only for the wealthy?

I was blinded by my contact lens,"When Irenie Ekkeshis's eye started to itch she assumed it would soon settle down. It didn't. Before long, she found herself in excruciating pain and lost her sight in that eye. And the cause may have been nothing more than handling her contact lenses with wet fingers. One Saturday morning in January 2011, Irenie Ekkeshis woke up to find her right eye was streaming with tears. So she went to the chemist's and picked up some eye drops. ""I thought I had a little infection that would clear up by Monday. But by that evening I couldn't bear to go in my kitchen because I found the fluorescent lights too bright. It was painful."" Ekkeshis went straight to Moorfield's Eye Hospital where doctors gave her a corneal scrape - a procedure that involves taking cells from the surface of the eyeball. ""It was as horrible as it sounds - you see the needle heading towards your eye. It was excruciatingly painful, even though they use numbing eye drops,"" she says. Within days she was told she had Acanthamoeba Keratitis (AK), a rare but serious eye infection caused by a micro-organism that's common in tap water, sea water and swimming pools. ""I was feeling very shocked and frightened, as by then I had lost the vision in my right eye. It was like looking through a foggy bathroom mirror. I could see colours and shapes but not much else,"" she says. The illness affects about 125 people in the UK every year - and the vast majority of cases are associated with the use of contact lenses. ""I hadn't had a shower or gone swimming in my lenses,"" Ekkeshis says. ""But I learned that even washing your hands and not drying them properly before handling lenses can cause it."" About 85% of AK cases are associated with wearing contact lenses It was at the age of 12 that Ekkeshis decided to swap her thick glasses for contact lenses. ""I suppose I was a self-conscious pre-teen,"" she says. By the time she was 30 she wore daily disposable lenses, the kind you throw away each evening, and she had never had any trouble with them. But AK, in which an amoeba invades the cornea - the clear front part of the eye - turned out to be a major problem. At first, Ekkeshis was given antiseptic eye drops to take every hour. She was told that as the infection had been caught early it should be cured in a matter of weeks. But her eye didn't respond to the treatment, and because the cornea has the highest density of pain receptors in the body, she was soon in agony. ""The pain got worse as the infection developed,"" she says. ""At times it was unbearable and was almost impossible to control, even with the strongest painkillers."" She could not work and eventually quit her job as a travel company director. Her eye streamed for months until doctors started to get the infection under control. The pain also started to subside. But by now the cornea of her right eye was scarred, leaving her vision in this eye blurred. DO: Wash and dry your hands before handling your lenses Apply your lenses before putting on make-up Keep your eyes closed when using hairspray or other aerosols DON'T: Use your lenses for swimming, hot tubs or water sports, unless wearing goggles Wear your lenses when showering unless you keep your eyes firmly closed Wet your lenses with saliva Source:Loveyourlenses.com,external In May 2013 she had a corneal transplant, which appeared to be a success. ""It was amazing to be able to see through both eyes for the first time in a long time,"" she says. However, after 10 days Ekkeshis noticed the sight in her right eye was becoming cloudy again. ""I had a scan which confirmed the AK had moved in to the new transplant. I was back to square one. It was devastating."" Acanthamoeba keratitis can scar the surface of the eye A second transplant followed in 2014. ""My eye stabilised and I was no longer in pain,"" she says. However, something then went wrong with her retina and she completely lost her vision in that eye. Doctors have told her they suspect that inflammation caused by AK was the source of the problem - and that her sight is unlikely to return. During her illness, Ekkeshis discovered that none of her friends or family, many of whom wore contact lenses, knew about the risks of exposing them to water. So she decided to set up a campaign from her sofa to tackle the issue. She discovered that while a safety leaflet was produced it wasn't usually included inside the lens boxes, so the information rarely reached lens wearers. The British Contact Lens Association has distributed 100,000 ""No Water"" stickers for lens boxes She asked the British Contact Lens Association why there was no warning on the boxes. When told there simply wasn't room she designed her own ""No Water"" graphic. ""At that point the industry realised I was serious and they became supportive. We produced these No Water stickers that opticians could stick on boxes,"" she says. Ekkeshis spoke at conferences to promote the campaign and it spread to the US too, after she attracted the attention of the American Academy of Optometry. She hopes one day the ""No Water"" graphic will be automatically printed on all contact lens boxes. Using her campaigning experience, she has co-founded an enterprise called The New Citizenship Project. ""Our purpose is to get people more involved in society. When you think and behave like a citizen you feel able to create change,"" she says. Contact lens wear causes minor corneal abrasions, which is the key initial step for Acanthamoeba infection Contact lenses serve as a vehicle for the harbouring, transmission and delivery of microorganisms to the eye - Acanthamoeba has a high affinity for contact lens surfaces Source:Journal of Optometry (2009),external Meanwhile Ekkeshis, now 36, has had to adapt to her impaired sight. ""You do things to help cope day to day. So if I'm going to a meal with friends I try to sit closer to the wall on my right side so I can see everyone,"" she says. ""But it is hard. Sometimes people can get huffy on public transport if you bump in to them because you can't see your right side."" The eyelid is now droopy, which is common in AK. ""My advice to people is simple. Never let your lenses come into contact with water - in the shower, swimming or when washing. ""Although infections like AK are rare, I'm proof they can happen and the results can be devastating.""

Farewell to pay growth,"Income growth - or lack of it - has been one of the defining economic and political issues of the last decade. Average weekly earnings are still Â£26 below where they were at their peak in 2008. Employment levels are strong - which is economic good news. But if people in work feel worse off year on year, then Number 10 knows it has a major issue to fix. The reasons for Britain's wage stagnation problem are multiple. The recession following the financial crisis raised the spectre of unemployment, meaning that holding on to your job became more important than asking for a pay rise. As growth, demand and investment dried up following the banking collapse, inflation in western economies evaporated and in some sectors - such as food - price deflation became the norm. The cost of living - the usual fuel for wage demands - stopped rising. Then there is Britain's productivity problem, which will not return to its long-term growth rate of 2% until 2020. Productivity measures the amount of value (outputs) created in the economy per unit of input - such as labour hours worked, materials used or capital investment spent. Its increase is directly related to income: if productivity rises, wealth is created more rapidly than costs rise, and increased profit and wage rises are the result. If productivity is poor - and the UK lags far behind America, France and Germany on this measure - that wealth is harder to come by. As Philip Hammond put it at the time of the Autumn Statement last November: ""It takes a German worker four days to produce what we make in five, which means, in turn, that too many British workers work longer hours for lower pay than their counterparts."" By the time a British worker has earned Â£1, a German worked has earned Â£1.35. When inflation is low or non-existent, stagnant real income growth is less of an issue for the people affected. But over the past six months, inflation has risen markedly, from 1% in September to 2.3% last month. Some of that is down to the fall in the value of sterling, but global inflationary pressures are also rising as more solid growth returns,as I've written before. Today's figures from the Office for National Statisticsreveal that earnings growth is travelling in the opposite direction - down to 2.2% last month from 2.3% in February. And that, of course, is an average figure. For some areas of employment - such as public sector workers - the picture is far grimmer. The Resolution Foundation says that more than a third of the workforce are already in sectors where pay is falling in real terms. ""Britain's brief pay recovery has come to an end,"" said Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the think-tank. ""Forty per cent of the workforce are experiencing shrinking pay packets according to the latest figures, in sectors ranging from finance to the public sector. Many more will join them in the coming months as inflation continues to rise, with pay across the economy as a whole set to have fallen in the first three months of 2017."" Inflation is expected to jump again when the April figures are published next month - price rises associated with the later Easter holiday this year (increased air fares for example) will feed through as will plans by the major energy companies to raise prices. At the same time, wage increases are set to continue slowing. It is likely that next month, falling real incomes will be back with us for the first time since September 2014. As I have said before, Britain's income squeeze is one of the most difficult political and economic issues facing the government. Many will argue that an economy that works for everyone would not be expected to be one where people are worse off at the end of the year than they were at the beginning.

The right place for Holocaust memorial?,"Shortlisted: Allied Works design It's a rare piece of green space with the backdrop of Parliament and a commanding view of the Thames. Victoria Tower Gardens, London's smallest royal park, is a popular haunt for dog walkers, joggers, families - and also picnicking office workers, who use it to soak up the sun and get a breather from the hustle and bustle of city life. But that could be about to change because this narrow strip of parkland is set to become home to a national Holocaust memorial with an underground learning centre. By Holocaust Memorial Day 2021, organisers anticipate the Â£50m scheme will transform the park, which dates back to the 1870s and is fringed by trees and benches, into a tourist destination and education resource attracting more than a million visitors a year. Shortlisted: Caruso St John, Marcus Taylor and Rachel Whiteread's sculpture Shortlisted: Lahdelma & MahlamÃ¤ki Architects and David Morley A A shortlist of 10 architects are currently competing in aninternational design competition,externallaunched by the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation to create the new structure, with the winning team to be announced by the end of May. Former Prime Minister David Cameron said the new monument would ""show the importance Britain places on preserving the memory of the Holocaust"", claiming it would represent ""a permanent statement of our values as a nation"" and something that would be visited ""for generations to come"". But not everyone is happy about the plan. Some local residents, MPs and peers say that while they are fully behind the creation of a Holocaust memorial - and in particular a learning centre - they believe the project will destroy the park. Shortlisted: Studio Libeskind and Haptic Architects Shortlisted: heneghan peng Barbara Weiss, the architect who refurbished the Russell Square headquarters of the Wiener Library - the oldest institution for the study of the Holocaust and genocide - questioned why it could not be placed with it. ""I'm not against the memorial, I just don't want any building in our park, not even a hospital or an art gallery."" Ms Weiss is a leading light in the Save Victoria Tower Gardens campaign. She says the park is ""absolutely unique, historic and gorgeous - to put something else there will totally change its character completely"". ""It doesn't make a lot of sense to build a learning centre underground in an area beside a river in a flood area. ""The organisers are talking about one million extra visitors there - that's a lot of extra security. We would have people with machine guns and bag checks, and I know people who work in Parliament don't want that. They go to the park to get away from that pressure of feeling constantly monitored."" Shortlisted: Anish Kapoor and Zaha Hadid Architects Shortlisted: Adjaye Associates and Ron Arad Architects Lucy Peck, a retired architectural historian who lives nearby, said: ""I'm not against a memorial at all, but there are bigger places in London that could take a project of this size much more easily. There's a superb Holocaust gallery less than a mile away at the Imperial War Museum, so why build another fairly similar thing here?"" The Imperial War Museum, a 15 minute walk from Parliament, was one of three locations out of 50 in the running as a Holocaust memorial site - until January 2016 when Mr Cameron named Victoria Tower Gardens as the preferred option. Lucy Donoughue, the IWM's assistant communications director, said the museum - which is spending Â£15m on renewing and expanding its renowned Holocaust Exhibition and already attracts a million visitors a year - was not deemed central enough. ""While we were disappointed by this decision, we still remain hugely supportive of the initiatives laid out by the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation,"" she said. Veteran Conservative MP Sir Peter Bottomley, who has lived near Victoria Tower Gardens for more than 25 years, says he is unhappy two other sites - Potters Field on the south bank of the Thames between Tower Bridge and City Hall, and Millbank, next to Tate Britain - were ruled out. Shortlisted: Foster + Partners and Michal Rovner Shortlisted: John McAslan + Partners and MASS Design Group Shortlisted: Diamond Schmitt Architects ""Somewhere, somehow some unnamed person in Number 10 decided to substitute these three with Victoria Tower Gardens,"" he said. ""You can't have a prominent memorial here - you've got to keep the garden. I would urge the government to pause, reopen the debate and rethink."" The park, which is listed Grade II and is partly inside a Unesco world heritage site, is no stranger to significant structures including August Rodin's bronze The Burghers of Calais, a statue of the Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, and a fountain commemorating the abolition of slavery. A spokeswoman for the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation, which is chaired by Sir Peter Bazalgette, said its mission had been to find ""the most iconic location"" for a national memorial and learning centre - and Victoria Tower Gardens, next to Parliament ""fulfils that aim better than any of the almost 50 sites we examined"". She declined to say specifically why other sites had not been chosen except that ""a lot of those were for commercial reasons"". ""With cross-party support, we have made a promise to survivors that in Victoria Tower Gardens we will create a fitting national memorial as a permanent site of remembrance and an education centre to act more broadly as a voice against hatred and prejudice in the modern world, while respecting and enhancing the existing green space,"" she said. ""There can be nowhere more meaningful for such a powerful statement of our national values than next to Parliament, at the heart of our democracy. We want Britain's Holocaust survivors to know that we will not break our promise."" But Jewish Conservative peer Lord Wasserman, one of David Cameron's closest political allies who lives quite near the gardens, says it is not the right location for such a symbolic and important project. ""In particular,  I am concerned that this will lead to massive resentment on the part of those ordinary Londoners who will be seriously inconvenienced by the additional traffic (vehicular and pedestrian) which the museum will generate,"" he said.  ""I'm also concerned about the the additional security risk associated with such a site."" Maja Turcan, whose parents were Holocaust survivors, says while a learning centre is needed ""particularly at a time where anti-Semitism and hate crimes are increasing"" - she questions why it could not be placed somewhere like Manchester ""where there's a big Jewish community, but is also multi-ethnic and multi-cultural"". Victoria Park Gardens as it is now Aviva Trup, who manages Jewish Care's Holocaust Survivors Services - a centre which offers a programme of social, cultural and therapeutic events for Holocaust survivors in the UK - said ""legacy and education is of upmost importance to our members"". She would not be drawn on whether Victoria Tower Gardens was the right place for the project, saying that ""the most important thing is that the memorial is built in a central London location and is easy to access"". The UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation is currently running a public consultation exercise, with exhibitions across the UK featuring the proposed schemes until the end of April. The winning design will be announced before the end of May by Sir Peter's jury, whose members include: London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid, TV presenters Loyd Grossman - also chair of the Royal Parks - and newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky. The project should be open to the public by Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January 2021. Parliament Holocaust memorial planned What was the Holocaust?

Can British Easter eggs conquer the world?,"There's nothing but air in the middle of most chocolate eggs Cracking open a large chocolate egg to find nothing in the middle is one of life's perennial disappointments. Yet for some chocolate firms the fact that most Easter eggs are hollow is more than just disappointing, it's problematic. ""It sounds ridiculous, but there is a lot of air in Easter eggs relative to their value in weight,"" says Helen Pattinson, co-founder of boutique British chocolate chain Montezuma's. The oval shape of eggs and the boxes required to keep them intact means that, compared to the amount of space they take up in a shipping container, it is impossible for Montezuma's to charge the end customer enough to make a decent profit. Foreign sales account for about a fifth of the company's overall sales and for this financial year, ending in May, it expects exports to hit the Â£1m mark for the first time. Despite the strong demand from abroad, the firm is yet to send its chocolate eggs overseas. ""The economics just haven't added up so far,"" says Mrs Pattinson, who co-founded the firm in 2000 with her husband Simon. More than three-quarters of Montezuma's chocolate exports go to the US, but it is yet to send any eggs The company has six shops in the South East of England and sells directly to customers in the US and Europe via its website, and further afield via export arrangements. So far most of its overseas customers have come via a partnership deal with a large US retailer. Despite the more established reputation of Swiss and Belgian chocolatiers, Mrs Pattinson says she is seeing a growing demand for British-made chocolate. ""The most contemporary artisan foodies are beginning to realise Britain is a fantastic producer of chocolate,"" she says. Last year, the UK exported a whopping Â£245m worth of chocolate, up by almost a quarter on 2015. Exports of unfilled chocolates and chocolate products, which include Easter eggs, totalled just over Â£30m, up 3% on 2015. While the vast majority of these went to EU countries, the biggest growth was in exports to non-EU countries which increased by almost a fifth, according to the Department for International Trade. An ""element of snob value"" is helping British chocolate egg exports in some markets, says Sean Ramsden It is a trend that hasn't escaped the notice of Sean Ramsden, chief executive of Ramsden International. The family firm specialises in exporting British food overseas and Mr Ramsden says Easter is its busiest period after Christmas. The awkward shape of chocolate eggs isn't a problem for the company because it supplies a much wider range of products, enabling it to mix Easter eggs with other food orders. ""Easter eggs are a popular UK product and they're very exportable. They [Easter eggs] are not as advanced in other countries,"" he says. When the Grimsby-based firm first started exporting in 1970, business was largely driven by expats. Marmite, brown sauce and baked beans were the items most in demand in the company's markets in Spain, Portugal, France, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong. Now it delivers to 130 countries and turnover last year was Â£50m. Mr Ramsden says the company's growth reflects demand from a growing global middle class. ""The food becomes premium by virtue of being imported. There is an element of snob value in certain markets,"" he says. Hong Kong-based Sharan Gill always buys imported eggs for her daughters Eysha and Elyna Particularly in Asia, he says, customers are keen to have ""something a little bit different or a bit more exclusive"" such as a foreign brand. But he says many of its customers also have an international outlook, with second homes in the UK, for example, and a genuine affection for British food. Sharan Gill, who lives in Hong Kong, says she always buys imported chocolate eggs for her children at Easter. ""It's a tradition amongst my friends too, both Western and Asian. I spend between 100 to 150 Hong Kong dollars (Â£10-Â£15; $13-$19) on chocolates for the annual Easter egg hunt, which my kids thoroughly enjoy. ""Easter seems to be a growing trend, partly because clubs and restaurants promote it extensively. ""Plus Hong Kong has a large expat community, a large proportion of which consists of Westerners, for whom Easter is an established tradition. It is also celebrated by the predominantly Catholic Filipino community who form a large part of the domestic helper workforce,"" she says. Good Housekeeping magazine included Easter crackers on its Easter dinner table photo shoot for the first time this year The fervour surrounding the Christian festival has reached such fever pitch that the home and lifestyle gurus at Good Housekeeping magazine recently declared the occasion ""a second Christmas"". Theresa May criticises Cadbury over Easter egg hunt Co-op's 'Treat your daughter' Easter egg adverts changed It is not just small firms benefiting from the growing sense of occasion. Marks and Spencer says it exports a number of its popular eggs to its 468 shops overseas, with them selling particularly well in Hong Kong, Western Europe and the Czech Republic. ""We're seeing double-digit growth on sales of our Easter eggs internationally - with people buying into both our large 'giftable' eggs as well as impulse purchasing small bags of chocolate foiled eggs and bigger bags of eggs for Easter egg hunts - an event which is increasing in popularity,"" says a spokeswoman. People really like the licensed character eggs and Star Wars' R2D2 is currently the best seller internationally, she adds. Marks and Spencer's R2D2 egg is its most popular internationally While market research firm Mintel doesn't track British chocolate exports, its figures show people around the world are eating more chocolate eggs. ""In Brazil, for example, the trade association ABICAB reported that 95 million chocolate Easter eggs were sold in 2016, a 19% increase over 2015. In that country, Easter eggs make up a major percentage of annual chocolate revenues,"" says global food and drink analyst Marcia Mogelonsky.

Urban Burqa: A critique of Islamophobia,"Fabian Muir says his series critiques rising Islamophobia When Tony Abbott, as Australian prime minister in 2014, appeared to support a ban on the burka being worn in Parliament House, award-winning photographer Fabian Muir had one response. He trekked 1,600km (1,000 miles) across his homeland, camera in hand. Muir's resulting series pitted a cobalt-coloured garment of Afghanistan, alternatively spelled burqa, against Australia's most forbidding, and beautiful, terrains. Blue Burqa in a Sunburnt Country features a lone figure standing against swirling skies on a ridge of yellow sand; reflected in clear water; and walking amongst a forest of dead trees. Now Muir has made a follow up sequence - Urban Burqa. Rather than pictured in the outback, a woman in blue stands, contrastingly, against the white of milk bottles in a supermarket. Other images include the figure outside a fluorescent McDonald's sign and in a concrete basement covered in graffiti. The series is a critique of the rising far right and Islamophobia, Muir says. Muir says his series deals with ""confrontation and adaptation"" ""Tragically, [anti-immigrant sentiment] has only become more magnified since 2014,"" says Muir, pointing out that 49% of Australians ina 2016 poll,externalsupported a ban on Muslims entering the country. ""The refugee crisisâ¦ is always such an easy target for politicians. There's always going to be a percentage of the population who swallows that because it seems like an easy solution to problems."" In Blue Burqa in a Sunburnt Country, Muir wanted to show how the burka complemented - and even enhanced - the landscapes: ""It hinted or suggested a potential symbiosis of this country and immigrants, that runs counter to the narrative making the headlines at that time."" Urban Burqa, by contrast, touches more on a cultural clash. ""It's still about simulation but there's also a sense of confrontation and adaptation, hence this darker, edgier feel to it,"" he says. Born in a household of Australian creatives - Muir's mother was a director at Opera Australia, his father a director at the Australian Broadcasting Corp - Muir turned to photography after completing a law degree at Sydney University. He has since lived in Estonia, Lithuania, France, Spain and Germany. Muir, who is in his 40s, credits his success to a lack of formal training. The subject is photographed against the Aboriginal flag ""I personally think it's unnecessary and potentially dangerous for an aspiring photographer [to attend photography school],"" he says. ""Especially if they're young. They're going to potentially lack the fortitude to resist their teacher's vision."" Muir taught himself, learning on film. ""The trial and error was quite expensive,"" he laughs. ""Each shot cost me a dollar!"" Still, he appreciates the ability to pursue his own ideas ""untrammelled and unburdened by someone else's vision"". Last year Muir completed his series Intimate Perspectives on North Korea, selected as a finalist in the Magnum Photography Awards. ""It's a time capsule,"" says Muir of the nation, which he visited five times over the course of two years. Shepherded around by guides, he was only allowed to walk unaided - and unwatched - on a handful of occasions. One of Muir's photos from North Korea The photographer was first inspired to travel to North Korea after coming across Tomas van Houtryve's 2009 photo essay The Land of No Smiles. He says Houtryve's images are powerful but bleak. ""His descriptions are very acid, of children fleeing at the sight of him,"" he says. ""What I saw was very different."" ""The bleakness is part of the narrative,"" continues Muir. ""But it's not the sole element. Almost more interesting was my experience of street level North Korea. They're really very warm and have a sense of humour, and enjoy very normal things."" In order to document this, Muir took photographs of picnics in the park, kids in a playground, and bathers at a beach resort. One of his most hard-hitting images is of young children in an orphanage sitting beneath portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. It works because of ""the structural composition, which says something about North Korean society - this strict structure of children lined up under the presence of the leadership there,"" he says. ""For me it also raises questions: these infants, where are they going to be in the future? It asks questions about the future, it illustrates the present, and it also says something about the past."" Muir says his series ends on a hopeful note Key was showing that there was more to the story than ""unthinking robotic people and their hatred for America and Japan"". This hit home in 2015. ""Out of nowhere I sensed this figure cannon balling towards me and arms were thrown around me. It was this guide I had on previous visits - he was in his sixties, quite eccentric and has fantastic sense of humour,"" Muir says. ""He was almost in tears to see me again. It was absolutely genuine - no one put him up to that."" With regards to Urban Burqa, Muir believes it ends on a hopeful note. The last image shows a woman in a burka standing in a bright blue skate park. The shadow from a skater in a T-shirt and shorts skirts the crown of her covered head, his hand almost touching her. ""For me it's a nice closing image, it's optimistic - because of the reaching out,"" he says. ""[But] there's a sense that there are a lot of barriers that have to be overcome.""

Boris Johnson: A weakened foreign secretary?,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson denies 'defeat' over sanctions plan There is, to use Boris Johnson's own lingo, a ""whinge-o-rama"" raging among the foreign secretary's political opponents and in parts of the press about his performance in the current Syria crisis. He faces a number of charges. First, he pulled out of a long-planned trip to Moscow after the US missile strike on a Syrian airfield. It was agreed the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson should go instead. Poodle, cried his critics. Next, Team Boris briefed journalists that the foreign secretary wanted to get the G7 to agree new sanctions against Russia at its meeting in the Italian city of Lucca. But Mr Johnson entirely failed to persuade other countries to agree. Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said there was no consensus new sanctions would help and argued they could push Russia into a corner. Mr Johnson's own view of the Syrian conflict seems to have swerved around like a shopping trolley since he became the UK's chief diplomat in July. Giving evidence to a House of Lords committee at the start of 2017, he signalled a shift in UK policy towards Syria. Mr Johnson said the ""mantra"" of calling for President Assad to go had not worked and the military space had been left open to Russia to fill. The Foreign Secretary told peers President Assad should be allowed to run for election as part of a ""democratic resolution"" of the civil war. Now, however, Mr Johnson believes the Syrian leader has to go. Russia hits out over Johnson's cancelled trip Boris Johnson denies defeat over sanctions How much of this is fair? And what might the episode say about Boris Johnson's standing in Theresa May's government? First, the UK was a bystander to the Trump administration's missile strike on Syria. The government was given a courtesy call to say it was coming but the UK was not asked to be involved. Mr Johnson's trip to Moscow (which would have been the first by a British foreign secretary to Russia for five years) was long planned and quickly binned. I understand Mrs May told Mr Johnson it was his call whether he wanted to go or not. After speaking to Rex Tillerson, Mr Johnson and his US opposite number agreed it was best for one man to deliver a single message to Moscow. Theresa May's decision to give Boris Johnson a top cabinet role surprised many Mr Johnson then spent a weekend hitting the phones to other G7 countries trying to get a united position agreed ahead of the meeting in Lucca. In its final communique, the G7 did agree to state the Assad regime had to end. But further sanctions - an idea endorsed by Number 10 - got nowhere. It was clearly a snub to Mr Johnson although government sources insist sanctions have not been taken off the table. On Wednesday, the Chancellor, Phillip Hammond, said other countries were ""less forward-leaning"" than the UK on the issue. Diplomacy is tough. But it may have been unwise for the Foreign Office to suggest sanctions were an ambition when key G7 nations clearly didn't agree. Boris Johnson: His rise, fall, rise, fall and rise At the weekend, I was told by Team Boris that he was very relaxed about the sniping and criticism being lobbed his way in recent days. And Mr Johnson has provoked quite a lot since he became foreign secretary, largely because of his use of decidedly undiplomatic language. He was taken to task by a Swedish MEP in February for calling Brexit a ""liberation"". A month before that, Mr Johnson warned the French president not to respond to Brexit by administering ""punishment beatings"" in the manner of a World War Two film. Guy Verhofstadt, who speaks for the European Parliament on Brexit, branded the remarks ""abhorrent and deeply unhelpful"". It was several days after President Trump's election that Boris Johnson said it was time for Mr Trump's critics to get over their ""whinge-o-rama"" - a comment I know left some officials in Brussels agog. Mr Johnson is always keen to speak with the swashbuckling pluck of the newspaper columnist he once was. His many fans in the Tory party might love it. But even Mrs May has hinted at exasperation. This video can not be played Theresa May jokes about Boris Johnson the FFS At the Conservative Party conference last autumn, the prime minister said: ""Do we have a plan for Brexit? We do. Are we ready for the effort it will take to see it through? We are. Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days? Just about."" It was a joke. But not many prime ministers joke about their foreign secretary's erraticism. Then in December, Mrs May described Boris Johnson as an FFS - saying that in this case it stood for being a Fine Foreign Secretary (and not the punchy abbreviation for a term of exasperation). When Mrs May was home secretary and Mr Johnson was London mayor they had a prickly relationship. She then beat him to the job he craved. Her appointment of the Brexit campaign's most prominent champion to the job of foreign secretary stunned Westminster and it remains one of the most intriguing political relationships within the government. While happy to clip his wings publicly from time to time, Theresa May also needs Boris Johnson on board as she embarks on Brexit. A force so effective in persuading Britain to vote to leave the EU is not a politician the prime minister wants sniping from outside the cabinet as the negotiating trade-offs begin.

On patrol with India's anti-harassment squad,"The squads patrol areas where there are most reports of harassment In Uttar Pradesh, a special police squad has been set up to fight eve teasing - a local term for sexual harassment. But the move has led to allegations of moral policing. The BBC's Vikas Pandey spent a day with the squad in Allahabad city. In a public park, a young couple try to hide as they spot the squad. ""Please come out. We are here for your safety,"" Niraj Kumar Jadaun, assistant superintendent of police and head of the squad, tells them. The boy emerges and asks for forgiveness, only to be reassured by Mr Jadaun that he has done nothing wrong. After a brief conversation, the couple manage a faint smile before disappearing into the park. ""Some people are scared of cops. And that's the perception we have to fight against,"" he says. ""But eve teasing is another reality that we need to fight against."" Niraj Kumar Jadaun wants to win the trust of young people Police in Uttar Pradesh established the squad due to rising reports of sexual harassment. There are no reliable statistics and police say that in most cases women don't report harassment. But most women have a story, or several, to tell about inappropriate or abusive groping, language or behaviour. A total of 1,400 officers have been deployed to anti-harassment squads across the state. Each squad includes three uniformed officers and a female officer in plain clothes. They patrol in cars and on foot, targeting areas where they get most complaints about harassment. So far there have been mixed results. Some squads have made headlines for ""moral policing"" and there have been reports of couples being harassed and even beaten up. But Rahul Srivastava, chief spokesperson of the police, said that only ""a handful"" of officers were making mistakes. ""We are repeatedly training our staff about the dos and don'ts,"" he said. ""We have suspended nine officials so far for violations. Our instruction is clear that consenting adults should not be disturbed."" Mr Jadaun says upbringing can be to blame. ""In some cultures it's still a taboo for a boy and a girl to sit together in public places. So some cops who think on similar lines end up indulging in moral policing,"" he says. ""But their number is very small."" The police have strict instructions to not disturb consenting couples Back in the park, Mr Jadaun is stopped by a young man who wants to talk. ""My name is Abhilash Denis and I want to thank you for this initiative. But I also have some issues,"" he says. Mr Denis says that he likes to go to public parks with his girlfriend. ""But it's always a risk. Eve teasers are always around. They make nasty remarks and make rude gestures. The squad's presence has made sure that such people are less visible in public places,"" he says. ""But that doesn't mean that cops have a right to disturb us any time."" Mr Jadaun assures him that police will only disturb him to ask about their safety. Abhilash Denis supports the initiative but wants it to work better Police officers say they also visit rural areas to make women feel safe Elsewhere in the park a woman, who didn't want to be identified, seems angry with the police. ""It's the police's responsibility to make us feel safe. But I don't want random police to question me just because I am sitting in a public place with my male friend,"" she says. ""Yes, I agree that eve teasing is a problem. And I am happy the police are doing something about it. But they need to get better at what they do."" In another part of the city, police approach two couples sitting on a bench. Kritika Singh says she appreciates the work the police are doing, and didn't mind having a conversation with them. ""You have to know how big a problem eve teasing is in this state. Every girl can tell you horrific incidents they have faced in public places,"" she says. ""Abuse, filthy gestures from men are very common. Sometimes they also end up touching us inappropriately in public places."" Kritika Singh says eve teasing is rampant in Uttar Pradesh Police constable Santosh Paul talks to two young women as the squad moves through the city Her friend Sadhna Maurya agrees. ""I have seen reports about moral policing and that must stop. But the squad should not be shut. I have seen it making a difference. We feel a bit safer now, though not 100%."" She says she has grown up accepting harassment as a reality. ""For the first time something is being done, I am willing to accept it despite its imperfections."" I witnessed similar conversations between the squad and people across the city. We stopped at schools, malls and shopping districts. The squad questions many men, but nobody is detained. ""Our purpose is not to arrest people. We want eve teasers to know that the police are out there to catch them. We want them to change,"" Mr Jadaun says. Each squad shares its experiences each day with senior police officers As the day finishes, the jury still seems to be out on whether the initiative is a success. In some places people, mostly women, appreciated the squad's work. But some still have doubts about its methods. I put this question to the state's top police official, Javeed Ahmed. ""Eve teasing is a reality,"" he said. ""We needed to send a signal that women would be protected and people who harassed them would be dealt with in a strict manner."" He acknowledges that there is a long way to go. ""But I am glad we have made a start,"" he says. ""We can't become a progressive state if women don't feel safe here."" Back at base, the squad hold a briefing to go over the day's events. Superintendent of Police Vipin Tada says it is a chance to identify mistakes. ""They are learning fast. Just remember it's a new initiative for them as well,"" he says. Allahabad's top police officer Shalabh Kumar Mathur says he does not regret putting resources into this initiative. ""Eve teasing is a menace. If the choice is between doing nothing and doing something with scope for improvement, I would pick the latter,"" he says. Images by Ankit Srinivas Â© 2025 BBC.

Why is Harvard putting puritans in the stocks?,"Harvard University has defended plans to remove a reference to ""puritans"" from its ceremonial song, as part of a project promoting ""inclusion and belonging"". The proposal to change the fusty lyrics of a 19th Century song, ""Fair Harvard"", has started a very contemporary argument about identity and how universities represent their own past. Harvard's ""presidential task force on inclusion and belonging"" has announced a competition to find a replacement for the song's ending, which praises the university's puritan heritage: ""Be the herald of Light, and the bearer of Love, Till the stock of the Puritans die."" They want this symbol of Harvard's identity, sung at university ceremonies, to refer to something broader and more inclusive than the starchy New England colonialists. But according to the Harvard Crimson university newspaper, the decision to ditch the reference to puritan founders seems to have had a lukewarm response among students. There were questions raised about the relevance of changing a song from the 1830s that has never really been a source of contention. On Twitter, there were complaints about ""editing history"" and censorship. Academic and social commentator Frank Furedi described it as ""morally disoriented"". How open are the gates to Harvard University? And will song lyrics change that? Even if puritans had once been a dominant force, there was no suggestion that the frugal religious reformers were still getting an unfair advantage in what is now the world's wealthiest university. About half the most recent intake is from an ethnic minority with close to equal proportions of male and female students. But Professor Danielle Allen, co-chair of the university's inclusion task force, said in a statement that the symbols and mottos had to be appropriate for everyone ""regardless of background, identity, religious affiliation or viewpoint"". She said the current university song lyrics suggested that ""the commitment to truth, and to being the bearer of its light, is the special province of those of puritan stock. This is false"". More stories from theBBC's Global education series,externallooking at education from an international perspective, andhow to get in touch. You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. Prof Allen also pointed out that the song had been changed before, with a reference to ""sons"" being changed to something more gender neutral in 1998. And as well as looking for different words, the university is considering an alternative tune or style for the song, with the suggestion of a hip-hop version. This is the latest university battle over emblems and language, with arguments over how institutions should balance their historic roots with the need to appeal to a modern, diverse range of students. These come alongside strongly-contested debates about ""safe spaces"" and ""no-platforming"", with arguments over whether students have a right to block views they find offensive. What does a Harvard student look like? And how should the university reflect its past? But some student campaigners have brought about changes. After a long-running protest,Yale University announced earlier this year that it would re-name Calhoun College, named after a 19th Century advocate of slavery. It is now to be named after a female computer scientist, Grace Murray Hopper. Harvard is dropping the title of ""house master"" because ofconnotations of slavery, and ending the use of a seal that includes the family crest of a notoriously brutal slave trader. The university was once an owner of slaves and has held a series of events and commemorations to examine its own connections to the slave trade. Oxford University has a project to create more diversity in the paintings on display Georgetown University, in a bid to come to terms with its own legacy of slave owning, has promised extra support in the admissions process for anydescendants of slaves sold by the universityin the 1830s. In the UK, there have also been questions about public symbols and memorials. Students at the University of Bristol have called for the re-naming of a building because of claims of historic links with wealth derived from slavery. Oxford University's Oriel College had a high-profile controversy over whether a statue of the Cecil Rhodes should be removed, with protestors arguing that the Victorian magnate's views on race made him an unsuitable figure to be commemorated. But the call for the statue's removal was rejected. Oxford University last month announced that it was putting up more than 20 portraits to ensure more images ofwomen and people from ethnic minorities were represented on its walls. The competition at Harvard to find new words for the university song is open until September. But the debate about university symbols is going to last much longer.

What makes this Easter egg so hard to export?,"There's nothing but air in the middle of most chocolate eggs Cracking open a large chocolate egg to find nothing in the middle is one of life's perennial disappointments. Yet for some chocolate firms the fact that most Easter eggs are hollow is more than just disappointing, it's problematic. ""It sounds ridiculous, but there is a lot of air in Easter eggs relative to their value in weight,"" says Helen Pattinson, co-founder of boutique British chocolate chain Montezuma's. The oval shape of eggs and the boxes required to keep them intact means that, compared to the amount of space they take up in a shipping container, it is impossible for Montezuma's to charge the end customer enough to make a decent profit. Foreign sales account for about a fifth of the company's overall sales and for this financial year, ending in May, it expects exports to hit the Â£1m mark for the first time. Despite the strong demand from abroad, the firm is yet to send its chocolate eggs overseas. ""The economics just haven't added up so far,"" says Mrs Pattinson, who co-founded the firm in 2000 with her husband Simon. More than three-quarters of Montezuma's chocolate exports go to the US, but it is yet to send any eggs The company has six shops in the South East of England and sells directly to customers in the US and Europe via its website, and further afield via export arrangements. So far most of its overseas customers have come via a partnership deal with a large US retailer. Despite the more established reputation of Swiss and Belgian chocolatiers, Mrs Pattinson says she is seeing a growing demand for British-made chocolate. ""The most contemporary artisan foodies are beginning to realise Britain is a fantastic producer of chocolate,"" she says. Last year, the UK exported a whopping Â£245m worth of chocolate, up by almost a quarter on 2015. Exports of unfilled chocolates and chocolate products, which include Easter eggs, totalled just over Â£30m, up 3% on 2015. While the vast majority of these went to EU countries, the biggest growth was in exports to non-EU countries which increased by almost a fifth, according to the Department for International Trade. An ""element of snob value"" is helping British chocolate egg exports in some markets, says Sean Ramsden It is a trend that hasn't escaped the notice of Sean Ramsden, chief executive of Ramsden International. The family firm specialises in exporting British food overseas and Mr Ramsden says Easter is its busiest period after Christmas. The awkward shape of chocolate eggs isn't a problem for the company because it supplies a much wider range of products, enabling it to mix Easter eggs with other food orders. ""Easter eggs are a popular UK product and they're very exportable. They [Easter eggs] are not as advanced in other countries,"" he says. When the Grimsby-based firm first started exporting in 1970, business was largely driven by expats. Marmite, brown sauce and baked beans were the items most in demand in the company's markets in Spain, Portugal, France, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong. Now it delivers to 130 countries and turnover last year was Â£50m. Mr Ramsden says the company's growth reflects demand from a growing global middle class. ""The food becomes premium by virtue of being imported. There is an element of snob value in certain markets,"" he says. Hong Kong-based Sharan Gill always buys imported eggs for her daughters Eysha and Elyna Particularly in Asia, he says, customers are keen to have ""something a little bit different or a bit more exclusive"" such as a foreign brand. But he says many of its customers also have an international outlook, with second homes in the UK, for example, and a genuine affection for British food. Sharan Gill, who lives in Hong Kong, says she always buys imported chocolate eggs for her children at Easter. ""It's a tradition amongst my friends too, both Western and Asian. I spend between 100 to 150 Hong Kong dollars (Â£10-Â£15; $13-$19) on chocolates for the annual Easter egg hunt, which my kids thoroughly enjoy. ""Easter seems to be a growing trend, partly because clubs and restaurants promote it extensively. ""Plus Hong Kong has a large expat community, a large proportion of which consists of Westerners, for whom Easter is an established tradition. It is also celebrated by the predominantly Catholic Filipino community who form a large part of the domestic helper workforce,"" she says. Good Housekeeping magazine included Easter crackers on its Easter dinner table photo shoot for the first time this year The fervour surrounding the Christian festival has reached such fever pitch that the home and lifestyle gurus at Good Housekeeping magazine recently declared the occasion ""a second Christmas"". Theresa May criticises Cadbury over Easter egg hunt Co-op's 'Treat your daughter' Easter egg adverts changed It is not just small firms benefiting from the growing sense of occasion. Marks and Spencer says it exports a number of its popular eggs to its 468 shops overseas, with them selling particularly well in Hong Kong, Western Europe and the Czech Republic. ""We're seeing double-digit growth on sales of our Easter eggs internationally - with people buying into both our large 'giftable' eggs as well as impulse purchasing small bags of chocolate foiled eggs and bigger bags of eggs for Easter egg hunts - an event which is increasing in popularity,"" says a spokeswoman. People really like the licensed character eggs and Star Wars' R2D2 is currently the best seller internationally, she adds. Marks and Spencer's R2D2 egg is its most popular internationally While market research firm Mintel doesn't track British chocolate exports, its figures show people around the world are eating more chocolate eggs. ""In Brazil, for example, the trade association ABICAB reported that 95 million chocolate Easter eggs were sold in 2016, a 19% increase over 2015. In that country, Easter eggs make up a major percentage of annual chocolate revenues,"" says global food and drink analyst Marcia Mogelonsky. ""In Ireland, consumers spent more than 40m euros (Â£34m; $42m) on Easter eggs in 2016, while the UK Easter egg market was valued at Â£220m."" It is a market that Montezuma's Mrs Pattinson is obviously keen to exploit. ""It's about putting our new product development heads on to find ones that don't have so much air inside,"" she laughs.

Women's scratch race Italy's Rachele Barbieri pips GB rider Elinor Barker at the death to take the gold medal.Â Today's events Teams comprise four riders, racing over 4km. Two teams are on the track at the same time, one starting on the back straight, one on the home straight. The rules are simple - complete the distance in the quickest time possible, or catch your opponents in the final to win. Drafting is crucial with riders racing millimetres behind each other. The time is stopped when the front wheel of the third rider crosses the line. This allows one member of the team to drop out during the race. Qualifying rounds now feature two teams on the track at once instead of one. Today's events The men race over 15km, the women 10km - the simplest of races. There are no intermediate sprints or points to be won. The winner is the first rider to cross the finish line. Â Today's events The men's race is a three-lap, three-rider team time trial. After each lap, one rider drops out, leaving one man to race the final lap on his own. The women's race is a two-lap, two-rider affair. The quickest eight teams in qualifying proceed to the first competition round and the fastest two teams from that round compete against each other in the final for the gold medal, with the next two fastest going through to race for the bronze medal. Olympic champions Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Steven Burke and Callum Skinner have been named in the squad of 20 riders, of whom 10 are making their World Championship debut. Great Britain will hope to match theirÂtable-topping five gold medalsÂ from last year's event in London but are without a number of star names. Six-time Olympic champion Jason Kenny and four-time Olympic gold medallist wife Laura, who areÂexpecting their first child,Â will miss the championships, while Bradley Wiggins has retired and Mark Cavendish is focusing on road racing.
