EU will not renegotiate NI Protocol - Å efÄoviÄ,"Maros Å efÄoviÄ says he has ""no mandate"" to renegotiate the Northern Ireland Protocol European Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ has said he is ""not ready to renegotiate"" the Northern Ireland Protocol. On Wednesday, he revealed aplan to reduce post-Brexit checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. It seeks to calm a long-running dispute over a key part of the Brexit deal. He told the BBC that the EU was ready to discuss issues and concerns with the protocol. Mr Å efÄoviÄ added that the EU would ""respect deals we have signed which became international law"". But he said he had ""no mandate to renegotiate protocol"". Northern Ireland's special Brexit deal keeps it in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. Most food products will not need to be physically checked when arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain A cut to the required administration for Northern Ireland importers Expanded trusted trader arrangements meaning more products and companies are exempt from customs tariffs Change to current laws to ensure no disruption to  moving medicines across the Irish Sea Improved engagement with stakeholders in Northern Ireland including politicians and business groups The UK says the arrangement imposes too many barriers, as goods arriving from Britain face checks and controls. The EU says its new plan would remove about 80% of spot checks and cut customs paperwork by 50%. However, the measures fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) - the EU's highest court - from an oversight role. On Tuesday, the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frostproposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing one. As part of these plans, the UK government wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the ECJ. The Brexit agreement states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland - so for example, if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ. The protocol avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland Speaking to BBC NI's The View programme on Thursday, Mr Å efÄoviÄ said: ""I do not see how we can have access to the single market without oversight from the European Court of Justice."" Mr Å efÄoviÄ said he wants to see a revised protocol agreement signed off ""before the end of the year"". He said he hopes to ""start the new year with a new agreement and with a positive new EU/UK agenda"". ""I have demonstrated I can do a lot, I am testing flexibility within the protocol but we should respect it and look how practically we can resolve the problems linked to protocol,"" he said. ""I am ready to go at big lengths to achieve that."" He said the EU's proposal is ""far reaching"" and that he is ""delivering on my promise that I would do whatever it takes to deliver on concerns linked with medicine supply"". Former UK Brexit secretary David Davis cast doubt on a deal made before Christmas, but said he believed Mr Å efÄoviÄ was ""trying very hard"" to achieve this. But he told The View that if the EU refused to make concessions on the oversight role of European Court of Justice,Article 16would be triggered as a result. The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal:It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU). It means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules:As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland. But some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all:EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found. Read more:The Northern Ireland Protocol explained The UK government said it was studying the detail of the EU's proposals. Lord Frost is meeting Mr Å efÄoviÄ in Brussels on Friday to begin this process, and talks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are likely to go on for several weeks. Mr Å efÄoviÄ met with four of Northern Ireland's main party leaders on Thursday. Speaking after the meeting, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said agreement with the EU is possible, even though unionists believe the proposed changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol did not go far enough. Sir Jeffrey said officials from the EU and UK would meet later this week. ""What the EU have put on the table falls well short of what we need,"" he said. ""But progress is being made and we need to see more progress in the next few days."" Some unionists in Northern Ireland have held street protests against the protocol Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the EU proposals may be attractive to some but ""to other sectors they have been oversold and will under-deliver"" as they did not deal with some core issues. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said the proposals demonstrated ""generous flexibility"" and called on the UK Government to show the same willingness to reach an accommodation. Mr Eastwood called on Sir Jeffrey to withdrawhis threat to collapse the devolved institutions, in light of the movement made by EU leaders. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill reiterated her support for the protocol and the EU's ""practical proposals to ensure it works more smoothly for local businesses"". ""It is time for the British government to put an end to the bluster and to engage constructively with the process of trying to find solutions to the practical issues that need to be addressed,"" she said. Sinn FÃ©in areseeking a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly, but that looks unlikely to happen as their recall petition has not been signed by any other parties. Speaking on Wednesday, Alliance leader Naomi Long said there was ""a bit of gameplay going on"". ""It worries me that the EU have dealt with all of those issues, the practical and pragmatic things, that businesses and politicians have raised and as soon as they get within touching distance of a really improved situation, suddenly it's about the ECJ,"" she said. Brexit has led to new checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland At the start of the year, the new post-Brexit arrangement -known as the Northern Ireland Protocol- was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It involves keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods - but this, in turn, creates a new trade border with Great Britain. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK. Brexit Minister Lord Frost has said the protocol was harming the peace process in Northern Irelandand that it undermined the Good Friday Agreement. The EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and is now attempting to ease that burden with what it calls ""a different model"". Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? Katya Adler: Will talks lead to truce or trade war? 'We do see opportunities, but have had problems' A UK government spokesperson welcomed Mr Å efÄoviÄ's efforts to address the concerns about the protocol, adding that the UK was studying these proposals with officials working closely with their EU counterparts to understand the detail. ""Nevertheless it is clear there is still a substantial gap between our two positions,"" said the spokesperson. ""We need to discuss them intensively in the days to come to see if the gaps can be bridged and a solution found which delivers the significant change needed."" There are also plans to give Northern Ireland politicians and other interested parties greater influence over the implementation of the protocol. The View is onBBC iPlayer.

Cheaper Covid travel tests to start on 24 October,"New rules allowing travellers returning to England to take lateral flow tests instead of more expensive PCR tests will come into force on 24 October. The government says the changes will take effect in time for families returning from half term breaks. Fully vaccinated passengers will be told to upload photos of their Covid-19 tests for verification. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would make travel easier and simpler. The travel industry had said it was vital to make the changes to the Covid travel tests in time for the half term holiday. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said: ""This is great news and we're pleased to get it over the line in time for the crucial half term period, which will be a massive relief to families desperate to get away this autumn."" Along with last week's reduction of the travel red list and the recognition of vaccinations administered in more foreign countries, the change is ""a major step forward that will support the desperately needed recovery of our sector,"" he said. What tests do I need to holiday abroad? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Lateral flow test more accurate than first thought The changes come as the UK continues to record the highest level of Covid-19 infections and deaths in western Europe, with another 45,066 cases recorded on Thursday - the largest number since late July. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how lateral flow tests work and how to do one A further 157 deaths were also recorded. Policy on travel is devolved, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have previously aligned with policy in England, citing the practicalities of the shared border. But Wales criticised replacing PCR tests, which are often described as the gold standard for Covid testing, with lateral flow tests, saying that along with other relaxed measures it would ""considerably increase"" the risk of new variants coming into the country. Under the existing system, PCR tests taken on day two after returning to England can cost about Â£75 per person. When the changes come into effect, anyone who receives a positive result from their lateral flow test will be required to self-isolate and to take a free PCR test to confirm it. Travellers due to arrive in England from 24 October onwards will be able to order their lateral flow tests from 22 October, when a list of approved providers will be published on the gov.uk website. NHS Test and Trace tests - which can be ordered for free - cannot be used for international travel, the government said. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We want to make going abroad easier and cheaper, whether you're travelling for work or visiting friends and family."" He said the change was made possible by the high levels of vaccination, which means ""we can safely open up travel as we learn to live with the virus"". Mr Shapps said: ""Taking away expensive mandatory PCR testing will boost the travel industry and is a major step forward in normalising international travel and encouraging people to book holidays with confidence.""

What is the NI Protocol?,"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

NHS in bleak position as A&E waits worsen - doctors,"A&E waits have sunk to their worst levels in England since the four-hour target started, with doctors warning the situation is bleak ahead of winter. A quarter of patients waited more than four hours for treatment in September - with even longer waits being recorded elsewhere in the UK. It comes as ministers and GPs clashed over demands that practices see more patients face-to-face. The government has handed GP practices Â£250m to take on temporary staff. But the British Medical Association said they were ""hugely dismayed"" with the plan, saying it would not solve the problems. This video can not be played Pandemic healthcare: 'Most GPs are probably working 12 to 14 hour days at least.' The winter rescue package came on the day NHS England released its latest monthly data for hospital performance. Lack of access to GPs has been cited as one of the reasons for growing pressures on A&Es. The A&E performance in England was the worst performance since 2004, when the four-hour target was brought in. Even greater numbers are waiting over four hours in the other nations with four in 10 patients in Northern Ireland taking over four hours to be seen. In England, A&E patients who then went on to be admitted to a ward also faced record-long waits for a bed, so-called ""trolley waits"" - they tend to be the most seriously-ill and frail patients. Of the 386,000 who were admitted, more than a quarter waited over four hours for a bed to become free. And more than 5,000 had to wait over 12 hours. Dr Katherine Henderson, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: ""This data is bleak and is a stark warning of the crisis that we are heading towards this winter."" She added that emergency departments were ""dangerously"" over-crowded and there were widespread reports of ambulances queuing outside hospital because of the demands being placed on the system. The Â£250m funding plan for GPs is part of the extra Â£5bn Covid fund announced last month to help the NHS through the winter. It comes on top of the Â£12bn set aside for GP services this year. Alongside locum doctors - doctors who stand in for others temporarily - GP practices will be able to use the money to recruit other temporary staff such as physios and podiatrists. Pharmacists are also being encouraged to see people with minor illness to relieve the pressure on GPs. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the new GP rescue package would help relieve pressure on the whole system. Only 58% of patients were seen face-to-face in August - the first full month following the ending of restrictions. That compares with 54% in January and more than 80% before the pandemic. Patients have also complained of long waits on phone lines to book an appointment. Kevin Fogarty said his 84-year-old mother was initially refused face-to-face contact with a GP, despite having an infection in her leg following a biopsy. ""She had not been seen for two years. However, an infection developed in the wound but the GP still wouldn't see her. We had to put pressure on them."" Mr Fogarty, 60, said the practice in Somerset eventually agreed to see her in person and she is now getting home visits from a nurse to tend to her wound. ""GPs seem to be the only group not getting back to normal services, while the likes of shop workers and everyone else are getting on with it. ""Telephone and video calls are helpful as an initial consultation, but the GP must see the patient should they insist or there is a requirement."" Alongside the extra money, social distancing rules are also expected to be relaxed in GP surgeries and responsibility for signing fitness-to-work and fitness-to-drive certificates will be able to be passed on to other staff. Mr Javid said: ""I'm determined to ensure patients can see their GP in the way they want, no matter where they live. ""Our new plan provides general practice teams with investment and targeted support. This will tackle underperformance, taking pressure off staff so they can spend more time with patients and increase the number of face-to-face appointments."" GP surgeries will be named in league tables if they are judged to have failed to provide an appropriate level of ""access"". But Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said he was ""hugely dismayed"" with the package. ""It offers very little and shows a government out of touch with the scale of the crisis on the ground."" He said patients would ""continue to suffer"" and find it harder to book appointments. ""It is disappointing to see there is no end in sight to the preoccupation with face-to-face appointments."" He said in-person appointments were still a key feature of GP care but the pandemic had proven phone or video consultations were ""entirely appropriate and appreciated"" by many. The rescue package comes amid the government's ongoing struggle to increase the number of GPs. Over the past five years the total - in terms of full-time posts - has fallen despite successive government drives to increase numbers. NHS Providers, which represents health bosses, said its members were particularly worried about A&Es alongside mental health and cancer services. Deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said: ""The NHS is fighting fires on multiple fronts as they try to recover care backlogs, increased demand for emergency care, treating patients with Covid and preparing for what is likely to be the most challenging winter yet for the NHS. ""In a matter of weeks, we will face our first winter where both flu and Covid are in circulation.""

Banksy's Love is in the Bin sells for record Â£16m,"Oliver Barker brought down the hammer on the record sale A Banksy artwork which shredded itself at a previous auction has sold for a record Â£16m. Love is in the Bin was what remained of the artist'slive destructionof his piece Girl with Balloon, which sold for Â£1m in 2018. It went under the hammer at Sotheby's in London on Thursday, selling for Â£16m - vastly over its Â£4-6m guide price. Including a buyer's premium, the purchaser paid Â£18.5m in total. The sale, which saw nine bidders battle for around 10 minutes, beats theprevious record of Â£16.8mset for Banksy in March. After closing bidding, auctioneer Oliver Barker joked he was relieved that the artwork was ""still there"". Before opening the bidding, Mr Barker said that the painting became an ""unexpected piece of performance art"" when it shredded in the same auction room after being sold to a ""private European investor"" three years ago. Opening bids at Â£2.5m, its price tag hit Â£10m within minutes as numerous offers were placed. Bidding then gradually climbed to a record Â£15m as the race progressively narrowed down between fewer bidders. There were a few tentative moments after bidder Nick Buckley Wood, representing a private investor, waited to see if anyone would outdo his client's Â£16m offer. A shake of the head from his rival finally indicated they were out of the running. Mr Barker said: ""At Â£16m ladies and gentlemen we are selling the Banksy at Sotheby's. ""You were here for this fantastic moment."" He then drew laughter from the audience after saying: ""I can't tell you how terrified I am to bring down this hammer."" Auctioneer Oliver Barker opens bidding In keeping with his irreverent guerrilla style, Love is in the Bin saw Banksy poke fun at the art world. Sotheby's contemporary art chairman Alex Branczik said the stunt ""did not so much destroy an artwork by shredding it, but instead created one"". ""Today, this piece is considered heir to a venerated legacy of anti-establishment art,"" he added, labelling it as ""the ultimate Banksy artwork and a true icon of recent art history"". This video can not be played The anonymous artist uploaded a video of the destruction onto Instagram but soon deleted the post Back in 2018, moments after the hammer fell at the auction, alarms sounded and the canvas dropped through a hidden shredder built into the bottom. The unnamed European woman who bought the piece said: ""At first I was shocked, but I realised I would end up with my own piece of art history."" Former BBC arts editor Will Gompertz wrote at the time that he believed Love is in the Bin would go on to be seen as ""one of the most significant artworks of the early 21st Century"". ""It is not a great painting that can be compared to a late Rembrandt, or a sculpture to sit alongside Michelangelo's David, but in terms of conceptual art emanating from [Marcel] Duchamp's Dadaist sensibility, it is exceptional,"" he added.

PM said he would 'tear up' NI Protocol - Paisley,"Ian Paisley, seen here with Boris Johnson on a visit to a bus factory in 2016, said the PM had agreed tot he protocol 'for the semantics' Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would tear up the Northern Ireland Protocol shortly after he made the EU deal, DUP MP Ian Paisley has claimed. The PM reportedly made the remarks before MPs voted on the deal in 2019. The claims followed comments from Boris Johnson's ex-adviser who saidthe plan was to ""ditch the bits we didn't like"". That prompted the Irish deputy PM to warn countries considering trade deals with the UK that it is a nation that ""doesn't necessarily keep its word"". The protocol, agreed by the EU and UK in the Brexit deal, keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But the UK now says the arrangement imposes too many barriers, as it means goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Britain face checks and controls. This video can not be played PM told me he planned to 'tear up' NI Protocol On Wednesday,the EU revealed its plan to reduce checks on those goods. The proposals include scrapping checks on most food products being shipped to, and remaining in, Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The EU said their new plan would remove about 80% of spot checks and cut customs paperwork by 50%. However, the measures fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from an oversight role. The UK government said it was studying the detail of the EU's proposals. ""Boris Johnson did tell me personally that he would, after agreeing to the protocol, he would sign up to changing that protocol and indeed tearing it up, that this was just for the semantics,"" Mr Paisley told the BBC's Newsnight programme. ""Now that comment has been verified by another source [Dominic Cummings] much closer to Boris Johnson within his own government,"" added the North Antrim MP. The conversation between Mr Johnson and Mr Paisley allegedly took place just before the first House of Commons vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement in October 2019. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar casts doubt on the trustworthiness of the British government. On Tuesday, Downing Street's former strategy chief Dominic Cummings tweeted that he had planned in the autumn of 2019 to get the prime minister to ""ditch bits"" of the Brexit deal. In a series of tweets, Mr Cummings - who has turned against Mr Johnson since being removed from Downing Street at the end of 2020 - claimed the prime minister never understood what the withdrawal agreement really meant. He also dismissed suggestions that abandoning elements of the deal would mean breaking international law. ""Our priorities meant e.g. getting Brexit done is 10,000 times more important than lawyers yapping re international law in negotiations with people who break international law all the time,"" he said. The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal:It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU). It means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules:As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland. But some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all:EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found. Read more:The Northern Ireland Protocol explained The tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister), Leo Varadkar, said Mr Cummings' claims ""must resonate around the world"". ""Essentially now what Dominic Cummings is saying is that this is a country that makes treaties, that strikes agreements and then intends to renege on them,"" he added. ""Don't make any agreement with the British government; don't sign any treaty with the United Kingdom, until you can be confident that this is a country that can honour its promises."" However, when asked about Mr Cummings claims, Brexit negotiator Lord Frost said: ""We all understood extremely well what the deal meant, it delivered on democracy, took the UK out of the EU whole and entire, and it was a very good deal."" Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? Katya Adler: Will talks lead to truce or trade war? 'We do see opportunities, but have had problems' But he said it now had to be changed because it was ""undermining the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, not supporting it"". ""The problem with the protocol at the moment is that EU law, with the European Court of Justice as the enforcer, is applied in Northern Ireland without any democratic process. That has to change if we are to find governance arrangements people can live with,"" he said. Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leaderMichelle O'Neill has urged a recall the Northern Ireland Assemblyto demonstrate support for the NI Protocol, following the EU's proposal.

Overseas abattoir workers to get temporary visas,"The government is to allow 800 foreign abattoir workers into the UK on temporary visas, after warnings from farmers of mass culls. It previously said businesses should pay higher wages and invest in skills. The shortage of butchers has already seen farmers destroy 6,600 healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the National Pig Association (NPA) said. The government also announced plans to allow thousands more HGV deliveries to address a chronic driver shortage. Labour shortage human disaster for pig farms - NFU PM not taking pig cull threat seriously, says vet Abattoir labour shortage sees farmer kill piglets The meat industry blames the butcher shortage on factors including Covid and Brexit. Thousands of healthy pigs have been culled since last week,when the tally was about 600. Last week,the National Farmer's Union (NFU) warnedthat pig farmers were ""facing a human disaster"" due to the shortage of butchers. It said that ""empty retail shelves and product shortages are becoming increasingly commonplace and Christmas specialities such as pigs in blankets are already under threat"". The government is temporarily extending its seasonal workers scheme to pork butchers, it said. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the new measures were only temporary, not a long term solution Up to 800 pork butchers will be eligible to apply until the end of the year for six-month visas. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ""A unique range of pressures on the pig sector over recent months, such as the impacts of the pandemic and its effect on export markets, have led to the temporary package of measures we are announcing. ""This is the result of close working with industry to understand how we can support them through this challenging time."" The government added that the temporary visas ""are not a long term solution and businesses must make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce to build a high-wage, high-skill economy, instead of relying on overseas labour"". Alongside the temporary visas, the government announced a package of measures for the industry, including: Animals being slaughtered and processed on a Saturday Longer working days in the meat industry, where possible A ""private storage aid scheme"" which will allow processors to store slaughtered pigs for three to six months Suspending nearly Â£1m of tax on pig farmers and producers in November It said there had been ""a suspension of approval to export to China for some UK pork establishments"" and that it was working with the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board to identify other export markets. The extension of visa requirements for butchers follows the announcement of temporary visas for lorry drivers and poultry workers,as the government seeks to limit disruption in the run-up to Christmas. But the first foreign HGV drivers brought in on the new visa scheme may not arrive for another month, sources told BBC transport correspondent Carrie Davies. The visa scheme for HGV drivers to deliver food, opened for applications on Monday. The Home Office has not confirmed the number of visas that have been applied for so far, but several agencies that are recruiting the drivers told the BBC that they were yet to apply for them. More heavy good vehicle drivers are being trained after the government simplified the qualification process in September A chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which the haulage industry has said is due to factors that include Covid and Brexit, has affected businesses including petrol stations and supermarkets. The government announced on Thursday that it planned to temporarily allow lorries from the EU to make more deliveries, as part of efforts to address the shortage. At the moment, EU lorries can only make two ""cabotage"" trips per week. Cabotage refers to loading or unloading goods in one country when a vehicle is registered in another country. The government wants to relax this rule to temporarily allow EU lorries to make unlimited pick-ups and drop-offs within a two week period.

Ministers attend cross-border health meeting,"Stormont politicians have joined a North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting, the first sincethe Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) boycottwas ruled unlawful. It went ahead after First Minister Paul Givan agreed to the agenda. He said it was in line with his party's position,which allows for meetings on health issues. The DUP refuses to attend north-south talks in protest againstthe Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is part of the Brexit deal agreed in 2019 and was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Givan defends DUP boycott of north-south meetings DUP boycott of north-south meetings 'unlawful' DUP snubs second north-south meeting in days The DUP boycott, announced by party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson last month,was ruled unlawful by a high court judge on Monday. When asked on Thursday whether the DUP would continue their boycott, Sir Jeffrey told BBC Radio Foyle ""our position remains as it has been"". First Minister Paul Givan has rejected criticism of the DUP for not attending previous north-south meetings Health Minister Robin Swann is due to meet his Republic of Ireland counterpart, Stephen Donnelly at the meeting. While Sir Jeffrey had promised health meetings would go ahead,other meetings have been cancelled. The DUP has said it is considering Monday's judgement. ""We will take a view on how we respond to that [court ruling] and I will speak to my senior leadership team,"" he added. Meanwhile a â¬1bn (Â£849m) peace funding package has been approved by the NSMC after the executive. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Neighbour wins privacy row over smart doorbell,"A judge has ruled that security cameras and a Ring doorbell installed in a house in Oxfordshire ""unjustifiably invaded"" the privacy of a neighbour. Dr Mary Fairhurst claimed that the devices installed on the house of neighbour Jon Woodard broke data laws and contributed to harassment. The judge upheld both these claims. Mr Woodard now faces a substantial fine. He claimed he installed the devices in good faith as a deterrent against burglars. The origin of the row stems from an invitation from Mr Woodard to his neighbour Dr Fairhurst to have a tour of his home renovations, during which she claimed he showed off his new security system. The judgment reads that Dr Fairhurst was ""alarmed and appalled"" to notice that he had a camera mounted on his shed and that footage from it was sent to his smartphone. A series of disputes about the cameras followed, which resulted in Dr Fairhurst moving out of her home. In the judgement it was found that the Ring doorbell captured images of the claimant's house and garden, while the shed camera covered almost the whole of her garden and her parking space. Amazon rolls out encryption for Ring doorbells Amazon's Ring video doorbells catch fire because wrong screw used FBI worried that Ring doorbells are spying on police Judge Melissa Clarke found that audio data collected by cameras on a shed, in a driveway and on the Ring doorbell was processed unlawfully. She noted that at the time it was not possible to turn off the audio recording facility - that happened in an update in 2020. She said that she found the audio data that could capture conversations ""even more problematic and detrimental than video data"". ""Personal data may be captured from people who are not even aware that the device is there, or that it records and processes audio and personal data,"" she said in her judgement. That, she said, was in breach of UK data laws - both the UK Data Protection Act and UK GDPR. Amazon, which made both the doorbell and the cameras, said that customers must ""respect their neighbours' privacy, and comply with any applicable laws when using their Ring device."" ""We've put features in place across all our devices to ensure privacy, security and user control remain front and centre - including customisable privacy zones to block out 'off-limit' areas, motion zones to control the areas customers want their Ring device to detect motion, and Audio Toggle to turn audio on and off."" But the judge added: ""Even if an activation zone is disabled so that the camera does not activate to film by movement in that area, activation by movement in one of the other non-disabled activation zones will cause the camera to film across the whole field of view."" The Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC: ""Lots of people use domestic CCTV and video doorbells. If you own one, you should respect people's privacy rights and take steps to minimise intrusion to neighbours and passers-by."" But it added: ""In the vast number of cases, there are no issues."" Hannah Hart, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy, said: ""Whilst this case doesn't set a legal precedent, it does continue an ongoing conversation about our changing attitude towards domestic surveillance - and how normalised it has become in our communities. ""The fact remains that anyone with a Ring doorbell can turn their area of the neighbourhood into a surveillance space due to its video recording functionality and audio processors which are able to pick up sound 40 feet away. ""This means a small number of residents can effectively transform public spaces into surveillance hotbeds, and even share their recordings with police.""

Norway attack appears to be terrorism - officials,"This video can not be played Norway attack witness: ""I heard a distinct thunk sound"" A deadly bow and arrow attack in Norway which left five people dead appears to have been an act of terror, Norway's security service (PST) said. The suspect, a 37-year-old Danish citizen named Espen Andersen Brathen, had converted to Islam and there were fears he had been radicalised. However a motive has not yet been determined. He is accused of killing four women and a man on Wednesday night in the southern town of Kongsberg. Ina press release,externalon Thursday (in Norwegian), police said Brathen was due to appear in court on Friday at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT). A police lawyer told public broadcaster NRK he would be assessed by psychiatrists. During a press conference PST head Hans Sverre Sjovold said the suspect had been ""in and out of the health system for some time"". Residents have been deeply shaken by the violence. Flags were flown at half-mast on Thursday while flowers and other memorials were placed in Kongsberg's main square. The victims were all aged between 50 and 70, regional police chief Ole Bredrup Saeverud told reporters at a Thursday morning news briefing. What we know about the Norway bow and arrow attack The attack was first reported at 18:13 (16:13 GMT) on Wednesday. Police confronted the man six minutes later, but he shot several arrows at them and escaped. He was eventually caught about 30 minutes later. It was during this time, between being first approached and then arrested, that the victims were killed, the police chief said. A woman was also stabbed at a nearby intersection, witnesses told local media. Police fired warning shots when he was eventually arrested, but it is not clear if officers were armed when they first came across the suspect. Norwegian police do not usually carry guns on them - weapons are stored at police stations or in their patrol cars. The attack was Norway's deadliest since far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik murdered 77 people, most of them teenagers, on the island of Utoya in July 2011. The attacker allegedly launched the assault inside a Coop Extra supermarket on Kongsberg's west side. One of those injured was an off-duty police officer who was in the shop at the time. The officer and another person who was wounded are recovering in hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police on Thursday said a third person had also been injured, and was taken to the emergency room. Police prosecutor Ann IrÃ©n Svane Mathiassen told NRK that from what they could tell all those attacked were ""completely random victims"". She said the police believed the man went into people's homes to kill them during the attack. One witness told local outlet TV2 she had heard a commotion and saw a woman taking cover, then a ""man standing on the corner with arrows in a quiver on his shoulder and a bow in his hand"". ""Afterwards, I saw people running for their lives. One of them was a woman holding a child by the hand,"" she added. Police have told Norwegian news agency NTB that the attacker also used other weapons during the incident, without giving more details. Residents have placed tributes for those killed in Kongsberg town centre The suspect moved over a large area, and authorities cordoned off several parts of the town. Residents were ordered to stay indoors so authorities could examine the scene and gather evidence. Police searched surrounding gardens and garages with the help of sniffer dogs. Kongsberg Mayor Kari Anne Sand said it was a shocking attack in an area where many people lived, and that a crisis team would help anyone affected. Describing the town as ""a completely ordinary community with completely ordinary people"", Ms Sand said everyone had been deeply shaken by ""this very tragic situation"". British woman Fiona Herland, who has lived in Kongsberg for five years, described the town as ""a very warm, cosy place - nothing happens here."" ""This is absolutely devastating. You can feel the atmosphere here has darkened,"" she told the BBC. Espen Andersen Brathen is set to appear in court at 09:00 local time on Friday Officers took the suspect to a police station in the town of Drammen, where his defence lawyer, Fredrik Neumann, said he was questioned for more than three hours and was co-operating with authorities. The suspect had a Danish mother and Norwegian father, he said. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Danish authorities will work with their Norwegian counterparts on the investigation. Police prosecutor Ann IrÃ©n Svane Mathiassen told TV2 that the man lived in Kongsberg and was known to police. The attack came on the final day of then-Prime Minister Erna Solberg's conservative government. On Thursday morning, Labour leader Jonas Gahr Store became Norway's new Prime minister with a centre-left coalition. Mr Store said it was a ""gruesome and brutal act"". NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, who is from Oslo, said it was ""shocking news"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nurses' 3% pay rise dispute with Welsh government,"NHS nurses now feel ""undervalued, disenfranchised and angry"", says the RCN A nurses' trade union has lodged a formal dispute with the Welsh government over a 3% NHS pay rise. Wales' health minister previously announced the rise recognised""the dedication and commitment of hardworking NHS staff"". But the Royal College of Nursing Wales' (RCN) director said nurses now felt ""undervalued"". The Welsh government said it followed recommendations from the NHS Pay Review Body and Dentist Review Body. NHS workers in Wales to get 3% pay rise What is the state of NHS pay? RCN Wales director Helen Whyley said a formal trade dispute would warn the government that if it would not open pay negotiations, the trade union body would begin steps towards industrial action. ""For the past 18 months nursing staff have gone above and beyond in their response to the Covid-19 pandemic, but now they feel undervalued, disenfranchised and angry,"" she said. Ms Whyley said 94% of the trade union body's members who voted in a consultative ballot, voted that a 3% pay rise was ""totally unacceptable"". ""Despite the first ministerannouncing Â£991m of new funding,externalavailable for NHS Wales, none of it has been earmarked for nurses' pay,"" she said. ""Patients are waiting for treatment and care and nursing staff are needed to deliver that."" She added onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""Nobody wants to rush into any form of industrial action, but my members and nurses, they're really clear: 94% of them voted to say that 3% is not acceptable. ""We want the government to get back round the table, we want to get this sorted out, we want more nurses to be better valued and stay in our NHS so we can get on with doing what we do well as nurses - caring for patients."" She also called on the Welsh government to address ""over 1,700 vacancies for registered nurses"" in NHS Wales. RCN Wales board chair Richard Jones said: ""We do not wish to take steps towards industrial action, but the anger and frustration of our members is clear."" In response, the Welsh government said the 3% for NHS staff was a recommendation ""based on evidence submitted by all parties including trade unions"". ""We hope NHS workers understand how much we value their work and appreciate everything they have done."" It said it has had ""a number of constructive meetings"" on how to ""enhance the pay award for NHS Wales"". ""While it is disappointing that the RCN felt unable to participate in these discussions, we remain committed to offering a package of enhancements within the funding available. ""While we want to invest in our workforce we also need to invest in delivering vital NHS services."" It added that on top of the pay rise, it had awarded NHS staff a one-off payment of Â£735 per person - which after deductions, would be Â£500 for most.

"Border boat staff don't need immunity, says union","A group of people thought to be migrants are brought in to Dover, Kent, aboard a Border Force vessel Border force staff do not need immunity from prosecution if a refugee crossing the Channel dies, their union has said. Home Secretary Priti Patel is reported to be considering such a move to give legal protection to staff ordered to ""push back"" migrant boats. But the ISU union said seafaring staff already complied with international laws on the protection of life. They acted ethically because it was the right thing to do - not out of fear of prosecution, the union added. Last month, officials were authorised to use the so-called ""pushback"" tactic, if personally approved by Ms Patel. Migrant boats could be turned back in new UK move Are migrant 'pushbacks' in the Channel legal? Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? More than 12,600 migrants have made the journey across the English Channel so far this year. Ms Patel has vowed to crack down on organised crime gangs who smuggle people to the UK for profit - and said the new Nationality and Borders Bill will seek to ""break their business model"". In September, the Home Office confirmed border officials will have the authority to turn boats away in limited circumstances and only with the prior approval of the home secretary. It has sparked fears that border officials could be subject to prosecution if a migrant drowns. A report in the Guardian,externalnewspaper says Ms Patel will respond to those concerns by inserting a clause in to theNationality and Borders Bill,externalto give staff legal protection against prosecution. The government has not yet published all the details of the Bill, although it does outline maritime enforcement measures to make ""pushbacks"" easier. But critics have cast doubt on whether the new powers would ever be used in practice because Border Force commanders, like everyone else at sea, are under an international legal obligation to protect life where possible. Lucy Moreton, of the ISU union, said Border Force staff would not ""recklessly or deliberately endanger life"" if they did not have immunity from prosecution. ""Ms Patel's approach appears to suggest that she believes staff are only held back out of fear of prosecution for any loss of life.  That is simply not the case."" In addition, UK law could not ""protect an officer from prosecution in another jurisdiction, for example in France or internationally"", they added. ""Such a measure would likely be subject to significant and lengthy legal challenge. Immunity could not, for example, be infinite. ""There will inevitably, and correctly, be challenges to the extent of an officer's actions should a death result."" Minnie Rahman, interim chief executive of the the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said pushing small boats back is ""extremely dangerous"" and ""similar tactics have been linked to hundreds of deaths in the Mediterranean"". ""Once again it seems that government is intent on using refugees as a political football, instead of taking the practical steps needed to end dangerous crossings for good, by working with the French and establishing safe, regulated means of travel for people seeking asylum in the UK"", she added. Labour is still waiting to see the full proposals but Shadow Home Secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: ""The Conservatives do not respect the rule of law. These provisions would be unconscionable"". If migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British port If they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take them Each country has search-and-rescue zones An EU law called Dublin III allows asylum seekers to be transferred back to the first member state they were proven to have entered but the UK is no longer part of this arrangement and has not agreed a new scheme to replace it In a statement, the Home Office said: ""We are seeing an unacceptable rise in dangerous Channel crossings and as part of our ongoing operational response, we continue to evaluate and test a range of safe and legal options for stopping small boats. ""The health, safety and wellbeing of our staff is paramount when undertaking all of their operational duties."" ""That's why we provide extensive training and provide operational procedures that comply and are delivered in accordance with domestic and international law.""

Rail disruption warning as COP26 strikes confirmed,"The Scottish government will take over ScotRail from Abellio in March of next year Scotland's rail network will be hit by strikes during the UN climate summit in Glasgow, a union has confirmed. The RMT said members who work for ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper will stage industrial action during COP26 in an ongoing row over pay. ScotRail staff will strike from 00:01 on Monday 1 November until 23:59 on Friday 12th November. The summit, which is expected to draw thousands of people to Glasgow, runs from 31 October until 12 November. Sleeper staff will strike on Sunday 31 October from 11:59 until 11:58 hours on Tuesday 2 November and again for 48 hours on Thursday 11 November from 11:59. GMB cleansing workers in Glasgow and Unite's Stagecoach staff have also voted to strike during COP26. A spokesman for ScotRail said the ""highly damaging"" strike action was ""extremely disappointing"" as it faced a serious financial crisis in the wake of the pandemic. Transport Minister Graeme Dey told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that the RMT was in receipt of a ""very fair"" pay proposal. But he added many of its members will have voted for strike action ""unaware of the offer that is now on the table"". Mr Dey also described the two-year deal, which he said has been backed by the three other unions involved, was ""the best offer that can be made in the circumstances"". Why are ScotRail workers striking during COP26? New pay offer in bid to halt ScotRail strikes It is the latest stage in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions and proposed cuts to services at the rail operator, which wants to reduce the number of services across Scotlandby 300 a day from next May. Reacting to Mr Dey's comments, Michael Hogg from the RMT union said they would not ballot ScotRail workers on the new deal because ""it is not worthy of consideration"". He said the new pay offer was 4.7% over two years, but there have to be efficiency savings. That would mean workers having to give up some current terms and conditions in order to get a pay rise, a caveat Mr Hogg branded ""unacceptable"". There will be no trains running anywhere in Scotland during COP26 if the strikes go ahead, he confirmed. The climate summit will be held at the Scottish Events Campus in Glasgow ScotRail is currently run by Dutch firm Abellio - but will be taken over by acompany owned and controlled by the Scottish governmentin March next year. The move was announced by the government earlier this year after Abellio wasstripped of its contractthree years early amid concern over its performance. ScotRail has been in talks for several weeks with trade unions about pay and conditions. A formal written offer was made to four rail trade unions - Aslef, RMT, TSSA, and Unite the union. The company said it had only survived the pandemic due to emergency taxpayer support of more than Â£400m in ""the most serious financial crisis in our history"". A spokesman said: ""It's extremely disappointing that the RMT have opted to continue with this highly damaging strike action, particularly when a pay offer, negotiated over several weeks, has been made to the trade unions. ""We're seeing customers gradually return to Scotland's Railway, but the scale of the financial situation ScotRail is facing is stark. ""To build a more sustainable and greener railway for the future and reduce the burden on the taxpayer, we need to change. All of us in the railway - management, staff, trade unions, suppliers, and government - need to work together to modernise the railway so that it is fit for the future."" Transport Scotland said it welcomed constructive talks between all parties and that a ""significant offer"" has been made by employers since the RMT ballot opened. A spokeswoman said: ""We understand that the RMT will now ballot its membership again on the substance of this offer.  We hope that RMT members and the other unions will agree and accept this offer, putting to an end existing and proposed industrial disputes and action. ""Rail workers have played their part in keeping the country moving through the pandemic and we are sure that they will see the importance of the moment and the role they can play in showing the best Scotland's Railway has to offer as we welcome world leaders from across the globe to COP26."" Meanwhile, Chris Mitchell of the GMB denied cleansing workers in Glasgow were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip. Mr Mitchell claimed his members have been ""put in a corner"" by Cosla despite their heroic efforts during the pandemic. And he told Good Morning Scotland the current pay offer of Â£850 a year would only amount to an extra Â£6.50 a week, after tax and National Insurance. Mr Mitchell said he acknowledged the importance of COP26 but added: ""Cosla need to realise there is an emergency on their own door step."" Why are ScotRail workers striking during COP26?

Norway country profile,"Europe's northernmost country, the Kingdom of Norway is famed for its mountains and spectacular fjord coastline, as well as its history as a seafaring power. It also enjoys one of the world's highest standards of living, in large part due to the discovery in the late 1960s of offshore oil and gas. It is a major oil exporter and has resisted the temptation to splurge its windfall, choosing instead to deposit the surplus wealth into its oil fund - now the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. What to do with the money is a hot political issue: whether to use more of it to improve infrastructure or keep it for a rainy day and future generations. Norway plays an active international role. It has mediated between Israel and the Palestinians as well as in the Sri Lankan conflict, and has participated in military action in Afghanistan and Libya. Ex-premier Jens Stoltenberg is Nato's secretary general. It defies a global ban on commercial whaling, along with Japan and Iceland.

Born in 1937, he fled with his mother and siblings to the United States after the German invasion in 1940, while his father and grandfather, the then King Haakon VII, joined the government in exile in London. King Harald is a keen sportsman, and represented Norway with distinction as a yachtsman at the Tokyo, Mexico and Munich Olympics. He caused some controversy by marrying a commoner, rather than a royal princess. The king has clearly defined constitutional duties. Apart from being head of the armed forces and Church of Norway, he chairs the Council of State once a week. He appoints the government according to which party commands the largest number of seats in parliament, or else on the advice of the head of parliament and the prime minister of the day. King Harald has continued the royal family's tradition of unpretentious public duty, and serves as a symbol of the country's strong sense of national identity. Prime minister: Jonas Gahr Store Jonas Gahr Store's centre-left Labour Party won the greatest number of seats in the September 2021 general election, but not enough to form a majority government. In alliance with the agrarian Centre Party, he leads a minority coalition government, which are common in Nordic countries.. Erna Solberg, who had been prime minister since 2013 resigned after her Conservative party ended up with the second-largest number of seats. Store, like his political mentors Gro Harlem Brundtland and Jens Stoltenberg, is associated with the business-friendly right wing of the Labour Party.

Microsoft shutting down LinkedIn in China,"Microsoft is shutting down its social network, LinkedIn, in China, saying having to comply with the Chinese state has become increasingly challenging. It comes after the career-networking site faced questions for blocking the profiles of some journalists. LinkedIn will launch a jobs-only version of the site, called InJobs, later this year. But this will not include a social feed or the ability to share or post articles. LinkedIn senior vice-president Mohak Shroffblogged:,external""We're facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China."" And the firm said in a statement: ""While we are going to sunset the localised version of LinkedIn in China later this year, we will continue to have a strong presence in China to drive our new strategy and are excited to launch the new InJobs app later this year."" LinkedIn had been the only major Western social-media platform operating in China. When it launched there, in 2014, it had agreed to adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate there, but also promised to be transparent about how it conducted business in the country and said it disagreed with government censorship. Recently, LinkedIn blacklisted several journalist accounts, including those of Melissa Chan and Greg Bruno, from its China-based website. Mr Bruno, who has written a book documenting China's treatment of Tibetan refugees,told Verdict,externalhe was not surprised the Chinese Communist Party did not like it but was ""dismayed that an American tech company is caving into the demands of a foreign government"". US senator Rick Scott called the move a ""gross appeasement and an act of submission to Communist China"", in a letter to LinkedIn chief executive Ryan Roslansky and Microsoft boss Satya Nadella. Zhaoyin Feng, BBC News, Washington It's hard to pinpoint whether LinkedIn's move was driven by the pressure from China, or that from the US. It could be both, as the Chinese government has been tightening its grip over the internet, and meanwhile, LinkedIn has drawn growing criticism in America for bowing to Beijing's censorship rules. LinkedIn launched its Chinese version in 2014, hoping to tap into the country's huge market. Seven years on, it has struggled against local competitors and run into regulatory problems. In March, LinkedIn was reportedly punished by the Chinese regulator for failing to censor political content, resulting in a suspension of new user registration for 30 days. Other than controversy over censorships,the platform has been used by Chinese intelligence agencies as a recruitment tool. In a letter to the platform's users in China today, President of LinkedIn China Lu Jian pledges that the site will continue to ""connect global business opportunities"". But LinkedIn's shutdown in China shows an opposite trend. The country's heavily controlled internet has drifted further away from the rest of the world, and it's increasingly challenging for global business operating in China to bridge the deep divide.

Pupil abuse in special school filmed on CCTV,"An investigation has been launched into ""organised abuse"" at a special school in London after CCTV was discovered of pupils being physically assaulted and neglected, BBC News has learned. The videos, found by staff, show pupils being mistreated in padded seclusion rooms between 2014 and 2017. One parent said he didn't know the rooms existed until he collected his ""distressed"" autistic son from one. The school said it was working with the police and supporting families. Whitefield School in Walthamstow, north-east London, has over 300 pupils aged between three and 19, many of whom have severe or complex needs and are unable to communicate verbally. BBC News has learned that in May a staff member found a significant number of videos showing children in the school's seclusion rooms. In some of the footage, pupils are physically assaulted and neglected. Secure or seclusion rooms are used in schools when it is thought a pupil needs to be isolated from a classroom during the school day. In July, the school wrote to parents about the discovery of evidence of ""alleged child neglect"". The Metropolitan Police has now reviewed a significant amount of CCTV footage and the local authority has launched an investigation into ""organised and complex abuse"" at the school, BBC News has learned. This is defined as ""abuse involving one or more abusers and a number of related or non-related abused children"". In January 2017 the school was rated inadequate after an Ofsted inspection found a small number of pupils had been placed in secure rooms ""for repeated and prolonged periods of time"". The report said while the school referred to them as ""calming rooms"" this was ""not an accurate description of the three secure, padded and bare spaces that are used"". All three rooms at Whitefield School were poorly ventilated with doors that could not be opened from the inside, while two had no natural light and children were unable to see outside or hear clearly, according to Ofsted. ""In a significant number of cases, pupils are placed in the rooms more frequently or for longer periods of time, as their behaviour worsens,"" the report said. It added there was no evidence parents had been told when their child had been placed in the room. Following the inspection, the school wrote to parents telling them it was ending use of the rooms. Later that year the school was inspected again and given an outstanding rating. One parent told the BBC he didn't know the rooms existed until he was taken to collect his autistic son from one of the them, following problems with his behaviour. He said his son appeared agitated and his shirt was ripped. ""He was very upset, very distressed"", he added. ""I thought it was diabolical."" The boy's mother said her son would not have been able to communicate any experiences in the rooms because of the nature of his disability. She said she was frequently called by the school about ways to manage his behaviour but use of the rooms was never mentioned. ""You send your child to school because you expect that they're going to be treated with dignity and respect,"" she said. ""I think of a 'calming room' as a safe space: beanbags, soft lighting, bubble machines - not padded cells."" Parents of some pupils at the school who may have spent time in the rooms have been contacted by the London Borough of Waltham Forest, but not been told whether their children have been identified in videos. BBC News has seen a letter written by the school's head teacher in May 2017 outlining the steps it was taking to address the Ofsted inspection. It said it was closing the ""calming rooms"" but no mention was made of footage documenting their use. That month a teacher at the school was sacked after a member of the public saw him kick a 17-year-old pupil with autism on a school trip. A BBC News investigation in 2018discovered the use of isolation and seclusion rooms varied widelyin schools. It found some children spent consecutive weeks in isolation booths and more than 5,000 children with special educational needs had attended them. Seclusion rooms are used in many schools across the country to tackle challenging behaviour and disruption. But government guidance says ""a separate room"" should only be used when it is in the best interests of the child and other pupils, and locked rooms should only be considered in ""exceptional circumstances"". Rules around use of seclusion rooms are not strong enough, according to Paul Dix, who has campaigned to ban isolation rooms. An example of a padded seclusion room inside a mainstream primary school ""I don't think they could be more lax"", he said. ""It seems to just rest with the culture and leadership of the individual organisation and nobody really seems too concerned about legislating. ""It's just ludicrously Victorian to think that putting a child in a locked room is going to do anything but exacerbate the problem."" In response to the BBC, the academy trust which runs the school said it had new leadership since the rooms were used who ""promptly"" reported the videos to the police and local authority after they found them. It said it had appointed a new head teacher following the discovery and met with parents of those children who may have been affected. It declined to say if the CCTV had been disclosed to Ofsted during its inspection. Ofsted also declined to say if it had observed CCTV cameras during its inspection or asked to review footage. In a statement it said it had shared some of its inspection evidence with the police at their request and could not comment further. The London Borough of Waltham Forest said it visited the school after Ofsted's January 2017 inspection ""to ensure the safeguarding concerns raised were acted upon immediately"" but only learned pupils had been filmed in the seclusion rooms when the footage was discovered in May 2021. The Metropolitan Police said it was investigating ""several allegations of child cruelty"" at the school between 2014 and 2017 but there have been no arrests. The government said it was aware of the allegations but could not comment further while a police investigation was under way.

What we know about the Kongsberg attack,"The suspect was arrested 30 minutes after officers first confronted him in Kongsberg A bow and arrow attack that left five people dead and three others wounded has shocked Norway. A 37-year-old Danish man has been arrested and is being questioned by police, who have not ruled out terrorism. The attack was the country's deadliest since the far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in 2011. Here's what we know. The attack took place on Wednesday evening in Kongsberg, which is about 80km (49 miles) south-west of Norway's capital, Oslo. The attacker launched the assault near a Coop Extra supermarket on Kongsberg's west side. Police first received a report of a man shooting at people with a bow and arrow at 18:12 local time (16:12 GMT). Shortly afterwards, officers arrived on the scene. It is not clear if they were armed when they first came across the suspect. They made contact with the attacker at 18:18. The officers were then shot at with arrows before the attacker escaped. Attacks were subsequently reported in different locations. One witness told local media they saw a woman lying injured at an intersection and calling for help. Another witness told the TV2 channel that she saw a ""man standing on the corner with arrows in a quiver on his shoulder and a bow in his hand"". ""Afterwards, I saw people running for their lives. One of them was a woman holding a child by the hand,"" she said. Images from Kongsberg showed arrows lying on the ground and one sticking out of a wall. At a news conference on Thursday, Norwegian police official Ole Bredrup Saeverud said the victims were most likely killed after officers first confronted the attacker. The suspect was arrested at 18:45 - 35 minutes after the attack began. Warning shots were fired during the arrest, police said. Norwegian media questioned why it took police more than half an hour to arrest the suspect after the first reports of an attack. Mr Saeverud said it had been a ""confusing"" situation. Norway's intelligence service, PST, said the attack appeared to be an ""act of terror"" but further investigation was needed to establish the motivation. Officers named him,externalas Espen Andersen Brathen, a 37-year-old Danish citizen with a Danish mother and Norwegian father. Police prosecutor Ann IrÃ©n Svane Mathiassen told TV2 that the man lived in Kongsberg and was known to police. He will be assessed by psychiatric experts, she told NRK. The suspect converted to Islam and ""there were fears linked to radicalisation previously"", Chief Saeverud told reporters. He said the latest report of concern about radicalisation was in 2020. ""We haven't had any reports about him in 2021,"" Mr Saeverud said. Public broadcaster NRK reported that Brathen received a six-month restraining order against two family members last year. According to the verdict in that case, he reportedly left a revolver on the sofa which one family member perceived as a threat. This video can not be played Norway attack witness: ""I heard a distinct thunk sound"" The suspect was taken to a police station in the town of Drammen, where he was questioned by police. ""He is explaining in detail and he is speaking and co-operating with the police,"" the suspect's lawyer, Fredrik Neumann, told reporters. Mr Saeverud said the suspect confessed during questioning, adding that he was ""relatively sure that he acted alone"". The suspect was charged and is expected to appear before a court in Kongsberg on Friday at 09:00 local time. None of the victims have been formally identified. Four women and a man, all aged between 50 and 70, were killed, police said. Relatives have been notified. Police say they do not believe the suspect knew any of the victims. One of those injured was an off-duty police officer who was in the supermarket, where the attack is said to have started. He and one other wounded person were stable. In a press release on Thursday, police said a third person was wounded and had been taken to an emergency room. Incoming Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said the attack was a ""gruesome and brutal act"". It happened a day before his centre-left coalition government was due to take office. The outgoing conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg said reports of the attack were ""horrifying"". And Kongsberg Mayor Kari Anne Sand said it was a shocking attack that had taken place in an area where many people lived. Describing the town as ""a completely ordinary community with completely ordinary people"", Ms Sand said everyone had been deeply shaken by ""this very tragic situation"". Internationally, political leaders expressed shock and offered their condolences. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen condemned the ""terrible attack"", while UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was ""saddened by the tragic news"".

July, with more than 45,000 new cases reported in the UK today. There was always a concern the autumn could prompt a
significant rise. A combination of an increase in mixing with waning immunity
could unbalance that equilibrium. What is noticeable about the latest figures is that there
are signs infection rates are going up in older age groups and not just in
teenagers, certainly in England. That is a worry because of the impact it will
have on hospital cases. But what remains to be seen is how long this rise lasts â and what the consequences will be. The roll-out of boosters will offer more protection to those at highest risk of serious illness. The vaccination of children may help drive down overall infection levels. With flu just beginning to take-off and a virus called RSV, the leading cause of hospitalisation for respiratory illness among the under fives, at high levels, it is easy to see why there is such concern about what the coming months will bring. Members of the British Medical Association are calling for the health secretary to explain where extra locum doctors - otherwise known as temporary, freelance doctors - will come from to fulfil his winter plan. Sajid Javid saysÂ£250m will be given to GP surgeries in England to pay for temporary staffto boost face-to-face appointments. but Dr Ben Molyneux, BMA sessional GPs committee chair, says: âItâs not as if there is a large group of locums on standby, waiting for a call from their local practice to go in and help out. ""Those locums who can and want to be in work, are already doing so."" Dr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chairman, adds that it is unclear how practices will access the new funding and
how many hoops they will have to jump through to get it. âMost worrying is that the funding is being linked to
current performance, so it will penalise practices most in need of support,"" he says âGP morale is already at rock bottom and being asked to
âprove themselvesâ in order to secure desperately needed extra investment will
be an insult too far. Rather than taking away unnecessary bureaucracy as we
needed, the government has just added more."" Tuberculosis is on the rise internationally for the first time in a decade, the World Health Organization says - linked to problems accessing healthcare during the pandemic. WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says it is ""alarming news"" and ""must serve as a global wake-up call"" to the need to close gaps in diagnosis, treatment and care for those affected, the AFP agency reports. In its annual TB report for 2020, the WHO had said progress towards eradicating TB entirely had been made worse, because of cases going undiagnosed and untreated. It estimates about 4.1 million people have TB that has not been diagnosed or officially declared - up from 2.9 million in 2019. Dr Tedros says: ""This report confirms our fears that the disruption of essential health services due to the pandemic could start to unravel years of progress against tuberculosis."" Last month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that
""day two"" PCR tests would be replaced with cheaper lateral flow tests
for fully vaccinated travellers from ""the end of October"".Tour operators and airlines are now calling on the government to publish a date. No firm details have been issued yet. Travel chiefs, and travellers
going overseas, are frustrated by this delay. Jet2 - UKâs second-largest tour operator - says it is experiencing an increase in demand following a difficult 18
months. The travel business says âhalf-term will be incredibly busyâ and it will be âoperating up to 2,500 weekly flightsâ. Steve Heapy, boss of Jet2, says: ""It is time for the UK government to confirm exactly when these changes will come into force."" Half-term holidays begin this Friday in some areas of
England, while other schools in England and Wales follow in the last week of
October. Northern Ireland's schools have a short break in
October and Scotland's half-term has already happened. The government is encourageing travellers to hold off from booking tests for half-term. At the moment, fully vaccinated travellers need to do a PCR test on day two of arrival in the UK. Under the new rules, lateral flow tests will replace PCR tests for those that are fully jabbed, but the date of the change remains unknown. There are no changes if you are not fully vaccinated. The UK has recorded another 45,066 coronavirus cases,according to the government's daily figures.,external It is the highest number of new infections since 20 July, when the number was 46,558. Another 157 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have also been reported. Earlier we heard from England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who warned this winter will be ""exceptionally difficult"" for the NHS. While the vaccination programme has weakened the link between Covid cases and hospital admissions, the health service also faces other challenges, including the return of normal winter illnesses and a backlog of other patients waiting for treatment delayed by the pandemic. Last year saw much lower levels of flu than normal due to lockdown measures and social distancing. But this means immunity to flu and other respiratory viruses will have waned, while very young children will not have been able to develop any at all. Alongside Covid patients, this could put significant pressure on NHS services. Hospitals are also dealing with a huge backlog, with record numbers waiting for operations and other routine treatments. Kyrie Irving (left) is a seven-time All-Star Basketball star Kyrie Irving says he is ""doing what's best for me"" in refusing the Covid-19 vaccine, a move that will see him sidelined from the NBA. His team the Brooklyn Netts says Irving will not play until he is eligible to become ""a full participant"" under New York City Covid-19 vaccine rules. Regulations state that all athletes,externalwho play or train in the city have to be vaccinated and the 29-year-old says he will not bow to pressure. Speaking about the issue on Instagram, Irving says: ""Do what's best for you, but I am not an advocate for either side.I am doing what's best for me."" Aswe've been reporting, ministers have set up aÂ£250memergency winter rescue package so GP surgeries can take on more temporary staff. So how far will that money go? There are around7,500GP surgeries in England, according to NHS data. The Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth says that the proposal works out atÂ£33,000per GP surgery which ""is not enough money to recruit an extra doctor"". The government says the money is to help surgeries take on more temporary staff. Royal College of Practitioners,externalis advertising some locum GP roles at aroundÂ£700a day and on that basis the money would pay for a temporary GP at one surgery for 47 days. Most people on the continent are tested when they turn up at health centres with symptoms Six out of every seven coronavirus cases are not being detected in Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. It has made the calculation based on a formula that looks at recorded deaths and case fatality rates. So far only eight million Covid cases have been recorded but the WHO now estimates the real figure could be 59 million. In the main, the only people who are tested are those who turn up at health centres with symptoms and those intending to travel out of their country. This means a huge number of asymptomatic cases are not being spotted, resulting in more transmission. To deal with this, the WHO is boosting community screening in eight countries aiming to reach seven million people with rapid testing in the next year. âWith limited
testing, weâre still flying blind in far too many communities in Africa...  More testing means rapid isolation, less transmission and more
lives saved through targeted action,â says WHO's Africa director Dr Matshidiso Moeti. Burundi, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Congo-Brazzaville, Senegal and Zambia will be taking part. There has been a decline in recorded new cases recently, the WHO says, but there is concern that with low vaccination rates Covid remains a threat for many. Case rates in England are continuing to rise in all age groups, according to the UK Health Security Agency. The highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds, with 1,120.8 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 10 October, up week-on-week from 1,061.8. This is followed by five to nine-year-olds, for whom rates are up from 484.2 to 574.2. For both age groups this is the highest weekly rate since this data was first collected in October 2020. The lowest rate is among people aged 80 and over, at 110.8, up from 90.2. Vaccination rates are lower in under-18s, as healthy 16 and 17-year-olds were only offered a Covid jab from early August, while first doses have been offered to 12 to 15-year-olds since 20 September. Meanwhile, cases are also rising in all regions of England, the data shows. The East Midlands has the highest rate, with 488.7 cases per 100,000 people, up from 450. London has the lowest rate at 214.2, up from 204.6. You can check the number of cases in your area here. A nurse has received an award from the Royal College of
Nursing for her outstanding efforts to create a Covid-19 vaccine clinic for
people with learning disabilities and autism. Rebecca Crossleydeveloped a sensory-friendly clinicwith patients
who find syringes, PPE and a noisy clinic daunting at the heart of her planning.
Due to her efforts to make the environment as sensory-friendly as possible, the
clinic has a 99.9% vaccine take-up rate. Rebecca pitched the idea to the clinical commissioning group
and James Paget Hospital following her own experience having the Covid jab earlier this year. The clinic is ongoing and based in the Waveney area of Norfolk and north Suffolk. The Royal College of Nursing says its awards showcase the diversity of nursing and recognise commitment, compassion and clinical excellence. Rebecca says patients ""come through a sensory garden to enter the clinic, where all the equipment is hidden behind a screen"". She adds that it is important ""to get it right the first time because people have to come back, and if you get it wrong, they won't come back"". We've been telling you about anew winter planthat's being set up in England. As part of it, GPs are being told to see more patients face-to-face, with funding being given for more temporary staff. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says the new GP rescue package will help relieve pressure on the whole system. But what do GPs themselves think about it? Dr Rob Barnett, who works at Greenbank Road Surgery in Liverpool, says: ""I would ask the health secretary to come here to our surgery and see for himself how it works and how weâve had to change to support patients. âMore face-to-face appointments isnât the answer - if we were to make all our interactions face-to-face we would end up with huge waiting lists."" Dr Barnett, a British Medical Association representative in the North West, says GPs are ""having more contact than ever with patients"" online and on the phone - and that ""just throwing money at the issue"" is not going to solve their problems. AndDr Nigel de Kare-Silverof Gladstone Medical Centre in north-west London says the fund is ""a long-awaited recognition of the impossible strains on our services"". But he stresses there are ""massive workforce issues which cannot be ignored with an undersupply of trained competent GPs across the UK"". ""Even with this boost on funding"", he says, ""the historic decline in GP numbers"" would not be alleviated. But, he says recognition of the problem by government could help ""alleviate the pressures from patients who have health concerns -  increasingly expressed as abuse to our front-line reception and clinical teams"".   The government has set up a Â£250m emergency winter rescue package so GP surgeries can take on more locums - but what does this mean? What is a locum GP?They are doctors who are employed on a temporary basis to help surgeries fulfil appointments. They may be self-employed or work for an agency. They might work solely as a locum, be employed by another surgery or have retired from full-time practice. How much do they earn?Locum GP roles advertised by theRoyal College of General Practitioners,externalare aboutÂ£700a day. Richard Fieldhouse, chairman of the National Association of Sessional GPs (NASGP) says an agency locum can cost upwards ofÂ£1,000a day with 30% going to the agency. But he says some locums chargeÂ£200per half day to work at a surgery where they feel part of a team. ""Money has never been the problem in getting locums, it's how you treat them,"" he says. How many locums are there?NASGP says there are about 20,000 locum GPs across the UK and they make up 25% of the workforce. British actress Letitia Wright has denied a report that she shared anti-vaccination  views on the set of Black Panther 2. Wright, who plays Shuri in the Marvel films, says the story in The Hollywood Reporter is ""completely untrue"". It comes after she was criticised in December for sharing a video making unsubstantiated claims about the safety of coronavirus vaccines. Wright, 27, has responded on Instagram, saying: ""Anyone who knows me or has worked with me, knows that I work incredibly hard at my craft & my main focus is always to do work that's impactful and inspiring. That has been & will continue to be my only focus."" Late last year, she become embroiled in a controversy after posting a link to a video whose host said people taking the vaccines would have to ""hope it doesn't make extra limbs grow"". After being criticised on Twitter, Wright said she wasn't against vaccines but it was important to ""ask questions"". Read more here. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty has been speaking at a GPs' conference and says this winter will be ""exceptionally difficult"" for the NHS. He says this will be the case ""irrespective"" of whether the country experiences relatively low Covid cases or a further surge, alongside other winter pressures such as flu and falls. Prof Whitty also praises GPs for their ""outstanding"" hard work during the pandemic, after some said they felt they were being attacked by sections of the media and some politicians over the issue of face-to-face appointments. On the lessons to be learned from the pandemic, he tells the annual conference of the Royal College of GPs ""there
are certainly some quite significant things we got wrong at the beginning of
Covid"". However, he says it would be a mistake to assume the lessons from the current pandemic would necessarily be applicable to the next one. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says unless the government addresses long term planning for the GP workforce the number of face-to-face appointments will go down and not up. In a longthread of tweets,externalthe Conservative MP, who chairs the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, says: ""As someone who tried and failed to get 5,000 more GPs into the system, I donât think this package will turn the tide."" He says he got thousands more graduates into GP surgeries but found experienced GPs were retiring or going part time faster than new trainees arrived. Hunt says the only way to stop this is ""a clear plan to end the unsustainable pressure they face"". He suggests a big recruitment drive and incentives to persuade retired GPs who stepped up temporarily during the pandemic to extend their service. ""But sticking plaster after sticking plaster will no longer cut it. Unless we fix workforce planning in the NHS for the long term, the future will be bleak and the number of face-to-face GP appointments will go down not up,"" he says. The new justice secretary says he can't promise when court backlogs in England and Wales will return to pre-pandemic levels. Funding cuts and delays caused by Covid restrictions have contributed to the unprecedented delays in prosecuting and jailing criminals. More than 60,000 crown court trials are waiting to be heard with many serious cases now being listed in late 2023. Dominic Raab, who moved to the role last month, tells the BBC he hopes backlogs will fall within 12 months but could not give a precise figure. Read more. Russiaâs surging outbreak hits a population with only 31% fully jabbed,
according to the Gogov website, which tallies data from around the country. The Kremlin has refrained from re-introducing major restrictions, despite calling the country's vaccination rate ""unacceptably"" low. It says authorities have to ensure ""the economy continues
working."" Today, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has ruled out a lockdown and
says authorities have to ""continue to explain to people that it is
necessary to be vaccinated.â ""It's irresponsible not to get the vaccine,"" Peskov says. He adds ""the entire medical infrastructure is mobilisedâ for
the surge in coronavirus patients, and says it is not ""overwhelmed"". Russia's Health Minister Mikhail Murashko blames the growing spread on the
""behaviour"" of Russians and is urging them to get vaccinated. Although several Russian-developed jabs have been available for
months, authorities are struggling to inoculate avaccine-sceptic population. Moscow - the epicentre of Russia's outbreak - has so far withheld from
bringing back restrictions. However, it announced on Monday that two dozen sites would open in the capital for residents to get free rapid tests. Independent experts have accused authorities of downplaying the
severity of Russia's epidemic. Russiaâs Federal State Statistics Service, also known as the Rosstat
statistics agency, said last week an estimate of 400,000 Russians that
contracted coronavirus had died by the end of August. Ministers have urged parents to get their children vaccinated Covid infections rose exponentially among five to 17-year-olds in England in September, as children returned for the autumn school term, research suggests. Across the general population, the React-1 study, conducted by
Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori between 9 and 27 September, found one in 120 people were infected and prevalence appears to be remaining stable overall. The data shows the infection rate is growing most among those aged under 18, and falling among those aged 18 to 54. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the React programme, says the trends ""reinforce
how important it is for children aged 12 and above to get vaccinated and help
curb the spread of infection, and minimise disruption to education"". Relatively few under-18s have been vaccinated in the UK, as healthy 16 and 17-year-olds were only offered the jab from early August, while first doses have been offered to 12 to 15-year-olds since 20 September. The study's findings also support the arguments for booster jabs for adults, with a higher prevalence of fully vaccinated people testing positive within three to six months of their vaccination.

"Microsoft shutting down LinkedIn in ChinaThe company will offer a jobs-only site with no social-media elements, instead.","Microsoft is shutting down its social network, LinkedIn, in China, saying having to comply with the Chinese state has become increasingly challenging. It comes after the career-networking site faced questions for blocking the profiles of some journalists. LinkedIn will launch a jobs-only version of the site, called InJobs, later this year. But this will not include a social feed or the ability to share or post articles. LinkedIn senior vice-president Mohak Shroffblogged:,external""We're facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China."" And the firm said in a statement: ""While we are going to sunset the localised version of LinkedIn in China later this year, we will continue to have a strong presence in China to drive our new strategy and are excited to launch the new InJobs app later this year."" LinkedIn had been the only major Western social-media platform operating in China. When it launched there, in 2014, it had agreed to adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate there, but also promised to be transparent about how it conducted business in the country and said it disagreed with government censorship. Recently, LinkedIn blacklisted several journalist accounts, including those of Melissa Chan and Greg Bruno, from its China-based website. Mr Bruno, who has written a book documenting China's treatment of Tibetan refugees,told Verdict,externalhe was not surprised the Chinese Communist Party did not like it but was ""dismayed that an American tech company is caving into the demands of a foreign government"". US senator Rick Scott called the move a ""gross appeasement and an act of submission to Communist China"", in a letter to LinkedIn chief executive Ryan Roslansky and Microsoft boss Satya Nadella. Zhaoyin Feng, BBC News, Washington It's hard to pinpoint whether LinkedIn's move was driven by the pressure from China, or that from the US. It could be both, as the Chinese government has been tightening its grip over the internet, and meanwhile, LinkedIn has drawn growing criticism in America for bowing to Beijing's censorship rules. LinkedIn launched its Chinese version in 2014, hoping to tap into the country's huge market. Seven years on, it has struggled against local competitors and run into regulatory problems. In March, LinkedIn was reportedly punished by the Chinese regulator for failing to censor political content, resulting in a suspension of new user registration for 30 days. Other than controversy over censorships,the platform has been used by Chinese intelligence agencies as a recruitment tool. In a letter to the platform's users in China today, President of LinkedIn China Lu Jian pledges that the site will continue to ""connect global business opportunities"". But LinkedIn's shutdown in China shows an opposite trend. The country's heavily controlled internet has drifted further away from the rest of the world, and it's increasingly challenging for global business operating in China to bridge the deep divide.

Neighbour wins privacy row over smart doorbellThe Amazon devices were found to invade privacy and break data laws in a landmark UK case.Technology,"A judge has ruled that security cameras and a Ring doorbell installed in a house in Oxfordshire ""unjustifiably invaded"" the privacy of a neighbour. Dr Mary Fairhurst claimed that the devices installed on the house of neighbour Jon Woodard broke data laws and contributed to harassment. The judge upheld both these claims. Mr Woodard now faces a substantial fine. He claimed he installed the devices in good faith as a deterrent against burglars. The origin of the row stems from an invitation from Mr Woodard to his neighbour Dr Fairhurst to have a tour of his home renovations, during which she claimed he showed off his new security system. The judgment reads that Dr Fairhurst was ""alarmed and appalled"" to notice that he had a camera mounted on his shed and that footage from it was sent to his smartphone. A series of disputes about the cameras followed, which resulted in Dr Fairhurst moving out of her home. In the judgement it was found that the Ring doorbell captured images of the claimant's house and garden, while the shed camera covered almost the whole of her garden and her parking space. Amazon rolls out encryption for Ring doorbells Amazon's Ring video doorbells catch fire because wrong screw used FBI worried that Ring doorbells are spying on police Judge Melissa Clarke found that audio data collected by cameras on a shed, in a driveway and on the Ring doorbell was processed unlawfully. She noted that at the time it was not possible to turn off the audio recording facility - that happened in an update in 2020. She said that she found the audio data that could capture conversations ""even more problematic and detrimental than video data"". ""Personal data may be captured from people who are not even aware that the device is there, or that it records and processes audio and personal data,"" she said in her judgement. That, she said, was in breach of UK data laws - both the UK Data Protection Act and UK GDPR. Amazon, which made both the doorbell and the cameras, said that customers must ""respect their neighbours' privacy, and comply with any applicable laws when using their Ring device."" ""We've put features in place across all our devices to ensure privacy, security and user control remain front and centre - including customisable privacy zones to block out 'off-limit' areas, motion zones to control the areas customers want their Ring device to detect motion, and Audio Toggle to turn audio on and off."" But the judge added: ""Even if an activation zone is disabled so that the camera does not activate to film by movement in that area, activation by movement in one of the other non-disabled activation zones will cause the camera to film across the whole field of view."" The Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC: ""Lots of people use domestic CCTV and video doorbells. If you own one, you should respect people's privacy rights and take steps to minimise intrusion to neighbours and passers-by."" But it added: ""In the vast number of cases, there are no issues."" Hannah Hart, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy, said: ""Whilst this case doesn't set a legal precedent, it does continue an ongoing conversation about our changing attitude towards domestic surveillance - and how normalised it has become in our communities. ""The fact remains that anyone with a Ring doorbell can turn their area of the neighbourhood into a surveillance space due to its video recording functionality and audio processors which are able to pick up sound 40 feet away. ""This means a small number of residents can effectively transform public spaces into surveillance hotbeds, and even share their recordings with police.""

LiveLiveNHS facing exceptionally difficult winter - Whitty6 minutes ago,"The NHS faces an ""exceptionally difficult"" winter whether there is a Covid surge or not, England's chief medial officer Prof Chris Whitty says GPs in England are being told to see more patients face-to-face as ministers unveil a Â£250m winter rescue package But the doctors' union says the package shows ""a government out of touch with the scale of the crisis"" The British Medical Association adds doctors will be ""horrified"" by the idea the plan will save them when it could ""sink the ship altogether"" Health Secretary Sajid Javid defends the plan, saying it will provide financial support and remove ""red tape"" But former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says the package won't ""turn the tide"" and says a ""sticking plaster will no longer cut it"" Nearly 470,000 A&E patients in England waited longer than four hours to be treated in September Lateral flow tests are very good at detecting those most likely to spread Covid, researchers say Edited by Hamish Mackay Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a reminder of some of the day's headlines:  This live page was written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and Malu Cursino. It was edited by Hamish Mackay and James Clarke. From all of us, have a good evening. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Since July, infection rates have been bobbling around â with periods of increases followed by drops. That is a sign we have reached an equilibrium whereby the
amount of immunity in the population keeps the virus in check. However, it is now clear we are seeing the most sustained rise since
July, with more than 45,000 new cases reported in the UK today. There was always a concern the autumn could prompt a
significant rise. A combination of an increase in mixing with waning immunity
could unbalance that equilibrium. What is noticeable about the latest figures is that there
are signs infection rates are going up in older age groups and not just in
teenagers, certainly in England. That is a worry because of the impact it will
have on hospital cases. But what remains to be seen is how long this rise lasts â and what the consequences will be. The roll-out of boosters will offer more protection to those at highest risk of serious illness. The vaccination of children may help drive down overall infection levels. With flu just beginning to take-off and a virus called RSV, the leading cause of hospitalisation for respiratory illness among the under fives, at high levels, it is easy to see why there is such concern about what the coming months will bring. Members of the British Medical Association are calling for the health secretary to explain where extra locum doctors - otherwise known as temporary, freelance doctors - will come from to fulfil his winter plan. Sajid Javid saysÂ£250m will be given to GP surgeries in England to pay for temporary staffto boost face-to-face appointments. but Dr Ben Molyneux, BMA sessional GPs committee chair, says: âItâs not as if there is a large group of locums on standby, waiting for a call from their local practice to go in and help out. ""Those locums who can and want to be in work, are already doing so."" Dr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chairman, adds that it is unclear how practices will access the new funding and
how many hoops they will have to jump through to get it. âMost worrying is that the funding is being linked to
current performance, so it will penalise practices most in need of support,"" he says âGP morale is already at rock bottom and being asked to
âprove themselvesâ in order to secure desperately needed extra investment will
be an insult too far. Rather than taking away unnecessary bureaucracy as we
needed, the government has just added more."" Tuberculosis is on the rise internationally for the first time in a decade, the World Health Organization says - linked to problems accessing healthcare during the pandemic. WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says it is ""alarming news"" and ""must serve as a global wake-up call"" to the need to close gaps in diagnosis, treatment and care for those affected, the AFP agency reports. In its annual TB report for 2020, the WHO had said progress towards eradicating TB entirely had been made worse, because of cases going undiagnosed and untreated. It estimates about 4.1 million people have TB that has not been diagnosed or officially declared - up from 2.9 million in 2019. Dr Tedros says: ""This report confirms our fears that the disruption of essential health services due to the pandemic could start to unravel years of progress against tuberculosis."" Last month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that
""day two"" PCR tests would be replaced with cheaper lateral flow tests
for fully vaccinated travellers from ""the end of October"".Tour operators and airlines are now calling on the government to publish a date. No firm details have been issued yet. Travel chiefs, and travellers
going overseas, are frustrated by this delay. Jet2 - UKâs second-largest tour operator - says it is experiencing an increase in demand following a difficult 18
months. The travel business says âhalf-term will be incredibly busyâ and it will be âoperating up to 2,500 weekly flightsâ. Steve Heapy, boss of Jet2, says: ""It is time for the UK government to confirm exactly when these changes will come into force."" Half-term holidays begin this Friday in some areas of
England, while other schools in England and Wales follow in the last week of
October. Northern Ireland's schools have a short break in
October and Scotland's half-term has already happened. The government is encourageing travellers to hold off from booking tests for half-term. At the moment, fully vaccinated travellers need to do a PCR test on day two of arrival in the UK. Under the new rules, lateral flow tests will replace PCR tests for those that are fully jabbed, but the date of the change remains unknown. There are no changes if you are not fully vaccinated. The UK has recorded another 45,066 coronavirus cases,according to the government's daily figures.,external It is the highest number of new infections since 20 July, when the number was 46,558. Another 157 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have also been reported. Earlier we heard from England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who warned this winter will be ""exceptionally difficult"" for the NHS. While the vaccination programme has weakened the link between Covid cases and hospital admissions, the health service also faces other challenges, including the return of normal winter illnesses and a backlog of other patients waiting for treatment delayed by the pandemic. Last year saw much lower levels of flu than normal due to lockdown measures and social distancing. But this means immunity to flu and other respiratory viruses will have waned, while very young children will not have been able to develop any at all. Alongside Covid patients, this could put significant pressure on NHS services. Hospitals are also dealing with a huge backlog, with record numbers waiting for operations and other routine treatments.

Aswe've been reporting, ministers have set up aÂ£250memergency winter rescue package so GP surgeries can take on more temporary staff. So how far will that money go? There are around7,500GP surgeries in England, according to NHS data. The Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth says that the proposal works out atÂ£33,000per GP surgery which ""is not enough money to recruit an extra doctor"". The government says the money is to help surgeries take on more temporary staff.

Most people on the continent are tested when they turn up at health centres with symptoms Six out of every seven coronavirus cases are not being detected in Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. It has made the calculation based on a formula that looks at recorded deaths and case fatality rates. So far only eight million Covid cases have been recorded but the WHO now estimates the real figure could be 59 million. In the main, the only people who are tested are those who turn up at health centres with symptoms and those intending to travel out of their country. This means a huge number of asymptomatic cases are not being spotted, resulting in more transmission. To deal with this, the WHO is boosting community screening in eight countries aiming to reach seven million people with rapid testing in the next year. âWith limited
testing, weâre still flying blind in far too many communities in Africa...  More testing means rapid isolation, less transmission and more
lives saved through targeted action,â says WHO's Africa director Dr Matshidiso Moeti. Burundi, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Congo-Brazzaville, Senegal and Zambia will be taking part. There has been a decline in recorded new cases recently, the WHO says, but there is concern that with low vaccination rates Covid remains a threat for many. Case rates in England are continuing to rise in all age groups, according to the UK Health Security Agency. The highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds, with 1,120.8 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 10 October, up week-on-week from 1,061.8. This is followed by five to nine-year-olds, for whom rates are up from 484.2 to 574.2. For both age groups this is the highest weekly rate since this data was first collected in October 2020. The lowest rate is among people aged 80 and over, at 110.8, up from 90.2. Vaccination rates are lower in under-18s, as healthy 16 and 17-year-olds were only offered a Covid jab from early August, while first doses have been offered to 12 to 15-year-olds since 20 September. Meanwhile, cases are also rising in all regions of England, the data shows. The East Midlands has the highest rate, with 488.7 cases per 100,000 people, up from 450. London has the lowest rate at 214.2, up from 204.6. You can check the number of cases in your area here. A nurse has received an award from the Royal College of

We've been telling you about anew winter planthat's being set up in England. As part of it, GPs are being told to see more patients face-to-face, with funding being given for more temporary staff. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says the new GP rescue package will help relieve pressure on the whole system. But what do GPs themselves think about it? Dr Rob Barnett, who works at Greenbank Road Surgery in Liverpool, says: ""I would ask the health secretary to come here to our surgery and see for himself how it works and how weâve had to change to support patients. âMore face-to-face appointments isnât the answer - if we were to make all our interactions face-to-face we would end up with huge waiting lists."" Dr Barnett, a British Medical Association representative in the North West, says GPs are ""having more contact than ever with patients"" online and on the phone - and that ""just throwing money at the issue"" is not going to solve their problems. AndDr Nigel de Kare-Silverof Gladstone Medical Centre in north-west London says the fund is ""a long-awaited recognition of the impossible strains on our services"". But he stresses there are ""massive workforce issues which cannot be ignored with an undersupply of trained competent GPs across the UK"". ""Even with this boost on funding"", he says, ""the historic decline in GP numbers"" would not be alleviated. But, he says recognition of the problem by government could help ""alleviate the pressures from patients who have health concerns -  increasingly expressed as abuse to our front-line reception and clinical teams"".   The government has set up a Â£250m emergency winter rescue package so GP surgeries can take on more locums - but what does this mean? What is a locum GP?They are doctors who are employed on a temporary basis to help surgeries fulfil appointments. They may be self-employed or work for an agency. They might work solely as a locum, be employed by another surgery or have retired from full-time practice. How much do they earn?Locum GP roles advertised by theRoyal College of General Practitioners,externalare aboutÂ£700a day. Richard Fieldhouse, chairman of the National Association of Sessional GPs (NASGP) says an agency locum can cost upwards ofÂ£1,000a day with 30% going to the agency. But he says some locums chargeÂ£200per half day to work at a surgery where they feel part of a team. ""Money has never been the problem in getting locums, it's how you treat them,"" he says. How many locums are there?NASGP says there are about 20,000 locum GPs across the UK and they make up 25% of the workforce. British actress Letitia Wright has denied a report that she shared anti-vaccination  views on the set of Black Panther 2. Wright, who plays Shuri in the Marvel films, says the story in The Hollywood Reporter is ""completely untrue"". It comes after she was criticised in December for sharing a video making unsubstantiated claims about the safety of coronavirus vaccines. Wright, 27, has responded on Instagram, saying: ""Anyone who knows me or has worked with me, knows that I work incredibly hard at my craft & my main focus is always to do work that's impactful and inspiring. That has been & will continue to be my only focus."" Late last year, she become embroiled in a controversy after posting a link to a video whose host said people taking the vaccines would have to ""hope it doesn't make extra limbs grow"". After being criticised on Twitter, Wright said she wasn't against vaccines but it was important to ""ask questions"". Read more here. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty has been speaking at a GPs' conference and says this winter will be ""exceptionally difficult"" for the NHS. He says this will be the case ""irrespective"" of whether the country experiences relatively low Covid cases or a further surge, alongside other winter pressures such as flu and falls. Prof Whitty also praises GPs for their ""outstanding"" hard work during the pandemic, after some said they felt they were being attacked by sections of the media and some politicians over the issue of face-to-face appointments. On the lessons to be learned from the pandemic, he tells the annual conference of the Royal College of GPs ""there
are certainly some quite significant things we got wrong at the beginning of
Covid"". However, he says it would be a mistake to assume the lessons from the current pandemic would necessarily be applicable to the next one. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says unless the government addresses long term planning for the GP workforce the number of face-to-face appointments will go down and not up. In a longthread of tweets,externalthe Conservative MP, who chairs the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, says: ""As someone who tried and failed to get 5,000 more GPs into the system, I donât think this package will turn the tide."" He says he got thousands more graduates into GP surgeries but found experienced GPs were retiring or going part time faster than new trainees arrived. Hunt says the only way to stop this is ""a clear plan to end the unsustainable pressure they face"". He suggests a big recruitment drive and incentives to persuade retired GPs who stepped up temporarily during the pandemic to extend their service. ""But sticking plaster after sticking plaster will no longer cut it. Unless we fix workforce planning in the NHS for the long term, the future will be bleak and the number of face-to-face GP appointments will go down not up,"" he says. The new justice secretary says he can't promise when court backlogs in England and Wales will return to pre-pandemic levels. Funding cuts and delays caused by Covid restrictions have contributed to the unprecedented delays in prosecuting and jailing criminals. More than 60,000 crown court trials are waiting to be heard with many serious cases now being listed in late 2023. Dominic Raab, who moved to the role last month, tells the BBC he hopes backlogs will fall within 12 months but could not give a precise figure. Read more. Russiaâs surging outbreak hits a population with only 31% fully jabbed,
according to the Gogov website, which tallies data from around the country. The Kremlin has refrained from re-introducing major restrictions, despite calling the country's vaccination rate ""unacceptably"" low. It says authorities have to ensure ""the economy continues
working."" Today, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has ruled out a lockdown and
says authorities have to ""continue to explain to people that it is
necessary to be vaccinated.â ""It's irresponsible not to get the vaccine,"" Peskov says. He adds ""the entire medical infrastructure is mobilisedâ for
the surge in coronavirus patients, and says it is not ""overwhelmed"". Russia's Health Minister Mikhail Murashko blames the growing spread on the
""behaviour"" of Russians and is urging them to get vaccinated. Although several Russian-developed jabs have been available for
months, authorities are struggling to inoculate avaccine-sceptic population. Moscow - the epicentre of Russia's outbreak - has so far withheld from
bringing back restrictions. However, it announced on Monday that two dozen sites would open in the capital for residents to get free rapid tests. Independent experts have accused authorities of downplaying the
severity of Russia's epidemic. Russiaâs Federal State Statistics Service, also known as the Rosstat
statistics agency, said last week an estimate of 400,000 Russians that
contracted coronavirus had died by the end of August. Ministers have urged parents to get their children vaccinated Covid infections rose exponentially among five to 17-year-olds in England in September, as children returned for the autumn school term, research suggests. Across the general population, the React-1 study, conducted by
Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori between 9 and 27 September, found one in 120 people were infected and prevalence appears to be remaining stable overall. The data shows the infection rate is growing most among those aged under 18, and falling among those aged 18 to 54. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the React programme, says the trends ""reinforce
how important it is for children aged 12 and above to get vaccinated and help
curb the spread of infection, and minimise disruption to education"". Relatively few under-18s have been vaccinated in the UK, as healthy 16 and 17-year-olds were only offered the jab from early August, while first doses have been offered to 12 to 15-year-olds since 20 September. The study's findings also support the arguments for booster jabs for adults, with a higher prevalence of fully vaccinated people testing positive within three to six months of their vaccination.

Neighbour wins privacy row over smart doorbellThe Amazon devices were found to invade privacy and break data laws in a landmark UK case.,"A judge has ruled that security cameras and a Ring doorbell installed in a house in Oxfordshire ""unjustifiably invaded"" the privacy of a neighbour. Dr Mary Fairhurst claimed that the devices installed on the house of neighbour Jon Woodard broke data laws and contributed to harassment. The judge upheld both these claims. Mr Woodard now faces a substantial fine. He claimed he installed the devices in good faith as a deterrent against burglars. The origin of the row stems from an invitation from Mr Woodard to his neighbour Dr Fairhurst to have a tour of his home renovations, during which she claimed he showed off his new security system. The judgment reads that Dr Fairhurst was ""alarmed and appalled"" to notice that he had a camera mounted on his shed and that footage from it was sent to his smartphone. A series of disputes about the cameras followed, which resulted in Dr Fairhurst moving out of her home. In the judgement it was found that the Ring doorbell captured images of the claimant's house and garden, while the shed camera covered almost the whole of her garden and her parking space. Amazon rolls out encryption for Ring doorbells Amazon's Ring video doorbells catch fire because wrong screw used FBI worried that Ring doorbells are spying on police Judge Melissa Clarke found that audio data collected by cameras on a shed, in a driveway and on the Ring doorbell was processed unlawfully. She noted that at the time it was not possible to turn off the audio recording facility - that happened in an update in 2020. She said that she found the audio data that could capture conversations ""even more problematic and detrimental than video data"". ""Personal data may be captured from people who are not even aware that the device is there, or that it records and processes audio and personal data,"" she said in her judgement. That, she said, was in breach of UK data laws - both the UK Data Protection Act and UK GDPR. Amazon, which made both the doorbell and the cameras, said that customers must ""respect their neighbours' privacy, and comply with any applicable laws when using their Ring device."" ""We've put features in place across all our devices to ensure privacy, security and user control remain front and centre - including customisable privacy zones to block out 'off-limit' areas, motion zones to control the areas customers want their Ring device to detect motion, and Audio Toggle to turn audio on and off."" But the judge added: ""Even if an activation zone is disabled so that the camera does not activate to film by movement in that area, activation by movement in one of the other non-disabled activation zones will cause the camera to film across the whole field of view."" The Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC: ""Lots of people use domestic CCTV and video doorbells. If you own one, you should respect people's privacy rights and take steps to minimise intrusion to neighbours and passers-by."" But it added: ""In the vast number of cases, there are no issues."" Hannah Hart, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy, said: ""Whilst this case doesn't set a legal precedent, it does continue an ongoing conversation about our changing attitude towards domestic surveillance - and how normalised it has become in our communities. ""The fact remains that anyone with a Ring doorbell can turn their area of the neighbourhood into a surveillance space due to its video recording functionality and audio processors which are able to pick up sound 40 feet away. ""This means a small number of residents can effectively transform public spaces into surveillance hotbeds, and even share their recordings with police.""

Here's a reminder of some of the day's headlines:  This live page was written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and Malu Cursino. It was edited by Hamish Mackay and James Clarke. From all of us, have a good evening. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Since July, infection rates have been bobbling around â with periods of increases followed by drops. That is a sign we have reached an equilibrium whereby the
amount of immunity in the population keeps the virus in check. However, it is now clear we are seeing the most sustained rise since
July, with more than 45,000 new cases reported in the UK today. There was always a concern the autumn could prompt a
significant rise. A combination of an increase in mixing with waning immunity
could unbalance that equilibrium. What is noticeable about the latest figures is that there
are signs infection rates are going up in older age groups and not just in
teenagers, certainly in England. That is a worry because of the impact it will
have on hospital cases. But what remains to be seen is how long this rise lasts â and what the consequences will be. The roll-out of boosters will offer more protection to those at highest risk of serious illness. The vaccination of children may help drive down overall infection levels. With flu just beginning to take-off and a virus called RSV, the leading cause of hospitalisation for respiratory illness among the under fives, at high levels, it is easy to see why there is such concern about what the coming months will bring. Members of the British Medical Association are calling for the health secretary to explain where extra locum doctors - otherwise known as temporary, freelance doctors - will come from to fulfil his winter plan. Sajid Javid saysÂ£250m will be given to GP surgeries in England to pay for temporary staffto boost face-to-face appointments. but Dr Ben Molyneux, BMA sessional GPs committee chair, says: âItâs not as if there is a large group of locums on standby, waiting for a call from their local practice to go in and help out. ""Those locums who can and want to be in work, are already doing so."" Dr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chairman, adds that it is unclear how practices will access the new funding and
how many hoops they will have to jump through to get it. âMost worrying is that the funding is being linked to
current performance, so it will penalise practices most in need of support,"" he says âGP morale is already at rock bottom and being asked to
âprove themselvesâ in order to secure desperately needed extra investment will
be an insult too far. Rather than taking away unnecessary bureaucracy as we
needed, the government has just added more."" Tuberculosis is on the rise internationally for the first time in a decade, the World Health Organization says - linked to problems accessing healthcare during the pandemic. WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says it is ""alarming news"" and ""must serve as a global wake-up call"" to the need to close gaps in diagnosis, treatment and care for those affected, the AFP agency reports. In its annual TB report for 2020, the WHO had said progress towards eradicating TB entirely had been made worse, because of cases going undiagnosed and untreated. It estimates about 4.1 million people have TB that has not been diagnosed or officially declared - up from 2.9 million in 2019. Dr Tedros says: ""This report confirms our fears that the disruption of essential health services due to the pandemic could start to unravel years of progress against tuberculosis."" Last month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that
""day two"" PCR tests would be replaced with cheaper lateral flow tests
for fully vaccinated travellers from ""the end of October"".Tour operators and airlines are now calling on the government to publish a date. No firm details have been issued yet. Travel chiefs, and travellers
going overseas, are frustrated by this delay. Jet2 - UKâs second-largest tour operator - says it is experiencing an increase in demand following a difficult 18
months. The travel business says âhalf-term will be incredibly busyâ and it will be âoperating up to 2,500 weekly flightsâ. Steve Heapy, boss of Jet2, says: ""It is time for the UK government to confirm exactly when these changes will come into force."" Half-term holidays begin this Friday in some areas of
England, while other schools in England and Wales follow in the last week of
October. Northern Ireland's schools have a short break in
October and Scotland's half-term has already happened. The government is encourageing travellers to hold off from booking tests for half-term. At the moment, fully vaccinated travellers need to do a PCR test on day two of arrival in the UK. Under the new rules, lateral flow tests will replace PCR tests for those that are fully jabbed, but the date of the change remains unknown. There are no changes if you are not fully vaccinated. The UK has recorded another 45,066 coronavirus cases,according to the government's daily figures.,external It is the highest number of new infections since 20 July, when the number was 46,558. Another 157 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have also been reported. Earlier we heard from England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who warned this winter will be ""exceptionally difficult"" for the NHS. While the vaccination programme has weakened the link between Covid cases and hospital admissions, the health service also faces other challenges, including the return of normal winter illnesses and a backlog of other patients waiting for treatment delayed by the pandemic.

England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty has been speaking at a GPs' conference and says this winter will be ""exceptionally difficult"" for the NHS. He says this will be the case ""irrespective"" of whether the country experiences relatively low Covid cases or a further surge, alongside other winter pressures such as flu and falls. Prof Whitty also praises GPs for their ""outstanding"" hard work during the pandemic, after some said they felt they were being attacked by sections of the media and some politicians over the issue of face-to-face appointments. On the lessons to be learned from the pandemic, he tells the annual conference of the Royal College of GPs ""there
are certainly some quite significant things we got wrong at the beginning of
Covid"". However, he says it would be a mistake to assume the lessons from the current pandemic would necessarily be applicable to the next one. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says unless the government addresses long term planning for the GP workforce the number of face-to-face appointments will go down and not up. In a longthread of tweets,externalthe Conservative MP, who chairs the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, says: ""As someone who tried and failed to get 5,000 more GPs into the system, I donât think this package will turn the tide."" He says he got thousands more graduates into GP surgeries but found experienced GPs were retiring or going part time faster than new trainees arrived. Hunt says the only way to stop this is ""a clear plan to end the unsustainable pressure they face"". He suggests a big recruitment drive and incentives to persuade retired GPs who stepped up temporarily during the pandemic to extend their service. ""But sticking plaster after sticking plaster will no longer cut it. Unless we fix workforce planning in the NHS for the long term, the future will be bleak and the number of face-to-face GP appointments will go down not up,"" he says. The new justice secretary says he can't promise when court backlogs in England and Wales will return to pre-pandemic levels. Funding cuts and delays caused by Covid restrictions have contributed to the unprecedented delays in prosecuting and jailing criminals. More than 60,000 crown court trials are waiting to be heard with many serious cases now being listed in late 2023. Dominic Raab, who moved to the role last month, tells the BBC he hopes backlogs will fall within 12 months but could not give a precise figure. Read more. Russiaâs surging outbreak hits a population with only 31% fully jabbed,
according to the Gogov website, which tallies data from around the country. The Kremlin has refrained from re-introducing major restrictions, despite calling the country's vaccination rate ""unacceptably"" low. It says authorities have to ensure ""the economy continues
working."" Today, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has ruled out a lockdown and
says authorities have to ""continue to explain to people that it is
necessary to be vaccinated.â ""It's irresponsible not to get the vaccine,"" Peskov says. He adds ""the entire medical infrastructure is mobilisedâ for
the surge in coronavirus patients, and says it is not ""overwhelmed"". Russia's Health Minister Mikhail Murashko blames the growing spread on the
""behaviour"" of Russians and is urging them to get vaccinated. Although several Russian-developed jabs have been available for
months, authorities are struggling to inoculate avaccine-sceptic population. Moscow - the epicentre of Russia's outbreak - has so far withheld from
bringing back restrictions. However, it announced on Monday that two dozen sites would open in the capital for residents to get free rapid tests. Independent experts have accused authorities of downplaying the
severity of Russia's epidemic. Russiaâs Federal State Statistics Service, also known as the Rosstat
statistics agency, said last week an estimate of 400,000 Russians that
contracted coronavirus had died by the end of August. Ministers have urged parents to get their children vaccinated Covid infections rose exponentially among five to 17-year-olds in England in September, as children returned for the autumn school term, research suggests. Across the general population, the React-1 study, conducted by
Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori between 9 and 27 September, found one in 120 people were infected and prevalence appears to be remaining stable overall. The data shows the infection rate is growing most among those aged under 18, and falling among those aged 18 to 54. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the React programme, says the trends ""reinforce
how important it is for children aged 12 and above to get vaccinated and help
curb the spread of infection, and minimise disruption to education"". Relatively few under-18s have been vaccinated in the UK, as healthy 16 and 17-year-olds were only offered the jab from early August, while first doses have been offered to 12 to 15-year-olds since 20 September. The study's findings also support the arguments for booster jabs for adults, with a higher prevalence of fully vaccinated people testing positive within three to six months of their vaccination.

"Price of chicken set to rise, UK supplier warns","The UK's largest poultry seller has warned that the price of chicken is set to rise because of supply chain problems. The chief executive of 2 Sisters Food Group, Ronald Kers, said that ""in reality food is too cheap"". Mr Kers told the BBC that the price of chicken, the UK's most popular meat, should be higher to reflect the extra costs the business is facing. The firm has 600 farms and 16 factories across the UK. Mr Kers told the BBC's Today programme that the company has had to cope with additional costs because of Brexit, Covid, labour shortages and logistics issues. He added that the ""significant"" inflated costs of packaging, energy and CO2 were also ""bulking up the price of food"". Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Why are gas prices so high? On Wednesday, the founder of 2 Sisters Food Group, Ranjit Boparan, warned that chicken prices would rise by 10%. ""How can it be right that a whole chicken costs less than a pint of beer?"" he said. Mr Boparan said the days of low prices were ""coming to an end"" and that ""transparent, honest pricing"" was needed because of  mounting costs. The company has seen its CO2 costs rise by more than 500% in three weeks, while energy costs have increased by more than 450% from a year earlier. It also said feed costs at farms have risen by 15%, with commodity costs in the farming process also up by around 20%. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Kers said: ""If you look at the price of chicken now it is Â£3.50, while a decade ago it was Â£5 - it should have gone up. ""People on farms are struggling - we don't have enough people on our factories, farms or enough HGV drivers and as a result we're seeing empty shelves and reduced choice,"" he continued. ""There's no margin in the whole supply chain"". The government's visa scheme for short-term workers meant the company was able to bring in an additional 700 people to secure the volume they needed for Christmas, but Mr Kers said the scheme came ""a little too late and a little too short"". 2 Sisters sells 60% of all turkeys in the country and while Mr Kers said the overall supply chain was ""clearly very fragile"", he advised shoppers to buy ""normally"". The firm produces about a third of all the poultry products consumed in the UK and processes more than 10 million birds each week. Rod Adlington at the farm in Coventry Chicken and turkey farmer Rod Adlington, owner of Adlington Ltd, shares Mr Boparan's concerns and has already had to raise the price of his chickens by 8%. ""We've never ever had to put through a price rise before, but if we don't make these changes we just won't be here in six months,"" he told the BBC. The company, based in Coventry, sells premium free range chickens retailing at between Â£15-Â£20.  It sells about 2,000 chickens a week and 10,000 turkeys each Christmas. The price of chicken feed has gone up by 20%, and the business has also been hit by higher energy bills and CO2 prices. To help deal with the labour shortage, the firm has put up wages by 10-15%. But Mr Adlington says there is still not enough staff. ""The labour issue is catastrophic at the moment, we just have no people for the factories,"" he says. ""There's an awful lot of pressure on us and we just can't take it. We need to find a way out of the labour problems."" Edward Cayton owns Peck and Yard chicken shop, which has two branches in Manchester and sells 550 kilo of chicken per week. He said prices rises have ""already had a knock-on effect"". The firm, which was Manchester's first Asian chicken shop, has had to pay Â£4-Â£4.5 per kilo of chicken breast that would have usually cost Â£2. Mr Cayton said thigh pieces are also up by a third and wings, which usually cost Â£2.5 from his supplier, have risen to Â£3.5 per kilo. ""We can't raise menu prices because no one would pay much more for chicken and I can't reduce staff so the cost is having to come out of our margins"". ""We just have to do more marketing and encourage people to go out to absorb the increases"". One of the key factors affecting the supply chain recently has been the shortage of HGV drivers. The shortage has been blamed on a combination of factors, including the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes. At the end of September, the government announced that it would allow 4,700 visas for HGV drivers to deliver food. However, the first foreign HGV food drivers might not be in the country for another month, according to a source with close knowledge of the process. Under the scheme - which is separate to that for HGV fuel drivers - drivers can work in the UK until 28 February. The visa scheme opened for applications on Monday. The Home Office has not confirmed the number of visas that have been applied for so far, but several agencies that are recruiting the drivers told the BBC that they were yet to apply for them. When the visa was announced there was concern from some in the industry that it was too short and would not attract drivers. ""The issue is the shortage of HGV drivers across Europe,"" said one source. ""Offers need to be attractive to encourage drivers to come.""

PM said he would 'tear up' NI Protocol - PaisleyMP Ian Paisley says Boris Johnson promised to tear up the protocol before signing the Brexit deal.Northern Ireland,"Ian Paisley, seen here with Boris Johnson on a visit to a bus factory in 2016, said the PM had agreed tot he protocol 'for the semantics' Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would tear up the Northern Ireland Protocol shortly after he made the EU deal, DUP MP Ian Paisley has claimed. The PM reportedly made the remarks before MPs voted on the deal in 2019. The claims followed comments from Boris Johnson's ex-adviser who saidthe plan was to ""ditch the bits we didn't like"". That prompted the Irish deputy PM to warn countries considering trade deals with the UK that it is a nation that ""doesn't necessarily keep its word"". The protocol, agreed by the EU and UK in the Brexit deal, keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But the UK now says the arrangement imposes too many barriers, as it means goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Britain face checks and controls. This video can not be played PM told me he planned to 'tear up' NI Protocol On Wednesday,the EU revealed its plan to reduce checks on those goods. The proposals include scrapping checks on most food products being shipped to, and remaining in, Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The EU said their new plan would remove about 80% of spot checks and cut customs paperwork by 50%. However, the measures fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from an oversight role. The UK government said it was studying the detail of the EU's proposals. ""Boris Johnson did tell me personally that he would, after agreeing to the protocol, he would sign up to changing that protocol and indeed tearing it up, that this was just for the semantics,"" Mr Paisley told the BBC's Newsnight programme. ""Now that comment has been verified by another source [Dominic Cummings] much closer to Boris Johnson within his own government,"" added the North Antrim MP. The conversation between Mr Johnson and Mr Paisley allegedly took place just before the first House of Commons vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement in October 2019. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar casts doubt on the trustworthiness of the British government. On Tuesday, Downing Street's former strategy chief Dominic Cummings tweeted that he had planned in the autumn of 2019 to get the prime minister to ""ditch bits"" of the Brexit deal. In a series of tweets, Mr Cummings - who has turned against Mr Johnson since being removed from Downing Street at the end of 2020 - claimed the prime minister never understood what the withdrawal agreement really meant. He also dismissed suggestions that abandoning elements of the deal would mean breaking international law. ""Our priorities meant e.g. getting Brexit done is 10,000 times more important than lawyers yapping re international law in negotiations with people who break international law all the time,"" he said. The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal:It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU). It means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules:As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland. But some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all:EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found. Read more:The Northern Ireland Protocol explained The tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister), Leo Varadkar, said Mr Cummings' claims ""must resonate around the world"". ""Essentially now what Dominic Cummings is saying is that this is a country that makes treaties, that strikes agreements and then intends to renege on them,"" he added. ""Don't make any agreement with the British government; don't sign any treaty with the United Kingdom, until you can be confident that this is a country that can honour its promises."" However, when asked about Mr Cummings claims, Brexit negotiator Lord Frost said: ""We all understood extremely well what the deal meant, it delivered on democracy, took the UK out of the EU whole and entire, and it was a very good deal."" Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? Katya Adler: Will talks lead to truce or trade war? 'We do see opportunities, but have had problems' But he said it now had to be changed because it was ""undermining the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, not supporting it"". ""The problem with the protocol at the moment is that EU law, with the European Court of Justice as the enforcer, is applied in Northern Ireland without any democratic process. That has to change if we are to find governance arrangements people can live with,"" he said. Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leaderMichelle O'Neill has urged a recall the Northern Ireland Assemblyto demonstrate support for the NI Protocol, following the EU's proposal. The European Commission'sMaros Å efÄoviÄ will speak with Stormont's political leadersabout the plan later. What is the NI Protocol?

"GPs told to see more patients face-to-faceIt comes as one in four wait over four hours to be seen in A&E in England, latest figures show.HealthComments","A&E waits have sunk to their worst levels in England since the four-hour target started, with doctors warning the situation is bleak ahead of winter. A quarter of patients waited more than four hours for treatment in September - with even longer waits being recorded elsewhere in the UK. It comes as ministers and GPs clashed over demands that practices see more patients face-to-face. The government has handed GP practices Â£250m to take on temporary staff. But the British Medical Association said they were ""hugely dismayed"" with the plan, saying it would not solve the problems. This video can not be played Pandemic healthcare: 'Most GPs are probably working 12 to 14 hour days at least.' The winter rescue package came on the day NHS England released its latest monthly data for hospital performance. Lack of access to GPs has been cited as one of the reasons for growing pressures on A&Es. The A&E performance in England was the worst performance since 2004, when the four-hour target was brought in. Even greater numbers are waiting over four hours in the other nations with four in 10 patients in Northern Ireland taking over four hours to be seen. In England, A&E patients who then went on to be admitted to a ward also faced record-long waits for a bed, so-called ""trolley waits"" - they tend to be the most seriously-ill and frail patients. Of the 386,000 who were admitted, more than a quarter waited over four hours for a bed to become free. And more than 5,000 had to wait over 12 hours. Dr Katherine Henderson, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: ""This data is bleak and is a stark warning of the crisis that we are heading towards this winter."" She added that emergency departments were ""dangerously"" over-crowded and there were widespread reports of ambulances queuing outside hospital because of the demands being placed on the system. The Â£250m funding plan for GPs is part of the extra Â£5bn Covid fund announced last month to help the NHS through the winter. It comes on top of the Â£12bn set aside for GP services this year. Alongside locum doctors - doctors who stand in for others temporarily - GP practices will be able to use the money to recruit other temporary staff such as physios and podiatrists. Pharmacists are also being encouraged to see people with minor illness to relieve the pressure on GPs. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the new GP rescue package would help relieve pressure on the whole system. Only 58% of patients were seen face-to-face in August - the first full month following the ending of restrictions. That compares with 54% in January and more than 80% before the pandemic. Patients have also complained of long waits on phone lines to book an appointment. Kevin Fogarty said his 84-year-old mother was initially refused face-to-face contact with a GP, despite having an infection in her leg following a biopsy. ""She had not been seen for two years. However, an infection developed in the wound but the GP still wouldn't see her. We had to put pressure on them."" Mr Fogarty, 60, said the practice in Somerset eventually agreed to see her in person and she is now getting home visits from a nurse to tend to her wound. ""GPs seem to be the only group not getting back to normal services, while the likes of shop workers and everyone else are getting on with it. ""Telephone and video calls are helpful as an initial consultation, but the GP must see the patient should they insist or there is a requirement."" Alongside the extra money, social distancing rules are also expected to be relaxed in GP surgeries and responsibility for signing fitness-to-work and fitness-to-drive certificates will be able to be passed on to other staff. Mr Javid said: ""I'm determined to ensure patients can see their GP in the way they want, no matter where they live. ""Our new plan provides general practice teams with investment and targeted support. This will tackle underperformance, taking pressure off staff so they can spend more time with patients and increase the number of face-to-face appointments."" GP surgeries will be named in league tables if they are judged to have failed to provide an appropriate level of ""access"". But Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said he was ""hugely dismayed"" with the package. ""It offers very little and shows a government out of touch with the scale of the crisis on the ground."" He said patients would ""continue to suffer"" and find it harder to book appointments. ""It is disappointing to see there is no end in sight to the preoccupation with face-to-face appointments."" He said in-person appointments were still a key feature of GP care but the pandemic had proven phone or video consultations were ""entirely appropriate and appreciated"" by many. The rescue package comes amid the government's ongoing struggle to increase the number of GPs. Over the past five years the total - in terms of full-time posts - has fallen despite successive government drives to increase numbers. NHS Providers, which represents health bosses, said its members were particularly worried about A&Es alongside mental health and cancer services. Deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said: ""The NHS is fighting fires on multiple fronts as they try to recover care backlogs, increased demand for emergency care, treating patients with Covid and preparing for what is likely to be the most challenging winter yet for the NHS. ""In a matter of weeks, we will face our first winter where both flu and Covid are in circulation.""

This video can not be played PM told me he planned to 'tear up' NI Protocol On Wednesday,the EU revealed its plan to reduce checks on those goods. The proposals include scrapping checks on most food products being shipped to, and remaining in, Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The EU said their new plan would remove about 80% of spot checks and cut customs paperwork by 50%. However, the measures fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from an oversight role. The UK government said it was studying the detail of the EU's proposals. ""Boris Johnson did tell me personally that he would, after agreeing to the protocol, he would sign up to changing that protocol and indeed tearing it up, that this was just for the semantics,"" Mr Paisley told the BBC's Newsnight programme. ""Now that comment has been verified by another source [Dominic Cummings] much closer to Boris Johnson within his own government,"" added the North Antrim MP. The conversation between Mr Johnson and Mr Paisley allegedly took place just before the first House of Commons vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement in October 2019. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar casts doubt on the trustworthiness of the British government. On Tuesday, Downing Street's former strategy chief Dominic Cummings tweeted that he had planned in the autumn of 2019 to get the prime minister to ""ditch bits"" of the Brexit deal. In a series of tweets, Mr Cummings - who has turned against Mr Johnson since being removed from Downing Street at the end of 2020 - claimed the prime minister never understood what the withdrawal agreement really meant. He also dismissed suggestions that abandoning elements of the deal would mean breaking international law. ""Our priorities meant e.g. getting Brexit done is 10,000 times more important than lawyers yapping re international law in negotiations with people who break international law all the time,"" he said. The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal:It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU). It means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules:As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland. But some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all:EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found. Read more:The Northern Ireland Protocol explained The tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister), Leo Varadkar, said Mr Cummings' claims ""must resonate around the world"". ""Essentially now what Dominic Cummings is saying is that this is a country that makes treaties, that strikes agreements and then intends to renege on them,"" he added. ""Don't make any agreement with the British government; don't sign any treaty with the United Kingdom, until you can be confident that this is a country that can honour its promises."" However, when asked about Mr Cummings claims, Brexit negotiator Lord Frost said: ""We all understood extremely well what the deal meant, it delivered on democracy, took the UK out of the EU whole and entire, and it was a very good deal."" Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? Katya Adler: Will talks lead to truce or trade war? 'We do see opportunities, but have had problems' But he said it now had to be changed because it was ""undermining the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, not supporting it"". ""The problem with the protocol at the moment is that EU law, with the European Court of Justice as the enforcer, is applied in Northern Ireland without any democratic process. That has to change if we are to find governance arrangements people can live with,"" he said. Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leaderMichelle O'Neill has urged a recall the Northern Ireland Assemblyto demonstrate support for the NI Protocol, following the EU's proposal.

What we know about the Norway bow and arrow attack,"The suspect was arrested 30 minutes after officers first confronted him in Kongsberg A bow and arrow attack that left five people dead and three others wounded has shocked Norway. A 37-year-old Danish man has been arrested and is being questioned by police, who have not ruled out terrorism. The attack was the country's deadliest since the far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in 2011. Here's what we know. The attack took place on Wednesday evening in Kongsberg, which is about 80km (49 miles) south-west of Norway's capital, Oslo. The attacker launched the assault near a Coop Extra supermarket on Kongsberg's west side. Police first received a report of a man shooting at people with a bow and arrow at 18:12 local time (16:12 GMT). Shortly afterwards, officers arrived on the scene. It is not clear if they were armed when they first came across the suspect. They made contact with the attacker at 18:18. The officers were then shot at with arrows before the attacker escaped. Attacks were subsequently reported in different locations. One witness told local media they saw a woman lying injured at an intersection and calling for help. Another witness told the TV2 channel that she saw a ""man standing on the corner with arrows in a quiver on his shoulder and a bow in his hand"". ""Afterwards, I saw people running for their lives. One of them was a woman holding a child by the hand,"" she said. Images from Kongsberg showed arrows lying on the ground and one sticking out of a wall. At a news conference on Thursday, Norwegian police official Ole Bredrup Saeverud said the victims were most likely killed after officers first confronted the attacker. The suspect was arrested at 18:45 - 35 minutes after the attack began. Warning shots were fired during the arrest, police said. Norwegian media questioned why it took police more than half an hour to arrest the suspect after the first reports of an attack. Mr Saeverud said it had been a ""confusing"" situation. Norway's intelligence service, PST, said the attack appeared to be an ""act of terror"" but further investigation was needed to establish the motivation. Officers named him,externalas Espen Andersen Brathen, a 37-year-old Danish citizen with a Danish mother and Norwegian father. Police prosecutor Ann IrÃ©n Svane Mathiassen told TV2 that the man lived in Kongsberg and was known to police. He will be assessed by psychiatric experts, she told NRK. The suspect converted to Islam and ""there were fears linked to radicalisation previously"", Chief Saeverud told reporters. He said the latest report of concern about radicalisation was in 2020. ""We haven't had any reports about him in 2021,"" Mr Saeverud said. Public broadcaster NRK reported that Brathen received a six-month restraining order against two family members last year. According to the verdict in that case, he reportedly left a revolver on the sofa which one family member perceived as a threat. This video can not be played Norway attack witness: ""I heard a distinct thunk sound"" The suspect was taken to a police station in the town of Drammen, where he was questioned by police. ""He is explaining in detail and he is speaking and co-operating with the police,"" the suspect's lawyer, Fredrik Neumann, told reporters. Mr Saeverud said the suspect confessed during questioning, adding that he was ""relatively sure that he acted alone"". The suspect was charged and is expected to appear before a court in Kongsberg on Friday at 09:00 local time. None of the victims have been formally identified. Four women and a man, all aged between 50 and 70, were killed, police said. Relatives have been notified. Police say they do not believe the suspect knew any of the victims. One of those injured was an off-duty police officer who was in the supermarket, where the attack is said to have started. He and one other wounded person were stable. In a press release on Thursday, police said a third person was wounded and had been taken to an emergency room. Incoming Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said the attack was a ""gruesome and brutal act"". It happened a day before his centre-left coalition government was due to take office. The outgoing conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg said reports of the attack were ""horrifying"". And Kongsberg Mayor Kari Anne Sand said it was a shocking attack that had taken place in an area where many people lived. Describing the town as ""a completely ordinary community with completely ordinary people"", Ms Sand said everyone had been deeply shaken by ""this very tragic situation"". Internationally, political leaders expressed shock and offered their condolences.

"Dominoâs seeks 8,000 drivers before Christmas rush","Domino's Pizza says it intends to hire more than 8,000 drivers in the UK and Ireland in the run-up to Christmas. The fast-food chain has already recruited thousands of workers in the past year or so to keep up with demand. The latest move comes as a nationwide shortage of goods vehicle drivers continues to plague the UK economy. Domino's said it offered good long-term prospects, as more than 90% of store managers had started in the kitchen or as delivery drivers. It also stressed that most of the jobs on offer were permanent and not just for Christmas. However, it may still have a struggle recruiting the workers it needs, according to analysis by job site Indeed. At the start of this month, the share of searches being made for seasonal roles by jobseekers was 27% lower than in the same period in 2019 and down 33% on its 2018 level. In June, Domino's saidit was hiring 5,000 cooks and delivery drivers, as staff who joined during the pandemic headed back to former roles after Covid restrictions eased. How do I find a new job and who is hiring? Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Domino's operations director Nicola Frampton said 2021 had been a busy year for the firm so far, but the busiest period was ""just around the corner"". ""Our delivery drivers are vital to the service we provide our customers and the success of our business, so we're really keen to hear from those wanting to join."" At the same time, Domino's said sales in the 13 weeks to 26 September were up 8.8% on a like-for-like basis to Â£375.8m. Orders collected from stores rose 40.3% and are now at 82% of pre-pandemic levels. The chain said it was still on target to open 30 new stores this year, having opened five in the latest trading period. The company said it sold seven pizzas each second over the 13 weeks, with online orders peaking at 13 a second on 3 July during England's match against Ukraine in the Euro 2020 football tournament. But it also warned that supply chain problems and rising staff wages were starting to have an effect. ""We have seen some impact from the well-publicised pressures on labour availability and food cost inflation, which we expect to extend into next year, but continue to take proactive, preventative measures to ensure our world-class supply chain service levels are maintained and that cost increases are constrained.""

Sunak: We're doing all we can to fix shop supplies,"Shoppers can be reassured ministers are doing ""absolutely everything we can"" to fix supply chain issues in the UK, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. In recent days, several retailers have warned of potential shortages during the Christmas shopping season. Speaking to the BBC at the end of G7 meetings in Washington, Mr Sunak blamed global factors for delays seen at ports such as Felixstowe. It comes as G7 finance ministers agreed to work together to address the issues. Mr Sunak said: ""I'm confident there'll be a good amount of Christmas presents available for everyone to buy."" His comments came after a container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked concerns among businesses, ahead of the most important period of the year for retail spending. On Wednesday, the UK's largest commercial port said the supply chain crisis has caused a logjam of shipping containers. The Port of Felixstowe, which handles 36% of the UK's freight container traffic, blamed the busy pre-Christmas period and haulage shortages. However, it said the situation has been improving over the last few days. Meanwhile, shipping giant Maersk told the BBC it was rerouting some of its biggest ships away from the port. Shipping giant Maersk has rerouted some ships away from Felixstowe At the same time, one of biggest ports in the US will start operating 24 hours a day to try to clear long queues of cargo ships. The Port of Los Angeles in California said it will handle more goods at night after a similar move by nearby Long Beach port. The ports - which handle 40% of all cargo containers entering the US - have faced months of problems. Major US firms such as Walmart and FedEx have also committed to increasing their round-the-clock operations to help clear the jam, the White House said on Wednesday. Mr Sunak was speaking after the G7 agreed to work more closely together to monitor issues facing the movement of goods around the world. The meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors discussed the importance of global co-operation to ensure that supply chains are more resilient as the world emerges from the pandemic. The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. Ministers and officials from the member countries hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events. Shops have been hit by shortages in recent weeks In the BBC interview, Mr Sunak largely focused on the situation for industry in the UK - and he said he completely rejected the assertion of the head of UK Steel that the government had created a ""hostile environment"" for industrial investment and levelling up. But when asked if he, as chancellor, was prepared to accept that high gas prices would put some heavy industry out of business he said he had to make sure taxpayers' money was protected and that ""it's not the government's job to come in and start managing the price of every individual product"". Mr Sunak said the government would work constructively with businesses after Prime Minister Boris Johnson blamed shortages on UK firms ""mainlining"" migrant labour, pointing to the appointment of the former Tesco boss Sir Dave Lewis as a supply chain tsar. However, the chancellor also said ""everyone"" including Mr Johnson accepts that increasing wages without increasing productivity would be inflationary. He said the move to a high wage, high-skill economy advocated by Mr Johnson would ""obviously take time"".

EU went extra mile with NI Brexit offer - diplomat,"Diplomat JoÃ£o Vale de Almeida was previously the EU's ambassador to the US and UN The EU has gone the extra mile by offering a fix to the row about trade in Northern Ireland, a senior EU official has said. JoÃ£o Vale de Almeida - who is the EU's ambassador to the UK - told the BBC the bloc's proposals were ""unprecedented"". The EUhas suggested changing part of the Brexit dealthat specifically covers Northern Ireland. Both sides agree it has problems. The UK and EU will now hold three weeks of talks to discuss the suggestions. When the Brexit deal was agreed less than two years ago, the two sides signed up to the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part that aimed to stop checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Instead, the trade checks take place when goods arrive into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. What's the Northern Ireland Protocol? Were there Brexit warnings about Northern Ireland? But two years on, both sides admit there are problems with the protocol. The UK says the current arrangement imposes too many barriers, and the EU recognises it has caused problems for businesses in Northern Ireland. Their suggested solutions differ, however, with the UKwanting a completely new protocol,while the EU wants to adapt the current one. This video can not be played Watch the lorry journey from England to NI On Wednesday, the EUpublished its plan of how the protocol could be amended- cutting the number of spot checks by 80% and also halving the amount of customs paperwork. Speaking to BBC Two's Newsnight, Mr Vale de Almeida, who became the ambassador to the UK last year, said: ""What we have presented in Brussels today is unprecedented. And I have been working for the EU for almost 40 years now. ""What we have done today goes very far. We went the extra mile to address the problems that were created by Brexit in Northern Ireland, which the protocol tries to mitigate."" He insisted that the EU's suggestions did not represent it giving way to the UK government. ""These are not concessions, these are proposals that we make out of our own initiative,"" he said. ""Why should they be concessions? We're not forced to propose this, we proposed this because we realised that there are problems in Northern Ireland and we care about Northern Ireland, we want the protocol to work."" ""We are not renegotiating the protocol, we are adapting the protocol,"" he said. Why is there a row over the European Court of Justice? NI businesses give verdict on protocol After the EU set out its plans on Wednesday, the UK said it would study the detail and the next step should involve rapid and intensive talks to see if a solution could be found. But disagreements could still remain, including over the role of the European Court of Justice - the EU's highest court - in Northern Ireland. Both sides previously agreed that the ECJ can police matters of EU law in Northern Ireland, as Northern Ireland will be staying in the EU's single market for goods. So, for example if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ. But the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frost previously said he wants the ECJ's role to be removed. Mr Vale de Almeida said the EU had gone to the limits of what it could offer. Asked about the ECJ issue on Newsnight, Mr Vale de Almeida - who is Portuguese - said: ""There is no single market without the European Court of Justice. ""It's the referee of the single market. ""So if Northern Ireland wants to have access to single market for goods... and at same time have access to the British market, it's a unique position in the world... there has to be a European Court of Justice. One does not go without the other."" Talks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are now likely to go on for several weeks. The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal:It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU). It means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules:As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland.

The PM reportedly made the remarks before MPs voted on the deal in 2019. The claims followed comments from Boris Johnson's ex-adviser who saidthe plan was to ""ditch the bits we didn't like"". That prompted the Irish deputy PM to warn countries considering trade deals with the UK that it is a nation that ""doesn't necessarily keep its word"". The protocol, agreed by the EU and UK in the Brexit deal, keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But the UK now says the arrangement imposes too many barriers, as it means goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Britain face checks and controls. This video can not be played PM told me he planned to 'tear up' NI Protocol On Wednesday,the EU revealed its plan to reduce checks on those goods. The proposals include scrapping checks on most food products being shipped to, and remaining in, Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The EU said their new plan would remove about 80% of spot checks and cut customs paperwork by 50%. However, the measures fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from an oversight role. The UK government said it was studying the detail of the EU's proposals. ""Boris Johnson did tell me personally that he would, after agreeing to the protocol, he would sign up to changing that protocol and indeed tearing it up, that this was just for the semantics,"" Mr Paisley told the BBC's Newsnight programme. ""Now that comment has been verified by another source [Dominic Cummings] much closer to Boris Johnson within his own government,"" added the North Antrim MP. The conversation between Mr Johnson and Mr Paisley allegedly took place just before the first House of Commons vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement in October 2019. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar casts doubt on the trustworthiness of the British government. On Tuesday, Downing Street's former strategy chief Dominic Cummings tweeted that he had planned in the autumn of 2019 to get the prime minister to ""ditch bits"" of the Brexit deal. In a series of tweets, Mr Cummings - who has turned against Mr Johnson since being removed from Downing Street at the end of 2020 - claimed the prime minister never understood what the withdrawal agreement really meant. He also dismissed suggestions that abandoning elements of the deal would mean breaking international law. ""Our priorities meant e.g. getting Brexit done is 10,000 times more important than lawyers yapping re international law in negotiations with people who break international law all the time,"" he said. The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal:It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU). It means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules:As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland. But some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all:EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found. Read more:The Northern Ireland Protocol explained The tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister), Leo Varadkar, said Mr Cummings' claims ""must resonate around the world"". ""Essentially now what Dominic Cummings is saying is that this is a country that makes treaties, that strikes agreements and then intends to renege on them,"" he added. ""Don't make any agreement with the British government; don't sign any treaty with the United Kingdom, until you can be confident that this is a country that can honour its promises."" However, when asked about Mr Cummings claims, Brexit negotiator Lord Frost said: ""We all understood extremely well what the deal meant, it delivered on democracy, took the UK out of the EU whole and entire, and it was a very good deal.""

'We do see opportunities, but have had problems' But he said it now had to be changed because it was ""undermining the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, not supporting it"". ""The problem with the protocol at the moment is that EU law, with the European Court of Justice as the enforcer, is applied in Northern Ireland without any democratic process. That has to change if we are to find governance arrangements people can live with,"" he said.

Ministers to attend cross-border health meeting,"Stormont politicians have joined a North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting, the first sincethe Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) boycottwas ruled unlawful. It went ahead after First Minister Paul Givan agreed to the agenda. He said it was in line with his party's position,which allows for meetings on health issues. The DUP refuses to attend north-south talks in protest againstthe Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is part of the Brexit deal agreed in 2019 and was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Givan defends DUP boycott of north-south meetings DUP boycott of north-south meetings 'unlawful' DUP snubs second north-south meeting in days The DUP boycott, announced by party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson last month,was ruled unlawful by a high court judge on Monday.

"EU went extra mile with NI Brexit offer - diplomatOur proposals to help fix Northern Ireland trade problems are unprecedented, the bloc's UK ambassador says.","Diplomat JoÃ£o Vale de Almeida was previously the EU's ambassador to the US and UN The EU has gone the extra mile by offering a fix to the row about trade in Northern Ireland, a senior EU official has said. JoÃ£o Vale de Almeida - who is the EU's ambassador to the UK - told the BBC the bloc's proposals were ""unprecedented"". The EUhas suggested changing part of the Brexit dealthat specifically covers Northern Ireland. Both sides agree it has problems. The UK and EU will now hold three weeks of talks to discuss the suggestions. When the Brexit deal was agreed less than two years ago, the two sides signed up to the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part that aimed to stop checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Instead, the trade checks take place when goods arrive into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. What's the Northern Ireland Protocol? Were there Brexit warnings about Northern Ireland? But two years on, both sides admit there are problems with the protocol. The UK says the current arrangement imposes too many barriers, and the EU recognises it has caused problems for businesses in Northern Ireland. Their suggested solutions differ, however, with the UKwanting a completely new protocol,while the EU wants to adapt the current one. This video can not be played Watch the lorry journey from England to NI On Wednesday, the EUpublished its plan of how the protocol could be amended- cutting the number of spot checks by 80% and also halving the amount of customs paperwork. Speaking to BBC Two's Newsnight, Mr Vale de Almeida, who became the ambassador to the UK last year, said: ""What we have presented in Brussels today is unprecedented. And I have been working for the EU for almost 40 years now. ""What we have done today goes very far. We went the extra mile to address the problems that were created by Brexit in Northern Ireland, which the protocol tries to mitigate."" He insisted that the EU's suggestions did not represent it giving way to the UK government. ""These are not concessions, these are proposals that we make out of our own initiative,"" he said. ""Why should they be concessions? We're not forced to propose this, we proposed this because we realised that there are problems in Northern Ireland and we care about Northern Ireland, we want the protocol to work."" ""We are not renegotiating the protocol, we are adapting the protocol,"" he said. Why is there a row over the European Court of Justice? NI businesses give verdict on protocol After the EU set out its plans on Wednesday, the UK said it would study the detail and the next step should involve rapid and intensive talks to see if a solution could be found. But disagreements could still remain, including over the role of the European Court of Justice - the EU's highest court - in Northern Ireland. Both sides previously agreed that the ECJ can police matters of EU law in Northern Ireland, as Northern Ireland will be staying in the EU's single market for goods. So, for example if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ. But the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frost previously said he wants the ECJ's role to be removed. Mr Vale de Almeida said the EU had gone to the limits of what it could offer. Asked about the ECJ issue on Newsnight, Mr Vale de Almeida - who is Portuguese - said: ""There is no single market without the European Court of Justice. ""It's the referee of the single market. ""So if Northern Ireland wants to have access to single market for goods... and at same time have access to the British market, it's a unique position in the world... there has to be a European Court of Justice. One does not go without the other."" Talks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are now likely to go on for several weeks. The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal:It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU).

Plan to boost face-to-face GP consultationsExtra Â£250m available to pay for locum staff to help practices in England improve access over winter.HealthComments,"A&E waits have sunk to their worst levels in England since the four-hour target started, with doctors warning the situation is bleak ahead of winter. A quarter of patients waited more than four hours for treatment in September - with even longer waits being recorded elsewhere in the UK. It comes as ministers and GPs clashed over demands that practices see more patients face-to-face. The government has handed GP practices Â£250m to take on temporary staff. But the British Medical Association said they were ""hugely dismayed"" with the plan, saying it would not solve the problems. This video can not be played Pandemic healthcare: 'Most GPs are probably working 12 to 14 hour days at least.' The winter rescue package came on the day NHS England released its latest monthly data for hospital performance. Lack of access to GPs has been cited as one of the reasons for growing pressures on A&Es. The A&E performance in England was the worst performance since 2004, when the four-hour target was brought in. Even greater numbers are waiting over four hours in the other nations with four in 10 patients in Northern Ireland taking over four hours to be seen. In England, A&E patients who then went on to be admitted to a ward also faced record-long waits for a bed, so-called ""trolley waits"" - they tend to be the most seriously-ill and frail patients. Of the 386,000 who were admitted, more than a quarter waited over four hours for a bed to become free. And more than 5,000 had to wait over 12 hours. Dr Katherine Henderson, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: ""This data is bleak and is a stark warning of the crisis that we are heading towards this winter."" She added that emergency departments were ""dangerously"" over-crowded and there were widespread reports of ambulances queuing outside hospital because of the demands being placed on the system. The Â£250m funding plan for GPs is part of the extra Â£5bn Covid fund announced last month to help the NHS through the winter. It comes on top of the Â£12bn set aside for GP services this year. Alongside locum doctors - doctors who stand in for others temporarily - GP practices will be able to use the money to recruit other temporary staff such as physios and podiatrists. Pharmacists are also being encouraged to see people with minor illness to relieve the pressure on GPs. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the new GP rescue package would help relieve pressure on the whole system. Only 58% of patients were seen face-to-face in August - the first full month following the ending of restrictions. That compares with 54% in January and more than 80% before the pandemic. Patients have also complained of long waits on phone lines to book an appointment. Kevin Fogarty said his 84-year-old mother was initially refused face-to-face contact with a GP, despite having an infection in her leg following a biopsy. ""She had not been seen for two years. However, an infection developed in the wound but the GP still wouldn't see her. We had to put pressure on them."" Mr Fogarty, 60, said the practice in Somerset eventually agreed to see her in person and she is now getting home visits from a nurse to tend to her wound. ""GPs seem to be the only group not getting back to normal services, while the likes of shop workers and everyone else are getting on with it. ""Telephone and video calls are helpful as an initial consultation, but the GP must see the patient should they insist or there is a requirement."" Alongside the extra money, social distancing rules are also expected to be relaxed in GP surgeries and responsibility for signing fitness-to-work and fitness-to-drive certificates will be able to be passed on to other staff. Mr Javid said: ""I'm determined to ensure patients can see their GP in the way they want, no matter where they live. ""Our new plan provides general practice teams with investment and targeted support. This will tackle underperformance, taking pressure off staff so they can spend more time with patients and increase the number of face-to-face appointments."" GP surgeries will be named in league tables if they are judged to have failed to provide an appropriate level of ""access"". But Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said he was ""hugely dismayed"" with the package. ""It offers very little and shows a government out of touch with the scale of the crisis on the ground."" He said patients would ""continue to suffer"" and find it harder to book appointments. ""It is disappointing to see there is no end in sight to the preoccupation with face-to-face appointments."" He said in-person appointments were still a key feature of GP care but the pandemic had proven phone or video consultations were ""entirely appropriate and appreciated"" by many. The rescue package comes amid the government's ongoing struggle to increase the number of GPs. Over the past five years the total - in terms of full-time posts - has fallen despite successive government drives to increase numbers. NHS Providers, which represents health bosses, said its members were particularly worried about A&Es alongside mental health and cancer services. Deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said: ""The NHS is fighting fires on multiple fronts as they try to recover care backlogs, increased demand for emergency care, treating patients with Covid and preparing for what is likely to be the most challenging winter yet for the NHS. ""In a matter of weeks, we will face our first winter where both flu and Covid are in circulation.""

"Bow and arrow suspect known to Norwegian policeA man held for killing five people was a convert to Islam who had shown signs of radicalisation, police say.Europe","This video can not be played Norway attack witness: ""I heard a distinct thunk sound"" A deadly bow and arrow attack in Norway which left five people dead appears to have been an act of terror, Norway's security service (PST) said. The suspect, a 37-year-old Danish citizen named Espen Andersen Brathen, had converted to Islam and there were fears he had been radicalised. However a motive has not yet been determined. He is accused of killing four women and a man on Wednesday night in the southern town of Kongsberg. Ina press release,externalon Thursday (in Norwegian), police said Brathen was due to appear in court on Friday at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT). A police lawyer told public broadcaster NRK he would be assessed by psychiatrists. During a press conference PST head Hans Sverre Sjovold said the suspect had been ""in and out of the health system for some time"". Residents have been deeply shaken by the violence. Flags were flown at half-mast on Thursday while flowers and other memorials were placed in Kongsberg's main square. The victims were all aged between 50 and 70, regional police chief Ole Bredrup Saeverud told reporters at a Thursday morning news briefing. What we know about the Norway bow and arrow attack The attack was first reported at 18:13 (16:13 GMT) on Wednesday. Police confronted the man six minutes later, but he shot several arrows at them and escaped. He was eventually caught about 30 minutes later. It was during this time, between being first approached and then arrested, that the victims were killed, the police chief said. A woman was also stabbed at a nearby intersection, witnesses told local media. Police fired warning shots when he was eventually arrested, but it is not clear if officers were armed when they first came across the suspect. Norwegian police do not usually carry guns on them - weapons are stored at police stations or in their patrol cars. The attack was Norway's deadliest since far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik murdered 77 people, most of them teenagers, on the island of Utoya in July 2011. The attacker allegedly launched the assault inside a Coop Extra supermarket on Kongsberg's west side. One of those injured was an off-duty police officer who was in the shop at the time. The officer and another person who was wounded are recovering in hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police on Thursday said a third person had also been injured, and was taken to the emergency room. Police prosecutor Ann IrÃ©n Svane Mathiassen told NRK that from what they could tell all those attacked were ""completely random victims"". She said the police believed the man went into people's homes to kill them during the attack. One witness told local outlet TV2 she had heard a commotion and saw a woman taking cover, then a ""man standing on the corner with arrows in a quiver on his shoulder and a bow in his hand"". ""Afterwards, I saw people running for their lives. One of them was a woman holding a child by the hand,"" she added. Police have told Norwegian news agency NTB that the attacker also used other weapons during the incident, without giving more details. Residents have placed tributes for those killed in Kongsberg town centre The suspect moved over a large area, and authorities cordoned off several parts of the town. Residents were ordered to stay indoors so authorities could examine the scene and gather evidence. Police searched surrounding gardens and garages with the help of sniffer dogs. Kongsberg Mayor Kari Anne Sand said it was a shocking attack in an area where many people lived, and that a crisis team would help anyone affected. Describing the town as ""a completely ordinary community with completely ordinary people"", Ms Sand said everyone had been deeply shaken by ""this very tragic situation"". British woman Fiona Herland, who has lived in Kongsberg for five years, described the town as ""a very warm, cosy place - nothing happens here."" ""This is absolutely devastating. You can feel the atmosphere here has darkened,"" she told the BBC. Espen Andersen Brathen is set to appear in court at 09:00 local time on Friday Officers took the suspect to a police station in the town of Drammen, where his defence lawyer, Fredrik Neumann, said he was questioned for more than three hours and was co-operating with authorities. The suspect had a Danish mother and Norwegian father, he said. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Danish authorities will work with their Norwegian counterparts on the investigation. Police prosecutor Ann IrÃ©n Svane Mathiassen told TV2 that the man lived in Kongsberg and was known to police. The attack came on the final day of then-Prime Minister Erna Solberg's conservative government. On Thursday morning, Labour leader Jonas Gahr Store became Norway's new Prime minister with a centre-left coalition. Mr Store said it was a ""gruesome and brutal act"". NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, who is from Oslo, said it was ""shocking news"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rich countries' CO2 emissions rose rapidly in 2021,"A coal-fired power plant in China's Inner Mongolia Carbon emissions are rebounding strongly and are rising across the world's 20 richest nations, according to a new study. TheClimate Transparency Report,externalsays that CO2 will go up by 4% across the G20 group this year, having dropped 6% in 2020 due to the pandemic. China, India and Argentina are set to exceed their 2019 emissions levels. The authors say that the continued use of fossil fuels is undermining efforts to rein in temperatures. 'Adapt or die' warning over UK climate change Facebook to act on illegal sale of Amazon rainforest UK public now eating significantly less meat With just two weeks left until the criticalCOP26 climate conferenceopens in Glasgow, the task facing negotiators is stark. One of the key goals of the gathering is to take steps to keep the important 1.5C temperature threshold alive and within reach. Flooding has taken place in many parts of China across 2021 With the world currently around 1.1C warmer than pre-industrial times, limiting future incremental increases is extremely challenging. If Glasgow is going to succeed on this question, then the countries that create the most carbon will have to put ambitious policies into place. A really simple guide to climate change Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? The evidence from this new report is that it isn't happening fast enough. The G20 group is responsible for around 75% of global emissions, which fell significantly last year as economies were closed down in response to Covid-19. But this year's rebound is being powered by fossil fuel, especially coal. According to the report, compiled by 16 research organisations and environmental campaign groups, coal use across the G20 is projected to rise by 5% this year. This is mainly due to China who are responsible for around 60% of the rise, but increases in coal are also taking place in the US and India. Coal use in China has surged with the country experiencing increased demand for energy as the global economy has recovered. Coal prices are up nearly 200% from a year ago. This in turn has seenpower cutsas it became uneconomical for coal-fired electricity plants generate electricity in recent months. With the Chinese government announcing a change in policy this week to allow these power plants to charge market rates for their energy, the expectation is that this will spur even more coal use this year. When it comes to gas, the Climate Transparency Report finds that use is up by 12% across the G20 in the 2015-2020 period. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet it's climate targets? While political leaders have promised that the global recovery from Covid should have a green focus, the financial commitments made by rich nations don't bear this out. Of the $1.8tn that has been earmarked for recovery spending, just $300bn will go on green projects. To put that figure into context, it almost matches the $298bn spent by G20 countries in subsidising fossil fuel industries in the eighteen months up to August 2021. The report also points to some positive developments including the growth of solar and wind energy in richer countries, with record amounts of new capacity installed across the G20 last year. Renewables now supply around 12% of power compared to 10% in 2020. Politically, there has been significant progress as well with the G20 group as the majority recognise that net zero targets are needed for around the middle of this century. All members of the group have agreed to put new 2030 carbon plans on the table before the Glasgow conference.

""G20 governments need to come to the table with more ambitious national emission reductions targets. The numbers in this report confirm we can't move the dial without them - they know it, we know it - the ball is firmly in their court ahead of COP26,"" said Kim Coetzee from Climate Analytics, who coordinated the overall analysis. Coal consumption is projected to rise by almost 5% in 2021, with this growth driven by China (accounting for 61% of the growth), the USA (18%) and India (17%) The US (4.9 tCO2/capita) and Australia (4.1 tCO2/capita) have the highest building emissions per capita in the G20 (average is 1.4 tCO2/capita), reflecting the high share of fossil fuels, especially natural gas and oil, used for heat generation Between 1999 and 2018 there have been nearly 500,000 fatalities and close to $3.5 trillion of economic costs due to climate impacts worldwide, with China, India, Japan, Germany, and the US being hit particularly hard in 2018 Across the G20, the current average market share of electric vehicles (EVs) in new car sales remains low at 3.2% (excluding the EU), with Germany, France, and the UK having the highest shares of EVs There are expectations that both India and China will submit new national plans before the meeting in Glasgow, which could give a significant boost to attempts to keep the 1.5C target in view. The G20 group will meet in Rome in the days leading up to COP26 and the UK minister who will lead the talks has in recent days urged the leaders of these countries to now step up. ""It is leaders who made a promise to the world in Paris six years ago, and it is leaders that must honour it,"" said Alok Sharma. ""Responsibility rests with each and every country, and we must all play our part. Because on climate, the world will succeed, or fail, as one.""

GP rescue plan to boost face-to-face consultationsExtra Â£250m available to pay for locum staff to help practices in England improve access over winter.,"A&E waits have sunk to their worst levels in England since the four-hour target started, with doctors warning the situation is bleak ahead of winter. A quarter of patients waited more than four hours for treatment in September - with even longer waits being recorded elsewhere in the UK. It comes as ministers and GPs clashed over demands that practices see more patients face-to-face. The government has handed GP practices Â£250m to take on temporary staff. But the British Medical Association said they were ""hugely dismayed"" with the plan, saying it would not solve the problems. This video can not be played Pandemic healthcare: 'Most GPs are probably working 12 to 14 hour days at least.' The winter rescue package came on the day NHS England released its latest monthly data for hospital performance. Lack of access to GPs has been cited as one of the reasons for growing pressures on A&Es. The A&E performance in England was the worst performance since 2004, when the four-hour target was brought in. Even greater numbers are waiting over four hours in the other nations with four in 10 patients in Northern Ireland taking over four hours to be seen. In England, A&E patients who then went on to be admitted to a ward also faced record-long waits for a bed, so-called ""trolley waits"" - they tend to be the most seriously-ill and frail patients. Of the 386,000 who were admitted, more than a quarter waited over four hours for a bed to become free. And more than 5,000 had to wait over 12 hours. Dr Katherine Henderson, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: ""This data is bleak and is a stark warning of the crisis that we are heading towards this winter."" She added that emergency departments were ""dangerously"" over-crowded and there were widespread reports of ambulances queuing outside hospital because of the demands being placed on the system. The Â£250m funding plan for GPs is part of the extra Â£5bn Covid fund announced last month to help the NHS through the winter. It comes on top of the Â£12bn set aside for GP services this year. Alongside locum doctors - doctors who stand in for others temporarily - GP practices will be able to use the money to recruit other temporary staff such as physios and podiatrists. Pharmacists are also being encouraged to see people with minor illness to relieve the pressure on GPs. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the new GP rescue package would help relieve pressure on the whole system. Only 58% of patients were seen face-to-face in August - the first full month following the ending of restrictions. That compares with 54% in January and more than 80% before the pandemic. Patients have also complained of long waits on phone lines to book an appointment. Kevin Fogarty said his 84-year-old mother was initially refused face-to-face contact with a GP, despite having an infection in her leg following a biopsy. ""She had not been seen for two years. However, an infection developed in the wound but the GP still wouldn't see her. We had to put pressure on them."" Mr Fogarty, 60, said the practice in Somerset eventually agreed to see her in person and she is now getting home visits from a nurse to tend to her wound. ""GPs seem to be the only group not getting back to normal services, while the likes of shop workers and everyone else are getting on with it. ""Telephone and video calls are helpful as an initial consultation, but the GP must see the patient should they insist or there is a requirement."" Alongside the extra money, social distancing rules are also expected to be relaxed in GP surgeries and responsibility for signing fitness-to-work and fitness-to-drive certificates will be able to be passed on to other staff. Mr Javid said: ""I'm determined to ensure patients can see their GP in the way they want, no matter where they live. ""Our new plan provides general practice teams with investment and targeted support. This will tackle underperformance, taking pressure off staff so they can spend more time with patients and increase the number of face-to-face appointments."" GP surgeries will be named in league tables if they are judged to have failed to provide an appropriate level of ""access"". But Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said he was ""hugely dismayed"" with the package. ""It offers very little and shows a government out of touch with the scale of the crisis on the ground."" He said patients would ""continue to suffer"" and find it harder to book appointments. ""It is disappointing to see there is no end in sight to the preoccupation with face-to-face appointments."" He said in-person appointments were still a key feature of GP care but the pandemic had proven phone or video consultations were ""entirely appropriate and appreciated"" by many. The rescue package comes amid the government's ongoing struggle to increase the number of GPs. Over the past five years the total - in terms of full-time posts - has fallen despite successive government drives to increase numbers. NHS Providers, which represents health bosses, said its members were particularly worried about A&Es alongside mental health and cancer services. Deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said: ""The NHS is fighting fires on multiple fronts as they try to recover care backlogs, increased demand for emergency care, treating patients with Covid and preparing for what is likely to be the most challenging winter yet for the NHS.

EU negotiator to speak with NI leaders on protocol,"Maros Å efÄoviÄ says he has ""no mandate"" to renegotiate the Northern Ireland Protocol European Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ has said he is ""not ready to renegotiate"" the Northern Ireland Protocol. On Wednesday, he revealed aplan to reduce post-Brexit checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. It seeks to calm a long-running dispute over a key part of the Brexit deal. He told the BBC that the EU was ready to discuss issues and concerns with the protocol. Mr Å efÄoviÄ added that the EU would ""respect deals we have signed which became international law"". But he said he had ""no mandate to renegotiate protocol"". Northern Ireland's special Brexit deal keeps it in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. Most food products will not need to be physically checked when arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain A cut to the required administration for Northern Ireland importers Expanded trusted trader arrangements meaning more products and companies are exempt from customs tariffs Change to current laws to ensure no disruption to  moving medicines across the Irish Sea Improved engagement with stakeholders in Northern Ireland including politicians and business groups The UK says the arrangement imposes too many barriers, as goods arriving from Britain face checks and controls. The EU says its new plan would remove about 80% of spot checks and cut customs paperwork by 50%. However, the measures fall short of UK demands to fundamentally change the protocol by removing the European Court of Justice (ECJ) - the EU's highest court - from an oversight role. On Tuesday, the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frostproposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing one. As part of these plans, the UK government wants to reverse its previous agreement on the oversight role of the ECJ. The Brexit agreement states that the ECJ has jurisdiction to rule on matters of EU law in Northern Ireland - so for example, if there was a dispute around complying with applicable EU law, the EU could take the UK to the ECJ. The protocol avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland Speaking to BBC NI's The View programme on Thursday, Mr Å efÄoviÄ said: ""I do not see how we can have access to the single market without oversight from the European Court of Justice."" Mr Å efÄoviÄ said he wants to see a revised protocol agreement signed off ""before the end of the year"". He said he hopes to ""start the new year with a new agreement and with a positive new EU/UK agenda"". ""I have demonstrated I can do a lot, I am testing flexibility within the protocol but we should respect it and look how practically we can resolve the problems linked to protocol,"" he said. ""I am ready to go at big lengths to achieve that."" He said the EU's proposal is ""far reaching"" and that he is ""delivering on my promise that I would do whatever it takes to deliver on concerns linked with medicine supply"". Former UK Brexit secretary David Davis cast doubt on a deal made before Christmas, but said he believed Mr Å efÄoviÄ was ""trying very hard"" to achieve this. But he told The View that if the EU refused to make concessions on the oversight role of European Court of Justice,Article 16would be triggered as a result. The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal:It is an agreement that means goods can pass freely across the Irish border. Basically, lorries don't have to stop and prove their goods follow EU rules when they go between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU). It means Northern Ireland still follows some EU rules:As the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) no longer follow EU trade rules, some goods from there have to be checked when they arrive in Northern Ireland. But some goods from Britain can't enter Northern Ireland at all:EU rules don't allow certain products, like chilled sausages, to enter its market. A grace period, where the rules don't apply, has been in place since January but no long-term solution has been found. Read more:The Northern Ireland Protocol explained The UK government said it was studying the detail of the EU's proposals. Lord Frost is meeting Mr Å efÄoviÄ in Brussels on Friday to begin this process, and talks between the EU and UK on the new proposals are likely to go on for several weeks. Mr Å efÄoviÄ met with four of Northern Ireland's main party leaders on Thursday. Speaking after the meeting, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said agreement with the EU is possible, even though unionists believe the proposed changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol did not go far enough. Sir Jeffrey said officials from the EU and UK would meet later this week. ""What the EU have put on the table falls well short of what we need,"" he said. ""But progress is being made and we need to see more progress in the next few days."" Some unionists in Northern Ireland have held street protests against the protocol Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the EU proposals may be attractive to some but ""to other sectors they have been oversold and will under-deliver"" as they did not deal with some core issues. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said the proposals demonstrated ""generous flexibility"" and called on the UK Government to show the same willingness to reach an accommodation. Mr Eastwood called on Sir Jeffrey to withdrawhis threat to collapse the devolved institutions, in light of the movement made by EU leaders. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill reiterated her support for the protocol and the EU's ""practical proposals to ensure it works more smoothly for local businesses"". ""It is time for the British government to put an end to the bluster and to engage constructively with the process of trying to find solutions to the practical issues that need to be addressed,"" she said. Sinn FÃ©in areseeking a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly, but that looks unlikely to happen as their recall petition has not been signed by any other parties. Speaking on Wednesday, Alliance leader Naomi Long said there was ""a bit of gameplay going on"". ""It worries me that the EU have dealt with all of those issues, the practical and pragmatic things, that businesses and politicians have raised and as soon as they get within touching distance of a really improved situation, suddenly it's about the ECJ,"" she said. Brexit has led to new checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland At the start of the year, the new post-Brexit arrangement -known as the Northern Ireland Protocol- was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It involves keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods - but this, in turn, creates a new trade border with Great Britain. Unionists say this undermines their place in the UK. Brexit Minister Lord Frost has said the protocol was harming the peace process in Northern Irelandand that it undermined the Good Friday Agreement. The EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and is now attempting to ease that burden with what it calls ""a different model"". Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? Katya Adler: Will talks lead to truce or trade war? 'We do see opportunities, but have had problems' A UK government spokesperson welcomed Mr Å efÄoviÄ's efforts to address the concerns about the protocol, adding that the UK was studying these proposals with officials working closely with their EU counterparts to understand the detail. ""Nevertheless it is clear there is still a substantial gap between our two positions,"" said the spokesperson. ""We need to discuss them intensively in the days to come to see if the gaps can be bridged and a solution found which delivers the significant change needed."" There are also plans to give Northern Ireland politicians and other interested parties greater influence over the implementation of the protocol. The View is onBBC iPlayer.

Rich countries' CO2 emissions rose rapidly in 2021Emissions from the richest countries are going up again this year as the global economy rebounds.,"A coal-fired power plant in China's Inner Mongolia Carbon emissions are rebounding strongly and are rising across the world's 20 richest nations, according to a new study. TheClimate Transparency Report,externalsays that CO2 will go up by 4% across the G20 group this year, having dropped 6% in 2020 due to the pandemic. China, India and Argentina are set to exceed their 2019 emissions levels. The authors say that the continued use of fossil fuels is undermining efforts to rein in temperatures. 'Adapt or die' warning over UK climate change Facebook to act on illegal sale of Amazon rainforest UK public now eating significantly less meat With just two weeks left until the criticalCOP26 climate conferenceopens in Glasgow, the task facing negotiators is stark. One of the key goals of the gathering is to take steps to keep the important 1.5C temperature threshold alive and within reach. Flooding has taken place in many parts of China across 2021 With the world currently around 1.1C warmer than pre-industrial times, limiting future incremental increases is extremely challenging. If Glasgow is going to succeed on this question, then the countries that create the most carbon will have to put ambitious policies into place. A really simple guide to climate change Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? The evidence from this new report is that it isn't happening fast enough. The G20 group is responsible for around 75% of global emissions, which fell significantly last year as economies were closed down in response to Covid-19. But this year's rebound is being powered by fossil fuel, especially coal. According to the report, compiled by 16 research organisations and environmental campaign groups, coal use across the G20 is projected to rise by 5% this year. This is mainly due to China who are responsible for around 60% of the rise, but increases in coal are also taking place in the US and India. Coal use in China has surged with the country experiencing increased demand for energy as the global economy has recovered. Coal prices are up nearly 200% from a year ago. This in turn has seenpower cutsas it became uneconomical for coal-fired electricity plants generate electricity in recent months. With the Chinese government announcing a change in policy this week to allow these power plants to charge market rates for their energy, the expectation is that this will spur even more coal use this year. When it comes to gas, the Climate Transparency Report finds that use is up by 12% across the G20 in the 2015-2020 period. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet it's climate targets? While political leaders have promised that the global recovery from Covid should have a green focus, the financial commitments made by rich nations don't bear this out. Of the $1.8tn that has been earmarked for recovery spending, just $300bn will go on green projects. To put that figure into context, it almost matches the $298bn spent by G20 countries in subsidising fossil fuel industries in the eighteen months up to August 2021. The report also points to some positive developments including the growth of solar and wind energy in richer countries, with record amounts of new capacity installed across the G20 last year. Renewables now supply around 12% of power compared to 10% in 2020. Politically, there has been significant progress as well with the G20 group as the majority recognise that net zero targets are needed for around the middle of this century. All members of the group have agreed to put new 2030 carbon plans on the table before the Glasgow conference. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains how to cut your carbon footprint However, China, India, Australia and Saudi Arabia have not yet done so. ""G20 governments need to come to the table with more ambitious national emission reductions targets. The numbers in this report confirm we can't move the dial without them - they know it, we know it - the ball is firmly in their court ahead of COP26,"" said Kim Coetzee from Climate Analytics, who coordinated the overall analysis. Coal consumption is projected to rise by almost 5% in 2021, with this growth driven by China (accounting for 61% of the growth), the USA (18%) and India (17%) The US (4.9 tCO2/capita) and Australia (4.1 tCO2/capita) have the highest building emissions per capita in the G20 (average is 1.4 tCO2/capita), reflecting the high share of fossil fuels, especially natural gas and oil, used for heat generation Between 1999 and 2018 there have been nearly 500,000 fatalities and close to $3.5 trillion of economic costs due to climate impacts worldwide, with China, India, Japan, Germany, and the US being hit particularly hard in 2018 Across the G20, the current average market share of electric vehicles (EVs) in new car sales remains low at 3.2% (excluding the EU), with Germany, France, and the UK having the highest shares of EVs There are expectations that both India and China will submit new national plans before the meeting in Glasgow, which could give a significant boost to attempts to keep the 1.5C target in view. The G20 group will meet in Rome in the days leading up to COP26 and the UK minister who will lead the talks has in recent days urged the leaders of these countries to now step up. ""It is leaders who made a promise to the world in Paris six years ago, and it is leaders that must honour it,"" said Alok Sharma. ""Responsibility rests with each and every country, and we must all play our part. Because on climate, the world will succeed, or fail, as one.""

LiveLiveGPs will be 'horrified' by winter rescue plan - union4 minutes ago,"The NHS faces an ""exceptionally difficult"" winter whether there is a Covid surge or not, England's chief medial officer Prof Chris Whitty says GPs in England are being told to see more patients face-to-face as ministers unveil a Â£250m winter rescue package But the doctors' union says the package shows ""a government out of touch with the scale of the crisis"" The British Medical Association adds doctors will be ""horrified"" by the idea the plan will save them when it could ""sink the ship altogether"" Health Secretary Sajid Javid defends the plan, saying it will provide financial support and remove ""red tape"" But former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says the package won't ""turn the tide"" and says a ""sticking plaster will no longer cut it"" Nearly 470,000 A&E patients in England waited longer than four hours to be treated in September Lateral flow tests are very good at detecting those most likely to spread Covid, researchers say Edited by Hamish Mackay Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a reminder of some of the day's headlines:  This live page was written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and Malu Cursino. It was edited by Hamish Mackay and James Clarke. From all of us, have a good evening. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Since July, infection rates have been bobbling around â with periods of increases followed by drops. That is a sign we have reached an equilibrium whereby the
amount of immunity in the population keeps the virus in check. However, it is now clear we are seeing the most sustained rise since
July, with more than 45,000 new cases reported in the UK today. There was always a concern the autumn could prompt a
significant rise. A combination of an increase in mixing with waning immunity
could unbalance that equilibrium. What is noticeable about the latest figures is that there
are signs infection rates are going up in older age groups and not just in
teenagers, certainly in England. That is a worry because of the impact it will
have on hospital cases. But what remains to be seen is how long this rise lasts â and what the consequences will be. The roll-out of boosters will offer more protection to those at highest risk of serious illness. The vaccination of children may help drive down overall infection levels. With flu just beginning to take-off and a virus called RSV, the leading cause of hospitalisation for respiratory illness among the under fives, at high levels, it is easy to see why there is such concern about what the coming months will bring. Members of the British Medical Association are calling for the health secretary to explain where extra locum doctors - otherwise known as temporary, freelance doctors - will come from to fulfil his winter plan. Sajid Javid saysÂ£250m will be given to GP surgeries in England to pay for temporary staffto boost face-to-face appointments. but Dr Ben Molyneux, BMA sessional GPs committee chair, says: âItâs not as if there is a large group of locums on standby, waiting for a call from their local practice to go in and help out. ""Those locums who can and want to be in work, are already doing so."" Dr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chairman, adds that it is unclear how practices will access the new funding and
how many hoops they will have to jump through to get it. âMost worrying is that the funding is being linked to
current performance, so it will penalise practices most in need of support,"" he says âGP morale is already at rock bottom and being asked to
âprove themselvesâ in order to secure desperately needed extra investment will
be an insult too far. Rather than taking away unnecessary bureaucracy as we
needed, the government has just added more."" Tuberculosis is on the rise internationally for the first time in a decade, the World Health Organization says - linked to problems accessing healthcare during the pandemic. WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says it is ""alarming news"" and ""must serve as a global wake-up call"" to the need to close gaps in diagnosis, treatment and care for those affected, the AFP agency reports. In its annual TB report for 2020, the WHO had said progress towards eradicating TB entirely had been made worse, because of cases going undiagnosed and untreated. It estimates about 4.1 million people have TB that has not been diagnosed or officially declared - up from 2.9 million in 2019. Dr Tedros says: ""This report confirms our fears that the disruption of essential health services due to the pandemic could start to unravel years of progress against tuberculosis."" Last month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that
""day two"" PCR tests would be replaced with cheaper lateral flow tests
for fully vaccinated travellers from ""the end of October"".Tour operators and airlines are now calling on the government to publish a date. No firm details have been issued yet. Travel chiefs, and travellers
going overseas, are frustrated by this delay. Jet2 - UKâs second-largest tour operator - says it is experiencing an increase in demand following a difficult 18
months. The travel business says âhalf-term will be incredibly busyâ and it will be âoperating up to 2,500 weekly flightsâ. Steve Heapy, boss of Jet2, says: ""It is time for the UK government to confirm exactly when these changes will come into force."" Half-term holidays begin this Friday in some areas of
England, while other schools in England and Wales follow in the last week of
October. Northern Ireland's schools have a short break in
October and Scotland's half-term has already happened. The government is encourageing travellers to hold off from booking tests for half-term. At the moment, fully vaccinated travellers need to do a PCR test on day two of arrival in the UK. Under the new rules, lateral flow tests will replace PCR tests for those that are fully jabbed, but the date of the change remains unknown. There are no changes if you are not fully vaccinated. The UK has recorded another 45,066 coronavirus cases,according to the government's daily figures.,external It is the highest number of new infections since 20 July, when the number was 46,558. Another 157 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have also been reported. Earlier we heard from England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who warned this winter will be ""exceptionally difficult"" for the NHS. While the vaccination programme has weakened the link between Covid cases and hospital admissions, the health service also faces other challenges, including the return of normal winter illnesses and a backlog of other patients waiting for treatment delayed by the pandemic. Last year saw much lower levels of flu than normal due to lockdown measures and social distancing. But this means immunity to flu and other respiratory viruses will have waned, while very young children will not have been able to develop any at all. Alongside Covid patients, this could put significant pressure on NHS services. Hospitals are also dealing with a huge backlog, with record numbers waiting for operations and other routine treatments. Kyrie Irving (left) is a seven-time All-Star Basketball star Kyrie Irving says he is ""doing what's best for me"" in refusing the Covid-19 vaccine, a move that will see him sidelined from the NBA. His team the Brooklyn Netts says Irving will not play until he is eligible to become ""a full participant"" under New York City Covid-19 vaccine rules. Regulations state that all athletes,externalwho play or train in the city have to be vaccinated and the 29-year-old says he will not bow to pressure. Speaking about the issue on Instagram, Irving says: ""Do what's best for you, but I am not an advocate for either side.I am doing what's best for me."" Aswe've been reporting, ministers have set up aÂ£250memergency winter rescue package so GP surgeries can take on more temporary staff. So how far will that money go? There are around7,500GP surgeries in England, according to NHS data. The Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth says that the proposal works out atÂ£33,000per GP surgery which ""is not enough money to recruit an extra doctor"". The government says the money is to help surgeries take on more temporary staff. Royal College of Practitioners,externalis advertising some locum GP roles at aroundÂ£700a day and on that basis the money would pay for a temporary GP at one surgery for 47 days. Most people on the continent are tested when they turn up at health centres with symptoms Six out of every seven coronavirus cases are not being detected in Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. It has made the calculation based on a formula that looks at recorded deaths and case fatality rates. So far only eight million Covid cases have been recorded but the WHO now estimates the real figure could be 59 million. In the main, the only people who are tested are those who turn up at health centres with symptoms and those intending to travel out of their country. This means a huge number of asymptomatic cases are not being spotted, resulting in more transmission. To deal with this, the WHO is boosting community screening in eight countries aiming to reach seven million people with rapid testing in the next year. âWith limited
testing, weâre still flying blind in far too many communities in Africa...  More testing means rapid isolation, less transmission and more
lives saved through targeted action,â says WHO's Africa director Dr Matshidiso Moeti. Burundi, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Congo-Brazzaville, Senegal and Zambia will be taking part. There has been a decline in recorded new cases recently, the WHO says, but there is concern that with low vaccination rates Covid remains a threat for many. Case rates in England are continuing to rise in all age groups, according to the UK Health Security Agency. The highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds, with 1,120.8 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 10 October, up week-on-week from 1,061.8. This is followed by five to nine-year-olds, for whom rates are up from 484.2 to 574.2. For both age groups this is the highest weekly rate since this data was first collected in October 2020. The lowest rate is among people aged 80 and over, at 110.8, up from 90.2. Vaccination rates are lower in under-18s, as healthy 16 and 17-year-olds were only offered a Covid jab from early August, while first doses have been offered to 12 to 15-year-olds since 20 September. Meanwhile, cases are also rising in all regions of England, the data shows. The East Midlands has the highest rate, with 488.7 cases per 100,000 people, up from 450. London has the lowest rate at 214.2, up from 204.6. You can check the number of cases in your area here. A nurse has received an award from the Royal College of
Nursing for her outstanding efforts to create a Covid-19 vaccine clinic for
people with learning disabilities and autism. Rebecca Crossleydeveloped a sensory-friendly clinicwith patients
who find syringes, PPE and a noisy clinic daunting at the heart of her planning.
Due to her efforts to make the environment as sensory-friendly as possible, the
clinic has a 99.9% vaccine take-up rate. Rebecca pitched the idea to the clinical commissioning group
and James Paget Hospital following her own experience having the Covid jab earlier this year. The clinic is ongoing and based in the Waveney area of Norfolk and north Suffolk. The Royal College of Nursing says its awards showcase the diversity of nursing and recognise commitment, compassion and clinical excellence. Rebecca says patients ""come through a sensory garden to enter the clinic, where all the equipment is hidden behind a screen"". She adds that it is important ""to get it right the first time because people have to come back, and if you get it wrong, they won't come back"". We've been telling you about anew winter planthat's being set up in England. As part of it, GPs are being told to see more patients face-to-face, with funding being given for more temporary staff. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says the new GP rescue package will help relieve pressure on the whole system. But what do GPs themselves think about it? Dr Rob Barnett, who works at Greenbank Road Surgery in Liverpool, says: ""I would ask the health secretary to come here to our surgery and see for himself how it works and how weâve had to change to support patients. âMore face-to-face appointments isnât the answer - if we were to make all our interactions face-to-face we would end up with huge waiting lists."" Dr Barnett, a British Medical Association representative in the North West, says GPs are ""having more contact than ever with patients"" online and on the phone - and that ""just throwing money at the issue"" is not going to solve their problems. AndDr Nigel de Kare-Silverof Gladstone Medical Centre in north-west London says the fund is ""a long-awaited recognition of the impossible strains on our services"". But he stresses there are ""massive workforce issues which cannot be ignored with an undersupply of trained competent GPs across the UK"". ""Even with this boost on funding"", he says, ""the historic decline in GP numbers"" would not be alleviated. But, he says recognition of the problem by government could help ""alleviate the pressures from patients who have health concerns -  increasingly expressed as abuse to our front-line reception and clinical teams"".   The government has set up a Â£250m emergency winter rescue package so GP surgeries can take on more locums - but what does this mean? What is a locum GP?They are doctors who are employed on a temporary basis to help surgeries fulfil appointments. They may be self-employed or work for an agency. They might work solely as a locum, be employed by another surgery or have retired from full-time practice. How much do they earn?Locum GP roles advertised by theRoyal College of General Practitioners,externalare aboutÂ£700a day. Richard Fieldhouse, chairman of the National Association of Sessional GPs (NASGP) says an agency locum can cost upwards ofÂ£1,000a day with 30% going to the agency. But he says some locums chargeÂ£200per half day to work at a surgery where they feel part of a team. ""Money has never been the problem in getting locums, it's how you treat them,"" he says. How many locums are there?NASGP says there are about 20,000 locum GPs across the UK and they make up 25% of the workforce. British actress Letitia Wright has denied a report that she shared anti-vaccination  views on the set of Black Panther 2. Wright, who plays Shuri in the Marvel films, says the story in The Hollywood Reporter is ""completely untrue"". It comes after she was criticised in December for sharing a video making unsubstantiated claims about the safety of coronavirus vaccines. Wright, 27, has responded on Instagram, saying: ""Anyone who knows me or has worked with me, knows that I work incredibly hard at my craft & my main focus is always to do work that's impactful and inspiring. That has been & will continue to be my only focus."" Late last year, she become embroiled in a controversy after posting a link to a video whose host said people taking the vaccines would have to ""hope it doesn't make extra limbs grow"". After being criticised on Twitter, Wright said she wasn't against vaccines but it was important to ""ask questions"". Read more here. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty has been speaking at a GPs' conference and says this winter will be ""exceptionally difficult"" for the NHS. He says this will be the case ""irrespective"" of whether the country experiences relatively low Covid cases or a further surge, alongside other winter pressures such as flu and falls. Prof Whitty also praises GPs for their ""outstanding"" hard work during the pandemic, after some said they felt they were being attacked by sections of the media and some politicians over the issue of face-to-face appointments. On the lessons to be learned from the pandemic, he tells the annual conference of the Royal College of GPs ""there
are certainly some quite significant things we got wrong at the beginning of
Covid"". However, he says it would be a mistake to assume the lessons from the current pandemic would necessarily be applicable to the next one. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says unless the government addresses long term planning for the GP workforce the number of face-to-face appointments will go down and not up. In a longthread of tweets,externalthe Conservative MP, who chairs the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, says: ""As someone who tried and failed to get 5,000 more GPs into the system, I donât think this package will turn the tide."" He says he got thousands more graduates into GP surgeries but found experienced GPs were retiring or going part time faster than new trainees arrived. Hunt says the only way to stop this is ""a clear plan to end the unsustainable pressure they face"". He suggests a big recruitment drive and incentives to persuade retired GPs who stepped up temporarily during the pandemic to extend their service. ""But sticking plaster after sticking plaster will no longer cut it. Unless we fix workforce planning in the NHS for the long term, the future will be bleak and the number of face-to-face GP appointments will go down not up,"" he says. The new justice secretary says he can't promise when court backlogs in England and Wales will return to pre-pandemic levels. Funding cuts and delays caused by Covid restrictions have contributed to the unprecedented delays in prosecuting and jailing criminals. More than 60,000 crown court trials are waiting to be heard with many serious cases now being listed in late 2023. Dominic Raab, who moved to the role last month, tells the BBC he hopes backlogs will fall within 12 months but could not give a precise figure. Read more. Russiaâs surging outbreak hits a population with only 31% fully jabbed,
according to the Gogov website, which tallies data from around the country. The Kremlin has refrained from re-introducing major restrictions, despite calling the country's vaccination rate ""unacceptably"" low. It says authorities have to ensure ""the economy continues
working."" Today, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has ruled out a lockdown and
says authorities have to ""continue to explain to people that it is
necessary to be vaccinated.â ""It's irresponsible not to get the vaccine,"" Peskov says. He adds ""the entire medical infrastructure is mobilisedâ for
the surge in coronavirus patients, and says it is not ""overwhelmed"". Russia's Health Minister Mikhail Murashko blames the growing spread on the
""behaviour"" of Russians and is urging them to get vaccinated. Although several Russian-developed jabs have been available for
months, authorities are struggling to inoculate avaccine-sceptic population. Moscow - the epicentre of Russia's outbreak - has so far withheld from
bringing back restrictions. However, it announced on Monday that two dozen sites would open in the capital for residents to get free rapid tests. Independent experts have accused authorities of downplaying the
severity of Russia's epidemic. Russiaâs Federal State Statistics Service, also known as the Rosstat
statistics agency, said last week an estimate of 400,000 Russians that
contracted coronavirus had died by the end of August. Ministers have urged parents to get their children vaccinated Covid infections rose exponentially among five to 17-year-olds in England in September, as children returned for the autumn school term, research suggests. Across the general population, the React-1 study, conducted by
Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori between 9 and 27 September, found one in 120 people were infected and prevalence appears to be remaining stable overall. The data shows the infection rate is growing most among those aged under 18, and falling among those aged 18 to 54. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the React programme, says the trends ""reinforce
how important it is for children aged 12 and above to get vaccinated and help
curb the spread of infection, and minimise disruption to education"". Relatively few under-18s have been vaccinated in the UK, as healthy 16 and 17-year-olds were only offered the jab from early August, while first doses have been offered to 12 to 15-year-olds since 20 September. The study's findings also support the arguments for booster jabs for adults, with a higher prevalence of fully vaccinated people testing positive within three to six months of their vaccination.

Facebook claims checked for breach of UK law,"Whistleblower Frances Haugen warned about the risks to children from Facebook's products The data-privacy watchdog has written to a Facebook whistleblower, requesting her full evidence to see whether the technology company has broken UK law. The information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, says she wants to analyse the documents from a UK perspective, particularly relating to children. Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen claimed the social-media company hid ""behind walls"" about how it used data. But Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg rejected her allegations. ""Most of us just don't recognise the false picture of the company that is being painted,"" he said. Ms Denham, who is stepping down next month, told BBC News: ""We're looking very closely about what is publicly available right now from Frances's testimony - but I've also written to her to ask for access to the full reports of her allegations. Facebook harms children, claims ex-employee Whistleblower to appear before UK Parliament committee Facebook whistleblower reveals identity ""Because what I want to do with that information is analyse it from the UK's perspective - are these harms applicable in the UK, especially through the lens of children? ""We have rolled out a new children's code, which specifies design consideration to protect kids online. ""I want to see if these allegations point to any contravention of UK law and then I will take action."" This video can not be played Elizabeth Denham promised to take action if the evidence showed Facebook had contravened UK law The whistleblower claimed Facebook's products could pose a risk to children's mental health and stoke divisions in society. ""Facebook's closed design means it has no real oversight,"" Ms Haugen, who used to work on the company's algorithmic products, told a US Senate committee. ""Only Facebook knows how it personalises your feed for you. ""Facebook hides behind walls that keep researchers and regulators from understanding the true dynamics of their system."" Ms Haugen is to give evidence to the UK Parliament's online safety bill committee on 25 October. Elizabeth Denham has done far more than most to rein in big tech. But she is alarmed at the mismatch in power between democracies and Silicon Valley - and efforts to politicise the regulator she leaves. For the past five years, stories about the harms caused by social media giants have followed a wearisome and familiar pattern. First, scandal erupts. Next, the cry goes up: Something Must Be Done! (See also: Up With This We Will Not Put!) Then, reflecting headlines and noise on (ironically) social media, a meeting is convened, for which ambassadors of the tech giants are summoned. Finallyâ¦ not much happens. This pattern has been seen over and over and over again. And the common theme in these stories is how some big societal harm often falls between regulators, with Ofcom, the Advertising Standards Authority, and the Competition and Markets Authority, all sticking understandably to their remits. Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner who steps down next month, has been something of an antidote to this pattern. Read more from Amol Rajan here.

LiveLiveGPs in England to get Â£250m for extra staff7 minutes ago,"The NHS faces an ""exceptionally difficult"" winter whether there is a Covid surge or not, England's chief medial officer Prof Chris Whitty says GPs in England are being told to see more patients face-to-face as ministers unveil a Â£250m winter rescue package But the doctors' union says the package shows ""a government out of touch with the scale of the crisis"" The British Medical Association adds doctors will be ""horrified"" by the idea the plan will save them when it could ""sink the ship altogether"" Health Secretary Sajid Javid defends the plan, saying it will provide financial support and remove ""red tape"" But former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says the package won't ""turn the tide"" and says a ""sticking plaster will no longer cut it"" Nearly 470,000 A&E patients in England waited longer than four hours to be treated in September Lateral flow tests are very good at detecting those most likely to spread Covid, researchers say Edited by Hamish Mackay Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a reminder of some of the day's headlines:  This live page was written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and Malu Cursino. It was edited by Hamish Mackay and James Clarke. From all of us, have a good evening. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Since July, infection rates have been bobbling around â with periods of increases followed by drops. That is a sign we have reached an equilibrium whereby the
amount of immunity in the population keeps the virus in check. However, it is now clear we are seeing the most sustained rise since
July, with more than 45,000 new cases reported in the UK today. There was always a concern the autumn could prompt a
significant rise. A combination of an increase in mixing with waning immunity
could unbalance that equilibrium. What is noticeable about the latest figures is that there
are signs infection rates are going up in older age groups and not just in
teenagers, certainly in England. That is a worry because of the impact it will
have on hospital cases. But what remains to be seen is how long this rise lasts â and what the consequences will be. The roll-out of boosters will offer more protection to those at highest risk of serious illness. The vaccination of children may help drive down overall infection levels. With flu just beginning to take-off and a virus called RSV, the leading cause of hospitalisation for respiratory illness among the under fives, at high levels, it is easy to see why there is such concern about what the coming months will bring. Members of the British Medical Association are calling for the health secretary to explain where extra locum doctors - otherwise known as temporary, freelance doctors - will come from to fulfil his winter plan. Sajid Javid saysÂ£250m will be given to GP surgeries in England to pay for temporary staffto boost face-to-face appointments. but Dr Ben Molyneux, BMA sessional GPs committee chair, says: âItâs not as if there is a large group of locums on standby, waiting for a call from their local practice to go in and help out. ""Those locums who can and want to be in work, are already doing so."" Dr Richard Vautrey, BMA GP committee chairman, adds that it is unclear how practices will access the new funding and
how many hoops they will have to jump through to get it. âMost worrying is that the funding is being linked to
current performance, so it will penalise practices most in need of support,"" he says âGP morale is already at rock bottom and being asked to
âprove themselvesâ in order to secure desperately needed extra investment will
be an insult too far. Rather than taking away unnecessary bureaucracy as we
needed, the government has just added more."" Tuberculosis is on the rise internationally for the first time in a decade, the World Health Organization says - linked to problems accessing healthcare during the pandemic. WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says it is ""alarming news"" and ""must serve as a global wake-up call"" to the need to close gaps in diagnosis, treatment and care for those affected, the AFP agency reports. In its annual TB report for 2020, the WHO had said progress towards eradicating TB entirely had been made worse, because of cases going undiagnosed and untreated. It estimates about 4.1 million people have TB that has not been diagnosed or officially declared - up from 2.9 million in 2019. Dr Tedros says: ""This report confirms our fears that the disruption of essential health services due to the pandemic could start to unravel years of progress against tuberculosis."" Last month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that
""day two"" PCR tests would be replaced with cheaper lateral flow tests
for fully vaccinated travellers from ""the end of October"".Tour operators and airlines are now calling on the government to publish a date. No firm details have been issued yet. Travel chiefs, and travellers
going overseas, are frustrated by this delay. Jet2 - UKâs second-largest tour operator - says it is experiencing an increase in demand following a difficult 18
months. The travel business says âhalf-term will be incredibly busyâ and it will be âoperating up to 2,500 weekly flightsâ. Steve Heapy, boss of Jet2, says: ""It is time for the UK government to confirm exactly when these changes will come into force."" Half-term holidays begin this Friday in some areas of
England, while other schools in England and Wales follow in the last week of
October. Northern Ireland's schools have a short break in
October and Scotland's half-term has already happened. The government is encourageing travellers to hold off from booking tests for half-term. At the moment, fully vaccinated travellers need to do a PCR test on day two of arrival in the UK. Under the new rules, lateral flow tests will replace PCR tests for those that are fully jabbed, but the date of the change remains unknown. There are no changes if you are not fully vaccinated. The UK has recorded another 45,066 coronavirus cases,according to the government's daily figures.,external It is the highest number of new infections since 20 July, when the number was 46,558. Another 157 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have also been reported. Earlier we heard from England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who warned this winter will be ""exceptionally difficult"" for the NHS. While the vaccination programme has weakened the link between Covid cases and hospital admissions, the health service also faces other challenges, including the return of normal winter illnesses and a backlog of other patients waiting for treatment delayed by the pandemic. Last year saw much lower levels of flu than normal due to lockdown measures and social distancing. But this means immunity to flu and other respiratory viruses will have waned, while very young children will not have been able to develop any at all. Alongside Covid patients, this could put significant pressure on NHS services. Hospitals are also dealing with a huge backlog, with record numbers waiting for operations and other routine treatments. Kyrie Irving (left) is a seven-time All-Star Basketball star Kyrie Irving says he is ""doing what's best for me"" in refusing the Covid-19 vaccine, a move that will see him sidelined from the NBA. His team the Brooklyn Netts says Irving will not play until he is eligible to become ""a full participant"" under New York City Covid-19 vaccine rules. Regulations state that all athletes,externalwho play or train in the city have to be vaccinated and the 29-year-old says he will not bow to pressure. Speaking about the issue on Instagram, Irving says: ""Do what's best for you, but I am not an advocate for either side.I am doing what's best for me."" Aswe've been reporting, ministers have set up aÂ£250memergency winter rescue package so GP surgeries can take on more temporary staff. So how far will that money go? There are around7,500GP surgeries in England, according to NHS data. The Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth says that the proposal works out atÂ£33,000per GP surgery which ""is not enough money to recruit an extra doctor"". The government says the money is to help surgeries take on more temporary staff. Royal College of Practitioners,externalis advertising some locum GP roles at aroundÂ£700a day and on that basis the money would pay for a temporary GP at one surgery for 47 days. Most people on the continent are tested when they turn up at health centres with symptoms Six out of every seven coronavirus cases are not being detected in Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. It has made the calculation based on a formula that looks at recorded deaths and case fatality rates. So far only eight million Covid cases have been recorded but the WHO now estimates the real figure could be 59 million. In the main, the only people who are tested are those who turn up at health centres with symptoms and those intending to travel out of their country. This means a huge number of asymptomatic cases are not being spotted, resulting in more transmission. To deal with this, the WHO is boosting community screening in eight countries aiming to reach seven million people with rapid testing in the next year. âWith limited
testing, weâre still flying blind in far too many communities in Africa...  More testing means rapid isolation, less transmission and more
lives saved through targeted action,â says WHO's Africa director Dr Matshidiso Moeti. Burundi, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Congo-Brazzaville, Senegal and Zambia will be taking part. There has been a decline in recorded new cases recently, the WHO says, but there is concern that with low vaccination rates Covid remains a threat for many. Case rates in England are continuing to rise in all age groups, according to the UK Health Security Agency. The highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds, with 1,120.8 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 10 October, up week-on-week from 1,061.8. This is followed by five to nine-year-olds, for whom rates are up from 484.2 to 574.2. For both age groups this is the highest weekly rate since this data was first collected in October 2020. The lowest rate is among people aged 80 and over, at 110.8, up from 90.2. Vaccination rates are lower in under-18s, as healthy 16 and 17-year-olds were only offered a Covid jab from early August, while first doses have been offered to 12 to 15-year-olds since 20 September. Meanwhile, cases are also rising in all regions of England, the data shows. The East Midlands has the highest rate, with 488.7 cases per 100,000 people, up from 450. London has the lowest rate at 214.2, up from 204.6. You can check the number of cases in your area here. A nurse has received an award from the Royal College of
Nursing for her outstanding efforts to create a Covid-19 vaccine clinic for
people with learning disabilities and autism. Rebecca Crossleydeveloped a sensory-friendly clinicwith patients
who find syringes, PPE and a noisy clinic daunting at the heart of her planning.
Due to her efforts to make the environment as sensory-friendly as possible, the
clinic has a 99.9% vaccine take-up rate. Rebecca pitched the idea to the clinical commissioning group
and James Paget Hospital following her own experience having the Covid jab earlier this year. The clinic is ongoing and based in the Waveney area of Norfolk and north Suffolk. The Royal College of Nursing says its awards showcase the diversity of nursing and recognise commitment, compassion and clinical excellence. Rebecca says patients ""come through a sensory garden to enter the clinic, where all the equipment is hidden behind a screen"". She adds that it is important ""to get it right the first time because people have to come back, and if you get it wrong, they won't come back"". We've been telling you about anew winter planthat's being set up in England. As part of it, GPs are being told to see more patients face-to-face, with funding being given for more temporary staff. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says the new GP rescue package will help relieve pressure on the whole system. But what do GPs themselves think about it? Dr Rob Barnett, who works at Greenbank Road Surgery in Liverpool, says: ""I would ask the health secretary to come here to our surgery and see for himself how it works and how weâve had to change to support patients. âMore face-to-face appointments isnât the answer - if we were to make all our interactions face-to-face we would end up with huge waiting lists."" Dr Barnett, a British Medical Association representative in the North West, says GPs are ""having more contact than ever with patients"" online and on the phone - and that ""just throwing money at the issue"" is not going to solve their problems. AndDr Nigel de Kare-Silverof Gladstone Medical Centre in north-west London says the fund is ""a long-awaited recognition of the impossible strains on our services"". But he stresses there are ""massive workforce issues which cannot be ignored with an undersupply of trained competent GPs across the UK"". ""Even with this boost on funding"", he says, ""the historic decline in GP numbers"" would not be alleviated. But, he says recognition of the problem by government could help ""alleviate the pressures from patients who have health concerns -  increasingly expressed as abuse to our front-line reception and clinical teams"".   The government has set up a Â£250m emergency winter rescue package so GP surgeries can take on more locums - but what does this mean? What is a locum GP?They are doctors who are employed on a temporary basis to help surgeries fulfil appointments. They may be self-employed or work for an agency. They might work solely as a locum, be employed by another surgery or have retired from full-time practice. How much do they earn?Locum GP roles advertised by theRoyal College of General Practitioners,externalare aboutÂ£700a day. Richard Fieldhouse, chairman of the National Association of Sessional GPs (NASGP) says an agency locum can cost upwards ofÂ£1,000a day with 30% going to the agency. But he says some locums chargeÂ£200per half day to work at a surgery where they feel part of a team. ""Money has never been the problem in getting locums, it's how you treat them,"" he says. How many locums are there?NASGP says there are about 20,000 locum GPs across the UK and they make up 25% of the workforce. British actress Letitia Wright has denied a report that she shared anti-vaccination  views on the set of Black Panther 2. Wright, who plays Shuri in the Marvel films, says the story in The Hollywood Reporter is ""completely untrue"". It comes after she was criticised in December for sharing a video making unsubstantiated claims about the safety of coronavirus vaccines. Wright, 27, has responded on Instagram, saying: ""Anyone who knows me or has worked with me, knows that I work incredibly hard at my craft & my main focus is always to do work that's impactful and inspiring. That has been & will continue to be my only focus."" Late last year, she become embroiled in a controversy after posting a link to a video whose host said people taking the vaccines would have to ""hope it doesn't make extra limbs grow"". After being criticised on Twitter, Wright said she wasn't against vaccines but it was important to ""ask questions"". Read more here. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty has been speaking at a GPs' conference and says this winter will be ""exceptionally difficult"" for the NHS. He says this will be the case ""irrespective"" of whether the country experiences relatively low Covid cases or a further surge, alongside other winter pressures such as flu and falls. Prof Whitty also praises GPs for their ""outstanding"" hard work during the pandemic, after some said they felt they were being attacked by sections of the media and some politicians over the issue of face-to-face appointments. On the lessons to be learned from the pandemic, he tells the annual conference of the Royal College of GPs ""there
are certainly some quite significant things we got wrong at the beginning of
Covid"". However, he says it would be a mistake to assume the lessons from the current pandemic would necessarily be applicable to the next one. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says unless the government addresses long term planning for the GP workforce the number of face-to-face appointments will go down and not up. In a longthread of tweets,externalthe Conservative MP, who chairs the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, says: ""As someone who tried and failed to get 5,000 more GPs into the system, I donât think this package will turn the tide."" He says he got thousands more graduates into GP surgeries but found experienced GPs were retiring or going part time faster than new trainees arrived. Hunt says the only way to stop this is ""a clear plan to end the unsustainable pressure they face"". He suggests a big recruitment drive and incentives to persuade retired GPs who stepped up temporarily during the pandemic to extend their service. ""But sticking plaster after sticking plaster will no longer cut it. Unless we fix workforce planning in the NHS for the long term, the future will be bleak and the number of face-to-face GP appointments will go down not up,"" he says. The new justice secretary says he can't promise when court backlogs in England and Wales will return to pre-pandemic levels. Funding cuts and delays caused by Covid restrictions have contributed to the unprecedented delays in prosecuting and jailing criminals. More than 60,000 crown court trials are waiting to be heard with many serious cases now being listed in late 2023. Dominic Raab, who moved to the role last month, tells the BBC he hopes backlogs will fall within 12 months but could not give a precise figure. Read more. Russiaâs surging outbreak hits a population with only 31% fully jabbed,
according to the Gogov website, which tallies data from around the country. The Kremlin has refrained from re-introducing major restrictions, despite calling the country's vaccination rate ""unacceptably"" low. It says authorities have to ensure ""the economy continues
working."" Today, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has ruled out a lockdown and
says authorities have to ""continue to explain to people that it is
necessary to be vaccinated.â ""It's irresponsible not to get the vaccine,"" Peskov says. He adds ""the entire medical infrastructure is mobilisedâ for
the surge in coronavirus patients, and says it is not ""overwhelmed"". Russia's Health Minister Mikhail Murashko blames the growing spread on the
""behaviour"" of Russians and is urging them to get vaccinated. Although several Russian-developed jabs have been available for
months, authorities are struggling to inoculate avaccine-sceptic population. Moscow - the epicentre of Russia's outbreak - has so far withheld from
bringing back restrictions. However, it announced on Monday that two dozen sites would open in the capital for residents to get free rapid tests. Independent experts have accused authorities of downplaying the
severity of Russia's epidemic. Russiaâs Federal State Statistics Service, also known as the Rosstat
statistics agency, said last week an estimate of 400,000 Russians that
contracted coronavirus had died by the end of August. Ministers have urged parents to get their children vaccinated Covid infections rose exponentially among five to 17-year-olds in England in September, as children returned for the autumn school term, research suggests. Across the general population, the React-1 study, conducted by
Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori between 9 and 27 September, found one in 120 people were infected and prevalence appears to be remaining stable overall. The data shows the infection rate is growing most among those aged under 18, and falling among those aged 18 to 54. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the React programme, says the trends ""reinforce
how important it is for children aged 12 and above to get vaccinated and help
curb the spread of infection, and minimise disruption to education"". Relatively few under-18s have been vaccinated in the UK, as healthy 16 and 17-year-olds were only offered the jab from early August, while first doses have been offered to 12 to 15-year-olds since 20 September. The study's findings also support the arguments for booster jabs for adults, with a higher prevalence of fully vaccinated people testing positive within three to six months of their vaccination.

"Sunak: We're doing all we can to fix shop suppliesThe chancellor says shoppers ""should be reassured"" the government is working to fix port delays.","Shoppers can be reassured ministers are doing ""absolutely everything we can"" to fix supply chain issues in the UK, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. In recent days, several retailers have warned of potential shortages during the Christmas shopping season. Speaking to the BBC at the end of G7 meetings in Washington, Mr Sunak blamed global factors for delays seen at ports such as Felixstowe. It comes as G7 finance ministers agreed to work together to address the issues. Mr Sunak said: ""I'm confident there'll be a good amount of Christmas presents available for everyone to buy."" His comments came after a container logjam at ports, including Felixstowe, and a shortage of HGV lorry drivers has sparked concerns among businesses, ahead of the most important period of the year for retail spending. On Wednesday, the UK's largest commercial port said the supply chain crisis has caused a logjam of shipping containers. The Port of Felixstowe, which handles 36% of the UK's freight container traffic, blamed the busy pre-Christmas period and haulage shortages. However, it said the situation has been improving over the last few days. Meanwhile, shipping giant Maersk told the BBC it was rerouting some of its biggest ships away from the port.

"Bestselling biscuit binned in banned sprinkles rowGet Baked, in Leeds, is told to stop using US-made cake decorations containing prohibited additive.Leeds & West Yorkshire","Rich Myers said he would have to stop selling his ""best-selling"" raspberry glazed donut cookies A bakery has had to stop producing its bestselling biscuit after officials found the treats were topped with illegal sprinkles. Get Baked in Leeds withdrew its raspberry glazed donut cookies, which contained a banned food colouring. Owner Rich Myers branded the decision ""ridiculous"" and said alternative sprinkles on the market were ""rubbish"". West Yorkshire Trading Standards said the imported decoration had fallen foul of UK regulations. Mr Myers said: ""I know it sounds like a small thing but it is a big deal for my business - we used them a lot. ""Our best-selling cookie, we're not going to be able to sell them any more. For a small independent business that only has a small menu, it's a problem."" More stories from across Yorkshire Trading Standards said theE127 food colouring,external, also know as Erythrosine, is only approved for use in the UK and EU in cocktail cherries and candied cherries. The ingredient has been linked to problemswith hyperactivity and behavioural issues in children,externaland a US study suggested anincreased risk of thyroid tumours,externalwhen tested on male rats. ""[The inspector] said they'd had reports of us using illegal sprinkles and I actually laughed by mistake, then realised he was being serious,"" Mr Myers said. ""To whoever reported us to Trading Standards, all I have to say is: 'Dear Lord, what a sad little life Jane'."" He said he sourced the US-made cake toppers from a UK-based wholesaler, adding that other products on the market were not as good. ""British sprinkles are rubbish,"" he said. ""They run and aren't bake-stable. The colours aren't vibrant and they just don't look very good."" The bakery uses the decorations on a number of products Mr Myers' plight was recognised by two former Great British Bake Off contestants, who sympathised with his desire to obtain suitable ingredients. Edd Kimber, 2010 winner, agreed supermarket sprinkles were ""not as good"". ""It is what he's designing his product around, so I feel his pain,"" he added. Fellow contestant Hermine Dossou, who was a semi-finalist in the 2020 show, called on sprinkle makers in the UK to ""step up their game"". ""I get where Trading Standards is coming from, but it comes back to the everything in moderation argument,"" she said. A spokesperson for West Yorkshire Trading Standards said: ""We can confirm that we have advised the business concerned the use of E127 is not permitted in this type of confectionery item. ""We stand by this advice and would urge all food business operators, when seeking to use imported foods containing additives, to check that they are permitted for use in the UK.""
