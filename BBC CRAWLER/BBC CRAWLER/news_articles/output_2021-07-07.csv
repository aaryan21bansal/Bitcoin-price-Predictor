Gates Foundation agrees break-up back-up plan,"The couple, pictured here in 2018, have given billions to charity The Gates Foundation has outlined back-up plans in case its co-chairs cannot work together in the wake of their divorce. The deal gives Bill and Melinda Gates a two-year trial, after which Ms Gates could resign from the organisation. Under the agreement, Ms Gates would also receive ""personal resources"" from her ex-husband for her own charity work. Ms Gates said she was ""deeply proud"" of what the organisation has achieved. In a statement, she added: ""I believe deeply in the foundation's mission and remain fully committed as co-chair to its work."" The agreement comes after question marks were raised over the future of the organisationwhen the couple announced they were divorcing after 27 years of marriage in May. The billionaires run the charitable foundation, which has worked on initiatives such as fighting infectious diseases and encouraging vaccinations for children. This video can not be played The BBC's Michelle Fleury breaks down the story of Bill and Melinda Gates' relationship Ms Gates will remain as a trustee during the ""trial period"", although it was announcedin a blog post,externalon Wednesday that the foundation will recruit new trustees to oversee its work. Its chief executive Mark Suzman said the successful candidates will be announced in January next year. He added that any funds received by Ms Gates in the event of her resignation would be ""completely separate from the foundation's endowment, which would not be affected"". The announcement also follows on from billionaire investor Warren Buffett's recent decision to step back from the foundation's board. He previously said his ""physical participation is in no way needed"" for the foundation to achieve its goals. Warren Buffett gives away $4.1bn more to charity Gates divorce puts spotlight on their foundation Mr Buffett is a co-founder of the Giving Pledge, along with Bill and Melinda Gates, which is a campaign that encourages billionaire philanthropy. In a note to Gates Foundation staff on Tuesday, it was announced that the couple would be donating another $15bn (Â£10.9bn) of their personal wealth to the foundation. Both Mr and Ms Gates do, however, have other charitable funds, focused on green energy and women's causes respectively.

Backlash against longer hours for lorry drivers,"A temporary extension of lorry drivers' working hours has been met with backlash from the industry who say the government is applying a ""sticking plaster"" to driver shortage problems. HGV drivers can increase their daily driving limits from nine to 10 hours or change weekly rest patterns on Monday. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the move would give flexibility to drivers to make slightly longer trips. But the Road Haulage Association said the move wouldn't make any difference. The RHA believes there is currently a shortfall of about 60,000 lorry drivers and said the relaxation on driving hour limits was a ""sticking plaster"". It estimates that some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the Covid pandemic. ""Relaxing drivers' hours won't make any material difference - and fails to address the underlying issues, which require a package of measures to fix,"" the RHA said. The national officer for road transport at Unite the union, Adrian Jones, also said the announcement would do nothing to resolve the problem of driver shortages. He added: ""Unite will be advising its members to not place themselves in danger and that if they are too tired to drive safely, they have a legal right to refuse to do so. ""Unite will fully support those who make that decision, legally and industrially."" Logistics UK, which represents freight businesses, said longer hours would ""heap more pressure on drivers who are already stretched to the limit to deliver"". James Firth, of Logistics UK, said the industry ""vehemently opposed the extension"" and said the government had ""ignored the will of those who will be most affected by the changes"". ""Existing drivers have been working flat out since the start of the pandemic, and this could be the final straw for many of them,"" he said. ""Instead of trying to paper over the gaps, government should be working with industry to produce a plan to support moving drivers through the current bottleneck of HGV driving tests."" Where have all the UK workers gone? Businesses and union officials have warned that the driver shortage jeopardises deliveries to supermarkets and other sectors of the economy. The haulage industry is one of a number of sectors having trouble finding suitable staff as the economy reopens, leading some experts to talk of the UK's missing workers. Among those worried isGerman confectionery giant Haribo, which has said it is struggling to deliver its sweets to shops in the UK. Mr Shapps said the government had ""ramped up"" the number of driving tests available and would consider other measures. The government said driver safety must not be compromised and operators must notify the Department for Transport if the relaxation is used. The RHA's chief executive, Richard Burnett, said it opposed wholesale extensions to drivers' hours, believing they could be counter-productive by making the job less attractive. ""Loading more hours on to drivers that are already exhausted is not the answer - the problem needs more than just a sticking plaster,"" he added. ""Ministers should be mindful that road safety is the reason HGV drivers' hours are limited. Relaxing them should only be used as a last resort to resolve short-term issues that cannot be addressed in other ways."" Mr Burnett said that as the shortage worsened, drivers' pay rates were going up, often substantially. ""Suppliers and retailers should be prepared that these additional costs will be passed on,"" he added. A government spokesperson said it had ""already taken action on HGV driver shortages, including ramping up vocational test capacity, and funding apprenticeships"". ""Most of the solutions, however, are likely to be driven by industry, with progress already being made in testing and hiring, and a big push towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity,"" they added.

Covid cases in UK at highest level since January,"Coronavirus cases in the UK have risen above 30,000 for first time since January, official figures show. Wednesday's data showed there had been a further 32,548 confirmed Covid cases. And there were another 33 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive Covid test. It comes as Boris Johnson has defended the government's approach to easing England's lockdown, saying the link between infection and serious disease and death has been ""severed"". The prime minister has pledged to scrap most of England's coronavirus regulations at step four of the roadmap out of lockdown, expected on 19 July. It means the government is now braced for a surge in coronavirus cases, possibly around 100,000 a day, as restrictions are lifted. Millions could end up self-isolating this summer What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? I'm fully vaccinated, but how can I prove it? How could life change on 19 July? Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said it was ""certainly true"" there was a ""wave of cases because of the Delta variant"" of the virus. ""But scientists are also absolutely clear that we have severed the link between infection and serious disease and death,"" he said. ""Currently there are only a 30th of the deaths that we were seeing at an equivalent position in previous waves of this pandemic."" However, on Monday the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance was more cautious, saying vaccines had ""weakened the link between cases and hospitalisations, but it's a weakened link, not a completely broken link"". Wednesday's daily figure for Covid cases in the UK is above 30,000 for the first time since 24 January. In terms of hospitalisations, England is seeing more than 330 admissions a day on average at the moment. The most recent day - Monday - saw 416 admitted. As of Wednesday, 2,144 people are in hospital in England with Covid - the first time this figure has topped 2,000 since April. Wednesday's case total represents an increase from 28,700 on Tuesday. It is not unusual for there to be a big jump on a Wednesday as a result of a weekend effect - slightly less testing is done. What's important is the trend. Week on week this represents a 43% rise. That is actually down on what has been seen recently. They are going up quickly, but not as quickly as last week. It's too early to say whether that is part of a longer-term pattern. But what is certain is that government officials are watching this data like hawks. The policy of opening up in England is based on the hope that the virus will soon hit the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection. Ministers have said we should be prepared to see 100,000 cases a day. But they are hoping this wave of infection peaks well before that. Because while the vaccination programme has weakened the link between cases and hospitalisation, it has not broken it entirely. On current trends that many infections would lead to 2,000 daily admissions - twice what the NHS would normally see in the depths of winter for all types of respiratory illness. The PM has also defended the timescale for ending self-isolation for contacts of Covid, insisting it is a ""sensible approach"". The government has said people who are fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 from 16 August. Giving evidence to the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson rejected the suggestion 16 August had been chosen because it was when the government expected the population to have reached herd immunity . ""That's not the considerationâ¦ it's the time by which we feel that there will have been much more progress on vaccination,"" he said. And the PM said to do it any sooner would ""effectively be allowing many more people to be vector of disease."" ""All decisions are a balance of risk,"" he said. Asked how many people the government expected to end up self-isolating over the next month, he said: ""That will depend on the spread. I haven't seen any data on that. It will depend on the numbers."" Meanwhile, World Health Organization emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan has urged countries to use extreme caution when reopening their economies from Covid restrictions so as ""not to lose the gains you have made"". Asked at a briefing if the UK was aiming for herd immunity, Dr Ryan said: ""I'm not aware that that's the logic driving our colleagues in the United Kingdom, I suspect it's not. He said the argument that it was better to infect more people was morally empty and epidemiologically stupid. Labour's leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned the prime minister he is leading the countryinto a ""summer of chaos and confusion"" over plans to ease lockdown. At PMQs, he said the country should open up ""in a controlled way"" and urged Mr Johnson to ensure masks still have to be worn on public transport. Face masks will no longer be legally required and distancing rules will be scrappedat the final stage of England's Covid lockdown roadmap. The lifting of rules on 19 July will be confirmed next Monday after a review of the latest data.

LiveLiveEngland into first major men's final since 1966 - reaction,"England reach first ever men's Euros final & first men's major tournament final since 1966 England play Italy in Sunday's final at Wembley Shamoon Hafez Ben in Scarborough:I think those last 4 mins were the best football we've ever played!!!! We really looked like a team that knew how to win, not scared to lose. Awesome. Andy in Tavistock:Is this real? We are in the final?? An ecstatic feeling. My throat has gone... wowzers! Gary Redwin:Happy tears after too many years of hurt but also well played Denmark. Roll on Sunday. Daniel Johnson:I didnât cry when my daughters were born. I cried tonight. Thank you England. Tommy G:This is crazy. Just crazy. We are in a final. After the pens of 90, 96, 98, 04 and 06. Ronaldinho in 02. The sheer underwhelmingness (a word?) of everything thing else until Russia. And now this. Ruddy hell. A happy 40 year old I am. England 2-1 Denmark Our fixture list has updated for Sunday. It's now official. Lineker has nailed it with that last entry, he is spot on. So much has gone against England over the years in major tournaments, but it now feels different. It might just be coming home. England 2-1 Denmark Gary LinekerEx-England striker on BBC One It's been a long time coming. It's finally happened. I was doubting I'd ever see it again in my lifetime at one point. The longer the game went on, the more England looked likely to score, even though you have those self-doubts. There was about two or three minutes at the end where England were passing it around and keeping the ball. They were singing ""ole"" at Wembley Stadium in the semi-final of a major tournament! I've been around, watched tournaments and played in tournaments over the years and so many things have gone wrong - the 'Hand of God', Frank Lampard's goal, Chris Waddle hitting the inside of the post, it being a quarter of an inch away from Gazza's studs. We have seen big injuries to big players prior to tournaments but in this one, England just seem to have had a bit of luck for once! You need that to win a tournament. FT: England 2-1 Denmark Jermaine JenasFormer England midfielder on BBC One Going into extra time and running at full speed, full pace - Raheem Sterlingâs facing defenders up saying Iâm going to go by you again, when youâre
a defender that is hell and at that point in the game your legs are burning and
heâs just looking at them saying Iâm going to take you apart and he did it on
the right-wing and he did it on the left-wing. As far as performances go in an
England shirt it was right up there - itâs a special moment for him. FT: England 2-1 Denmark Alan ShearerFormer England striker on BBC One You don't achieve what Southgate has achieved in his career without having a tough streak, without being able to make big decisions. He has been a captain in every dressing room he has been in. He had to take off Jack Grealish today because it is clear he doesn't trust Grealish defensively. That worked, because then Denmark couldn't get the ball, England passed the ball. I lost count of the number of passes. England 2-1 Denmark Metro Scotland have taken England's victory well... FT: England 2-1 Denmark Jermaine JenasFormer England midfielder on BBC One The lads what
they did best was dealing with the pressure of the moment when Denmark were
going well. The way they responded all day to everything was absolutely spot on. You have to give Gareth Southgate credit,
he knows within his arsenal he has some incredible players but there were some
moments where he lets some players loose when he brought on Jack Grealish and Phil
Foden and put Raheem Sterling on the right they went out there with freedom and
thatâs why theyâve got the result tonight. FT: England 2-1 Denmark Alan ShearerFormer England striker on BBC One England have shown character in abundance. After three or four minutes we was saying Denmark are a really good team, they were popping it around, working hard and causing England problems. Then they got the goal, and England had to dig deep. They scored at the right time just before half-time which would have given them a little bit of confidence. FT: England 2-1 Denmark ""England make history."" ""Kane you believe it!"" ""Andfinally!"" ""The history boys."" ""Finally."" FT: England 2-1 Denmark Alan ShearerFormer England striker on BBC One We were screaming, what a night what a performance. It was hard work, it was very different to the other performances they have put in. But they have shown a great side to their game tonight, in coming back from conceding their first goal. FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England striker Ian Wright on ITV:""I still feel like Raheem Sterling is going to be
a key man, of course Harry Kane took the penalty and scored but Sterling is
still going to a key man and I think he is the one that Italy will be worried
about."" FT: England 2-1 Denmark Denmark Denmark coachKasper Hjulmand:""Obviously, it's a big disappointment that we're so close to the final, and different circumstances during the match mean that we're not taking the last step. ""It has been amazing what the boys have done. There's a fantastic power within these guys. They play football in a fantastic way. ""We've been attacking, scoring goals and showed our true selves. The players just went on with everything they have â both off and on the pitch."" FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England right back Gary Neville on ITV: ""Harry Kane needs to rest up, he has got Chiellini and Bonucci
all night, he is the type of player they will fancy playing against, a physical
contest. It will be a really tough test, you are not going to get an easy match
in the final. ""Italy have grown into the tournament better than I thought they
would. We have seen a lot over the years about possession football, but two
teams who have been more methodical has made the final. ""England have been a good team, one goal conceded in six
matches is outstanding, Southgate set his stall out at the start of this
tournament. The only way we was going to get to a final was keeping clean
sheets."" England 2-1 Denmark Go on. England 2-1 Denmark England England boss Gareth Southgate to BBC Sport:""The experiences the group have had really shone through tonight, we knew we wouldn't go through a tournament without conceding, but tonight it was our night. ""You can only gain confidence by the evidence of your results and performances. The more experiences like this - they are reference points for the team. We know we have one enormous hurdle to come but tonight they should enjoy it, they should be very proud. ""This tournament we've been adaptable and we've changed at the right times. Now we have a real challenge in the final. ""It was mayhem on the pitch at full-time. As soon as Sweet Caroline was playing that was it. They know how much tonight will have taken out of them. Italy are a day ahead in their preparation and we have to be spot on. ""I'm just so pleased for our country. The atmosphere, I don't think I've heard the new Wembley like that. It's only topped the Germany game really. We know what our country like others has been through and to continue that happiness and journey for anther four days, we're so happy. FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England striker Ian Wright on ITV:""I wasn't surprised Saka came off because that has been the pattern of Gareth, He's started him, he stretches the team goes at the defenders and then he brings on Jack Grealish. ""I feel for Jack Grealish you can see its a tournament that he really wants to be a part of, every time he gets going it doesnt quite happen for him. To be taken off like that is of course, you subbed a sub its not nice. ""But it is about the squad and being a part of it. Sunday Jack might come on and make a massive difference, he might set up the winning goal."" #bbcfootball Tommy G:This is crazy. Just crazy. We are in a final.

France campaign aims to end selfies on rail tracks,"There were about 10,000 railway trespassing incidents recorded across France last year, the SNCF said France's national rail operator is warning people not to take selfies on tracks as reported incidents rise during the coronavirus pandemic. The SNCF railway company said people were trespassing and taking dangerous risks to capture images at a time of reduced rail services and surveillance. This week the operator began publishing a series of video messages it said would continue to run until next month. Along with France, the UK has also seen a recent rise in such incidents. The SNCF launched the new video series on social media networks on Monday, using the hashtag #SurLesRails (#OnRails). It said the content of the posts was ""inspired by real events"".

The campaign uses slogans such as ""taking pictures on the tracks is to risk never taking pictures again"", and highlights the dangers including the risk of being hit by a train, high-voltage electrocution and a serious fall. The SNCF said that new guidance would be released each week as part of an ongoing risk prevention campaign. Measures introduced in the country last year to help reduce the spread of Covid-19 have meant that fewer trains have been in use, while track maintenance work and surveillance has also been reduced. The SNCF said that this was likely to be behind an increase in reported incidents of people visiting sites illegally and taking pictures, which are then shared on social media sites such as Instagram. ""Every week in France, a fatal accident near or on the railways is caused by risky behaviour,"" the operator said. The SNCF said that last year about 10,000 trespassing incidents were recorded, including 23 fatalities and 11 serious injuries. It said this was a significant increase on previous years, without providing details. In the UK, figures released by Network Rail and the British Transport Police for 2020 showed thatNovember saw ""a staggering 75% increase in youth"" railway trespassing incidents,external, compared with the previous year. The figures also showedan increase of such incidents by as much as 40% over the summer,externalcompared with 2019.

The Instagrammers who worry Iran,"Human rights activists say Instagramer Fatemeh Khishvand has been made an example of by Iran Growing up in Iran, Fatemeh Khishvand dreamed of becoming famous, posting selfies on Instagram in the hope of getting noticed. Typical enough - only Ms Khishvand's selfies were anything but. They were heavily doctored photos in which her face appeared gaunt, distorted, and enhanced by make-up. Posted under a pseudonym, Sahar Tabar, the photos were so striking they attracted international media attention when they first appeared in 2017. In some, Ms Khishvand bore an uncanny resemblance to American actress Angelina Jolie. This led to false rumours that the teen had undergone 50 cosmetic surgeries to look like the Hollywood star but, as she would later clarify, the Corpse Bride character from Tim Burton's titular musical fantasy was her true inspiration. Soon, her alter ego had almost 500,000 followers on Instagram, earning her the fame she had always desired. But that fame came at a price. In Iran, it can be dangerous to post on social media. The country's Shia Muslim authorities enforce strict laws about what can and cannot be posted. To them, Ms Khishvand's photos were seen as crimes, not the clever Photoshop trickery of a teenage girl. So, in October 2019,Ms Khishvand was arrested on a raft of charges, including blasphemy, instigating violence, insulting the Islamic dress code and encouraging corruption among young people. Her Instagram account was deleted and for more than a year she languished in jail, detained without bail. Eventually an Islamic Revolutionary Court - known for their secrecy and politically motivated rulings against dissidents - delivered a sentence of 10 years in prison in December last year. Ms Khishvand came to attention for her resemblance to a ""zombie"" version of Angelina Jolie The severity of the punishment was met with shock and condemnation. ""The Islamic Republic has a history of arresting women for dancing, for singing, for removing their compulsory veiling, for entering a stadium, for modelling, but come on - this time, for just using Photoshop,"" Masih Alinejad, a prominent Iranian journalist and activist, said in a Twitter video.

As Ms Alinejad's reaction suggested, Ms Khishvand's case is considered a new extreme in Iran's draconian treatment of social media users. Precise data on internet crimes in Iran is hard to come by. But, according to research by the US-based Human Rights Activists in Iran group, at least 332 people have been arrested for their internet activities since 20 December 2016. Of those, 109 were for activities on Instagram, the group said. As the only major social media network not blocked by the government, Instagram is a popular platform for young Iranians to express themselves. This has created a dilemma for the government, which experts say is loath to block the tool for fear of provoking unrest, hampering business owners who rely on it for advertising, and severing a useful means of communication with its citizens. Instead, the government has attempted to act as a moderator. Iranian singer gets summons over solo performance Iran women dance in support of arrested Instagram teen Iran raises prospect of ""white list"" internet clampdown This video can not be played Iranian Parkour athlete Alireza Japalaghy was arrested over a rooftop kiss ""For so long, Iran has tried to police culture unsuccessfully,"" Tara Sepehri Far, an Iran researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), told the BBC. ""There have been several waves of Instagram influencers being called in and interrogated."" One wave included six Iranians who, in 2014, were given suspended jail sentences and lashes for appearing in a video dancing to Pharrell Williams's song Happy. Another came in 2018, when a teenage gymnast was arrested for posting videos of herself dancing to pop music. Each followed a similar pattern. Instagram personalities were harassed, arrested and prosecuted by Iranian authorities, which activists say pressured them to ""confess"" their alleged crimes, sometimes on state TV. Indeed, that's apparently what happened to Ms Khishvand,who was paraded on Iranian Channel Two (IRTV2) as ""zombie Angelina Jolie"" a few weeks after her arrest. Seyed Ahmad Moinshirazi, 42, says he and his wife Shabnam Shahrokhi, 38, are familiar with the repressive methods of Iranian authorities. They too were popular social media influencers whose Instagram accounts fell foul of the law. Mr Moinshirazi said that, from 2018, he was subjected to a campaign of intimidation by Iran's Cyber Police, which summoned him for questioning and demanded a signed pledge of co-operation. During one hours-long interrogation, Mr Moinshirazi said he was repeatedly threatened with baseless espionage charges and ordered to purge his account of certain posts, such as those that showed his wife without a mandatory headscarf, known as a hijab. Shabnam Shahrokhi and Seyed Ahmad Moinshirazi have hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram ""They said these posts had contaminated Iran with Western culture,"" Mr Moinshirazi, a retired kickboxer better known as Picasso Moin, told the BBC. The posts were removed as requested, yet the harassment continued, culminating in the couple's arrest and release on bail of $200,000 (Â£147,000; 164,500 euros) in 2019. ""Our lawyer said they definitely want to see some blood,"" father-of-two Mr Moinshirazi said. A lengthy jail term seemed certain. So, fearing for the lives of his young children, Mr Moinshirazi and his family fled to Turkey in September 2019. The couple often shared videos of them practising kickboxing together Prosecutors were furious, Mr Moinshirazi said. No wonder, then, that the couple were sentenced harshly in absentia, receiving 16 years in prison, 74 lashes and a fine between them. Mr Moinshirazi believes the Iranian government wanted to make an example of him, like they did to Ms Khishvand. ""This is how Iran works,"" he said. ""In order to distract from other things in the country, they find cases to push their agendas. And Sahar Tabar is one of them."" Tellingly, Ms Khishvand revealed her sentence in an interview with Rokna, a private news agency thought to have close ties with the Iranian government. In the interview, she said she had been convicted of two of the four charges against her, but hoped to be pardoned. Meanwhile, more lurid articles appeared on Rokna. Written in a gossipy, stigmatising tone, the articles portrayed Ms Khishvand as the troubled child of a divorced couple, a loner whose desperation for Instagram fame was indicative of poor education, immorality, and mental illness. A mental health condition that Ms Khishvand said she had in the interview was a prominent feature of Rokna's coverage. Prosecutors, Ms Sepehri Far said, have a habit of promoting ""their own version of the story, their propaganda"" through the media. ""In the case of Sahar, they brought her before the camera to talk about the history of her mental health and her troubled family life,"" Ms Sepehri Far said. ""They're promoting this narrative of, if you're taking things to that extreme, you have a troubled family."" Iranian TV broadcast an interview with Sahar Tabar after her arrest last year For now, Ms Khishvand has been shown some mercy. At the end of December 2020, she was granted bail while she appeals her sentence. ""This is a small reward for her TV admission under duress, dismissing the lawyers and obeying their plans,"" her former lawyer Saeid Dehghan said. As for the appeal, much depends on the mood of prosecutors who did not differentiate between Ms Khishvand and the cartoonish persona she invented. ""In the end, she remains simply a teenager who is being cruelly and publicly punished and humiliated for daring to express herself outside the bounds of Iran's arbitrary rules governing personal social media use,"" Jasmin Ramsey, communications director for the Center for Human Rights in Iran, told the BBC.

And now this. Ruddy hell. A happy 40 year old I am. England 2-1 Denmark Our fixture list has updated for Sunday. It's now official. Lineker has nailed it with that last entry, he is spot on. So much has gone against England over the years in major tournaments, but it now feels different. It might just be coming home. England 2-1 Denmark Gary LinekerEx-England striker on BBC One It's been a long time coming. It's finally happened. I was doubting I'd ever see it again in my lifetime at one point. The longer the game went on, the more England looked likely to score, even though you have those self-doubts. There was about two or three minutes at the end where England were passing it around and keeping the ball. They were singing ""ole"" at Wembley Stadium in the semi-final of a major tournament! I've been around, watched tournaments and played in tournaments over the years and so many things have gone wrong - the 'Hand of God', Frank Lampard's goal, Chris Waddle hitting the inside of the post, it being a quarter of an inch away from Gazza's studs. We have seen big injuries to big players prior to tournaments but in this one, England just seem to have had a bit of luck for once! You need that to win a tournament. FT: England 2-1 Denmark Jermaine JenasFormer England midfielder on BBC One Going into extra time and running at full speed, full pace - Raheem Sterlingâs facing defenders up saying Iâm going to go by you again, when youâre
a defender that is hell and at that point in the game your legs are burning and
heâs just looking at them saying Iâm going to take you apart and he did it on
the right-wing and he did it on the left-wing. As far as performances go in an
England shirt it was right up there - itâs a special moment for him. FT: England 2-1 Denmark Alan ShearerFormer England striker on BBC One You don't achieve what Southgate has achieved in his career without having a tough streak, without being able to make big decisions. He has been a captain in every dressing room he has been in. He had to take off Jack Grealish today because it is clear he doesn't trust Grealish defensively. That worked, because then Denmark couldn't get the ball, England passed the ball. I lost count of the number of passes. England 2-1 Denmark Metro Scotland have taken England's victory well... FT: England 2-1 Denmark Jermaine JenasFormer England midfielder on BBC One The lads what
they did best was dealing with the pressure of the moment when Denmark were
going well. The way they responded all day to everything was absolutely spot on. You have to give Gareth Southgate credit,
he knows within his arsenal he has some incredible players but there were some
moments where he lets some players loose when he brought on Jack Grealish and Phil
Foden and put Raheem Sterling on the right they went out there with freedom and
thatâs why theyâve got the result tonight. FT: England 2-1 Denmark Alan ShearerFormer England striker on BBC One England have shown character in abundance. After three or four minutes we was saying Denmark are a really good team, they were popping it around, working hard and causing England problems. Then they got the goal, and England had to dig deep. They scored at the right time just before half-time which would have given them a little bit of confidence. FT: England 2-1 Denmark ""England make history."" ""Kane you believe it!"" ""Andfinally!"" ""The history boys."" ""Finally."" FT: England 2-1 Denmark Alan ShearerFormer England striker on BBC One We were screaming, what a night what a performance. It was hard work, it was very different to the other performances they have put in. But they have shown a great side to their game tonight, in coming back from conceding their first goal. FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England striker Ian Wright on ITV:""I still feel like Raheem Sterling is going to be
a key man, of course Harry Kane took the penalty and scored but Sterling is
still going to a key man and I think he is the one that Italy will be worried
about."" FT: England 2-1 Denmark Denmark Denmark coachKasper Hjulmand:""Obviously, it's a big disappointment that we're so close to the final, and different circumstances during the match mean that we're not taking the last step. ""It has been amazing what the boys have done. There's a fantastic power within these guys. They play football in a fantastic way. ""We've been attacking, scoring goals and showed our true selves. The players just went on with everything they have â both off and on the pitch."" FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England right back Gary Neville on ITV: ""Harry Kane needs to rest up, he has got Chiellini and Bonucci
all night, he is the type of player they will fancy playing against, a physical
contest. It will be a really tough test, you are not going to get an easy match
in the final. ""Italy have grown into the tournament better than I thought they
would. We have seen a lot over the years about possession football, but two
teams who have been more methodical has made the final. ""England have been a good team, one goal conceded in six
matches is outstanding, Southgate set his stall out at the start of this
tournament. The only way we was going to get to a final was keeping clean
sheets."" England 2-1 Denmark Go on. England 2-1 Denmark England England boss Gareth Southgate to BBC Sport:""The experiences the group have had really shone through tonight, we knew we wouldn't go through a tournament without conceding, but tonight it was our night. ""You can only gain confidence by the evidence of your results and performances. The more experiences like this - they are reference points for the team. We know we have one enormous hurdle to come but tonight they should enjoy it, they should be very proud. ""This tournament we've been adaptable and we've changed at the right times. Now we have a real challenge in the final. ""It was mayhem on the pitch at full-time. As soon as Sweet Caroline was playing that was it. They know how much tonight will have taken out of them. Italy are a day ahead in their preparation and we have to be spot on. ""I'm just so pleased for our country. The atmosphere, I don't think I've heard the new Wembley like that. It's only topped the Germany game really. We know what our country like others has been through and to continue that happiness and journey for anther four days, we're so happy. FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England striker Ian Wright on ITV:""I wasn't surprised Saka came off because that has been the pattern of Gareth, He's started him, he stretches the team goes at the defenders and then he brings on Jack Grealish. ""I feel for Jack Grealish you can see its a tournament that he really wants to be a part of, every time he gets going it doesnt quite happen for him. To be taken off like that is of course, you subbed a sub its not nice. ""But it is about the squad and being a part of it. Sunday Jack might come on and make a massive difference, he might set up the winning goal."" #bbcfootball Tommy G:This is crazy. Just crazy. We are in a final.

"Covid cases in UK at highest level since JanuaryMore than 32,500 confirmed cases have been reported in the country, up 43% on the same day last week.UK","Coronavirus cases in the UK have risen above 30,000 for first time since January, official figures show. Wednesday's data showed there had been a further 32,548 confirmed Covid cases. And there were another 33 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive Covid test. It comes as Boris Johnson has defended the government's approach to easing England's lockdown, saying the link between infection and serious disease and death has been ""severed"". The prime minister has pledged to scrap most of England's coronavirus regulations at step four of the roadmap out of lockdown, expected on 19 July. It means the government is now braced for a surge in coronavirus cases, possibly around 100,000 a day, as restrictions are lifted. Millions could end up self-isolating this summer What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? I'm fully vaccinated, but how can I prove it? How could life change on 19 July? Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said it was ""certainly true"" there was a ""wave of cases because of the Delta variant"" of the virus. ""But scientists are also absolutely clear that we have severed the link between infection and serious disease and death,"" he said. ""Currently there are only a 30th of the deaths that we were seeing at an equivalent position in previous waves of this pandemic."" However, on Monday the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance was more cautious, saying vaccines had ""weakened the link between cases and hospitalisations, but it's a weakened link, not a completely broken link"". Wednesday's daily figure for Covid cases in the UK is above 30,000 for the first time since 24 January. In terms of hospitalisations, England is seeing more than 330 admissions a day on average at the moment. The most recent day - Monday - saw 416 admitted. As of Wednesday, 2,144 people are in hospital in England with Covid - the first time this figure has topped 2,000 since April. Wednesday's case total represents an increase from 28,700 on Tuesday. It is not unusual for there to be a big jump on a Wednesday as a result of a weekend effect - slightly less testing is done. What's important is the trend. Week on week this represents a 43% rise. That is actually down on what has been seen recently. They are going up quickly, but not as quickly as last week. It's too early to say whether that is part of a longer-term pattern. But what is certain is that government officials are watching this data like hawks. The policy of opening up in England is based on the hope that the virus will soon hit the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection. Ministers have said we should be prepared to see 100,000 cases a day. But they are hoping this wave of infection peaks well before that. Because while the vaccination programme has weakened the link between cases and hospitalisation, it has not broken it entirely. On current trends that many infections would lead to 2,000 daily admissions - twice what the NHS would normally see in the depths of winter for all types of respiratory illness. The PM has also defended the timescale for ending self-isolation for contacts of Covid, insisting it is a ""sensible approach"". The government has said people who are fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 from 16 August. Giving evidence to the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson rejected the suggestion 16 August had been chosen because it was when the government expected the population to have reached herd immunity . ""That's not the considerationâ¦ it's the time by which we feel that there will have been much more progress on vaccination,"" he said. And the PM said to do it any sooner would ""effectively be allowing many more people to be vector of disease."" ""All decisions are a balance of risk,"" he said. Asked how many people the government expected to end up self-isolating over the next month, he said: ""That will depend on the spread. I haven't seen any data on that. It will depend on the numbers."" Meanwhile, World Health Organization emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan has urged countries to use extreme caution when reopening their economies from Covid restrictions so as ""not to lose the gains you have made"". Asked at a briefing if the UK was aiming for herd immunity, Dr Ryan said: ""I'm not aware that that's the logic driving our colleagues in the United Kingdom, I suspect it's not. He said the argument that it was better to infect more people was morally empty and epidemiologically stupid. Labour's leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned the prime minister he is leading the countryinto a ""summer of chaos and confusion"" over plans to ease lockdown. At PMQs, he said the country should open up ""in a controlled way"" and urged Mr Johnson to ensure masks still have to be worn on public transport. Face masks will no longer be legally required and distancing rules will be scrappedat the final stage of England's Covid lockdown roadmap. The lifting of rules on 19 July will be confirmed next Monday after a review of the latest data.

If you want to follow developments from Wembley as England play Denmark for a place in the final of Euro 2020you can see updates from our colleagues at BBC Sport here. But your coronavirus news has been brought to you today by Emma Harrison, Katie Wright, Sophie Williams, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and James Clarke.  Wembley should see its biggest crowd since before the pandemic this evening We are going to be bringing our live coverage of coronavirus to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: House prices in the UKdipped 0.5% in June as the stamp duty holiday began to be phased out,according to Halifax. Prices rose 8.8% over the year, leaving average prices still more than Â£21,000 higher, following a broadly unprecedented period of gains. The average price of a UK property is now Â£260,358, but the lender says it is ""important to put such a moderate decrease in context"". The government removed the need to pay stamp duty on certain properties throughout much of the pandemic. In the last year the housing market has been stimulated by stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, introduced by the government to boost the property market. From June 2020, buyers didn't have to pay any stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of their purchase price. However, at the start of this month, stamp duty breaks began to return to pre-pandemic levels. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News Some of music's biggest stars will squeeze into the UK's smallest venues this summer, in an attempt to revive the grassroots music scene. Sir Tom Jones will play the 800-seat Cambridge Junction, while Rag 'n' Bone Man will entertain 250 fans in the Tunbridge Wells Forum. It comes after 18 months in the which the live music industry essentially shut down due to Covid-19. Sir Tom says supporting small, local venues ""makes all the difference"". ""Musicians can record in their bedrooms, but they can't learn to perform in public without a place to play,"" he adds. Rag 'n' Bone Man has already tested the waters, playing three low-key, socially-distanced shows at London's Jazz CafÃ© last week. ""This has been very emotional,"" he told the audience on the closing night. ""I'm not going to get all soppy but not being able to do gigs for the last year-and-a-half feels like you're missing a testicle."" Read more The Scottish government has not yet decided whether to follow England in changing the self-isolation rules for school pupils and people who have been double vaccinated. Scotland's education secretary says the government is ""looking very seriously"" at whether it can make changes. Shirley-Anne Somerville says decisions will be taken ""as soon as we can"" but any decision will be based on the clinical advice and guidance the government is given. There have been calls for the Scottish government to introduce similar changes, after thousands of pupils missed out on learning due to having to self-isolate. Somerville tells the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme the absence rates in Scottish schools was about 4% at the end of the school term. But only 3% of those actually had Covid - with the vast majority of absent pupils only being off school because they had to self-isolate after someone else tested positive. Read more here. As we mentioned earlier, two British and Irish lions
players are isolating after one of the rugby squad's management team tested positive for
Covid during their tour of South Africa. This evening's game against Cell C Sharks is scheduled to go ahead, with kick-off at 19.00 BST - you canfollow the action hereif you wish to. Two members of staff are also isolating at the team
hotel and a Lions statement says all members of the touring party âhave since
been testedâ, adding further updates will âfollow in due courseâ. The Lions â who have been playing and training in a
strict coronavirus bubble â arrived as South Africa was battling a third wave
of infections, with the South African team having to isolate twice in the past
two weeks. You can read more here The World Health Organisation (WHO) is warning countries against lifting restrictions
too quickly. Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHOâs emergencies programme urges
caution and says there has been a 33% increase in cases in the European region
in the past week. âThis is not a flat curve, this is an increasing curve,â
he says. âMaking assumptions that transmissions will not increase because weâre
opening up because of a vaccine is a false assumption. âTransmission will increase when you open up because,
number one, we donât have any vaccines in everybody and, number two, the
vaccine coverage rates are lower and weâre not still sure to what extent
vaccination protects the ability to be infected.â He adds increased transmission in the community puts
the most vulnerable at risk. It comes as the UK prepares to lift restrictions,
including a limit on indoor meetings and the wearing of masks. It comes as the UK prepares to relax restrictions The government istemporarily extending lorry drivers' hours from Monday- because the haulage industry is reporting trouble recruiting enough staff. It means drivers and operators can make slightly longer journeys, says  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who acknowledges there is a shortage of drivers. The Road Haulage Association says there is currently a shortfall of about 60,000 lorry drivers though - and the new move is just a ""sticking plaster"" over the problem. It estimates about 30,000 HGV driving tests did not happen last year because of the pandemic. The haulage industry is just one of the sectors having problems finding staff as the economy reopens. Businesses and unions have warned if there are not enough drivers, there could be knock-on effects including on deliveries to supermarkets. The planned dates for easing coronavirus restrictions in Scotland are ""not set in stone"", Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister tells the BBC it would not be responsible to have a guaranteed timetable in the face of the virus, after another day of high case numbers. Scotland is due to move to level zero on 19 July, before dropping almost all restrictions on 9 August. However, Sturgeon says she will look very carefully at the latest data before confirming this will happen. This video can not be played Covid: Restriction easing dates 'not set in stone', say FM The NHS Covid tracing app has been downloaded more than 25 million times since its launch. But are people now deleting it - or switching off the contact tracing service - in order to avoid being told to isolate? In fact, usage is at an all-time high, says an adviser to NHS Test and Trace. ""About 50% of all, overall test results, nationally go through the app,"" Prof Christophe Fraser from Oxford University's Nuffield Department of Medicine tells Times Radio. ""The team monitors the usage of the app, and at this point in time the usage of the app is at an all-time high."" Asked about the implications of potentially 100,000 people testing positive every day, he says: ""It would result in a large amount of people being traced, which of course slows down the rate of infection and limits the stress on the NHS in terms of hospital admissions."" World Health Organisation (WHO) Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says the global Covid death toll has now reached four million. He warned on Wednesday the world is at a ""perilous point"" in the pandemic and hit out at a ""shocking inequality"" in global access to vaccines. The WHO chief says the pandemic's true death toll is likely to be much higher. ""At this stage in the pandemic, the fact that millions of health and care workers have not been vaccinated is abhorrent,"" he says during a press conference. ""From a moral, epidemiological or economic point view, now is the time for the world to come together to tackle this pandemic collectively,"" he adds.  Anyone travelling on public transport should continue to wear a mask even if they are no longer required legally, Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon says. Masks willno longer be required in England from 19 Julyunder a plan to end Covid-19 restrictions. Stormont ministers will decide the next steps for Northern Ireland on Thursday. Mallon says she has not seen any evidence to support ending the mandatory use of masks. ""The data tells us it acts as a mitigation against the virus but it also gives passengers confidence to come back on to our public transport network,"" she tells BBC News NI. ""To date I haven't seen any evidence that would warrant the immediate removal of face coverings from public transport and bars and restaurants."" Read more here India recorded more than 1,000 deaths on Wednesday As we mentioned earlier, Indonesia is
currently grappling with a spike in cases and deaths. The country has recorded 1,040 deaths today and 34,379 cases, both new record highs. Australia has announced
it is sending 2.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine as well as medical
supplies. The aid package, which includes a
thousand ventilators, oxygen cylinders, concentrators and antigen tests, was in
response to an international appeal by Indonesia. The recent surge there is believed to have
been fuelled by the more infectious Delta variant. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent More than 32,500 new Covid cases have been confirmed in the
UK â the highest daily total since late January. It represents an increase from 28,700 on Tuesday. It is not
unusual for there to be a big jump on a Wednesday as a result of a weekend
effect â slightly less testing is done. Whatâs important is the trend. Week on week this represents

cases a day. But they are hoping this wave of infection peaks well before that. Mr Bettel tested positive not long after attending an EU summit in Brussels Luxembourgâs Prime Minister Xavier Bettel will remain in
hospital under medical observation until at least tomorrow, officials say. Bettel tested positive for the virus at the end of
June and had been self-isolating until he was admitted to hospital on Monday. Officials say the prime minister is getting better. Bettel contracted Covid last month not long after
attending an EU summit in Brussels. It was also attended by French President
Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders.
However none of the EU leaders were considered close contacts, AFP news agency
reports. Labour's Catherine McKinnell has asked the PM for the data on the impact when all covid restrictions in England are lifted, likely to be on 19 July. She says cases are ""sky rocketing"" and nurseries are having to limit numbers to maintain legal ratios of staff to children. The PM says: ""We have to make sure we use the tools we have in terms of isolation to get through this particular phase, it won't last long."" She says businesses are having to close because of staff having to self-isolate. The PM says: ""Thanks to the vaccine rollout we were able to get to step 3 and we have a review on 12 July but it looks as though we will get through to step 4 which will allow them to open up fully without the need for the one metre rule."" McKinnell pushes the PM to share the data on what impact lifting restrictions will have on coronavirus cases, hospitalisations and deaths. He says: ""We have data on hospitalisations and deaths and we have data for predictions for where they might go. They're available, you can look at them but they're speculative at the moment."" He says we are in ""about the middle to low of projections"" scientists have made for the third wave if ""all the openings"" go ahead. Labour's Catherine McKinnell asks about education catch up funding per pupil and why it's only 19% of that spent in the US. The PM says he doesn't recognise that. We started with ""massive investment"", he says and there will ""be more to come"". A bit more now on the daily coronavirus figures from the UK, which we've been bringing you during the past hour. In the past seven days, there have been 192,902 cases - that is a rise of 57,828 from the previous week, up by just under 43%. And deaths have risen by a similar rate - up 42.4% in a week. There has been a total of 161 deaths recorded, which is an increase of 48 from the previous week. Bernard Jenkin MP asks the PM to ""spare a thought for the teachers because the health service gets all the limelight but teachers and support staff have taken a hell of a burden"". Boris Johnson says: ""They've done an incredible job, you go to some schools and you see the challenge they have."" Jenkin responds: ""Could you ask your education secretary to make sure they get a break this summer from initiatives from his department, which have very often been contradictory and they've had to respond fast in the pandemic of course - but they long for a period of stability and predicability."" The PM says: ""I will do everything I can."" Robert Halfon MP tells the liaison committee that 640,000 pupils were sent home from school because of positive cases in their classrooms this week. He says there are 93,500 ""ghost children"" who haven't returned to school since 8 March. There are ""exam orphans"" who are missing one in four days of face-to-face teaching, Halfon says. He asks the PM for his long-term plan to address the endemic pupil absence and establish a level playing field for children to begin sitting exams again. The PM says: ""What's happened over the last 18 months has been really dehabilitating for many children... we must make it better... it's the single most important investment we can make."" He says in addition to the Â£40m already pledged to education there is a Â£3bn catch up plan before anything the chancellor may do later this year. ""I think the thing that works and that parents, teachers and pupils respond to is more direct on-to-one or one-to-two tutoring,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Gates Foundation agrees break-up back-up planThe deal would give Melinda Gates the option to resign and receive ""personal resources"" for further charity work.Business","The couple, pictured here in 2018, have given billions to charity The Gates Foundation has outlined back-up plans in case its co-chairs cannot work together in the wake of their divorce. The deal gives Bill and Melinda Gates a two-year trial, after which Ms Gates could resign from the organisation. Under the agreement, Ms Gates would also receive ""personal resources"" from her ex-husband for her own charity work. Ms Gates said she was ""deeply proud"" of what the organisation has achieved. In a statement, she added: ""I believe deeply in the foundation's mission and remain fully committed as co-chair to its work."" The agreement comes after question marks were raised over the future of the organisationwhen the couple announced they were divorcing after 27 years of marriage in May. The billionaires run the charitable foundation, which has worked on initiatives such as fighting infectious diseases and encouraging vaccinations for children. This video can not be played The BBC's Michelle Fleury breaks down the story of Bill and Melinda Gates' relationship Ms Gates will remain as a trustee during the ""trial period"", although it was announcedin a blog post,externalon Wednesday that the foundation will recruit new trustees to oversee its work. Its chief executive Mark Suzman said the successful candidates will be announced in January next year. He added that any funds received by Ms Gates in the event of her resignation would be ""completely separate from the foundation's endowment, which would not be affected"". The announcement also follows on from billionaire investor Warren Buffett's recent decision to step back from the foundation's board. He previously said his ""physical participation is in no way needed"" for the foundation to achieve its goals. Warren Buffett gives away $4.1bn more to charity Gates divorce puts spotlight on their foundation Mr Buffett is a co-founder of the Giving Pledge, along with Bill and Melinda Gates, which is a campaign that encourages billionaire philanthropy. In a note to Gates Foundation staff on Tuesday, it was announced that the couple would be donating another $15bn (Â£10.9bn) of their personal wealth to the foundation.

If you want to follow developments from Wembley as England play Denmark for a place in the final of Euro 2020you can see updates from our colleagues at BBC Sport here. But your coronavirus news has been brought to you today by Emma Harrison, Katie Wright, Sophie Williams, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and James Clarke.  Wembley should see its biggest crowd since before the pandemic this evening We are going to be bringing our live coverage of coronavirus to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: House prices in the UKdipped 0.5% in June as the stamp duty holiday began to be phased out,according to Halifax. Prices rose 8.8% over the year, leaving average prices still more than Â£21,000 higher, following a broadly unprecedented period of gains. The average price of a UK property is now Â£260,358, but the lender says it is ""important to put such a moderate decrease in context"". The government removed the need to pay stamp duty on certain properties throughout much of the pandemic. In the last year the housing market has been stimulated by stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, introduced by the government to boost the property market. From June 2020, buyers didn't have to pay any stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of their purchase price. However, at the start of this month, stamp duty breaks began to return to pre-pandemic levels. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News Some of music's biggest stars will squeeze into the UK's smallest venues this summer, in an attempt to revive the grassroots music scene. Sir Tom Jones will play the 800-seat Cambridge Junction, while Rag 'n' Bone Man will entertain 250 fans in the Tunbridge Wells Forum. It comes after 18 months in the which the live music industry essentially shut down due to Covid-19. Sir Tom says supporting small, local venues ""makes all the difference"". ""Musicians can record in their bedrooms, but they can't learn to perform in public without a place to play,"" he adds. Rag 'n' Bone Man has already tested the waters, playing three low-key, socially-distanced shows at London's Jazz CafÃ© last week. ""This has been very emotional,"" he told the audience on the closing night. ""I'm not going to get all soppy but not being able to do gigs for the last year-and-a-half feels like you're missing a testicle."" Read more The Scottish government has not yet decided whether to follow England in changing the self-isolation rules for school pupils and people who have been double vaccinated. Scotland's education secretary says the government is ""looking very seriously"" at whether it can make changes. Shirley-Anne Somerville says decisions will be taken ""as soon as we can"" but any decision will be based on the clinical advice and guidance the government is given. There have been calls for the Scottish government to introduce similar changes, after thousands of pupils missed out on learning due to having to self-isolate. Somerville tells the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme the absence rates in Scottish schools was about 4% at the end of the school term. But only 3% of those actually had Covid - with the vast majority of absent pupils only being off school because they had to self-isolate after someone else tested positive. Read more here. As we mentioned earlier, two British and Irish lions
players are isolating after one of the rugby squad's management team tested positive for
Covid during their tour of South Africa. This evening's game against Cell C Sharks is scheduled to go ahead, with kick-off at 19.00 BST - you canfollow the action hereif you wish to. Two members of staff are also isolating at the team
hotel and a Lions statement says all members of the touring party âhave since
been testedâ, adding further updates will âfollow in due courseâ. The Lions â who have been playing and training in a
strict coronavirus bubble â arrived as South Africa was battling a third wave
of infections, with the South African team having to isolate twice in the past
two weeks. You can read more here The World Health Organisation (WHO) is warning countries against lifting restrictions
too quickly. Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHOâs emergencies programme urges
caution and says there has been a 33% increase in cases in the European region
in the past week. âThis is not a flat curve, this is an increasing curve,â
he says. âMaking assumptions that transmissions will not increase because weâre
opening up because of a vaccine is a false assumption. âTransmission will increase when you open up because,
number one, we donât have any vaccines in everybody and, number two, the
vaccine coverage rates are lower and weâre not still sure to what extent
vaccination protects the ability to be infected.â He adds increased transmission in the community puts
the most vulnerable at risk. It comes as the UK prepares to lift restrictions,
including a limit on indoor meetings and the wearing of masks. It comes as the UK prepares to relax restrictions The government istemporarily extending lorry drivers' hours from Monday- because the haulage industry is reporting trouble recruiting enough staff. It means drivers and operators can make slightly longer journeys, says  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who acknowledges there is a shortage of drivers. The Road Haulage Association says there is currently a shortfall of about 60,000 lorry drivers though - and the new move is just a ""sticking plaster"" over the problem. It estimates about 30,000 HGV driving tests did not happen last year because of the pandemic. The haulage industry is just one of the sectors having problems finding staff as the economy reopens. Businesses and unions have warned if there are not enough drivers, there could be knock-on effects including on deliveries to supermarkets. The planned dates for easing coronavirus restrictions in Scotland are ""not set in stone"", Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister tells the BBC it would not be responsible to have a guaranteed timetable in the face of the virus, after another day of high case numbers. Scotland is due to move to level zero on 19 July, before dropping almost all restrictions on 9 August. However, Sturgeon says she will look very carefully at the latest data before confirming this will happen. This video can not be played Covid: Restriction easing dates 'not set in stone', say FM The NHS Covid tracing app has been downloaded more than 25 million times since its launch. But are people now deleting it - or switching off the contact tracing service - in order to avoid being told to isolate? In fact, usage is at an all-time high, says an adviser to NHS Test and Trace. ""About 50% of all, overall test results, nationally go through the app,"" Prof Christophe Fraser from Oxford University's Nuffield Department of Medicine tells Times Radio. ""The team monitors the usage of the app, and at this point in time the usage of the app is at an all-time high."" Asked about the implications of potentially 100,000 people testing positive every day, he says: ""It would result in a large amount of people being traced, which of course slows down the rate of infection and limits the stress on the NHS in terms of hospital admissions."" World Health Organisation (WHO) Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says the global Covid death toll has now reached four million. He warned on Wednesday the world is at a ""perilous point"" in the pandemic and hit out at a ""shocking inequality"" in global access to vaccines. The WHO chief says the pandemic's true death toll is likely to be much higher. ""At this stage in the pandemic, the fact that millions of health and care workers have not been vaccinated is abhorrent,"" he says during a press conference. ""From a moral, epidemiological or economic point view, now is the time for the world to come together to tackle this pandemic collectively,"" he adds.  Anyone travelling on public transport should continue to wear a mask even if they are no longer required legally, Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon says. Masks willno longer be required in England from 19 Julyunder a plan to end Covid-19 restrictions. Stormont ministers will decide the next steps for Northern Ireland on Thursday. Mallon says she has not seen any evidence to support ending the mandatory use of masks. ""The data tells us it acts as a mitigation against the virus but it also gives passengers confidence to come back on to our public transport network,"" she tells BBC News NI. ""To date I haven't seen any evidence that would warrant the immediate removal of face coverings from public transport and bars and restaurants."" Read more here India recorded more than 1,000 deaths on Wednesday As we mentioned earlier, Indonesia is
currently grappling with a spike in cases and deaths. The country has recorded 1,040 deaths today and 34,379 cases, both new record highs. Australia has announced
it is sending 2.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine as well as medical
supplies. The aid package, which includes a
thousand ventilators, oxygen cylinders, concentrators and antigen tests, was in
response to an international appeal by Indonesia. The recent surge there is believed to have
been fuelled by the more infectious Delta variant. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent More than 32,500 new Covid cases have been confirmed in the
UK â the highest daily total since late January. It represents an increase from 28,700 on Tuesday. It is not
unusual for there to be a big jump on a Wednesday as a result of a weekend
effect â slightly less testing is done. Whatâs important is the trend. Week on week this represents
a 43% rise. That is actually down on what has been seen recently. Cases are
going up quickly, but not as quickly as last week. Itâs too early to say whether that is part of a longer-term
pattern. But what is certain is that government officials are watching this
data like hawks. The policy of opening up in England is based on the hope the virus will soon hit the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination
programme and natural infection. Ministers have said we should be prepared to see 100,000
cases a day. But they are hoping this wave of infection peaks well before that. Mr Bettel tested positive not long after attending an EU summit in Brussels Luxembourgâs Prime Minister Xavier Bettel will remain in
hospital under medical observation until at least tomorrow, officials say. Bettel tested positive for the virus at the end of
June and had been self-isolating until he was admitted to hospital on Monday. Officials say the prime minister is getting better. Bettel contracted Covid last month not long after
attending an EU summit in Brussels. It was also attended by French President
Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders.
However none of the EU leaders were considered close contacts, AFP news agency
reports. Labour's Catherine McKinnell has asked the PM for the data on the impact when all covid restrictions in England are lifted, likely to be on 19 July. She says cases are ""sky rocketing"" and nurseries are having to limit numbers to maintain legal ratios of staff to children. The PM says: ""We have to make sure we use the tools we have in terms of isolation to get through this particular phase, it won't last long."" She says businesses are having to close because of staff having to self-isolate. The PM says: ""Thanks to the vaccine rollout we were able to get to step 3 and we have a review on 12 July but it looks as though we will get through to step 4 which will allow them to open up fully without the need for the one metre rule."" McKinnell pushes the PM to share the data on what impact lifting restrictions will have on coronavirus cases, hospitalisations and deaths. He says: ""We have data on hospitalisations and deaths and we have data for predictions for where they might go. They're available, you can look at them but they're speculative at the moment."" He says we are in ""about the middle to low of projections"" scientists have made for the third wave if ""all the openings"" go ahead. Labour's Catherine McKinnell asks about education catch up funding per pupil and why it's only 19% of that spent in the US. The PM says he doesn't recognise that. We started with ""massive investment"", he says and there will ""be more to come"". A bit more now on the daily coronavirus figures from the UK, which we've been bringing you during the past hour. In the past seven days, there have been 192,902 cases - that is a rise of 57,828 from the previous week, up by just under 43%. And deaths have risen by a similar rate - up 42.4% in a week. There has been a total of 161 deaths recorded, which is an increase of 48 from the previous week. Bernard Jenkin MP asks the PM to ""spare a thought for the teachers because the health service gets all the limelight but teachers and support staff have taken a hell of a burden"". Boris Johnson says: ""They've done an incredible job, you go to some schools and you see the challenge they have."" Jenkin responds: ""Could you ask your education secretary to make sure they get a break this summer from initiatives from his department, which have very often been contradictory and they've had to respond fast in the pandemic of course - but they long for a period of stability and predicability."" The PM says: ""I will do everything I can."" Robert Halfon MP tells the liaison committee that 640,000 pupils were sent home from school because of positive cases in their classrooms this week.

Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Boris Johnson has often said
he wants to put the debate about Brexit in the past, but when challenged by a
committee of MPs about the importance of telling the truth in politics he waded
straight back into an old debate. âIt is commonly asserted,â he
said, âthat when we put the figure of Â£350m on the side of a bus that that was
erroneous.â It was erroneous,as we explained at the time. The slogan on the bus said
âwe send the EU Â£350m a weekâ but this gross figure didnât account for the fact
that UKâs budget rebate was deducted before any money was sent to Brussels. In 2017, the chair of the UK
Statistics Authority Sir David Norgrove wrote to Mr Johnson. He said suggesting
an extra Â£350m would be available for public spending outside the EU was ""a
clear misuse of official statistics"". Boris Johnson says therecent agreementto delay a ban on imports of chilled meats from Great Britain into Northern Ireland has only given the UK a ""stay of execution"", and a long-term solution is needed. In response to questioning from Conservative MP Sir Bill Cash, the PM blames the EU's application of the protocol for creating ""anomalies"" at the border. Before the questions move to veteran Tory MP Sir Bill Cash on Brexit, Boris Johnson says ""I'm sure our viewers may be switching over to football."" ""I'm not sure we'll be able to compete much longer,"" he states. Kick off is at 8pm andyou can follow all the action on the BBC Sport live page here. The Protocol has faced mounting opposition from unionists in Northern Ireland Boris Johnson was asked about the impact of the Northern Ireland Protocol - the bit of the UK's Brexit divorce deal he agreed to prevent border posts between the UK and the Irish Republic. In order to do this, since January this year border checks have instead been imposed on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). In a bid to stem the disruption caused by the checks, the UK government has pushed back the agreed date for some checks which are yet to come in - leading to legal action from the EU. Recently, the two sides agreed to postpone a ban on chilled meat products going from GB to NI that was due to come into effect at the end of June - but a long-term solution is yet to be found. Read more. Mr Hoare says the Protocol is best applied when there is political trust between both parties, and businesses will always work within the rules applied to them. Johnson says ""what is needed now is good will and imagination, but there are some very serious problems"". He says it is a ""very difficult situation"" to see drugs, including cancer drugs, not being able to get to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Hoare asks what movement the UK government should make to ensure the Protocol can be applied easily. Boris Johnson says the ""UK is a faithful, obedient servant of the law,"" and that officials are ""obeying the EU jurisdiction"". He says the way the EU is implementing the Protocol is ""grossly disproportionate and unnecessary"". Conservative Chair of the Northern Ireland Committee, Simon Hoare, says there is ""nothing in the Northern Ireland Protocol"" which negatively affects the constitutional ""integrity of the United Kingdom"". He says there are some in Northern Ireland who believe the Protocol is a ""stepping stone"" in steps to reunification of Ireland. ""I'm a passionate unionist,"" Boris Johnson replies, he says the government wants to ""strengthen"" the union. ""There is absolutely no threat to Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom."" He says the protocol is ""being applied, currently, in a way which causes the anxieties to which you have referred"". Sir Elton John has described the government as ""philistines"" over its handling of the music industry post-Brexit Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says we used to export musicians and talent across the EU but that has been severely affected since Brexit. Did the PM raise the issue of a visa waiver scheme with Angela Merkel when she visited London recently? he asks. Germany is one of the better countries on this, the prime minister says. ""About 17 EU members are quite good and seven are not so good,"" he adds but ""we are working on it to sort it out"". The proposal for a total visa waiver scheme, however  is a complicated one, he says. And ""we don't want a gradual erosion of out freedom"" by giving up rights won as a result of Brexit, he says. Johnson says he appreciates ""how frustrating it is"" and says he hopes it will be ""speedily resolved"". Sir Elton Johnrecently warned MPs that the UK music industry could lose ""a generation of talent""because of post-Brexit restrictions on touring the EU. The musician accused ministers of being unwilling to fix a ""gaping hole"" in the current Brexit deal which means artists need costly visas to play in the bloc. There have been a further 32,548 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. It's the first time since 24 January that the daily figure has been more than 30,000. For context, there was an eight-week period in April and May when the daily figure never went above 4,000. And there have been another 33 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. The questioning now moves on to the impact of Brexit. Scottish committee chair and SNP MP Pete Wishart uses the opportunity to ask Boris Johnson what he ""really feels"" about devolution. Last year, the prime minister was criticised after reports that he told a virtual meeting of Tory MPs thatdevolution had been a ""disaster"" in Scotland. In reply, Mr Johnson says there have been ""disastrous aspects"" of the SNP's performance in government but praises the role of the UK government during the pandemic. The government plans for ending quarantine for fully vaccinated contacts of people with Covid have dominated the agenda today at Westminster. Ministers have confirmed double-jabbed close contacts will not have to isolate after 16 August in England, nearly a month after restrictions are due to ease 19 July. BBC analysis shows increasing infection rates mean more than 4.5 million people could be asked to self-isolate between now and then. That's led to warning from industry bodies about the impact on businesses, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warning it could lead to ""carnage"" for the economy. Read more. Helen CattPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson has been asked for a second time today for an estimate of the numbers of how many people may end up having to self-isolate because of rising cases. Again, he doesn't put a figure on it. Expect him to be asked this several more times in the near future. How many people get 'pinged' could be crucial for all sorts of areas in the coming weeks. Conservative MP and Women and Equalities Chair Caroline Nokes asks what specific initiatives ministers are doing to ""build back in a more feminine and more gender neutral way"". She is quoting a previous remark by Boris Johnson while hosting the G7 on 11 June - take a look at the tweet below. Boris Johnson says furlough has ""generally attracted more female recipients than male, so far, which I think is positive"". Caroline Nokes says this shows that women were more likely to be working in areas which were shut down. ""We want to make sure that we have female employment rising across the board,"" Johnson states. ""The gender pay gap is at a record low,"" he says, and there are ""1.19m more women in work than there were in 2010,"" he adds. Allow Twitter content?

We started with ""massive investment"", he says and there will ""be more to come"". Halfon asks the prime minister whether he backs the idea of a longer school day to help schoolchildren catch up. Boris Johnson says he thinks this is the ""right thing to do"" - but there remains a question mark over how this should be done, and the mix of classes and activities that could be used. He says the government is having a ""proper review"" of this area. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who chairs the education committee, asks Boris Johnson what he intends to do to get children into a position to take exams next year. The prime minister acknowledges children have lost an  ""unconscionable"" amount of teaching time because of disruption caused, but the government's ""catch-up"" plan will help. He saysplans to axeCovid bubble self-isolation rules will also help lower disruption. Labour MP and Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee Stephen Timms says it's been recommended the Â£20 top up to Universal Credit should be made permanent. Boris Johnson says the government is working to increase the national living wage for the lowest paid. The government is focusing on a ""jobs-led"" recovery from the pandemic, he adds. Mr Timms says the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has warned 500,000 people could be pushed below the poverty line if the UC increase - which is Â£20 per week - is stopped. Boris Johnson says the answer is to ""get people into work,"" and adds that job vacancies are back to pre-pandemic levels.

"Covid cases in UK at highest level since JanuaryMore than 32,500 confirmed cases have been reported in the country, up 43% on the same day last week.","Coronavirus cases in the UK have risen above 30,000 for first time since January, official figures show. Wednesday's data showed there had been a further 32,548 confirmed Covid cases. And there were another 33 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive Covid test. It comes as Boris Johnson has defended the government's approach to easing England's lockdown, saying the link between infection and serious disease and death has been ""severed"". The prime minister has pledged to scrap most of England's coronavirus regulations at step four of the roadmap out of lockdown, expected on 19 July. It means the government is now braced for a surge in coronavirus cases, possibly around 100,000 a day, as restrictions are lifted. Millions could end up self-isolating this summer What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? I'm fully vaccinated, but how can I prove it? How could life change on 19 July? Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said it was ""certainly true"" there was a ""wave of cases because of the Delta variant"" of the virus. ""But scientists are also absolutely clear that we have severed the link between infection and serious disease and death,"" he said. ""Currently there are only a 30th of the deaths that we were seeing at an equivalent position in previous waves of this pandemic."" However, on Monday the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance was more cautious, saying vaccines had ""weakened the link between cases and hospitalisations, but it's a weakened link, not a completely broken link"". Wednesday's daily figure for Covid cases in the UK is above 30,000 for the first time since 24 January. In terms of hospitalisations, England is seeing more than 330 admissions a day on average at the moment. The most recent day - Monday - saw 416 admitted. As of Wednesday, 2,144 people are in hospital in England with Covid - the first time this figure has topped 2,000 since April. Wednesday's case total represents an increase from 28,700 on Tuesday. It is not unusual for there to be a big jump on a Wednesday as a result of a weekend effect - slightly less testing is done. What's important is the trend. Week on week this represents a 43% rise. That is actually down on what has been seen recently. They are going up quickly, but not as quickly as last week. It's too early to say whether that is part of a longer-term pattern. But what is certain is that government officials are watching this data like hawks. The policy of opening up in England is based on the hope that the virus will soon hit the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection. Ministers have said we should be prepared to see 100,000 cases a day. But they are hoping this wave of infection peaks well before that. Because while the vaccination programme has weakened the link between cases and hospitalisation, it has not broken it entirely. On current trends that many infections would lead to 2,000 daily admissions - twice what the NHS would normally see in the depths of winter for all types of respiratory illness. The PM has also defended the timescale for ending self-isolation for contacts of Covid, insisting it is a ""sensible approach"". The government has said people who are fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 from 16 August. Giving evidence to the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson rejected the suggestion 16 August had been chosen because it was when the government expected the population to have reached herd immunity . ""That's not the considerationâ¦ it's the time by which we feel that there will have been much more progress on vaccination,"" he said. And the PM said to do it any sooner would ""effectively be allowing many more people to be vector of disease."" ""All decisions are a balance of risk,"" he said. Asked how many people the government expected to end up self-isolating over the next month, he said: ""That will depend on the spread. I haven't seen any data on that. It will depend on the numbers."" Meanwhile, World Health Organization emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan has urged countries to use extreme caution when reopening their economies from Covid restrictions so as ""not to lose the gains you have made"". Asked at a briefing if the UK was aiming for herd immunity, Dr Ryan said: ""I'm not aware that that's the logic driving our colleagues in the United Kingdom, I suspect it's not. He said the argument that it was better to infect more people was morally empty and epidemiologically stupid. Labour's leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned the prime minister he is leading the countryinto a ""summer of chaos and confusion"" over plans to ease lockdown. At PMQs, he said the country should open up ""in a controlled way"" and urged Mr Johnson to ensure masks still have to be worn on public transport. Face masks will no longer be legally required and distancing rules will be scrappedat the final stage of England's Covid lockdown roadmap. The lifting of rules on 19 July will be confirmed next Monday after a review of the latest data.

Widow cleared of sex charges calls for law change,"This video can not be played In her first broadcast interview, Lady Lavinia Nourse describes how she felt on trial. A former High Court judge's widow, who was cleared of historical sex abuse, has called for those accused to be granted anonymity until charged. Lady Lavinia Nourse, 77, of Newmarket in Suffolk,was cleared of 17 counts of sexually abusing a boyunder 12. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she said ""anonymity up to the point of charge"" would be a ""step forward"". She has also questioned ""why the complainant cannot be revealed after the case"". Lady Lavinia Nourse was married to Sir Martin Nourse, who died in 2017, aged 85 Lady Lavinia, who was married to Sir Martin Nourse, was accused of abuse by a man known to her two months after her 85-year-old husband died in 2017. Eighteen months later, she was charged with five counts of indecently assaulting a boy and 12 counts of indecency with a child in the 1980s. All charges related to the same complainant. A jury at Peterborough's Nightingale court cleared her of all charges.   Lady Lavinia said she felt the case would not have got to court if she ""hadn't had such a high profile husband"" - a suggestion denied by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). ""It was made in the same way as all of our cases - following detailed consideration of the evidence and in accordance with our legal test,"" a CPS spokesman said. Lady Lavinia said she was ""completely and utterly shocked"" when she was accused ""The accuser was very happy to let it be known widely in London, and in and around Newmarket, using his name, and freely admitting that this is what I had done,"" Lady Lavinia said. ""It was intolerable on top of everything else. I didn't know who was looking at me, where I could turn, I didn't know who I could trust."" Ex-High Court judge's widow cleared of sex abuse Ex-Tory minister gives evidence in abuse trial Accuser of ex-judge's widow 'carried shame' Lady Lavinia describes the two-week trial as ""hell"" and said she had ""never been so frightened, lonely, [and] utterly miserable"". ""There was a very high chance that if I was found guilty that I would go to jail and I just find it really frightening that people can tell lies that actually can send an innocent person to prison,"" she said. She added it was an ""absolute nightmare"" to have to sit and ""listen to all the ghastly things that were said about me"". Dame Mary Archer said in her evidence Lady Nourse was ""one of my closest friends"" Lady Lavinia said she now wanted to ""raise awareness of the question of anonymity up to the point of charge"". ""Everyone remains anonymous, that in itself would be a step forward,"" she said. ""I think it's less likely that in the immediate future, we will get anonymity after being charged. ""But I would like to ask the question, why can the complainant then not be revealed after the case?"" A government spokesman said: ""Current police guidance is clear there should, in general, be a right to anonymity before the point of charge - however there will be circumstances in which the public interest means that an arrested suspect should be named."" The Home Office said once a suspect has been charged, the principle of open justice means that they should be named. This was because experience has shown that naming those charged with serious sexual offences can sometimes encourage others to come forward and ensure justice was done, it added. The guidance said the current approach applied to all offences and struck a balance between the rights of suspects to privacy and the need to prevent and investigate crime.

If you want to follow developments from Wembley as England play Denmark for a place in the final of Euro 2020you can see updates from our colleagues at BBC Sport here. But your coronavirus news has been brought to you today by Emma Harrison, Katie Wright, Sophie Williams, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and James Clarke.  Wembley should see its biggest crowd since before the pandemic this evening We are going to be bringing our live coverage of coronavirus to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: House prices in the UKdipped 0.5% in June as the stamp duty holiday began to be phased out,according to Halifax. Prices rose 8.8% over the year, leaving average prices still more than Â£21,000 higher, following a broadly unprecedented period of gains. The average price of a UK property is now Â£260,358, but the lender says it is ""important to put such a moderate decrease in context"". The government removed the need to pay stamp duty on certain properties throughout much of the pandemic. In the last year the housing market has been stimulated by stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, introduced by the government to boost the property market. From June 2020, buyers didn't have to pay any stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of their purchase price. However, at the start of this month, stamp duty breaks began to return to pre-pandemic levels. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News Some of music's biggest stars will squeeze into the UK's smallest venues this summer, in an attempt to revive the grassroots music scene. Sir Tom Jones will play the 800-seat Cambridge Junction, while Rag 'n' Bone Man will entertain 250 fans in the Tunbridge Wells Forum. It comes after 18 months in the which the live music industry essentially shut down due to Covid-19. Sir Tom says supporting small, local venues ""makes all the difference"". ""Musicians can record in their bedrooms, but they can't learn to perform in public without a place to play,"" he adds. Rag 'n' Bone Man has already tested the waters, playing three low-key, socially-distanced shows at London's Jazz CafÃ© last week. ""This has been very emotional,"" he told the audience on the closing night. ""I'm not going to get all soppy but not being able to do gigs for the last year-and-a-half feels like you're missing a testicle."" Read more The Scottish government has not yet decided whether to follow England in changing the self-isolation rules for school pupils and people who have been double vaccinated. Scotland's education secretary says the government is ""looking very seriously"" at whether it can make changes. Shirley-Anne Somerville says decisions will be taken ""as soon as we can"" but any decision will be based on the clinical advice and guidance the government is given. There have been calls for the Scottish government to introduce similar changes, after thousands of pupils missed out on learning due to having to self-isolate. Somerville tells the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme the absence rates in Scottish schools was about 4% at the end of the school term. But only 3% of those actually had Covid - with the vast majority of absent pupils only being off school because they had to self-isolate after someone else tested positive. Read more here. As we mentioned earlier, two British and Irish lions
players are isolating after one of the rugby squad's management team tested positive for
Covid during their tour of South Africa. This evening's game against Cell C Sharks is scheduled to go ahead, with kick-off at 19.00 BST - you canfollow the action hereif you wish to. Two members of staff are also isolating at the team
hotel and a Lions statement says all members of the touring party âhave since
been testedâ, adding further updates will âfollow in due courseâ. The Lions â who have been playing and training in a
strict coronavirus bubble â arrived as South Africa was battling a third wave
of infections, with the South African team having to isolate twice in the past
two weeks. You can read more here The World Health Organisation (WHO) is warning countries against lifting restrictions
too quickly. Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHOâs emergencies programme urges
caution and says there has been a 33% increase in cases in the European region
in the past week. âThis is not a flat curve, this is an increasing curve,â
he says. âMaking assumptions that transmissions will not increase because weâre
opening up because of a vaccine is a false assumption. âTransmission will increase when you open up because,
number one, we donât have any vaccines in everybody and, number two, the
vaccine coverage rates are lower and weâre not still sure to what extent
vaccination protects the ability to be infected.â He adds increased transmission in the community puts
the most vulnerable at risk. It comes as the UK prepares to lift restrictions,
including a limit on indoor meetings and the wearing of masks. It comes as the UK prepares to relax restrictions The government istemporarily extending lorry drivers' hours from Monday- because the haulage industry is reporting trouble recruiting enough staff. It means drivers and operators can make slightly longer journeys, says  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who acknowledges there is a shortage of drivers. The Road Haulage Association says there is currently a shortfall of about 60,000 lorry drivers though - and the new move is just a ""sticking plaster"" over the problem. It estimates about 30,000 HGV driving tests did not happen last year because of the pandemic. The haulage industry is just one of the sectors having problems finding staff as the economy reopens. Businesses and unions have warned if there are not enough drivers, there could be knock-on effects including on deliveries to supermarkets. The planned dates for easing coronavirus restrictions in Scotland are ""not set in stone"", Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister tells the BBC it would not be responsible to have a guaranteed timetable in the face of the virus, after another day of high case numbers. Scotland is due to move to level zero on 19 July, before dropping almost all restrictions on 9 August. However, Sturgeon says she will look very carefully at the latest data before confirming this will happen. This video can not be played Covid: Restriction easing dates 'not set in stone', say FM The NHS Covid tracing app has been downloaded more than 25 million times since its launch. But are people now deleting it - or switching off the contact tracing service - in order to avoid being told to isolate? In fact, usage is at an all-time high, says an adviser to NHS Test and Trace. ""About 50% of all, overall test results, nationally go through the app,"" Prof Christophe Fraser from Oxford University's Nuffield Department of Medicine tells Times Radio. ""The team monitors the usage of the app, and at this point in time the usage of the app is at an all-time high."" Asked about the implications of potentially 100,000 people testing positive every day, he says: ""It would result in a large amount of people being traced, which of course slows down the rate of infection and limits the stress on the NHS in terms of hospital admissions."" World Health Organisation (WHO) Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says the global Covid death toll has now reached four million. He warned on Wednesday the world is at a ""perilous point"" in the pandemic and hit out at a ""shocking inequality"" in global access to vaccines. The WHO chief says the pandemic's true death toll is likely to be much higher. ""At this stage in the pandemic, the fact that millions of health and care workers have not been vaccinated is abhorrent,"" he says during a press conference. ""From a moral, epidemiological or economic point view, now is the time for the world to come together to tackle this pandemic collectively,"" he adds.  Anyone travelling on public transport should continue to wear a mask even if they are no longer required legally, Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon says. Masks willno longer be required in England from 19 Julyunder a plan to end Covid-19 restrictions. Stormont ministers will decide the next steps for Northern Ireland on Thursday. Mallon says she has not seen any evidence to support ending the mandatory use of masks. ""The data tells us it acts as a mitigation against the virus but it also gives passengers confidence to come back on to our public transport network,"" she tells BBC News NI. ""To date I haven't seen any evidence that would warrant the immediate removal of face coverings from public transport and bars and restaurants."" Read more here India recorded more than 1,000 deaths on Wednesday As we mentioned earlier, Indonesia is
currently grappling with a spike in cases and deaths. The country has recorded 1,040 deaths today and 34,379 cases, both new record highs. Australia has announced
it is sending 2.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine as well as medical
supplies. The aid package, which includes a
thousand ventilators, oxygen cylinders, concentrators and antigen tests, was in
response to an international appeal by Indonesia. The recent surge there is believed to have
been fuelled by the more infectious Delta variant. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent More than 32,500 new Covid cases have been confirmed in the
UK â the highest daily total since late January. It represents an increase from 28,700 on Tuesday. It is not
unusual for there to be a big jump on a Wednesday as a result of a weekend
effect â slightly less testing is done. Whatâs important is the trend. Week on week this represents
a 43% rise. That is actually down on what has been seen recently. Cases are
going up quickly, but not as quickly as last week. Itâs too early to say whether that is part of a longer-term
pattern. But what is certain is that government officials are watching this
data like hawks. The policy of opening up in England is based on the hope the virus will soon hit the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination
programme and natural infection. Ministers have said we should be prepared to see 100,000
cases a day. But they are hoping this wave of infection peaks well before that. Mr Bettel tested positive not long after attending an EU summit in Brussels Luxembourgâs Prime Minister Xavier Bettel will remain in
hospital under medical observation until at least tomorrow, officials say. Bettel tested positive for the virus at the end of
June and had been self-isolating until he was admitted to hospital on Monday. Officials say the prime minister is getting better. Bettel contracted Covid last month not long after
attending an EU summit in Brussels. It was also attended by French President
Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders.
However none of the EU leaders were considered close contacts, AFP news agency
reports. Labour's Catherine McKinnell has asked the PM for the data on the impact when all covid restrictions in England are lifted, likely to be on 19 July. She says cases are ""sky rocketing"" and nurseries are having to limit numbers to maintain legal ratios of staff to children. The PM says: ""We have to make sure we use the tools we have in terms of isolation to get through this particular phase, it won't last long."" She says businesses are having to close because of staff having to self-isolate. The PM says: ""Thanks to the vaccine rollout we were able to get to step 3 and we have a review on 12 July but it looks as though we will get through to step 4 which will allow them to open up fully without the need for the one metre rule."" McKinnell pushes the PM to share the data on what impact lifting restrictions will have on coronavirus cases, hospitalisations and deaths. He says: ""We have data on hospitalisations and deaths and we have data for predictions for where they might go. They're available, you can look at them but they're speculative at the moment."" He says we are in ""about the middle to low of projections"" scientists have made for the third wave if ""all the openings"" go ahead. Labour's Catherine McKinnell asks about education catch up funding per pupil and why it's only 19% of that spent in the US. The PM says he doesn't recognise that. We started with ""massive investment"", he says and there will ""be more to come"". A bit more now on the daily coronavirus figures from the UK, which we've been bringing you during the past hour. In the past seven days, there have been 192,902 cases - that is a rise of 57,828 from the previous week, up by just under 43%. And deaths have risen by a similar rate - up 42.4% in a week. There has been a total of 161 deaths recorded, which is an increase of 48 from the previous week. Bernard Jenkin MP asks the PM to ""spare a thought for the teachers because the health service gets all the limelight but teachers and support staff have taken a hell of a burden"". Boris Johnson says: ""They've done an incredible job, you go to some schools and you see the challenge they have."" Jenkin responds: ""Could you ask your education secretary to make sure they get a break this summer from initiatives from his department, which have very often been contradictory and they've had to respond fast in the pandemic of course - but they long for a period of stability and predicability."" The PM says: ""I will do everything I can."" Robert Halfon MP tells the liaison committee that 640,000 pupils were sent home from school because of positive cases in their classrooms this week. He says there are 93,500 ""ghost children"" who haven't returned to school since 8 March. There are ""exam orphans"" who are missing one in four days of face-to-face teaching, Halfon says. He asks the PM for his long-term plan to address the endemic pupil absence and establish a level playing field for children to begin sitting exams again. The PM says: ""What's happened over the last 18 months has been really dehabilitating for many children... we must make it better... it's the single most important investment we can make."" He says in addition to the Â£40m already pledged to education there is a Â£3bn catch up plan before anything the chancellor may do later this year. ""I think the thing that works and that parents, teachers and pupils respond to is more direct on-to-one or one-to-two tutoring,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes,"This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" North America experienced its warmest June on record, according to the EU's Earth observation programme. That will come as no surprise given the unprecedentedly high temperatures recently recorded during the heatwave that hit Canada and parts of the US. But UK residents may be startled to learn that despite the rain and cloud they experienced, it was the second warmest June on record for Europe. It was also the fourth warmest June ever recorded worldwide. Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' A really simple guide to climate change Dozens dead as heatwave shatters records Copernicus, the EU's Earth observation programme, produces its figures for world temperatures from computer-generated analyses using billions of measurements from satellites, aircraft and weather stations around the world. Climate experts say the findings point to a frightening escalation in temperature extremes. ""We are getting used to record high temperatures being recorded somewhere around the world every year now,"" says Prof Peter Stott of the UK Met Office. He says what meteorologists like him find shocking is not that the world is experiencing more heatwaves but that temperature records are increasingly being broken by such large margins. In Canada and the north-western US, several cities recorded temperatures a full 5 degrees Celsius above previous records. A Siberian heatwave last year saw temperatures more than 5C above the previous record between January and June. A study by the Met Office on the extreme heat in the Russian region found that reaching such temperatures was almost impossible without human-caused climate change. It anticipates similar results from studies of the Canadian heatwave. Portland residents flocked to cooling centres amid the recent heatwave Its initial calculations suggest the odds of the sort of temperatures experienced in Canada occurring without climate change are very low indeed, says Professor Stott. ""It is telling us that changes in average climate are leading to rapid escalation not just of extreme temperatures, but of extraordinarily extreme temperatures,"" he adds. That is exactly what the science says we should expect, Prof Friederike Otto of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University told the BBC. ""Every decade the world has increased the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and that has increased the rate of warming. So, of course, heat records are being broken more frequently,"" she maintains. Prof Otto believes the risks from the increasing number of heatwaves the world now experiences is not taken seriously enough. The UK has also been experiencing soaring temperatures Storms and flood provide dramatic before-and-after images and cause widespread damage to property. Heatwaves, by contrast, do not leave a trail of destruction in their wake. Prof Otto describes them as ""silent killers"". ""People rarely drop dead on the street, but die quietly in their poorly insulated and un-air-conditioned homes."" Indeed, how many victims these events claim is often only apparent months after the event when statisticians can calculate excess mortality. Prof Otto says even if we do manage to achieve the dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that many countries around the world are now committed to, we will still see more frequent and more intense heatwaves than we have today. She advises that, alongside cutting carbon emissions, we should be investing in adaption and resilience to ensure our communities can withstand the higher temperatures we can expect in the future.

The longer the game went on, the more England looked likely to score, even though you have those self-doubts. There was about two or three minutes at the end where England were passing it around and keeping the ball. They were singing ""ole"" at Wembley Stadium in the semi-final of a major tournament! I've been around, watched tournaments and played in tournaments over the years and so many things have gone wrong - the 'Hand of God', Frank Lampard's goal, Chris Waddle hitting the inside of the post, it being a quarter of an inch away from Gazza's studs. We have seen big injuries to big players prior to tournaments but in this one, England just seem to have had a bit of luck for once! You need that to win a tournament.

FT: England 2-1 Denmark Alan ShearerFormer England striker on BBC One You don't achieve what Southgate has achieved in his career without having a tough streak, without being able to make big decisions. He has been a captain in every dressing room he has been in. He had to take off Jack Grealish today because it is clear he doesn't trust Grealish defensively. That worked, because then Denmark couldn't get the ball, England passed the ball. I lost count of the number of passes. England 2-1 Denmark Metro Scotland have taken England's victory well... FT: England 2-1 Denmark Jermaine JenasFormer England midfielder on BBC One The lads what
they did best was dealing with the pressure of the moment when Denmark were
going well. The way they responded all day to everything was absolutely spot on. You have to give Gareth Southgate credit,
he knows within his arsenal he has some incredible players but there were some
moments where he lets some players loose when he brought on Jack Grealish and Phil
Foden and put Raheem Sterling on the right they went out there with freedom and
thatâs why theyâve got the result tonight. FT: England 2-1 Denmark Alan ShearerFormer England striker on BBC One England have shown character in abundance. After three or four minutes we was saying Denmark are a really good team, they were popping it around, working hard and causing England problems. Then they got the goal, and England had to dig deep. They scored at the right time just before half-time which would have given them a little bit of confidence. FT: England 2-1 Denmark ""England make history."" ""Kane you believe it!"" ""Andfinally!"" ""The history boys."" ""Finally."" FT: England 2-1 Denmark Alan ShearerFormer England striker on BBC One We were screaming, what a night what a performance. It was hard work, it was very different to the other performances they have put in. But they have shown a great side to their game tonight, in coming back from conceding their first goal. FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England striker Ian Wright on ITV:""I still feel like Raheem Sterling is going to be
a key man, of course Harry Kane took the penalty and scored but Sterling is
still going to a key man and I think he is the one that Italy will be worried
about."" FT: England 2-1 Denmark Denmark Denmark coachKasper Hjulmand:""Obviously, it's a big disappointment that we're so close to the final, and different circumstances during the match mean that we're not taking the last step. ""It has been amazing what the boys have done. There's a fantastic power within these guys. They play football in a fantastic way. ""We've been attacking, scoring goals and showed our true selves. The players just went on with everything they have â both off and on the pitch."" FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England right back Gary Neville on ITV: ""Harry Kane needs to rest up, he has got Chiellini and Bonucci
all night, he is the type of player they will fancy playing against, a physical
contest. It will be a really tough test, you are not going to get an easy match
in the final. ""Italy have grown into the tournament better than I thought they
would. We have seen a lot over the years about possession football, but two
teams who have been more methodical has made the final. ""England have been a good team, one goal conceded in six
matches is outstanding, Southgate set his stall out at the start of this
tournament. The only way we was going to get to a final was keeping clean
sheets."" England 2-1 Denmark Go on. England 2-1 Denmark England England boss Gareth Southgate to BBC Sport:""The experiences the group have had really shone through tonight, we knew we wouldn't go through a tournament without conceding, but tonight it was our night. ""You can only gain confidence by the evidence of your results and performances. The more experiences like this - they are reference points for the team. We know we have one enormous hurdle to come but tonight they should enjoy it, they should be very proud. ""This tournament we've been adaptable and we've changed at the right times. Now we have a real challenge in the final. ""It was mayhem on the pitch at full-time. As soon as Sweet Caroline was playing that was it. They know how much tonight will have taken out of them. Italy are a day ahead in their preparation and we have to be spot on. ""I'm just so pleased for our country. The atmosphere, I don't think I've heard the new Wembley like that. It's only topped the Germany game really. We know what our country like others has been through and to continue that happiness and journey for anther four days, we're so happy. FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England striker Ian Wright on ITV:""I wasn't surprised Saka came off because that has been the pattern of Gareth, He's started him, he stretches the team goes at the defenders and then he brings on Jack Grealish. ""I feel for Jack Grealish you can see its a tournament that he really wants to be a part of, every time he gets going it doesnt quite happen for him. To be taken off like that is of course, you subbed a sub its not nice. ""But it is about the squad and being a part of it. Sunday Jack might come on and make a massive difference, he might set up the winning goal."" #bbcfootball Tommy G:This is crazy. Just crazy. We are in a final. After the pens of 90, 96, 98, 04 and 06. Ronaldinho in 02. The sheer underwhelmingness (a word?) of everything thing else until Russia. And now this. Ruddy hell. A happy 40 year old I am. England 2-1 Denmark Raheem Sterling was close to converting... FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England right back Gary Neville on ITV:""There's been moments before games where Southgate has been questioned and had it gone wrong he would have been battered. He has done thing his way all the way through the tournament. ""There is no ego in that dressing room and he will make the decisions that are best for the team."" Â© 2025 BBC.

England v Denmark (20:00 BST) For 18-year-oldJude Bellingham, success has been on the cards. since his early teens. Mike Dodds, head of Birmingham City's academy, told the BBC: ""I was there for his first session as a
7-year-old. I think he had a Argentina or Barcelona top on. He was no different
to others at that age. ""If anyone had said then he was going to be Euro
semi-finals at 18 I would have laughed but by the time he was 13 you knew he
was going to be special. ""He had interest at 12/13 from all over England.
Then by 14/15 half of Europe was watching him at our youth games at the
training ground. ""It's difficult to watch the games because I have
seen him do ridiculous things for so long but I am probably his biggest critic. As
good as he is, I'll be like 'yeah, but he could have done this', but then I
remember he's only 18 and would have just done his A- Levels. I am also his
biggest fan. ""His mindset won't be just to see Euro 2020 as
experience, he'll want to play every minute of every game."" England v Denmark (20:00 BST) Chris WaddleEx-England winger on BBC Radio 4 Former England wingerChris Waddlesays that Denmark seem to be on a mission now. ""You've got to give Denmark a lot of respect. The first two games they lost, everybody thought it's not meant to be. Obviously the scenes we saw with Christian Eriksen weren't pretty and they've seemed to have just got together as if they're on a mission now. ""They play with so much energy and so much passion for their country and the shirt with the fans right behind them. Since those first two games they've arguably been one of the best teams in the tournament."" The Danes have been travelling a fair bit for their games. Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Baku, and now Wembley but Waddle doesn't feel it will have an impact. ""They get good recovery now. They've got everything you can think of which can help them improve over the days after a match to recover. They are a very dangerous side who probably built their game on the English system many years ago and that is why I think we always find it difficult when we play these types of teams."" England v Denmark (20:00 BST) England's assistant managerSteve Hollandhas been telling BBC Radio 5 Live whyConor Coadyis his player of the tournament, despite not playing a minute of action yet.

Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Boris Johnson has often said
he wants to put the debate about Brexit in the past, but when challenged by a
committee of MPs about the importance of telling the truth in politics he waded
straight back into an old debate. âIt is commonly asserted,â he
said, âthat when we put the figure of Â£350m on the side of a bus that that was
erroneous.â It was erroneous,as we explained at the time. The slogan on the bus said
âwe send the EU Â£350m a weekâ but this gross figure didnât account for the fact
that UKâs budget rebate was deducted before any money was sent to Brussels. In 2017, the chair of the UK
Statistics Authority Sir David Norgrove wrote to Mr Johnson. He said suggesting
an extra Â£350m would be available for public spending outside the EU was ""a
clear misuse of official statistics"". Boris Johnson says therecent agreementto delay a ban on imports of chilled meats from Great Britain into Northern Ireland has only given the UK a ""stay of execution"", and a long-term solution is needed. In response to questioning from Conservative MP Sir Bill Cash, the PM blames the EU's application of the protocol for creating ""anomalies"" at the border. Before the questions move to veteran Tory MP Sir Bill Cash on Brexit, Boris Johnson says ""I'm sure our viewers may be switching over to football."" ""I'm not sure we'll be able to compete much longer,"" he states. Kick off is at 8pm andyou can follow all the action on the BBC Sport live page here. The Protocol has faced mounting opposition from unionists in Northern Ireland Boris Johnson was asked about the impact of the Northern Ireland Protocol - the bit of the UK's Brexit divorce deal he agreed to prevent border posts between the UK and the Irish Republic. In order to do this, since January this year border checks have instead been imposed on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). In a bid to stem the disruption caused by the checks, the UK government has pushed back the agreed date for some checks which are yet to come in - leading to legal action from the EU. Recently, the two sides agreed to postpone a ban on chilled meat products going from GB to NI that was due to come into effect at the end of June - but a long-term solution is yet to be found. Read more. Mr Hoare says the Protocol is best applied when there is political trust between both parties, and businesses will always work within the rules applied to them. Johnson says ""what is needed now is good will and imagination, but there are some very serious problems"". He says it is a ""very difficult situation"" to see drugs, including cancer drugs, not being able to get to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Hoare asks what movement the UK government should make to ensure the Protocol can be applied easily. Boris Johnson says the ""UK is a faithful, obedient servant of the law,"" and that officials are ""obeying the EU jurisdiction"". He says the way the EU is implementing the Protocol is ""grossly disproportionate and unnecessary"". Conservative Chair of the Northern Ireland Committee, Simon Hoare, says there is ""nothing in the Northern Ireland Protocol"" which negatively affects the constitutional ""integrity of the United Kingdom"". He says there are some in Northern Ireland who believe the Protocol is a ""stepping stone"" in steps to reunification of Ireland. ""I'm a passionate unionist,"" Boris Johnson replies, he says the government wants to ""strengthen"" the union. ""There is absolutely no threat to Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom."" He says the protocol is ""being applied, currently, in a way which causes the anxieties to which you have referred"". Sir Elton John has described the government as ""philistines"" over its handling of the music industry post-Brexit Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says we used to export musicians and talent across the EU but that has been severely affected since Brexit. Did the PM raise the issue of a visa waiver scheme with Angela Merkel when she visited London recently? he asks. Germany is one of the better countries on this, the prime minister says. ""About 17 EU members are quite good and seven are not so good,"" he adds but ""we are working on it to sort it out"". The proposal for a total visa waiver scheme, however  is a complicated one, he says. And ""we don't want a gradual erosion of out freedom"" by giving up rights won as a result of Brexit, he says. Johnson says he appreciates ""how frustrating it is"" and says he hopes it will be ""speedily resolved"". Sir Elton Johnrecently warned MPs that the UK music industry could lose ""a generation of talent""because of post-Brexit restrictions on touring the EU. The musician accused ministers of being unwilling to fix a ""gaping hole"" in the current Brexit deal which means artists need costly visas to play in the bloc. There have been a further 32,548 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. It's the first time since 24 January that the daily figure has been more than 30,000. For context, there was an eight-week period in April and May when the daily figure never went above 4,000. And there have been another 33 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. The questioning now moves on to the impact of Brexit. Scottish committee chair and SNP MP Pete Wishart uses the opportunity to ask Boris Johnson what he ""really feels"" about devolution. Last year, the prime minister was criticised after reports that he told a virtual meeting of Tory MPs thatdevolution had been a ""disaster"" in Scotland. In reply, Mr Johnson says there have been ""disastrous aspects"" of the SNP's performance in government but praises the role of the UK government during the pandemic. The government plans for ending quarantine for fully vaccinated contacts of people with Covid have dominated the agenda today at Westminster. Ministers have confirmed double-jabbed close contacts will not have to isolate after 16 August in England, nearly a month after restrictions are due to ease 19 July. BBC analysis shows increasing infection rates mean more than 4.5 million people could be asked to self-isolate between now and then. That's led to warning from industry bodies about the impact on businesses, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warning it could lead to ""carnage"" for the economy. Read more. Helen CattPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson has been asked for a second time today for an estimate of the numbers of how many people may end up having to self-isolate because of rising cases. Again, he doesn't put a figure on it. Expect him to be asked this several more times in the near future. How many people get 'pinged' could be crucial for all sorts of areas in the coming weeks. Conservative MP and Women and Equalities Chair Caroline Nokes asks what specific initiatives ministers are doing to ""build back in a more feminine and more gender neutral way"". She is quoting a previous remark by Boris Johnson while hosting the G7 on 11 June - take a look at the tweet below. Boris Johnson says furlough has ""generally attracted more female recipients than male, so far, which I think is positive"". Caroline Nokes says this shows that women were more likely to be working in areas which were shut down. ""We want to make sure that we have female employment rising across the board,"" Johnson states. ""The gender pay gap is at a record low,"" he says, and there are ""1.19m more women in work than there were in 2010,"" he adds. Allow Twitter content?

Labour's Catherine McKinnell asks about education catch up funding per pupil and why is it only 19% of that which is spent in the US? The PM says he doesn't recognise that. We started with ""massive investment"", he says and there will ""be more to come"". Halfon asks the prime minister whether he backs the idea of a longer school day to help schoolchildren catch up. Boris Johnson says he thinks this is the ""right thing to do"" - but there remains a question mark over how this should be done, and the mix of classes and activities that could be used. He says the government is having a ""proper review"" of this area. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who chairs the education committee, asks Boris Johnson what he intends to do to get children into a position to take exams next year. The prime minister acknowledges children have lost an  ""unconscionable"" amount of teaching time because of disruption caused, but the government's ""catch-up"" plan will help. He saysplans to axeCovid bubble self-isolation rules will also help lower disruption. Labour MP and Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee Stephen Timms says it's been recommended the Â£20 top up to Universal Credit should be made permanent. Boris Johnson says the government is working to increase the national living wage for the lowest paid. The government is focusing on a ""jobs-led"" recovery from the pandemic, he adds. Mr Timms says the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has warned 500,000 people could be pushed below the poverty line if the UC increase - which is Â£20 per week - is stopped. Boris Johnson says the answer is to ""get people into work,"" and adds that job vacancies are back to pre-pandemic levels. BBC analysis shows more than 4.5 million people could be asked to self-isolate before 16 August. Read more about the analysis here. Â© 2025 BBC.

In order to do this, since January this year border checks have instead been imposed on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). In a bid to stem the disruption caused by the checks, the UK government has pushed back the agreed date for some checks which are yet to come in - leading to legal action from the EU. Recently, the two sides agreed to postpone a ban on chilled meat products going from GB to NI that was due to come into effect at the end of June - but a long-term solution is yet to be found. Read more. Mr Hoare says the Protocol is best applied when there is political trust between both parties, and businesses will always work within the rules applied to them. Johnson says ""what is needed now is good will and imagination, but there are some very serious problems"". He says it is a ""very difficult situation"" to see drugs, including cancer drugs, not being able to get to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Hoare asks what movement the UK government should make to ensure the Protocol can be applied easily. Boris Johnson says the ""UK is a faithful, obedient servant of the law,"" and that officials are ""obeying the EU jurisdiction"". He says the way the EU is implementing the Protocol is ""grossly disproportionate and unnecessary"". Conservative Chair of the Northern Ireland Committee, Simon Hoare, says there is ""nothing in the Northern Ireland Protocol"" which negatively affects the constitutional ""integrity of the United Kingdom"". He says there are some in Northern Ireland who believe the Protocol is a ""stepping stone"" in steps to reunification of Ireland. ""I'm a passionate unionist,"" Boris Johnson replies, he says the government wants to ""strengthen"" the union. ""There is absolutely no threat to Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom."" He says the protocol is ""being applied, currently, in a way which causes the anxieties to which you have referred"". Sir Elton John has described the government as ""philistines"" over its handling of the music industry post-Brexit Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says we used to export musicians and talent across the EU but that has been severely affected since Brexit. Did the PM raise the issue of a visa waiver scheme with Angela Merkel when she visited London recently? he asks. Germany is one of the better countries on this, the prime minister says. ""About 17 EU members are quite good and seven are not so good,"" he adds but ""we are working on it to sort it out"". The proposal for a total visa waiver scheme, however  is a complicated one, he says. And ""we don't want a gradual erosion of out freedom"" by giving up rights won as a result of Brexit, he says. Johnson says he appreciates ""how frustrating it is"" and says he hopes it will be ""speedily resolved"". Sir Elton Johnrecently warned MPs that the UK music industry could lose ""a generation of talent""because of post-Brexit restrictions on touring the EU. The musician accused ministers of being unwilling to fix a ""gaping hole"" in the current Brexit deal which means artists need costly visas to play in the bloc. There have been a further 32,548 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. It's the first time since 24 January that the daily figure has been more than 30,000. For context, there was an eight-week period in April and May when the daily figure never went above 4,000. And there have been another 33 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. The questioning now moves on to the impact of Brexit. Scottish committee chair and SNP MP Pete Wishart uses the opportunity to ask Boris Johnson what he ""really feels"" about devolution. Last year, the prime minister was criticised after reports that he told a virtual meeting of Tory MPs thatdevolution had been a ""disaster"" in Scotland. In reply, Mr Johnson says there have been ""disastrous aspects"" of the SNP's performance in government but praises the role of the UK government during the pandemic. The government plans for ending quarantine for fully vaccinated contacts of people with Covid have dominated the agenda today at Westminster. Ministers have confirmed double-jabbed close contacts will not have to isolate after 16 August in England, nearly a month after restrictions are due to ease 19 July. BBC analysis shows increasing infection rates mean more than 4.5 million people could be asked to self-isolate between now and then. That's led to warning from industry bodies about the impact on businesses, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warning it could lead to ""carnage"" for the economy. Read more. Helen CattPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson has been asked for a second time today for an estimate of the numbers of how many people may end up having to self-isolate because of rising cases. Again, he doesn't put a figure on it. Expect him to be asked this several more times in the near future. How many people get 'pinged' could be crucial for all sorts of areas in the coming weeks. Conservative MP and Women and Equalities Chair Caroline Nokes asks what specific initiatives ministers are doing to ""build back in a more feminine and more gender neutral way"". She is quoting a previous remark by Boris Johnson while hosting the G7 on 11 June - take a look at the tweet below. Boris Johnson says furlough has ""generally attracted more female recipients than male, so far, which I think is positive"". Caroline Nokes says this shows that women were more likely to be working in areas which were shut down. ""We want to make sure that we have female employment rising across the board,"" Johnson states. ""The gender pay gap is at a record low,"" he says, and there are ""1.19m more women in work than there were in 2010,"" he adds. Allow Twitter content?

We asked you who should start for England in their Euro 2020 semi-final match against Denmark- and the majority of you think Gareth Southgate should stick with the same XI he picked against Ukraine.

Harry MaguireandJohn Stonesremain your preferred partnership in front of Pickford. After his goal against Ukraine, Maguire is the second most selected player overall, while Stones is fourth. NowHarry Kaneis up and running with three goals, the England captain has been entrusted by you to lead the line again. Kane - who earned star of the match honours against Ukraine - is the third-most picked player overall. The front three are completed byRaheem Sterling, who is the most selected player on the left side of attack, andJadon Sanchowho is the top choice to start on the right. WhileJack Grealishwas a popular choice, the Aston Villa captain's picks were split between a host of midfield and forward roles, so he just misses out.

Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Boris Johnson has often said
he wants to put the debate about Brexit in the past, but when challenged by a
committee of MPs about the importance of telling the truth in politics he waded
straight back into an old debate. âIt is commonly asserted,â he
said, âthat when we put the figure of Â£350m on the side of a bus that that was
erroneous.â It was erroneous,as we explained at the time. The slogan on the bus said
âwe send the EU Â£350m a weekâ but this gross figure didnât account for the fact
that UKâs budget rebate was deducted before any money was sent to Brussels. In 2017, the chair of the UK
Statistics Authority Sir David Norgrove wrote to Mr Johnson. He said suggesting
an extra Â£350m would be available for public spending outside the EU was ""a
clear misuse of official statistics"". Boris Johnson says therecent agreementto delay a ban on imports of chilled meats from Great Britain into Northern Ireland has only given the UK a ""stay of execution"", and a long-term solution is needed. In response to questioning from Conservative MP Sir Bill Cash, the PM blames the EU's application of the protocol for creating ""anomalies"" at the border. Before the questions move to veteran Tory MP Sir Bill Cash on Brexit, Boris Johnson says ""I'm sure our viewers may be switching over to football."" ""I'm not sure we'll be able to compete much longer,"" he states. Kick off is at 8pm andyou can follow all the action on the BBC Sport live page here.

Ship that blocked Suez is freed after deal signedThe megaship Ever Given is finally leaving the Suez Canal after a deal is struck with Egypt.Middle East,"The Ever Given, part of the Evergreen fleet, has been held at the Great Bitter Lake near Ismailia for three months A huge container ship that blocked the Suez Canal in March - disrupting global trade - is finally leaving the waterway after Egypt signed a compensation deal with its owners and insurers. The Ever Given weighed anchor shortly after 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) and headed north towards the Mediterranean escorted by tugs. The ship has been impounded for three months near the canal city of Ismailia. Terms of the deal were not disclosed but Egypt had demanded $550m (Â£397m). As it got under way, Egyptian TV showed footage of the captain and a crew member being presented with flowers and a plaque on board the ship. 'I was blamed for blocking the Suez Canal' How was the Suez Canal ship freed? The 193km (120-mile) Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea at the canal's northern end to the Red Sea in the south and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. But the vital waterway was blocked when the 400m-long (1,312ft) Ever Given became wedged across it after running aground amid high winds. Global trade was disrupted as hundreds of ships were stuck in the traffic jam. The container ship was refloated following a six-day salvage operation that involved a flotilla of tug boats and dredging vessels. One person was killed during the operation. A satellite photograph reveals how the Ever Given was wedged across the canal Since then, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) has been seeking compensation from the Ever Given's Japanese owner Shoei Kisen for the cost of the salvage operation, damage to the canal's banks and other losses. The SCA initially asked for $916m compensation, including $300m for a salvage bonus and $300m for loss of reputation. But UK Club - which insured Shoei Kisen for third-party liabilities - rejected the claim, describing it as ""extraordinarily large"" and ""largely unsupported"". The SCA later lowered its demand to $550m. The final settlement, which has not been revealed, was agreed a few days ago and signed on Wednesday to coincide with the ship's release. By Sally Nabil, BBC News, Suez Canal Journalists were taken on a tugboat to film the Ever Given finally resuming its voyage along the Suez Canal. As we watched the giant vessel sail past, everybody felt relieved. After more than three months, the story was coming to an end. I remembered the scene back in March, when the ship was wedged across the waterway, bringing navigation to a stand-still for six days and disrupting global trade. Those days were quite tense and full of uncertainty. On Wednesday, the atmosphere was one of cheerfulness. However, so far no-one knows what caused this whole saga. Investigations were carried out, but the findings have not been announced. At a news conference, Suez Canal Authority chairman Osama Rabie said the ship was the sole responsibility of its master. The details of the financial settlement between the SCA and the ship's owners and insurers have also not been revealed. Mr Rabie refused to even give a rough estimate of how much of a compensation the SCA received. SCA head Osama Rabie told a news conference that the authority would not change its rules about the passage of ships in bad weather. However, he said the grounding had accelerated plans for the canal's expansion. The UK Club paid tribute to ""the work and expertise of the SCA and others whose professionalism and dedication resulted in the ship being refloated"". ""Over the last three months we, along with the ship's owners and other interests, have worked closely with the SCA's negotiations team to achieve today's results,"" a statement said. This video can not be played (29 March 2021) The stranded container ship is seen finally on the move and no longer blocking the canal Yukito Higaki of Imabari shipbuilding, of which Shoei Kisen is a subsidiary, said the company would continue to be ""a regular and loyal customer"" of the Suez Canal Authority. The vessel, with an Indian crew, is still loaded with about 18,300 containers. It is due to undergo an inspection by divers at Port Said before sailing to Rotterdam in the Netherlands and then to the UK port of Felixstowe where it will offload its containers, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremesNorth America experienced its warmest June on record and experts say the figures are frightening.,"This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" North America experienced its warmest June on record, according to the EU's Earth observation programme. That will come as no surprise given the unprecedentedly high temperatures recently recorded during the heatwave that hit Canada and parts of the US. But UK residents may be startled to learn that despite the rain and cloud they experienced, it was the second warmest June on record for Europe. It was also the fourth warmest June ever recorded worldwide. Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' A really simple guide to climate change Dozens dead as heatwave shatters records Copernicus, the EU's Earth observation programme, produces its figures for world temperatures from computer-generated analyses using billions of measurements from satellites, aircraft and weather stations around the world. Climate experts say the findings point to a frightening escalation in temperature extremes. ""We are getting used to record high temperatures being recorded somewhere around the world every year now,"" says Prof Peter Stott of the UK Met Office. He says what meteorologists like him find shocking is not that the world is experiencing more heatwaves but that temperature records are increasingly being broken by such large margins. In Canada and the north-western US, several cities recorded temperatures a full 5 degrees Celsius above previous records. A Siberian heatwave last year saw temperatures more than 5C above the previous record between January and June. A study by the Met Office on the extreme heat in the Russian region found that reaching such temperatures was almost impossible without human-caused climate change. It anticipates similar results from studies of the Canadian heatwave. Portland residents flocked to cooling centres amid the recent heatwave Its initial calculations suggest the odds of the sort of temperatures experienced in Canada occurring without climate change are very low indeed, says Professor Stott. ""It is telling us that changes in average climate are leading to rapid escalation not just of extreme temperatures, but of extraordinarily extreme temperatures,"" he adds. That is exactly what the science says we should expect, Prof Friederike Otto of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University told the BBC. ""Every decade the world has increased the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and that has increased the rate of warming. So, of course, heat records are being broken more frequently,"" she maintains. Prof Otto believes the risks from the increasing number of heatwaves the world now experiences is not taken seriously enough. The UK has also been experiencing soaring temperatures Storms and flood provide dramatic before-and-after images and cause widespread damage to property. Heatwaves, by contrast, do not leave a trail of destruction in their wake. Prof Otto describes them as ""silent killers"". ""People rarely drop dead on the street, but die quietly in their poorly insulated and un-air-conditioned homes."" Indeed, how many victims these events claim is often only apparent months after the event when statisticians can calculate excess mortality. Prof Otto says even if we do manage to achieve the dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that many countries around the world are now committed to, we will still see more frequent and more intense heatwaves than we have today. She advises that, alongside cutting carbon emissions, we should be investing in adaption and resilience to ensure our communities can withstand the higher temperatures we can expect in the future.

Warnings of staff shortages due to self-isolationBusiness groups say the delay in easing self-isolation rules will hit firms that rely on young workers.,"A decision not to ease rules on self-isolation until 16 August could lead to severe staff shortages this summer, industry groups have warned. From next month, double-jabbed people in England will not have to isolate if a close contact tests positive. But with cases rising and most Covid rules set to end on 19 July, there are fears millions of people will still have to take time off work this summer. UK Hospitality said self-isolation was already causing ""carnage"" to firms. At the moment, close contacts of people who test positive for Covid have to isolate for up to 10 days. But UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls said testing could replace isolation for people who've been in contact with a Covid patient.

""What we are asking for is pragmatic adjustment to avoid disadvantaging young workers - test to release as per international travel will reduce disruption without reducing protection."" The Orchard Tea Garden was forced to close as staff self-isolated The Orchard Tea Gardens in Grantchester near Cambridge had to close this week after several staff were contacted by the NHS Test and Trace app. Owner Charles Bunker said sales were already down 30% this summer, while ingredient prices and staff wages had risen sharply. The cafe now faced a ""perfect storm"" due to the impact of test and trace. ""The reality is that most of these people aren't ill, they've just been in contact with someone who has and have had to self isolate,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake up to Money. ""We need a system now whereby people can test, and immediately they are found not to have Covid they can come back to work. ""16 August will be two thirds of the way through our summer and the hospitality is dependent on having a good summer."" Currently, if you are required to self isolate your employer cannot force you to come into work, says Emma Bartlett, an employment lawyer at CM Murray. Doing so would not only breach your rights but those of your fellow workers in terms of health and safety. As you isolate you may be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme. A Â£500 grant is also available in England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he expected cases to ""rise significantly"" as restrictions were eased and that they could go as high as 100,00 per day. According to BBC analysis, more than 4.5 million peoplecould still be asked to self-isolate between now and 16 August. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted the government had to strike a balance between reopening the economy and curbing the spread of Covid-19. ""On the one hand we're being told that the restrictions are too onerous, and on the other we're being told that we're being too loose in terms of lifting those restrictions. And that's the balance, that's the nature of political judgment,"" he told Sky News. Staff at The Wall climbing centre in Cumbria Cumbrian climbing centre The Wall only has three staff and if they all had to isolate at the same time the business would have to shut, manager Joe Holden said. All staff are under 25 and none have had the jab, he added. ""It's hard enough to get enough people through the door, let alone keeping up with the rules changing every few weeks,"" he told the BBC. ""We'll have to take on more staff as a contingency option [in case we're forced to isolate] but training more people increases the workload and costs for us."" Another sector potentially at risk from a rise in self-isolation is beauty. Most businesses in the sector are small and only employ a few staff. They also rely heavily on younger workers. The staff of KH Hair Group in Leicester and Oadby Lesley Blair, boss of industry group Babtac, said self-isolation was ""incredibly disruptive"" and urged the government to give staff in the industry priority for second vaccinations ahead of 16 August. ""Alternatively ideally rules could be changed, subject to certain conditions, such as daily tests being done, to allow businesses to stay open and staff to work provided they tested negative each day."" However, Amanda Falls, owner of KH Hair Group in the East Midlands, said she ""welcomed"" the easing of self-isolation rules from August. Out of 26 staff across her two salons, 20 have been double jabbed and those that have not are under 20 years old. One fully vaccinated staff member had to self-isolate recently costing her about Â£2,000 in lost income.

"Widow cleared of sex charges calls for law changeLady Lavinia Nourse calls her two-week historical child sex abuse trial an ""absolute nightmare"".","This video can not be played In her first broadcast interview, Lady Lavinia Nourse describes how she felt on trial. A former High Court judge's widow, who was cleared of historical sex abuse, has called for those accused to be granted anonymity until charged. Lady Lavinia Nourse, 77, of Newmarket in Suffolk,was cleared of 17 counts of sexually abusing a boyunder 12. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she said ""anonymity up to the point of charge"" would be a ""step forward"". She has also questioned ""why the complainant cannot be revealed after the case"". Lady Lavinia Nourse was married to Sir Martin Nourse, who died in 2017, aged 85 Lady Lavinia, who was married to Sir Martin Nourse, was accused of abuse by a man known to her two months after her 85-year-old husband died in 2017. Eighteen months later, she was charged with five counts of indecently assaulting a boy and 12 counts of indecency with a child in the 1980s. All charges related to the same complainant. A jury at Peterborough's Nightingale court cleared her of all charges.   Lady Lavinia said she felt the case would not have got to court if she ""hadn't had such a high profile husband"" - a suggestion denied by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). ""It was made in the same way as all of our cases - following detailed consideration of the evidence and in accordance with our legal test,"" a CPS spokesman said. Lady Lavinia said she was ""completely and utterly shocked"" when she was accused ""The accuser was very happy to let it be known widely in London, and in and around Newmarket, using his name, and freely admitting that this is what I had done,"" Lady Lavinia said. ""It was intolerable on top of everything else. I didn't know who was looking at me, where I could turn, I didn't know who I could trust."" Ex-High Court judge's widow cleared of sex abuse Ex-Tory minister gives evidence in abuse trial Accuser of ex-judge's widow 'carried shame' Lady Lavinia describes the two-week trial as ""hell"" and said she had ""never been so frightened, lonely, [and] utterly miserable"". ""There was a very high chance that if I was found guilty that I would go to jail and I just find it really frightening that people can tell lies that actually can send an innocent person to prison,"" she said. She added it was an ""absolute nightmare"" to have to sit and ""listen to all the ghastly things that were said about me"". Dame Mary Archer said in her evidence Lady Nourse was ""one of my closest friends"" Lady Lavinia said she now wanted to ""raise awareness of the question of anonymity up to the point of charge"". ""Everyone remains anonymous, that in itself would be a step forward,"" she said. ""I think it's less likely that in the immediate future, we will get anonymity after being charged. ""But I would like to ask the question, why can the complainant then not be revealed after the case?"" A government spokesman said: ""Current police guidance is clear there should, in general, be a right to anonymity before the point of charge - however there will be circumstances in which the public interest means that an arrested suspect should be named."" The Home Office said once a suspect has been charged, the principle of open justice means that they should be named. This was because experience has shown that naming those charged with serious sexual offences can sometimes encourage others to come forward and ensure justice was done, it added. The guidance said the current approach applied to all offences and struck a balance between the rights of suspects to privacy and the need to prevent and investigate crime.

Ship that blocked Suez is freed after deal signed,"The Ever Given, part of the Evergreen fleet, has been held at the Great Bitter Lake near Ismailia for three months A huge container ship that blocked the Suez Canal in March - disrupting global trade - is finally leaving the waterway after Egypt signed a compensation deal with its owners and insurers. The Ever Given weighed anchor shortly after 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) and headed north towards the Mediterranean escorted by tugs. The ship has been impounded for three months near the canal city of Ismailia. Terms of the deal were not disclosed but Egypt had demanded $550m (Â£397m). As it got under way, Egyptian TV showed footage of the captain and a crew member being presented with flowers and a plaque on board the ship. 'I was blamed for blocking the Suez Canal' How was the Suez Canal ship freed? The 193km (120-mile) Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea at the canal's northern end to the Red Sea in the south and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. But the vital waterway was blocked when the 400m-long (1,312ft) Ever Given became wedged across it after running aground amid high winds. Global trade was disrupted as hundreds of ships were stuck in the traffic jam. The container ship was refloated following a six-day salvage operation that involved a flotilla of tug boats and dredging vessels. One person was killed during the operation. A satellite photograph reveals how the Ever Given was wedged across the canal Since then, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) has been seeking compensation from the Ever Given's Japanese owner Shoei Kisen for the cost of the salvage operation, damage to the canal's banks and other losses. The SCA initially asked for $916m compensation, including $300m for a salvage bonus and $300m for loss of reputation. But UK Club - which insured Shoei Kisen for third-party liabilities - rejected the claim, describing it as ""extraordinarily large"" and ""largely unsupported"". The SCA later lowered its demand to $550m. The final settlement, which has not been revealed, was agreed a few days ago and signed on Wednesday to coincide with the ship's release. By Sally Nabil, BBC News, Suez Canal Journalists were taken on a tugboat to film the Ever Given finally resuming its voyage along the Suez Canal. As we watched the giant vessel sail past, everybody felt relieved. After more than three months, the story was coming to an end. I remembered the scene back in March, when the ship was wedged across the waterway, bringing navigation to a stand-still for six days and disrupting global trade. Those days were quite tense and full of uncertainty. On Wednesday, the atmosphere was one of cheerfulness. However, so far no-one knows what caused this whole saga. Investigations were carried out, but the findings have not been announced. At a news conference, Suez Canal Authority chairman Osama Rabie said the ship was the sole responsibility of its master. The details of the financial settlement between the SCA and the ship's owners and insurers have also not been revealed. Mr Rabie refused to even give a rough estimate of how much of a compensation the SCA received. SCA head Osama Rabie told a news conference that the authority would not change its rules about the passage of ships in bad weather. However, he said the grounding had accelerated plans for the canal's expansion. The UK Club paid tribute to ""the work and expertise of the SCA and others whose professionalism and dedication resulted in the ship being refloated"". ""Over the last three months we, along with the ship's owners and other interests, have worked closely with the SCA's negotiations team to achieve today's results,"" a statement said. This video can not be played (29 March 2021) The stranded container ship is seen finally on the move and no longer blocking the canal Yukito Higaki of Imabari shipbuilding, of which Shoei Kisen is a subsidiary, said the company would continue to be ""a regular and loyal customer"" of the Suez Canal Authority. The vessel, with an Indian crew, is still loaded with about 18,300 containers. It is due to undergo an inspection by divers at Port Said before sailing to Rotterdam in the Netherlands and then to the UK port of Felixstowe where it will offload its containers, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Britney Spears' long-time lawyer offers to resign,"The singer recently said she would like the opportunity to select her own legal team Britney Spears' court-appointed lawyer has asked to resign from his role, as the fallout from the pop star's dramatic court testimony continues. Samuel Ingham has represented the singer since she was placed under a conservatorship in 2008. But in a public statement to the court last month, Spears said he discouraged her from speaking out, and that she wanted to chose her own legal team. Mr Ingham's announcement came afterSpears' manager also stepped down. The lawyer revealed his desire to resign in court papers filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday. ""Samuel D Ingham III hereby resigns as court-appointed counsel for Britney Jean Spears, conservatee, effective upon the appointment of new court-appointed counsel,"" the request said. Loeb and Loeb, a law firm brought in to help Mr Ingham, also offered its resignation in the filing. Neither party explained why they wanted to step down, but the move came less than two weeks after Spears described her conservatorship, a legal guardianship arrangement, as ""abusive"" and said she was ""traumatised"". Britney Spears: Everything she said in court Britney Spears' manager resigns after 25 years BBC Radio 4: Pieces of Britney In a 23-minute statement to the court last month, the singer claimed she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having children, and asked the court to end the conservatorship that has governed her life for the last 13 years. Although she had ""built a relationship"" with Mr Ingham in that time, she said he had been ""scared for me to go forward"" with her testimony. ""He told me I should keep it to myself,"" she said, adding that she would like the opportunity ""to actually handpick my own lawyer by myself"". Mr Ingham appeared to be taken aback by the star's statement - telling the court he was unaware of its contents before she spoke. He added that he would step aside as her representative if asked. According to the most recent accounting available, in 2019 Mr Ingham was paid about $373,000 (Â£270,000) for working with the singer. Spears pays the legal costs for both sides in her conservatorship case. This video can not be played What we can all learn from Britney Spearsâ case He is the third party involved in Spears' conservatorship to step aside in the past week. The star's long-time manager Larry Rudolph resigned earlier this week, saying he had been informed of her ""intention to officially retire"" from the music industry. Mr Rudolph had worked with Spears since her breakthrough with ...Baby One More Time in 1998 - although he said he had not been in contact with her for the last two-and-a-half years due to her work hiatus. And last week, financial management firm the Bessemer Trust, which was appointed to help oversee Spears' financial affairs,requested to resignfrom that role, citing her desire for the conservatorship to stop. Spears has not yet made a formal request for the court to review the arrangement. The next hearing is scheduled for 14 July. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

House prices dip as stamp duty holiday endsThe start of phasing out of the stamp duty holiday led to house prices dipping 0.5% in June.BusinessComments,"House prices dipped 0.5% in June as the stamp duty holiday began to be phased out, according to the Halifax. Prices rose 8.8% over the year, leaving average prices still more than Â£21,000 higher, following a broadly unprecedented period of gains. The lender said it was ""important to put such a moderate decrease in context."" The Government removed the need to pay stamp duty on certain properties throughout much of the pandemic. In the last year the housing market has been stimulated by stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, introduced by the government to boost the property market. From June 2020, buyers didn't have to pay any stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of their purchase price. However, at the start of this month, stamp duty breaks began to return to pre-pandemic levels. Now a 5% tax kicks in at Â£250,000 for properties up to Â£925,000. Rates on properties above that are higher. From October rates are due to return to normal which means the point homebuyers start paying stamp duty will revert back to Â£125,001. How much stamp duty will I have to pay now? Russell Galley, managing director of the Halifax, said: ""The power of homemovers to drive the market won't fade entirely as the economy recovers,."" He pointed out that people have been spurred on by increased time spent at home during the pandemic to still look to find properties with more space. ""Coupled with buyers chasing the relatively small number of available properties, and continued low borrowing rates, it's a trend which can sustain high average prices for some time to come,"" he said. The average price of a UK property according to the lender is now Â£260,358. Demand remains high among buyers searching for larger family homes with the average price of a detached property climbing faster than any other type over the past 12 months. These were up by more than 10% or almost Â£47,000 in cash terms. Detached homes now cost on average more than half a million pounds, Â£200,000 more expensive than the typical semi-detached house. However Mr Galley predicted that annual growth will slow more by the end of the year, with unemployment expected to edge higher as job support measures unwind, and the peak of buyer demand now likely to have passed. ""This may be the first sign house price growth is starting to run out of steam, but this slight cooling does not mean prices will come crashing back down to where they were last summer,"" said Lucy Pendleton of estate agents James Pendleton. She said some buyers are holding off marketing their property because they cannot see anywhere to move to: ""That creates a vicious cycle of low supply and consequently causing intense up-bidding on the most desirable properties."" North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said despite the beginning of the end to the stamp duty holiday there was still strength in the market: ""We don't expect this new balance between supply and demand to change much over the next few months, particularly if economic growth can make up for the ending of the furlough scheme.""

Warnings of staff shortages due to self-isolation,"A decision not to ease rules on self-isolation until 16 August could lead to severe staff shortages this summer, industry groups have warned. From next month, double-jabbed people in England will not have to isolate if a close contact tests positive. But with cases rising and most Covid rules set to end on 19 July, there are fears millions of people will still have to take time off work this summer. UK Hospitality said self-isolation was already causing ""carnage"" to firms. At the moment, close contacts of people who test positive for Covid have to isolate for up to 10 days. But UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls said testing could replace isolation for people who've been in contact with a Covid patient. Self-isolation to be scrapped for double-jabbed Restaurants forced to shut due to staff isolating What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? ""We understand the need for caution and effective transmission control,""she wrote on Twitter,external. ""What we are asking for is pragmatic adjustment to avoid disadvantaging young workers - test to release as per international travel will reduce disruption without reducing protection."" The Orchard Tea Garden was forced to close as staff self-isolated The Orchard Tea Gardens in Grantchester near Cambridge had to close this week after several staff were contacted by the NHS Test and Trace app. Owner Charles Bunker said sales were already down 30% this summer, while ingredient prices and staff wages had risen sharply. The cafe now faced a ""perfect storm"" due to the impact of test and trace. ""The reality is that most of these people aren't ill, they've just been in contact with someone who has and have had to self isolate,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake up to Money. ""We need a system now whereby people can test, and immediately they are found not to have Covid they can come back to work. ""16 August will be two thirds of the way through our summer and the hospitality is dependent on having a good summer."" Currently, if you are required to self isolate your employer cannot force you to come into work, says Emma Bartlett, an employment lawyer at CM Murray. Doing so would not only breach your rights but those of your fellow workers in terms of health and safety. As you isolate you may be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme. A Â£500 grant is also available in England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he expected cases to ""rise significantly"" as restrictions were eased and that they could go as high as 100,00 per day. According to BBC analysis, more than 4.5 million peoplecould still be asked to self-isolate between now and 16 August. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted the government had to strike a balance between reopening the economy and curbing the spread of Covid-19. ""On the one hand we're being told that the restrictions are too onerous, and on the other we're being told that we're being too loose in terms of lifting those restrictions. And that's the balance, that's the nature of political judgment,"" he told Sky News. Staff at The Wall climbing centre in Cumbria Cumbrian climbing centre The Wall only has three staff and if they all had to isolate at the same time the business would have to shut, manager Joe Holden said. All staff are under 25 and none have had the jab, he added. ""It's hard enough to get enough people through the door, let alone keeping up with the rules changing every few weeks,"" he told the BBC. ""We'll have to take on more staff as a contingency option [in case we're forced to isolate] but training more people increases the workload and costs for us."" Another sector potentially at risk from a rise in self-isolation is beauty. Most businesses in the sector are small and only employ a few staff. They also rely heavily on younger workers. The staff of KH Hair Group in Leicester and Oadby Lesley Blair, boss of industry group Babtac, said self-isolation was ""incredibly disruptive"" and urged the government to give staff in the industry priority for second vaccinations ahead of 16 August. ""Alternatively ideally rules could be changed, subject to certain conditions, such as daily tests being done, to allow businesses to stay open and staff to work provided they tested negative each day."" However, Amanda Falls, owner of KH Hair Group in the East Midlands, said she ""welcomed"" the easing of self-isolation rules from August. Out of 26 staff across her two salons, 20 have been double jabbed and those that have not are under 20 years old. One fully vaccinated staff member had to self-isolate recently costing her about Â£2,000 in lost income. ""Businesses can't continue like this - if I got tracked and traced I'd be fuming because I'm double jabbed,"" she said. Do you run a business?

House prices dip as stamp duty holiday ends,"House prices dipped 0.5% in June as the stamp duty holiday began to be phased out, according to the Halifax. Prices rose 8.8% over the year, leaving average prices still more than Â£21,000 higher, following a broadly unprecedented period of gains. The lender said it was ""important to put such a moderate decrease in context."" The Government removed the need to pay stamp duty on certain properties throughout much of the pandemic. In the last year the housing market has been stimulated by stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, introduced by the government to boost the property market. From June 2020, buyers didn't have to pay any stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of their purchase price. However, at the start of this month, stamp duty breaks began to return to pre-pandemic levels. Now a 5% tax kicks in at Â£250,000 for properties up to Â£925,000. Rates on properties above that are higher. From October rates are due to return to normal which means the point homebuyers start paying stamp duty will revert back to Â£125,001. How much stamp duty will I have to pay now? Russell Galley, managing director of the Halifax, said: ""The power of homemovers to drive the market won't fade entirely as the economy recovers,."" He pointed out that people have been spurred on by increased time spent at home during the pandemic to still look to find properties with more space. ""Coupled with buyers chasing the relatively small number of available properties, and continued low borrowing rates, it's a trend which can sustain high average prices for some time to come,"" he said. The average price of a UK property according to the lender is now Â£260,358. Demand remains high among buyers searching for larger family homes with the average price of a detached property climbing faster than any other type over the past 12 months. These were up by more than 10% or almost Â£47,000 in cash terms. Detached homes now cost on average more than half a million pounds, Â£200,000 more expensive than the typical semi-detached house. However Mr Galley predicted that annual growth will slow more by the end of the year, with unemployment expected to edge higher as job support measures unwind, and the peak of buyer demand now likely to have passed. ""This may be the first sign house price growth is starting to run out of steam, but this slight cooling does not mean prices will come crashing back down to where they were last summer,"" said Lucy Pendleton of estate agents James Pendleton. She said some buyers are holding off marketing their property because they cannot see anywhere to move to: ""That creates a vicious cycle of low supply and consequently causing intense up-bidding on the most desirable properties."" North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said despite the beginning of the end to the stamp duty holiday there was still strength in the market: ""We don't expect this new balance between supply and demand to change much over the next few months, particularly if economic growth can make up for the ending of the furlough scheme.""

Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Boris Johnson has often said
he wants to put the debate about Brexit in the past, but when challenged by a
committee of MPs about the importance of telling the truth in politics he waded
straight back into an old debate. âIt is commonly asserted,â he
said, âthat when we put the figure of Â£350m on the side of a bus that that was
erroneous.â It was erroneous,as we explained at the time. The slogan on the bus said
âwe send the EU Â£350m a weekâ but this gross figure didnât account for the fact
that UKâs budget rebate was deducted before any money was sent to Brussels. In 2017, the chair of the UK
Statistics Authority Sir David Norgrove wrote to Mr Johnson. He said suggesting
an extra Â£350m would be available for public spending outside the EU was ""a
clear misuse of official statistics"". Boris Johnson says therecent agreementto delay a ban on imports of chilled meats from Great Britain into Northern Ireland has only given the UK a ""stay of execution"", and a long-term solution is needed. In response to questioning from Conservative MP Sir Bill Cash, the PM blames the EU's application of the protocol for creating ""anomalies"" at the border. Before the questions move to veteran Tory MP Sir Bill Cash on Brexit, Boris Johnson says ""I'm sure our viewers may be switching over to football."" ""I'm not sure we'll be able to compete much longer,"" he states. Kick off is at 8pm andyou can follow all the action on the BBC Sport live page here. The Protocol has faced mounting opposition from unionists in Northern Ireland Boris Johnson was asked about the impact of the Northern Ireland Protocol - the bit of the UK's Brexit divorce deal he agreed to prevent border posts between the UK and the Irish Republic. In order to do this, since January this year border checks have instead been imposed on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). In a bid to stem the disruption caused by the checks, the UK government has pushed back the agreed date for some checks which are yet to come in - leading to legal action from the EU. Recently, the two sides agreed to postpone a ban on chilled meat products going from GB to NI that was due to come into effect at the end of June - but a long-term solution is yet to be found. Read more. Mr Hoare says the Protocol is best applied when there is political trust between both parties, and businesses will always work within the rules applied to them. Johnson says ""what is needed now is good will and imagination, but there are some very serious problems"". He says it is a ""very difficult situation"" to see drugs, including cancer drugs, not being able to get to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Hoare asks what movement the UK government should make to ensure the Protocol can be applied easily. Boris Johnson says the ""UK is a faithful, obedient servant of the law,"" and that officials are ""obeying the EU jurisdiction"". He says the way the EU is implementing the Protocol is ""grossly disproportionate and unnecessary"". Conservative Chair of the Northern Ireland Committee, Simon Hoare, says there is ""nothing in the Northern Ireland Protocol"" which negatively affects the constitutional ""integrity of the United Kingdom"". He says there are some in Northern Ireland who believe the Protocol is a ""stepping stone"" in steps to reunification of Ireland. ""I'm a passionate unionist,"" Boris Johnson replies, he says the government wants to ""strengthen"" the union. ""There is absolutely no threat to Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom."" He says the protocol is ""being applied, currently, in a way which causes the anxieties to which you have referred"". Sir Elton John has described the government as ""philistines"" over its handling of the music industry post-Brexit Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says we used to export musicians and talent across the EU but that has been severely affected since Brexit. Did the PM raise the issue of a visa waiver scheme with Angela Merkel when she visited London recently? he asks. Germany is one of the better countries on this, the prime minister says. ""About 17 EU members are quite good and seven are not so good,"" he adds but ""we are working on it to sort it out"". The proposal for a total visa waiver scheme, however  is a complicated one, he says. And ""we don't want a gradual erosion of out freedom"" by giving up rights won as a result of Brexit, he says. Johnson says he appreciates ""how frustrating it is"" and says he hopes it will be ""speedily resolved"". Sir Elton Johnrecently warned MPs that the UK music industry could lose ""a generation of talent""because of post-Brexit restrictions on touring the EU. The musician accused ministers of being unwilling to fix a ""gaping hole"" in the current Brexit deal which means artists need costly visas to play in the bloc. There have been a further 32,548 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. It's the first time since 24 January that the daily figure has been more than 30,000. For context, there was an eight-week period in April and May when the daily figure never went above 4,000. And there have been another 33 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. The questioning now moves on to the impact of Brexit. Scottish committee chair and SNP MP Pete Wishart uses the opportunity to ask Boris Johnson what he ""really feels"" about devolution. Last year, the prime minister was criticised after reports that he told a virtual meeting of Tory MPs thatdevolution had been a ""disaster"" in Scotland. In reply, Mr Johnson says there have been ""disastrous aspects"" of the SNP's performance in government but praises the role of the UK government during the pandemic. The government plans for ending quarantine for fully vaccinated contacts of people with Covid have dominated the agenda today at Westminster. Ministers have confirmed double-jabbed close contacts will not have to isolate after 16 August in England, nearly a month after restrictions are due to ease 19 July. BBC analysis shows increasing infection rates mean more than 4.5 million people could be asked to self-isolate between now and then. That's led to warning from industry bodies about the impact on businesses, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warning it could lead to ""carnage"" for the economy. Read more. Helen CattPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson has been asked for a second time today for an estimate of the numbers of how many people may end up having to self-isolate because of rising cases. Again, he doesn't put a figure on it. Expect him to be asked this several more times in the near future. How many people get 'pinged' could be crucial for all sorts of areas in the coming weeks. Conservative MP and Women and Equalities Chair Caroline Nokes asks what specific initiatives ministers are doing to ""build back in a more feminine and more gender neutral way"". She is quoting a previous remark by Boris Johnson while hosting the G7 on 11 June - take a look at the tweet below. Boris Johnson says furlough has ""generally attracted more female recipients than male, so far, which I think is positive"". Caroline Nokes says this shows that women were more likely to be working in areas which were shut down. ""We want to make sure that we have female employment rising across the board,"" Johnson states. ""The gender pay gap is at a record low,"" he says, and there are ""1.19m more women in work than there were in 2010,"" he adds. Allow Twitter content?

Labour's Catherine McKinnell asks about education catch up funding per pupil and why is it only 19% of that which is spent in the US? The PM says he doesn't recognise that. We started with ""massive investment"", he says and there will ""be more to come"". Halfon asks the prime minister whether he backs the idea of a longer school day to help schoolchildren catch up. Boris Johnson says he thinks this is the ""right thing to do"" - but there remains a question mark over how this should be done, and the mix of classes and activities that could be used. He says the government is having a ""proper review"" of this area. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who chairs the education committee, asks Boris Johnson what he intends to do to get children into a position to take exams next year. The prime minister acknowledges children have lost an  ""unconscionable"" amount of teaching time because of disruption caused, but the government's ""catch-up"" plan will help. He saysplans to axeCovid bubble self-isolation rules will also help lower disruption. Labour MP and Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee Stephen Timms says it's been recommended the Â£20 top up to Universal Credit should be made permanent. Boris Johnson says the government is working to increase the national living wage for the lowest paid. The government is focusing on a ""jobs-led"" recovery from the pandemic, he adds. Mr Timms says the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has warned 500,000 people could be pushed below the poverty line if the UC increase - which is Â£20 per week - is stopped. Boris Johnson says the answer is to ""get people into work,"" and adds that job vacancies are back to pre-pandemic levels. BBC analysis shows more than 4.5 million people could be asked to self-isolate before 16 August. Read more about the analysis here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Boris Johnson says furlough has ""generally attracted more female recipients than male, so far, which I think is positive"". Caroline Nokes says this shows that women were more likely to be working in areas which were shut down. ""We want to make sure that we have female employment rising across the board,"" Johnson states. ""The gender pay gap is at a record low,"" he says, and there are ""1.19m more women in work than there were in 2010,"" he adds. Allow Twitter content?

Labour's Catherine McKinnell asks about education catch up funding per pupil and why is it only 19% of that which is spent in the US? The PM says he doesn't recognise that. We started with ""massive investment"", he says and there will ""be more to come"". Halfon asks the prime minister whether he backs the idea of a longer school day to help schoolchildren catch up. Boris Johnson says he thinks this is the ""right thing to do"" - but there remains a question mark over how this should be done, and the mix of classes and activities that could be used. He says the government is having a ""proper review"" of this area. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who chairs the education committee, asks Boris Johnson what he intends to do to get children into a position to take exams next year. The prime minister acknowledges children have lost an  ""unconscionable"" amount of teaching time because of disruption caused, but the government's ""catch-up"" plan will help. He saysplans to axeCovid bubble self-isolation rules will also help lower disruption. Labour MP and Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee Stephen Timms says it's been recommended the Â£20 top up to Universal Credit should be made permanent. Boris Johnson says the government is working to increase the national living wage for the lowest paid. The government is focusing on a ""jobs-led"" recovery from the pandemic, he adds. Mr Timms says the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has warned 500,000 people could be pushed below the poverty line if the UC increase - which is Â£20 per week - is stopped.

Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Boris Johnson has often said
he wants to put the debate about Brexit in the past, but when challenged by a
committee of MPs about the importance of telling the truth in politics he waded
straight back into an old debate. âIt is commonly asserted,â he
said, âthat when we put the figure of Â£350m on the side of a bus that that was
erroneous.â It was erroneous,as we explained at the time. The slogan on the bus said
âwe send the EU Â£350m a weekâ but this gross figure didnât account for the fact
that UKâs budget rebate was deducted before any money was sent to Brussels. In 2017, the chair of the UK
Statistics Authority Sir David Norgrove wrote to Mr Johnson. He said suggesting
an extra Â£350m would be available for public spending outside the EU was ""a
clear misuse of official statistics"". Boris Johnson says therecent agreementto delay a ban on imports of chilled meats from Great Britain into Northern Ireland has only given the UK a ""stay of execution"", and a long-term solution is needed. In response to questioning from Conservative MP Sir Bill Cash, the PM blames the EU's application of the protocol for creating ""anomalies"" at the border. Before the questions move to veteran Tory MP Sir Bill Cash on Brexit, Boris Johnson says ""I'm sure our viewers may be switching over to football."" ""I'm not sure we'll be able to compete much longer,"" he states. Kick off is at 8pm andyou can follow all the action on the BBC Sport live page here. The Protocol has faced mounting opposition from unionists in Northern Ireland Boris Johnson was asked about the impact of the Northern Ireland Protocol - the bit of the UK's Brexit divorce deal he agreed to prevent border posts between the UK and the Irish Republic. In order to do this, since January this year border checks have instead been imposed on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). In a bid to stem the disruption caused by the checks, the UK government has pushed back the agreed date for some checks which are yet to come in - leading to legal action from the EU. Recently, the two sides agreed to postpone a ban on chilled meat products going from GB to NI that was due to come into effect at the end of June - but a long-term solution is yet to be found. Read more. Mr Hoare says the Protocol is best applied when there is political trust between both parties, and businesses will always work within the rules applied to them. Johnson says ""what is needed now is good will and imagination, but there are some very serious problems"". He says it is a ""very difficult situation"" to see drugs, including cancer drugs, not being able to get to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Hoare asks what movement the UK government should make to ensure the Protocol can be applied easily. Boris Johnson says the ""UK is a faithful, obedient servant of the law,"" and that officials are ""obeying the EU jurisdiction"". He says the way the EU is implementing the Protocol is ""grossly disproportionate and unnecessary"". Conservative Chair of the Northern Ireland Committee, Simon Hoare, says there is ""nothing in the Northern Ireland Protocol"" which negatively affects the constitutional ""integrity of the United Kingdom"". He says there are some in Northern Ireland who believe the Protocol is a ""stepping stone"" in steps to reunification of Ireland. ""I'm a passionate unionist,"" Boris Johnson replies, he says the government wants to ""strengthen"" the union. ""There is absolutely no threat to Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom."" He says the protocol is ""being applied, currently, in a way which causes the anxieties to which you have referred"". Sir Elton John has described the government as ""philistines"" over its handling of the music industry post-Brexit Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin says we used to export musicians and talent across the EU but that has been severely affected since Brexit. Did the PM raise the issue of a visa waiver scheme with Angela Merkel when she visited London recently? he asks. Germany is one of the better countries on this, the prime minister says. ""About 17 EU members are quite good and seven are not so good,"" he adds but ""we are working on it to sort it out"". The proposal for a total visa waiver scheme, however  is a complicated one, he says. And ""we don't want a gradual erosion of out freedom"" by giving up rights won as a result of Brexit, he says. Johnson says he appreciates ""how frustrating it is"" and says he hopes it will be ""speedily resolved"". Sir Elton Johnrecently warned MPs that the UK music industry could lose ""a generation of talent""because of post-Brexit restrictions on touring the EU. The musician accused ministers of being unwilling to fix a ""gaping hole"" in the current Brexit deal which means artists need costly visas to play in the bloc. There have been a further 32,548 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. It's the first time since 24 January that the daily figure has been more than 30,000. For context, there was an eight-week period in April and May when the daily figure never went above 4,000. And there have been another 33 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. The questioning now moves on to the impact of Brexit. Scottish committee chair and SNP MP Pete Wishart uses the opportunity to ask Boris Johnson what he ""really feels"" about devolution. Last year, the prime minister was criticised after reports that he told a virtual meeting of Tory MPs thatdevolution had been a ""disaster"" in Scotland. In reply, Mr Johnson says there have been ""disastrous aspects"" of the SNP's performance in government but praises the role of the UK government during the pandemic. The government plans for ending quarantine for fully vaccinated contacts of people with Covid have dominated the agenda today at Westminster. Ministers have confirmed double-jabbed close contacts will not have to isolate after 16 August in England, nearly a month after restrictions are due to ease 19 July. BBC analysis shows increasing infection rates mean more than 4.5 million people could be asked to self-isolate between now and then. That's led to warning from industry bodies about the impact on businesses, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warning it could lead to ""carnage"" for the economy. Read more. Helen CattPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson has been asked for a second time today for an estimate of the numbers of how many people may end up having to self-isolate because of rising cases. Again, he doesn't put a figure on it. Expect him to be asked this several more times in the near future. How many people get 'pinged' could be crucial for all sorts of areas in the coming weeks.

"Widow cleared of sex charges calls for law changeLady Lavinia Nourse calls her two-week historical child sex abuse trial an ""absolute nightmare"".Suffolk","This video can not be played In her first broadcast interview, Lady Lavinia Nourse describes how she felt on trial. A former High Court judge's widow, who was cleared of historical sex abuse, has called for those accused to be granted anonymity until charged. Lady Lavinia Nourse, 77, of Newmarket in Suffolk,was cleared of 17 counts of sexually abusing a boyunder 12. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she said ""anonymity up to the point of charge"" would be a ""step forward"". She has also questioned ""why the complainant cannot be revealed after the case"". Lady Lavinia Nourse was married to Sir Martin Nourse, who died in 2017, aged 85 Lady Lavinia, who was married to Sir Martin Nourse, was accused of abuse by a man known to her two months after her 85-year-old husband died in 2017. Eighteen months later, she was charged with five counts of indecently assaulting a boy and 12 counts of indecency with a child in the 1980s. All charges related to the same complainant. A jury at Peterborough's Nightingale court cleared her of all charges.   Lady Lavinia said she felt the case would not have got to court if she ""hadn't had such a high profile husband"" - a suggestion denied by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). ""It was made in the same way as all of our cases - following detailed consideration of the evidence and in accordance with our legal test,"" a CPS spokesman said. Lady Lavinia said she was ""completely and utterly shocked"" when she was accused ""The accuser was very happy to let it be known widely in London, and in and around Newmarket, using his name, and freely admitting that this is what I had done,"" Lady Lavinia said. ""It was intolerable on top of everything else. I didn't know who was looking at me, where I could turn, I didn't know who I could trust."" Ex-High Court judge's widow cleared of sex abuse Ex-Tory minister gives evidence in abuse trial Accuser of ex-judge's widow 'carried shame' Lady Lavinia describes the two-week trial as ""hell"" and said she had ""never been so frightened, lonely, [and] utterly miserable"". ""There was a very high chance that if I was found guilty that I would go to jail and I just find it really frightening that people can tell lies that actually can send an innocent person to prison,"" she said. She added it was an ""absolute nightmare"" to have to sit and ""listen to all the ghastly things that were said about me"". Dame Mary Archer said in her evidence Lady Nourse was ""one of my closest friends"" Lady Lavinia said she now wanted to ""raise awareness of the question of anonymity up to the point of charge"". ""Everyone remains anonymous, that in itself would be a step forward,"" she said. ""I think it's less likely that in the immediate future, we will get anonymity after being charged. ""But I would like to ask the question, why can the complainant then not be revealed after the case?"" A government spokesman said: ""Current police guidance is clear there should, in general, be a right to anonymity before the point of charge - however there will be circumstances in which the public interest means that an arrested suspect should be named."" The Home Office said once a suspect has been charged, the principle of open justice means that they should be named. This was because experience has shown that naming those charged with serious sexual offences can sometimes encourage others to come forward and ensure justice was done, it added. The guidance said the current approach applied to all offences and struck a balance between the rights of suspects to privacy and the need to prevent and investigate crime.

Customers fed up with Covid excuse for bad service,"Customers are fed up with being told they are getting poor service ""because of Covid"", according to research. Firms are being accused of using the pandemic as an excuse for long waits on the telephone or late deliveries, the UK Institute of Customer Service said. It said that consumers were initially tolerant of delays and other issues as businesses fought to cope with the effects of the crisis. But it said a blanket excuse was no longer sufficient. NS&I 'must work hard to win back customers' Bid to make financial terms and conditions clearer The number of complaints about poor service in the last six months was at its highest level since 2009, according to the institute's survey of 10,000 people. The sectors with the biggest issues were transport, local public services - such as GP surgeries, councils and police services, and telecommunications, the survey suggested. A quarter of those asked said that some organisations had used Covid as an excuse for poor service. ""Saying 'because of Covid' is not a good phrase,"" said Jo Causon, the institute's chief executive. ""Organisations must not hide behind this blanket statement."" She said that many businesses had responded admirably to the difficulties created by the pandemic. She said that managed queuing systems, such as inviting people to call at quieter times, was one area of success. Others had gone out of their way to assist people during the crisis, she said. Delays in deliveries had also arisen owing to the container ship that blocked the Suez Canal in March, and border issues as a result of Brexit. Retailers needed to be honest with customers when they started looking at a particular product about any potential delays, she said, so they were aware of how long they might have to wait to inform their decision about what to buy. The new smart meter display gave a startling energy reading One energy customer was surprised to see that his new smart meter suggested he was using Â£45,000 worth of gas an hour. The 50-year-old from Gloucestershire said the meter displayed the extreme gas usage a day after it was fitted. While the meter was clearly not working properly, the customer said he was more frustrated that his energy company had not offered an explanation, nor sent him any kind of bill for four months. The problems occurred during lockdown. Covid was not used as an excuse, but he found that it seemed almost impossible to get an answer from anyone at the energy firm. ""There has been no resolution. I would like to know what I owe,"" he said. Citizens Advice has said many gas and electricity customers are still being plagued by inaccurate bills. The Institute of Customer Service said companies should provide ""honest, genuine communication at all stages"" to customers. Ms Causon said that satisfaction levels has risen slightly as firms had ultimately dealt with issues, but she said businesses needed to work on preventing the complaints in the first place. Many customers were willing to pay extra, she said, if they knew they would get better customer service. Bank First Direct, department store John Lewis, online retailer Amazon, and bike and vehicle company Suzuki topped the institute's table for customer satisfaction. The first three of these were the only brands in the top 10 which featured in the same survey a year ago.

Brewdog ad banned over misleading health claims,"The advertising watchdog agreed and banned this Instagram ad post The advertising watchdog, the ASA, has banned an advert by controversial brewer Brewdog for misleading claims. An Instagram post for its Clean & Press Hard Seltzer said: ""Due to advertising regulations we cannot claim this drink is healthy,"" but continued with a reference to a low calorie claim. Brewdog said the ad was ""tongue-in-cheek"" but agreed not to use it again. Brewdog was also reported to the ASA last week for claiming a competition prize was solid gold and worth Â£15,000. The Scottish firm had offered 10 people the chance to find a gold can hidden in a case of its beer. Several winners of the gold beer can prize contested Brewdog's claim about its value when they discovered it was merely gold plated. Brewdog in row over Â£15,000 gold can prize claim Brewdog boss vows to learn from savage criticism Brewdog said it stood by the valuation. Meanwhile, the Advertising Standards Authority continues to look into whether the competition breached any of its rules. The company's ad for its Clean & Press seltzer ran in January. It said: ""Even though Clean & Press is only 90 calories per can, with no carbs or sugar and a little bit of alcohol, this is not a health drink. If you are looking for a health drink, do not drink Clean & Press."" The ASA also challenged whether the ad used nutrition claims that were not permitted for alcoholic drinks and whether the phrase ""a little bit of alcohol"" implied that the drink was low alcohol despite the product having an alcoholic strength by volume (ABV) of 5%. The ASA said ""only 90 calories per can"" and ""no carbs or sugar"" were nutrition claims that were not permitted for alcoholic drinks, as was the implication that the product was beneficial to overall good health or health-related wellbeing. The ASA said consumers would understand the claim ""a little bit of alcohol"" to mean that the product was low alcohol when it had an ABV of 5%, finding that the ad breached the Advertising Code on this point also. A Brewdog spokesman said: ""We have accepted the ASA ruling and have removed the wording in question."" In separate rulings, the ASA also banned two Instagram posts by rival Drty Drinks for making misleading nutrition claims for an alcoholic drink and for encouraging excessive drinking and website posts by the High Water and Whisp Drinks firms for making misleading and non-permitted nutrition claims for alcoholic drinks. Brewdog cans and one of the not-so-solid gold beer can prizes Brewdog was founded in 2007 by boss James Watt and Martin Dickie. It has been attracting negative scrutiny in recent weeks aftera letter from ex-workers was posted on Twitter,externalwhich said a ""significant number"" of former staff had ""suffered mental illness as a result of working at Brewdog"". It made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns.

Big stars to play small shows as live music returns,"Rag 'n' Bone Man played three small, socially-distanced shows last week to test the waters Some of music's biggest stars will squeeze into the UK's smallest venues this summer, in an attempt to revive the grassroots music scene. Sir Tom Jones will play the 800-seat Cambridge Junction, while Rag 'n' Bone Man will entertain 250 fans in the Tunbridge Wells Forum. It comes after 18 months in the which the live music industry essentially shut down due to Covid-19. Sir Tom said supporting small, local venues ""makes all the difference"". ""Musicians can record in their bedrooms, but they can't learn to perform in public without a place to play,"" he added. Sir Tom Jones: 'I might be old but my voice is still young' Rag 'n' Bone Man on fame, tattoos and fatherhood Festivals 2021: Which ones are still going ahead? Other artists supporting the venture with one-off shows include Mahalia, James Arthur, Frank Turner, Sam Fender and Fontaines DC. Rag 'n' Bone Man has already tested the waters, playing three low-key, socially-distanced shows at London's Jazz CafÃ© last week. ""This has been very emotional,"" he told the audience on the closing night. ""I'm not going to get all soppy but not being able to do gigs for the last year-and-a-half feels like you're missing a testicle."" The ""Revive Live"" scheme been organised by the Music Venues Trust, in conjunction with the National Lottery - which is contributing Â£1 million to help up-and-coming artists pay for touring expenses, like crew and transport, that they may not have been able to afford after a year of inactivity. More than 20 tours will be staged with this money, featuring the likes of Olivia Dean, Twin Atlantic, The Magic Gang and The Futureheads at venues across the UK. Up to 30,000 tickets - about half of those available - will be gifted to National Lottery players. Soul singer Mahalia will also take part in the Revive Live scheme Radio 2's Jo Whiley, who is an ambassador for the scheme, said it would kick-start the return of live music. ""I'm sure many people have missed the experience of live music over the course of the lockdown, myself included. I can't wait to go to see these amazing musicians on stage again!"" The announcement comes two days afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson said he expected to lift the remaining lockdown restrictionsin England on 19 July - meaning the end to capacity limits on gigs, and the reopening of nightclubs. However, more than half of this summer's festivals have already been cancelled - with major events like Glastonbury and BST Hyde Park postponing until next year. According to the Music Venue Trust, 83% of concert halls have faced closure over the last year. In a survey, its members suggested they would emerge from lockdown with a collective debt of Â£45 million. The government says it has helped support more than 800 music organisations with grants from its Culture Recovery Fund over the last year. Trade paper Music Week has also suggested the government is likely announce an insurance scheme for the summer's remaining festivals in the coming week. Event organisers and venue owners have been calling for such a scheme since the start of the year, saying it is the only way they can plan events without the fear of going bankrupt if a new wave of infections forces them to cancel.

Covid postpones Europe's biggest agricultural show,"The Royal Welsh Show was set to be held in July 2021 in Llanelwedd in Powys The 2021 edition of Europe's biggest agricultural event has been postponed because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, organisers have confirmed. The annual Royal Welsh Show, held at Llanelwedd, near Builth Wells in Powys, usually attracts about 250,000 people from 40 different countries. The Royal Welsh board said it decided to cancel July's event after holding discussions with the Welsh Government. It follows the decision to holdthe 2020 Royal Welsh Show virtually. The show began as the Welsh National Agricultural Society show in 1904 with just a few hundred animals. After moving to its current permanent home just outside Builth Wells since 1963, the show now attracts 1,000 stands and 8,000 animals. Royal Welsh Show taking show online due to Covid Royal Welsh 'could take five years to recover' The Royal Welsh Agricultural Society also announced the cancelled May's Smallholding and Countryside Festival and the postponed Clwyd's Feature County Year until 2022. ""It is with the regret that the decision has been made to cancel this year's Smallholding and Countryside Festival and to postpone the Royal Welsh Show,"" said board chairman John T Davies. This video can not be played Impressive figures as the Royal Welsh turns 100 He added that the society is exploring the option of hosting smaller Covid-compliant events over the summer and hopes to host a winter fair. Chief executive Steve Hughson said they will continue to work alongside the Welsh Government and Public Health Wales to ""create a road map for the safe re-opening of events"". ""Our events are central to the rural economy and way of life and mean so much to members, exhibitors, traders and visitors,"" he said.

England v Denmark (20:00 BST) For 18-year-oldJude Bellingham, success has been on the cards. since his early teens. Mike Dodds, head of Birmingham City's academy, told the BBC: ""I was there for his first session as a
7-year-old. I think he had a Argentina or Barcelona top on. He was no different
to others at that age. ""If anyone had said then he was going to be Euro
semi-finals at 18 I would have laughed but by the time he was 13 you knew he
was going to be special. ""He had interest at 12/13 from all over England.
Then by 14/15 half of Europe was watching him at our youth games at the
training ground. ""It's difficult to watch the games because I have
seen him do ridiculous things for so long but I am probably his biggest critic. As
good as he is, I'll be like 'yeah, but he could have done this', but then I
remember he's only 18 and would have just done his A- Levels. I am also his
biggest fan. ""His mindset won't be just to see Euro 2020 as
experience, he'll want to play every minute of every game."" England v Denmark (20:00 BST) Chris WaddleEx-England winger on BBC Radio 4 Former England wingerChris Waddlesays that Denmark seem to be on a mission now. ""You've got to give Denmark a lot of respect. The first two games they lost, everybody thought it's not meant to be. Obviously the scenes we saw with Christian Eriksen weren't pretty and they've seemed to have just got together as if they're on a mission now. ""They play with so much energy and so much passion for their country and the shirt with the fans right behind them. Since those first two games they've arguably been one of the best teams in the tournament."" The Danes have been travelling a fair bit for their games. Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Baku, and now Wembley but Waddle doesn't feel it will have an impact. ""They get good recovery now. They've got everything you can think of which can help them improve over the days after a match to recover. They are a very dangerous side who probably built their game on the English system many years ago and that is why I think we always find it difficult when we play these types of teams.""

If you want to follow developments from Wembley as England play Denmark for a place in the final of Euro 2020you can see updates from our colleagues at BBC Sport here. But your coronavirus news has been brought to you today by Emma Harrison, Katie Wright, Sophie Williams, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and James Clarke.  Wembley should see its biggest crowd since before the pandemic this evening We are going to be bringing our live coverage of coronavirus to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: House prices in the UKdipped 0.5% in June as the stamp duty holiday began to be phased out,according to Halifax. Prices rose 8.8% over the year, leaving average prices still more than Â£21,000 higher, following a broadly unprecedented period of gains. The average price of a UK property is now Â£260,358, but the lender says it is ""important to put such a moderate decrease in context"". The government removed the need to pay stamp duty on certain properties throughout much of the pandemic. In the last year the housing market has been stimulated by stamp duty holidays in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, introduced by the government to boost the property market. From June 2020, buyers didn't have to pay any stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of their purchase price. However, at the start of this month, stamp duty breaks began to return to pre-pandemic levels.

Read more The Scottish government has not yet decided whether to follow England in changing the self-isolation rules for school pupils and people who have been double vaccinated. Scotland's education secretary says the government is ""looking very seriously"" at whether it can make changes. Shirley-Anne Somerville says decisions will be taken ""as soon as we can"" but any decision will be based on the clinical advice and guidance the government is given. There have been calls for the Scottish government to introduce similar changes, after thousands of pupils missed out on learning due to having to self-isolate. Somerville tells the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme the absence rates in Scottish schools was about 4% at the end of the school term. But only 3% of those actually had Covid - with the vast majority of absent pupils only being off school because they had to self-isolate after someone else tested positive. Read more here. As we mentioned earlier, two British and Irish lions
players are isolating after one of the rugby squad's management team tested positive for
Covid during their tour of South Africa. This evening's game against Cell C Sharks is scheduled to go ahead, with kick-off at 19.00 BST - you canfollow the action hereif you wish to. Two members of staff are also isolating at the team
hotel and a Lions statement says all members of the touring party âhave since
been testedâ, adding further updates will âfollow in due courseâ. The Lions â who have been playing and training in a
strict coronavirus bubble â arrived as South Africa was battling a third wave
of infections, with the South African team having to isolate twice in the past
two weeks. You can read more here The World Health Organisation (WHO) is warning countries against lifting restrictions
too quickly. Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHOâs emergencies programme urges
caution and says there has been a 33% increase in cases in the European region
in the past week. âThis is not a flat curve, this is an increasing curve,â
he says. âMaking assumptions that transmissions will not increase because weâre
opening up because of a vaccine is a false assumption. âTransmission will increase when you open up because,
number one, we donât have any vaccines in everybody and, number two, the
vaccine coverage rates are lower and weâre not still sure to what extent
vaccination protects the ability to be infected.â He adds increased transmission in the community puts
the most vulnerable at risk. It comes as the UK prepares to lift restrictions,
including a limit on indoor meetings and the wearing of masks. It comes as the UK prepares to relax restrictions The government istemporarily extending lorry drivers' hours from Monday- because the haulage industry is reporting trouble recruiting enough staff. It means drivers and operators can make slightly longer journeys, says  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who acknowledges there is a shortage of drivers. The Road Haulage Association says there is currently a shortfall of about 60,000 lorry drivers though - and the new move is just a ""sticking plaster"" over the problem. It estimates about 30,000 HGV driving tests did not happen last year because of the pandemic. The haulage industry is just one of the sectors having problems finding staff as the economy reopens. Businesses and unions have warned if there are not enough drivers, there could be knock-on effects including on deliveries to supermarkets. The planned dates for easing coronavirus restrictions in Scotland are ""not set in stone"", Nicola Sturgeon says. The first minister tells the BBC it would not be responsible to have a guaranteed timetable in the face of the virus, after another day of high case numbers. Scotland is due to move to level zero on 19 July, before dropping almost all restrictions on 9 August. However, Sturgeon says she will look very carefully at the latest data before confirming this will happen. This video can not be played Covid: Restriction easing dates 'not set in stone', say FM The NHS Covid tracing app has been downloaded more than 25 million times since its launch. But are people now deleting it - or switching off the contact tracing service - in order to avoid being told to isolate? In fact, usage is at an all-time high, says an adviser to NHS Test and Trace. ""About 50% of all, overall test results, nationally go through the app,"" Prof Christophe Fraser from Oxford University's Nuffield Department of Medicine tells Times Radio. ""The team monitors the usage of the app, and at this point in time the usage of the app is at an all-time high."" Asked about the implications of potentially 100,000 people testing positive every day, he says: ""It would result in a large amount of people being traced, which of course slows down the rate of infection and limits the stress on the NHS in terms of hospital admissions."" World Health Organisation (WHO) Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says the global Covid death toll has now reached four million. He warned on Wednesday the world is at a ""perilous point"" in the pandemic and hit out at a ""shocking inequality"" in global access to vaccines. The WHO chief says the pandemic's true death toll is likely to be much higher. ""At this stage in the pandemic, the fact that millions of health and care workers have not been vaccinated is abhorrent,"" he says during a press conference. ""From a moral, epidemiological or economic point view, now is the time for the world to come together to tackle this pandemic collectively,"" he adds.  Anyone travelling on public transport should continue to wear a mask even if they are no longer required legally, Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon says. Masks willno longer be required in England from 19 Julyunder a plan to end Covid-19 restrictions. Stormont ministers will decide the next steps for Northern Ireland on Thursday. Mallon says she has not seen any evidence to support ending the mandatory use of masks. ""The data tells us it acts as a mitigation against the virus but it also gives passengers confidence to come back on to our public transport network,"" she tells BBC News NI. ""To date I haven't seen any evidence that would warrant the immediate removal of face coverings from public transport and bars and restaurants."" Read more here India recorded more than 1,000 deaths on Wednesday As we mentioned earlier, Indonesia is
currently grappling with a spike in cases and deaths. The country has recorded 1,040 deaths today and 34,379 cases, both new record highs. Australia has announced
it is sending 2.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine as well as medical
supplies. The aid package, which includes a
thousand ventilators, oxygen cylinders, concentrators and antigen tests, was in
response to an international appeal by Indonesia. The recent surge there is believed to have
been fuelled by the more infectious Delta variant. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent More than 32,500 new Covid cases have been confirmed in the
UK â the highest daily total since late January. It represents an increase from 28,700 on Tuesday. It is not
unusual for there to be a big jump on a Wednesday as a result of a weekend
effect â slightly less testing is done. Whatâs important is the trend. Week on week this represents
a 43% rise. That is actually down on what has been seen recently. Cases are
going up quickly, but not as quickly as last week. Itâs too early to say whether that is part of a longer-term
pattern. But what is certain is that government officials are watching this
data like hawks. The policy of opening up in England is based on the hope the virus will soon hit the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination
programme and natural infection. Ministers have said we should be prepared to see 100,000
cases a day. But they are hoping this wave of infection peaks well before that. Mr Bettel tested positive not long after attending an EU summit in Brussels Luxembourgâs Prime Minister Xavier Bettel will remain in
hospital under medical observation until at least tomorrow, officials say. Bettel tested positive for the virus at the end of
June and had been self-isolating until he was admitted to hospital on Monday. Officials say the prime minister is getting better. Bettel contracted Covid last month not long after
attending an EU summit in Brussels. It was also attended by French President
Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders.
However none of the EU leaders were considered close contacts, AFP news agency
reports. Labour's Catherine McKinnell has asked the PM for the data on the impact when all covid restrictions in England are lifted, likely to be on 19 July. She says cases are ""sky rocketing"" and nurseries are having to limit numbers to maintain legal ratios of staff to children. The PM says: ""We have to make sure we use the tools we have in terms of isolation to get through this particular phase, it won't last long."" She says businesses are having to close because of staff having to self-isolate. The PM says: ""Thanks to the vaccine rollout we were able to get to step 3 and we have a review on 12 July but it looks as though we will get through to step 4 which will allow them to open up fully without the need for the one metre rule."" McKinnell pushes the PM to share the data on what impact lifting restrictions will have on coronavirus cases, hospitalisations and deaths. He says: ""We have data on hospitalisations and deaths and we have data for predictions for where they might go. They're available, you can look at them but they're speculative at the moment."" He says we are in ""about the middle to low of projections"" scientists have made for the third wave if ""all the openings"" go ahead. Labour's Catherine McKinnell asks about education catch up funding per pupil and why it's only 19% of that spent in the US. The PM says he doesn't recognise that. We started with ""massive investment"", he says and there will ""be more to come"". A bit more now on the daily coronavirus figures from the UK, which we've been bringing you during the past hour. In the past seven days, there have been 192,902 cases - that is a rise of 57,828 from the previous week, up by just under 43%. And deaths have risen by a similar rate - up 42.4% in a week. There has been a total of 161 deaths recorded, which is an increase of 48 from the previous week. Bernard Jenkin MP asks the PM to ""spare a thought for the teachers because the health service gets all the limelight but teachers and support staff have taken a hell of a burden"". Boris Johnson says: ""They've done an incredible job, you go to some schools and you see the challenge they have."" Jenkin responds: ""Could you ask your education secretary to make sure they get a break this summer from initiatives from his department, which have very often been contradictory and they've had to respond fast in the pandemic of course - but they long for a period of stability and predicability."" The PM says: ""I will do everything I can."" Robert Halfon MP tells the liaison committee that 640,000 pupils were sent home from school because of positive cases in their classrooms this week. He says there are 93,500 ""ghost children"" who haven't returned to school since 8 March. There are ""exam orphans"" who are missing one in four days of face-to-face teaching, Halfon says. He asks the PM for his long-term plan to address the endemic pupil absence and establish a level playing field for children to begin sitting exams again. The PM says: ""What's happened over the last 18 months has been really dehabilitating for many children... we must make it better... it's the single most important investment we can make."" He says in addition to the Â£40m already pledged to education there is a Â£3bn catch up plan before anything the chancellor may do later this year. ""I think the thing that works and that parents, teachers and pupils respond to is more direct on-to-one or one-to-two tutoring,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Pick your England XI to face Denmark,"The final starting XI chosen by BBC Sport users - but who will Gareth Southgate go for? We asked you who should start for England in their Euro 2020 semi-final match against Denmark- and the majority of you think Gareth Southgate should stick with the same XI he picked against Ukraine. Having yet to concede a goal in the tournament, it comes as no surprise that goalkeeperJordan Pickfordwas the most selected player overall. Harry MaguireandJohn Stonesremain your preferred partnership in front of Pickford. After his goal against Ukraine, Maguire is the second most selected player overall, while Stones is fourth. NowHarry Kaneis up and running with three goals, the England captain has been entrusted by you to lead the line again. Kane - who earned star of the match honours against Ukraine - is the third-most picked player overall. The front three are completed byRaheem Sterling, who is the most selected player on the left side of attack, andJadon Sanchowho is the top choice to start on the right. WhileJack Grealishwas a popular choice, the Aston Villa captain's picks were split between a host of midfield and forward roles, so he just misses out. You can still choose your England XI but your selections will not be counted towards the result. Don't forget to share your picks on social media using #bbcfootball.
