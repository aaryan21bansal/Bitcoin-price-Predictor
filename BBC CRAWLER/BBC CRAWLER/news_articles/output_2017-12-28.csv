When sports stars make a run at politics,"George Weah was a top footballer, before turning his hand to politics One of Africa's all-time greatest footballers is set to clinch a new title - president of the west African nation of Liberia, his native country. George Weah rose from humble beginnings in a slum to play for some of Europe's best teams, garnering an array of footballing accolades along the way. He then turned his sights on politics and, after a number of failed attempts, won elected office as senator in 2014. He is nowgearing up to take over the top job. Profile: Who is George Weah? Not many former sports stars have made it as far as Mr Weah, but it's not uncommon to see them joining the political fray - often assisted by an established public presence and, perhaps, by the ambition and drive that helped them succeed in the sporting arena. Here is a handful of examples from around the world. One of the first to spring to mind may beImran Khan, who enjoyed an illustrious career playing for Pakistan's national cricket team between 1976 and 1992, and leading it to its only World Cup victory in 1992. He then took to philanthropy and politics, launching his own political party in 1996. He first won a seat in the National Assembly in 2002 and his party was established as a serious political force in 2013 elections. Imran Khan founded a leading opposition force in Pakistan after setting down his cricket bat Among the best-known examples in the US isJesse ""The Body"" Ventura, a Navy Seal and Vietnam veteran who shot to fame as a wrestler and commentator in the 1970s and 1980s. He went on to become a city mayor in Minnesota before creating a political shockwave in 1998 when he unexpectedly defeated both Republican and Democratic candidates to become state governor. Arnold Schwarzeneggerexperienced his first success as a bodybuilder in his native Austria, before he moved into roles in action films. He won Mr Universe at 20 and went on to win the Mr Olympia title seven times, and remains the best-known name in the industry. He served as Californian governor from 2003 to 2011. In American football,Jack Kempwas a 1960s star quarterback who went on to serve in Congress for 18 years as a Republican and became a conservative hero to the Reagan wing of the party. Jack Kemp (R) ran a serious campaign for the vice-presidency with presidential candidate Bob Dole in 1996 He made unsuccessful attempts to run for both the presidency and vice-presidency but did serve as housing secretary in the cabinet of George Bush Senior. On the Democrats' side, the best-known example may beBill Bradley, star basketball player with the New York Knicks who went on to become senator for New Jersey for 18 years. Politicians have also emerged from Brazilian football. RomÃ¡riowas Fifa's World Player of the Year in 1994 but also earned an image as a bad boy. His reinvention as a politician came with the birth of his sixth child, who had Down's Syndrome - first as a disability campaigner, then as elected congressman. He remains in office today. SÃ³cratesplayed football for Brazilian clubs and its national side for more than a decade from 1974, earning 60 caps for Brazil and captaining the much-admired (though ultimately losing) national squad for the 1982 Fifa World Cup. Socrates' intellectualism and political activism earned him the nickname ""The doctor of the ball"" Unusually for a footballer, he also earned a degree in medicine and was known for his outspoken political views and intellectualism, earning him the sobriquet Doctor SÃ³crates. SÃ³crates did not seek elected office but his influence extended far beyond the football pitch when he co-founded the Corinthians Democracy movement in opposition to the military government and publicly demanded direct presidential elections. Athletes are fairly well-represented in politics, including some of the few women to have made the switch. In the UK, Sebastian (now Lord) Coe went from leading track-and-field athlete to Conservative politician and life peer in the House of Lords, while former Liberal Democrat leaderMenzies Campbellwas once known as ""the fastest white man on the planet"" and held the British 100m record. Tanni Grey-Thompsonwon 16 medals as a Paralympian and her activism within sport also saw her appointed a life peer in 2010. MexicanAna Gabriela Guevarais a 400m runner-turned-senator, while Kenyan long-distance runnerWesley Korir- winner of the 2012 Boston Marathon - is now a member of parliament. Boxer Manny Pacquiao from the Philippines is now packing a punch in politics Boxing has also packed a punch in the world of politics. In the Philippines, legendary fighterManny Pacquiaofirst won election to congress in 2010 and is a senator today, while in Ukraine three-time world heavyweight championVitali Klitschkois mayor of Kiev.

George Weah elected Liberian president,"This video can not be played George Weah's supporters celebrate in Monrovia Former football star George Weah has been elected as Liberia's president. With nearly all ballots from Tuesday's run-off vote counted, Mr Weah is well ahead of opponent Joseph Boakai with more than 60% of the vote. As news of Mr Weah's victory emerged, his supporters began celebrating in the capital Monrovia. He will succeed Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female president, in Liberia's first democratic handover in decades. ""My fellow Liberians, I deeply feel the emotion of all the nation,"" Mr Weah wrote on Twitter,externalafter the results were announced. ""I measure the importance and the responsibility of the immense task which I embrace today. Change is on."" Mr Boakai has conceded victory and phoned Mr Weah to congratulate him. Mr Weah, who was raised in a slum in Liberia's capital Monrovia, starred at top-flight European football clubs Paris St-Germain (PSG) and AC Milan, before ending his career in England with brief stays at Chelsea and Manchester City. He is the only African footballer to have won both Fifa World Player of the Year and the prestigious Ballon D'Or. How a footballer became president When sports stars make a run at politics He entered politics after his retirement from the game in 2002 and is currently a senator in Liberia's parliament.

Liberia, founded by freed US slaves in the 19th Century, has not had a smooth transfer of power from one elected president to another since 1944. George Weah won the first round of the election - but not by enough to avoid a run-off vote Mrs Sirleaf defeated Mr Weah in the presidential election run-off in 2005 and took office a year later, after the end of a brutal civil war that saw President Charles Taylor forced out by rebels. Taylor is now serving a 50-year prison sentence in the UK for war crimes related to the conflict in neighbouring Sierra Leone. This time Mr Weah's campaign - under the Coalition for Democratic Change banner - appealed to the youth vote, while incumbent Vice-President Boakai was seen as old and out of touch. But Mr Weah's election is not without controversy, as his running mate was Jewel Taylor, former wife of the jailed president. At the scene: Umaru Fofana, BBC News, Monrovia Hundreds of jubilant supporters of George Weah took to the streets shortly after the electoral commission chairman announced the result. Election observers, both domestic and foreign, have praised the conduct of the election and say it showed a marked improvement from the first round in October. This is third time lucky for a man used to winning trophies but who found it hard to win this, the biggest award of his life. And he has his work cut out for him. Liberia has stabilised in the past decade after a long and bloody civil war. But it is still struggling with acute poverty and corruption. From producing Africa's first elected female president, now it has produced its first ex-footballer head of state. Mr Weah, 51, won the first round of the presidential election in October with 38.4% of the vote, compared with the 28.8% won by second-placed Mr Boakai, 73. The failure of any candidate to secure an outright majority forced the run-off. The National Elections Commission (NEC) said on Thursday that with 98.1% of the run-off vote counted, Mr Weah had won 61.5% of the vote while Mr Boakai was far behind with 38.5%. Turnout was low - put at 56% by election officials - for the vote, which had been delayed from its initial date, 7 November, following a legal challenge brought by a representative for the opposition Liberty Party, Charles Brumskine. Mr Brumskine said the first round vote - which he came third in - had been marred by ""massive fraud and irregularities"", but in December the Supreme Court ruled evidence of fraud was insufficient to merit a re-run of the opening round. Election observers have praised the conduct of the poll. More than two million people were eligible to cast their ballots in the nation of 4.6 million people.

Kabul suicide bomb attack kills dozens,"This video can not be played ""My face was burning"", one man told reporters At least 41 people have been killed and more than 80 wounded in a suicide bomb attack in the Afghan capital, Kabul. A Shia cultural organisation was the target but the Afghan Voice news agency was also hit. So-called Islamic State said it was behind the attack. The interior ministry told the BBC an explosion at the Shia centre was followed by at least two more blasts. IS has been behind a number of attacks on Shia targets across the country in recent months. Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new ""Great Game"" IS in Afghanistan: How successful has the group been? The main blast went off inside the Tabayan cultural centre, but offices of Afghan Voice are also at the location of the attack. Dust blows down a street after one of the explosions Students were among those who had gathered at the Shia centre for a discussion forum. The interior ministry said the event was to mark the 38th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The initial explosion was followed by at least two others, although the ministry said these did not cause any fatalities. The health ministry's latest figures say 41 people died and 84 were hurt, with women and children among the casualties. Student Mohammad Hasan Rezayee told Tolo News: ""We were inside the hall in the second row when an explosion from behind took place. After the blast there was fire and smoke inside the building and everyone was pleading for help."" Another witness, Sayed Jan, told reporters from his hospital bed: ""There was a book reading event and academic discussion, and I was one of the participants. During the speech a huge bang was heard and smoke rose from inside the hall. ""My face was burning. I fell down from the chair and I saw the other colleagues around me on the ground. The smoke was everywhere."" Sayed Abbas Hussaini, a journalist at Afghan Voice, told Reuters that one reporter at the agency had been killed and two wounded. Distraught relatives gathered at local hospitals, which are treating the dozens of wounded people. The Islamic State group said on its propaganda outlet Amaq that it had targeted the Shia centre with a suicide bomber and other bombs. The Taliban had earlier issued a statement saying they were not involved. The Taliban are not known to specifically target Shias, although both militant groups have carried out frequent attacks across the country. Analysis: Zia Shahreyar, BBC Persian, Kabul In recent months IS has attacked many Shia targets in the west of Kabul, where the majority of the city's Shia population live. The Tabayan centre also has offices in the Iranian cities of Tehran and Mashhad and is believed to have close ties with religious and cultural centres in Iran. There are growing fears that IS is trying to spark a Sunni-Shia sectarian war in Afghanistan and the Shia community is increasingly dissatisfied with President Ashraf Ghani's government for failing to protect them. US-led foreign forces meanwhile continue to engage IS in eastern Afghanistan and President Trump, in his new Afghan strategy, has pledged to root out IS in the country, as it has been in Iraq and Syria. IS announced the establishment of its ""Khorasan"" branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015. It initially gained ground in the east and north, although it has lost territory there and was largely eliminated from southern and western Afghanistan by the Taliban and operations conducted by Afghan and US/Nato forces. Afghan security forces have been battling IS fighters, but the group has survived the onslaught IS has since resorted mainly to guerrilla tactics and is estimated to have a force of between  1,000 and 5,000 fighters. IS considers Shia apostates and aims to turn the conflict in Afghanistan into a sectarian war between Sunnis and Shias. In October, at least 39 people were killed in an attack on a mosque belonging to the Shia minority. In April, the US said it haddropped the ""Mother of All Bombs"" on IS in eastern Afghanistan, but the group continues its attacks. President Ashraf Ghani's spokesman issued a statement describing the latest attack as an ""unpardonable"" crime against humanity. Amnesty International's South Asia director, Biraj Patnaik, said: ""This gruesome attack underscores the dangers faced by Afghan civilians. In one of the deadliest years on record, journalists and other civilians continue to be ruthlessly targeted by armed groups."" Nato's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan called the attack ""heinous"". It is unclear whether Afghan Voice was a specific part of the target, but it has been a difficult year for the media. Afghanistan remains one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists and media workers. In November, IS said it was behinda gun attack on the Shamshad TV station that killed one staff member. In May, two media workers, including a BBC driver, were killed in a massive bomb attack in Kabul. The first six months of 2017 saw a surge in violence against journalists, with local monitorthe Afghan Journalists Safety Committee,externalrecording 73 cases, an increase of 35% in comparison to the same period in 2016. Last year seven members of staff from the private Tolo television station were killed in a Taliban suicide bombing in Kabul. Who has troops in Afghanistan?

Can Afghan military turn tide?,"James Mattis flew in as Afghanistan's two top military leaders stood down US Defence Secretary James Mattis was filmed beside an open cargo door as he flew in to Kabul on Monday.  It was a glamorous image, but he could scarcely have flown into the country on a less auspicious day. In the morning both Defence Minister Abudullah Habibi and the Army Chief of Staff Qadam Shah Shahim had handed in their resignations in the wake of the Taliban attack on an army base outside Mazar-e Sharif on Friday.  It was the deadliest single attack on a military installation in the entire 16-year history of the Afghan conflict. When I was shown around the base the message was that although mistakes were made, the Taliban subterfuge had been particularly thorough. The Taliban fighters arrived in Ford Ranger trucks painted in a perfect facsimile of Afghan army vehicles.  They had full uniforms and plausible paperwork; one of the team was disguised as a casualty complete with a bloodied bandage around his head and an IV drip in his arm. This video can not be played 'The walls are pocked with gunshot fire' - Justin Rowlatt visits the site of the attack in Mazar-e Sharif But even this elaborate ruse should not have resulted in the carnage that ensued. The 10 Taliban attackers are believed to have killed around 170 Afghan soldiers. It was a major blow to morale in the military, but also in the country at large. No surprise then that the two top-level resignations were just the beginning of a unprecedented shake-up of the military hierarchy.  Four corps commanders - including Major Katawazai who was in charge of the base that was attacked - were suspended.  Meanwhile a further eight military personnel are being investigated, allegedly on suspicion that the Taliban attackers had help from inside the base. It leaves the Afghan military rudderless at a particularly dangerous time.  The Taliban now control more than a third of the country and traditionally there is an upsurge in violence as Afghanistan's bitter winter comes to an end: the so-called ""fighting season"". Officially the spring offensive has not started yet this year. Nevertheless last month the Taliban retook the key district of Sangin in the southern Afghan province of Helmand; a significant strategic advance. Insurgents targeted Afghan troops leaving Friday prayers at the mosque at the base in Mazar-e Sharif Damage to the base canteen shows the ferocity of the attack Public statements about the US mission have increasingly focused on the effort to tackle IS and other international terrorist organisations in Afghanistan. But the truth is the US recognises that the main threat to the Afghan government comes from the Taliban, and so the overwhelming focus of American involvement here remains anti-Taliban. Taliban successes in the almost two and a half years since the Nato combat mission in Afghanistan officially ended have led senior Afghan officials and American top brass here to argue that the US needs to boost its training and assistance mission.  The suggestion is a few thousand more troops are needed. That will certainly have been on the agenda of Defence Secretary Mattis as he met the Afghan president and other senior figures to discuss the Trump administration's evolving strategy here. Snipers and green tea on Helmand's frontline Horror at Kabul's military hospital Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' But many military analysts doubt that this will be enough to turn the tide.  Last year a record number of Afghan forces were killed - 6,800 in total.  That is three times the losses of American forces during the entire 16 years of this conflict. And many thousands more Afghan military personnel were either invalided out of service or simply deserted. It emphasises once again the key problems the Afghan forces face: inadequate training and a lack of commitment from recruits, exacerbated by terrible conditions, corruption in the officer class and poor air support. Today the office of the chief executive of Afghanistan, Abdullah Abudullah, announced a new defence minister had been appointed.  He was named as Tariq Shah Bahrani. Whether his appointment will be endorsed by parliament is another matter.  The National Unity government rarely lives up to its name.  During the almost three years it has held power it has been marked by deep divisions and open disagreements. With the army in turmoil, unity at the top levels of government is needed if a successful push back against Taliban advances is to be achieved.  Whether the current administration will be able to deliver that is another matter.

Snow-lovers' cars block mountain road,"Police tweeted a message to people on the Preseli Hills urging them not to block roads while they ""enjoy the snow fun"" Police officers were called to a mountain pass after snow-lovers caused traffic problems by parking illegally. More than 100 cars were parked at the side of the road by people enjoying snow on the Preseli Hills near Brynberian, Pembrokeshire. Dyfed-Powys officers spent two hours rounding up motorists and asking them to move their vehicles. A public car park off the B4329 road has space for about 30 vehicles but was full. A Dyfed-Powys Police spokeswoman said: ""Officers managed to move the bulk of the vehicles. ""There were more than 100 cars parked up and they were causing a problem.""

Is IS succeeding in Afghanistan?,"IS's Afghanistan chief Hafiz Saeed Khan was killed in a US air strike in July last year Amid a rise in attacks in Afghanistan attributed to the so-called Islamic State (IS), the BBC's Dawood Azami examines what kind of threat the militant group poses in the conflict-hit nation and the wider region. IS announced the establishment of its Khorasan branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015. It was the first time that IS had officially spread outside the Arab world. Within a few weeks, the group appeared in at least five Afghan provinces, including Helmand, Zabul, Farah, Logar and Nangarhar, trying to establishpockets of territory from which to expand. It was the first major militant group to directly challenge the Afghan Taliban's dominance over the local insurgency. Its first aim was to drive Afghan Taliban fighters out of the area and it also hoped to evict Taliban ally al-Qaeda from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, or absorb its fighters. Yet despite efforts to energise battle-weary militants, IS struggled to build a wide political base and the indigenous support it expected in Afghanistan. Instead, it made enemies of almost everyone, including the Afghan Taliban. In the first half of 2015, IS managed to capture large chunks of territory in eastern Nangarhar province. This became the de facto ""capital"" principally for two reasons - its proximity to the tribal areas of Pakistan, home of IS Khorasan's top leaders, and the presence of some people who follow a similar Salafi/Wahhabi interpretation of Islam to IS. IS is also trying to get a foothold in northern Afghanistan, where it aims to link up with Central Asian, Chechen and Chinese Uighur militants. But it has largely been eliminated from southern and western Afghanistan by the Afghan Taliban and military operations conducted by Afghan and US/Nato forces. Six Red Cross workers were killed earlier this month in northern Afghanistan by suspected IS militants It has also lost territory in eastern Afghanistan in recent months. But it still has control over some parts of Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, where it plans attacks and trains fighters. Small IS pockets have also been reported in Zabul and Ghazni, as well as a few northern provinces. Since its emergence in Afghanistan, IS has lost hundreds of militants in US air strikes and ground fighting with the Afghan military. Meanwhile, several hundred IS fighters have been killed in clashes with the Afghan Taliban. Around a dozen top leaders of the group's Afghanistan-Pakistan branch, including founding leader Hafiz Saeed Khan, a former Pakistani Taliban commander, and his deputies, have been killed in Afghanistan, mostly in US drone attacks. Estimates about IS's numerical strength inside Afghanistan vary, ranging from 1,000 to 5,000. US General John Nicholson, the top commander of US and Nato troops in Afghanistan, estimates that between 1,000 and 1,500 IS fighters are in Afghanistan. He says their number has been cut in half, from an estimated 3,000, by military operations over the past year or so. Afghan security forces have been battling IS fighters, but the group has survived the onslaught He adds that about 70% of those fighters come from the Pakistani Taliban group (TTP), some of whom moved to Afghanistan after the Pakistani military launched an operation in North Waziristan tribal area in 2014. But Afghan security officials insist that 80% of IS militants are Pakistanis. The other members were part of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), a group focused on Central Asian countries, and former Afghan Taliban or new recruits, they say. IS has so far survived the onslaught and it seems the group is attracting new recruits to replace those killed. After losing territory, IS Khorasan is emulating its Middle East counterparts by resorting to guerrilla tactics such as suicide attacks, targeted killings and the use of IEDs. It says it carried out some of the deadliest recent attacks in Afghanistan, several of them in the capital, Kabul. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed around 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. All of these attacks targeted minority Shia Muslims. IS has also claimed responsibility for attacks in other parts of the country and has killed civilians, including tribal elders and religious scholars opposed to its extreme ideology and brutal tactics. Nato estimates that there are between 1,000 and 1,500 IS fighters in Afghanistan Like its counterparts in the Middle East, IS Khorasan has taken violence to new levels, even by the bloody standards of the region. While al-Qaeda introduced suicide bombings into the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, IS brought new and more ruthless tactics. In one notorious example an IS video released in August 2015 showed 10 blindfolded community elders in Achin district in Nangarhar being forced to sit on holes in the ground filled with explosives. They were then blown to pieces. Beheadings and abductions, including of women and children, are other tactics. In addition, IS propaganda on the internet and air waves is strong. The group has several Twitter and Facebook accounts and has been broadcasting on an FM radio station in Nangarhar since December 2015. Radio Caliphate can be heard in Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, as well as adjacent parts of Pakistan. The station was once hit in a US airstrike but was back on air within a few weeks. IS has also carried out attacks in Pakistan, where it relies mainly on the support of certain anti-Shia sectarian groups. The first major attack in Pakistan for which IS claimed responsibility was in May 2015 when about 40 minority Shias were killed in a gun attack on a bus in the country's biggest city, Karachi. On 16 February, IS said it carried outan attack on the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar Sufi shrinein the town of Sehwan in Sindh province. Police say 90 people were killed. The attack at the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar Sufi shrine shocked Pakistan The conflict in Afghanistan has been going on for nearly four decades, but the country has largely remained immune to the sectarian violence that has hit other regional nations. IS, however, aims to turn the conflict in Afghanistan into a sectarian war between the majority Sunnis and minority Shias, as it has tried in Syria and Iraq. Shias are considered apostates by IS, which follows an austere version of Sunni Islam. The new 'Great Game' in Afghanistan Pakistan's bloody week: Who is to blame? Islamic State group: The full story Although IS has also killed many of its Sunni opponents, it has clearly stated sectarian goals in a number of its attacks. Justifying the July 2016 attack on the Shia rally in Kabul, IS called it retaliation for the activities of Afghan Shia Hazaras who have gone to Syria via Iran to fight for the government of President Bashar al-Assad, an Alawi-Shia, against the Islamic State group. Deliberate attacks by IS against Shia in Afghanistan add a dangerous complication to the conflict. The future of IS in Afghanistan and Pakistan is in many ways linked to the fate of IS in Syria and Iraq. Western and Afghan military officials confirm the group has financial ties to, and is in communication with, the main IS leadership. It also has contacts with IS cells operating in South and Central Asian countries. So far, IS has not been able to carry out attacks outside Afghanistan and Pakistan. But the group has many sympathisers in the region. Additionally, thousands of volunteers from nine South and Central Asian states - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight for IS. They have been trained and radicalised there. The return of these militants will pose a new threat and might strengthen the existing IS infrastructure in the region. Such developments further complicate the conflict in Afghanistan and pose a long term risk to regional stability. Regional powers, such as Russia, China and Iran, are concerned about the threat that IS poses to their internal security. These powers have established contacts withthe Afghan Taliban, which is fighting IS, to hedge against the potential risk. Mutual mistrust is preventing regional players from reaching a consensus to end the conflict in Afghanistan. Six Afghan ICRC workers 'killed by IS' Pakistan's bloody week: Who is to blame?

Murdered woman 'was on way home',"Iuliana Tudos, 22, had been missing since Christmas Eve A woman was murdered in a public park on her way home on Christmas Eve, police have said. The body of Iuliana Tudos, 22, was found in an outbuilding near the sports ground in Finsbury Park, north London, at about 16:30 GMT on Wednesday. Scotland Yard said she died from a stab wound to the abdomen and a head injury. No arrests have been made. The barmaid was last seen at about 20:00 on Sunday as she headed for a bus home from Camden. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Ms Tudos, who police said was of Russian and Greek origin, was due to meet at a friend's home in Enfield later that evening before spending Christmas Day there. However, she never arrived and a missing person appeal was launched by Scotland Yard. The body was found near the sports ground in Finsbury Park A member of the public found Ms Tudos's body, police said. Det Ch Insp Nicola Wall said: ""Iuliana's body was discovered in an outbuilding next to a sports pitch."" ""We believe that she may have been attacked on Christmas Eve but we want to hear from anyone who saw anything suspicious in that part of Finsbury Park over the Christmas period."" Residents have been laying flowers near where Iuliana Tudos's body was found On Thursday, an area of the north-east corner of Finsbury Park, close to a baseball pitch, was cordoned off and forensics officers marked out what appeared to be clothing scattered on the grass. Ms Tudos's home in nearby Upper Tollington Park was also searched by police.

"Kabul suicide bomb attack kills dozensSo-called Islamic State says it attacked a Shia centre in the Afghan capital, killing at least 41.7h7 hours agoAsia","This video can not be played ""My face was burning"", one man told reporters At least 41 people have been killed and more than 80 wounded in a suicide bomb attack in the Afghan capital, Kabul. A Shia cultural organisation was the target but the Afghan Voice news agency was also hit. So-called Islamic State said it was behind the attack. The interior ministry told the BBC an explosion at the Shia centre was followed by at least two more blasts. IS has been behind a number of attacks on Shia targets across the country in recent months. Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new ""Great Game"" IS in Afghanistan: How successful has the group been? The main blast went off inside the Tabayan cultural centre, but offices of Afghan Voice are also at the location of the attack. Dust blows down a street after one of the explosions Students were among those who had gathered at the Shia centre for a discussion forum. The interior ministry said the event was to mark the 38th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The initial explosion was followed by at least two others, although the ministry said these did not cause any fatalities. The health ministry's latest figures say 41 people died and 84 were hurt, with women and children among the casualties. Student Mohammad Hasan Rezayee told Tolo News: ""We were inside the hall in the second row when an explosion from behind took place. After the blast there was fire and smoke inside the building and everyone was pleading for help."" Another witness, Sayed Jan, told reporters from his hospital bed: ""There was a book reading event and academic discussion, and I was one of the participants. During the speech a huge bang was heard and smoke rose from inside the hall. ""My face was burning. I fell down from the chair and I saw the other colleagues around me on the ground. The smoke was everywhere."" Sayed Abbas Hussaini, a journalist at Afghan Voice, told Reuters that one reporter at the agency had been killed and two wounded. Distraught relatives gathered at local hospitals, which are treating the dozens of wounded people. The Islamic State group said on its propaganda outlet Amaq that it had targeted the Shia centre with a suicide bomber and other bombs. The Taliban had earlier issued a statement saying they were not involved. The Taliban are not known to specifically target Shias, although both militant groups have carried out frequent attacks across the country. Analysis: Zia Shahreyar, BBC Persian, Kabul In recent months IS has attacked many Shia targets in the west of Kabul, where the majority of the city's Shia population live. The Tabayan centre also has offices in the Iranian cities of Tehran and Mashhad and is believed to have close ties with religious and cultural centres in Iran. There are growing fears that IS is trying to spark a Sunni-Shia sectarian war in Afghanistan and the Shia community is increasingly dissatisfied with President Ashraf Ghani's government for failing to protect them. US-led foreign forces meanwhile continue to engage IS in eastern Afghanistan and President Trump, in his new Afghan strategy, has pledged to root out IS in the country, as it has been in Iraq and Syria. IS announced the establishment of its ""Khorasan"" branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015. It initially gained ground in the east and north, although it has lost territory there and was largely eliminated from southern and western Afghanistan by the Taliban and operations conducted by Afghan and US/Nato forces. Afghan security forces have been battling IS fighters, but the group has survived the onslaught IS has since resorted mainly to guerrilla tactics and is estimated to have a force of between  1,000 and 5,000 fighters. IS considers Shia apostates and aims to turn the conflict in Afghanistan into a sectarian war between Sunnis and Shias. In October, at least 39 people were killed in an attack on a mosque belonging to the Shia minority. In April, the US said it haddropped the ""Mother of All Bombs"" on IS in eastern Afghanistan, but the group continues its attacks. President Ashraf Ghani's spokesman issued a statement describing the latest attack as an ""unpardonable"" crime against humanity. Amnesty International's South Asia director, Biraj Patnaik, said: ""This gruesome attack underscores the dangers faced by Afghan civilians. In one of the deadliest years on record, journalists and other civilians continue to be ruthlessly targeted by armed groups."" Nato's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan called the attack ""heinous"". It is unclear whether Afghan Voice was a specific part of the target, but it has been a difficult year for the media. Afghanistan remains one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists and media workers. In November, IS said it was behinda gun attack on the Shamshad TV station that killed one staff member. In May, two media workers, including a BBC driver, were killed in a massive bomb attack in Kabul. The first six months of 2017 saw a surge in violence against journalists, with local monitorthe Afghan Journalists Safety Committee,externalrecording 73 cases, an increase of 35% in comparison to the same period in 2016. Last year seven members of staff from the private Tolo television station were killed in a Taliban suicide bombing in Kabul. Who has troops in Afghanistan?

"US to resume Turkey visa servicesThe United States had suspended processing papers in Turkey, amid a row over a consulate employee.3h3 hours agoEurope","Visa applications at the embassy in Ankara were suspended in October US missions in Turkey are to resume full visa services following security assurances from Turkey's government on US consular staff. The US had suspended all non-immigrant visa services after the arrest of one of its consulate employees in October. The worker had been detained over suspected links to a cleric blamed for last year's failed coup in Turkey. The US state department said it was ""confident that the security posture has improved sufficiently"". Turkey had ""adhered to high level assurances"" made to the US, it said. Erdogan's Turkey: The full story Turkey brain drain: Crackdown pushes intellectuals out Turkey's coup attempt: What you need to know The state department said the US had been assured no additional local employees of its missions were under investigation, and that staff would not be detained or arrested performing their official duties. However, it also said it still had serious concerns about allegations against its arrested local employees and about cases against US citizens detained under the state of emergency imposed after the botched July 2016 coup. There are at least 11 US citizens currently under arrest in Turkey. The Turkish embassy in Washington welcomed the US decision and said visa restrictions for US citizens imposed since the start of the dispute would also be lifted. However, it said Turkey had given no assurances to the US about cases being processed by Turkish courts, and that it still had concerns about Turkish nationals undergoing court cases in the US. Washington condemned the arrest of the consulate employee, a male Turkish citizen, as baseless and damaging to bilateral relations. The US mission in Ankara said it had suspended all non-immigrant visa services,externalin order to ""reassess"" Turkey's commitment to staff security. Turkey's embassy in Washington responded,externalby suspending ""all visa services"". It came less than a month after US President Donald Trump said the two countries were as ""close as we've ever been"". But tensions had been brewing for some time, with the US complaining of heavy-handed treatment of pro-Kurdish demonstrators by Turkish security officials during Mr Erdogan's visit to Washington in May. This video can not be played The violence took place outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC The Turkish embassy said Turkish-Americans who had come to see the president were provoked by the protesters. And in September, demonstrators were beaten and ejected from a New York hotel after interrupting a speech by Mr Erdogan, who was in the city to speak at the United Nations General Assembly. Turkey accuses Fethullah Gulen of being behind the failed coup - a charge he denies Turkey has been pressing Washington to extradite US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen over his alleged role in the botched coup in July 2016. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Mr Gulen of instigating the unrest - a charge the cleric denies. In the aftermath of the coup attempt, which was led by military officers, 40,000 people were arrested and 120,000 sacked or suspended. Relations between Turkey and other countries have also become strained as Mr Erdogan appears to be taking a more assertive approach to foreign relations.

The video has triggered numerous accusations of sexism on social media. In the video, employees suggest six new year's resolutions to Mrs Clinton. It is part of a series of such videos aimed at various public figures and fronted by Vanity Fair editors and writers. In the video, staffers make a series of suggestions,externalto Mrs Clinton, who lost the 2016 presidential election to Donald Trump, to move out of the political spotlight. The tips include: ""It's time to start working on your sequel to your book, What Happened: What the Hell Happened."" ""Get someone on your tech staff to disable autofill on your iPhone so that typing in F doesn't become 'Form Exploratory Committee for 2020',"" (a reference to the date of the next presidential election) ""You know how on Anderson Cooper you were telling him about alternate-nostril breathing? You seemed really adept. You should try teaching a class."" But the suggestion that attracted the greatest criticism on social media was that Mrs Clinton ""take up a new hobby in the new year: volunteer work, knitting, improve comedy - literally anything that will keep you from running again"". This video can not be played Hillary Clinton: ""I had not prepared a concession speech because I really thought I was going to win."" Since the election, some commentators have complained that Mrs Clinton has been unable to assume responsibility for her role in the defeat which stunned and divided the party. Many have called for Mrs Clinton and her supporters to move on, withdraw to the sidelines and allow the party to rebuild, say analysts. What Happened: The long list of who Hillary Clinton blames Nonetheless, if this was meant to be a tongue-in-cheek call of that kind, many Twitter users were unimpressed. Allow Twitter content?

US to resume Turkey visa services,"Visa applications at the embassy in Ankara were suspended in October US missions in Turkey are to resume full visa services following security assurances from Turkey's government on US consular staff. The US had suspended all non-immigrant visa services after the arrest of one of its consulate employees in October. The worker had been detained over suspected links to a cleric blamed for last year's failed coup in Turkey. The US state department said it was ""confident that the security posture has improved sufficiently"". Turkey had ""adhered to high level assurances"" made to the US, it said. Erdogan's Turkey: The full story Turkey brain drain: Crackdown pushes intellectuals out Turkey's coup attempt: What you need to know The state department said the US had been assured no additional local employees of its missions were under investigation, and that staff would not be detained or arrested performing their official duties. However, it also said it still had serious concerns about allegations against its arrested local employees and about cases against US citizens detained under the state of emergency imposed after the botched July 2016 coup. There are at least 11 US citizens currently under arrest in Turkey. The Turkish embassy in Washington welcomed the US decision and said visa restrictions for US citizens imposed since the start of the dispute would also be lifted. However, it said Turkey had given no assurances to the US about cases being processed by Turkish courts, and that it still had concerns about Turkish nationals undergoing court cases in the US. Washington condemned the arrest of the consulate employee, a male Turkish citizen, as baseless and damaging to bilateral relations. The US mission in Ankara said it had suspended all non-immigrant visa services,externalin order to ""reassess"" Turkey's commitment to staff security. Turkey's embassy in Washington responded,externalby suspending ""all visa services"". It came less than a month after US President Donald Trump said the two countries were as ""close as we've ever been"". But tensions had been brewing for some time, with the US complaining of heavy-handed treatment of pro-Kurdish demonstrators by Turkish security officials during Mr Erdogan's visit to Washington in May. This video can not be played The violence took place outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC The Turkish embassy said Turkish-Americans who had come to see the president were provoked by the protesters. And in September, demonstrators were beaten and ejected from a New York hotel after interrupting a speech by Mr Erdogan, who was in the city to speak at the United Nations General Assembly. Turkey accuses Fethullah Gulen of being behind the failed coup - a charge he denies Turkey has been pressing Washington to extradite US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen over his alleged role in the botched coup in July 2016. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Mr Gulen of instigating the unrest - a charge the cleric denies. In the aftermath of the coup attempt, which was led by military officers, 40,000 people were arrested and 120,000 sacked or suspended. Relations between Turkey and other countries have also become strained as Mr Erdogan appears to be taking a more assertive approach to foreign relations.

George Weah set to win Liberia presidency,"This video can not be played George Weah's supporters celebrate in Monrovia Former football star George Weah has been elected as Liberia's president. With nearly all ballots from Tuesday's run-off vote counted, Mr Weah is well ahead of opponent Joseph Boakai with more than 60% of the vote. As news of Mr Weah's victory emerged, his supporters began celebrating in the capital Monrovia. He will succeed Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female president, in Liberia's first democratic handover in decades. ""My fellow Liberians, I deeply feel the emotion of all the nation,"" Mr Weah wrote on Twitter,externalafter the results were announced. ""I measure the importance and the responsibility of the immense task which I embrace today. Change is on."" Mr Boakai has conceded victory and phoned Mr Weah to congratulate him. Mr Weah, who was raised in a slum in Liberia's capital Monrovia, starred at top-flight European football clubs Paris St-Germain (PSG) and AC Milan, before ending his career in England with brief stays at Chelsea and Manchester City. He is the only African footballer to have won both Fifa World Player of the Year and the prestigious Ballon D'Or. How a footballer became president When sports stars make a run at politics He entered politics after his retirement from the game in 2002 and is currently a senator in Liberia's parliament.

Liberia, founded by freed US slaves in the 19th Century, has not had a smooth transfer of power from one elected president to another since 1944. George Weah won the first round of the election - but not by enough to avoid a run-off vote Mrs Sirleaf defeated Mr Weah in the presidential election run-off in 2005 and took office a year later, after the end of a brutal civil war that saw President Charles Taylor forced out by rebels. Taylor is now serving a 50-year prison sentence in the UK for war crimes related to the conflict in neighbouring Sierra Leone. This time Mr Weah's campaign - under the Coalition for Democratic Change banner - appealed to the youth vote, while incumbent Vice-President Boakai was seen as old and out of touch. But Mr Weah's election is not without controversy, as his running mate was Jewel Taylor, former wife of the jailed president. At the scene: Umaru Fofana, BBC News, Monrovia Hundreds of jubilant supporters of George Weah took to the streets shortly after the electoral commission chairman announced the result. Election observers, both domestic and foreign, have praised the conduct of the election and say it showed a marked improvement from the first round in October. This is third time lucky for a man used to winning trophies but who found it hard to win this, the biggest award of his life. And he has his work cut out for him. Liberia has stabilised in the past decade after a long and bloody civil war. But it is still struggling with acute poverty and corruption. From producing Africa's first elected female president, now it has produced its first ex-footballer head of state. Mr Weah, 51, won the first round of the presidential election in October with 38.4% of the vote, compared with the 28.8% won by second-placed Mr Boakai, 73. The failure of any candidate to secure an outright majority forced the run-off. The National Elections Commission (NEC) said on Thursday that with 98.1% of the run-off vote counted, Mr Weah had won 61.5% of the vote while Mr Boakai was far behind with 38.5%. Turnout was low - put at 56% by election officials - for the vote, which had been delayed from its initial date, 7 November, following a legal challenge brought by a representative for the opposition Liberty Party, Charles Brumskine. Mr Brumskine said the first round vote - which he came third in - had been marred by ""massive fraud and irregularities"", but in December the Supreme Court ruled evidence of fraud was insufficient to merit a re-run of the opening round. Election observers have praised the conduct of the poll. More than two million people were eligible to cast their ballots in the nation of 4.6 million people.

UK medics to help Rohingya refugees,"A team of British medical staff is travelling to Bangladesh to help tackle an outbreak of diphtheria affecting Rohingya Muslim refugee camps. The first of more than 40 doctors, nurses and firefighters are on their way to Cox's Bazar - at the request of the World Health Organization. Cox's Bazar is home to more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled violence in bordering Myanmar. The government said the deployment was ""another proud moment for the NHS"". This is the first deployment of Britain's emergency medical team (EMT) since it was certified by the World Health Organization in 2016. The staff, who come from different parts of the NHS across the UK, will be at the camps for six weeks working to fight the spread of diphtheria. Myanmar Rohingya: What you need to know about the crisis 'Opening my home to 130 Rohingya' Myanmar extends Reuters reporters' custody The highly contagious disease has already killed at least 27 people and up to 160 new cases are being reported daily. The infection is now very rare in the UK, but affects the nose and throat and can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis and death. This video can not be played Some of the British medical team left from Manchester Airport on Thursday A group of 16 medics left from Manchester airport on Thursday, with the remaining team members following in the coming days and weeks. Among them was Derek Sloan, an infections and disease doctor who is usually working in Fife but has also had experience of working in the field. He described the ""emotional and psychological cost"" of the work. ""Sometimes you don't really feel that until you get back,"" he told the BBC. ""Having done this kind of work before doesn't make you immune to the difficulties of it. But we're also a good source of support to one another and we are used to working in a difficult environment."" Yasin Arfat, six, is among the Rohingya refugees suffering from diphtheria As of 21 December, the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said it had seen more than 2,000 suspected cases in its health facilities. The majority of patients were between five and 14 years old. Crystal VanLeeuwen, the emergency medical co-ordinator for MSF at one of the camps, said the living conditions of the camp presented added challenges. There is a ""very poor water and sanitation situation, overcrowding... and low vaccination coverage"", she said. The Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh has become overcrowded An estimated 620,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh following persecution from the Burmese military in their native state of Rakhine, since August. The United Nations described the military offensive in Rakhine, which provoked the exodus, as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". Myanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians. UK minister Penny Mordaunt met Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar earlier this year International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said it was ""absolutely right"" for the UK to ""step up"" and help ease the suffering of the Rohingya families. ""This will be an absolutely critical deployment, in a race against time for men, women and children at risk of dying from one of the world's cruellest infections,"" she added. The deployment will be funded from the department for international development's (DFID) Bangladesh humanitarian budget .

CCTV clue in hunt for missing student,"This video can not be played Sophie Smith vanished from her home in Avondale Road, Gorleston, dressed in just a vest top and shorts Police have been scouring CCTV in an effort to locate a student who has been missing since Boxing Day, as hope of finding her safe and well ""diminishes"". Sophie Smith, 21, left her home in Gorleston, Norfolk, dressed in shorts and a vest top at 03:00 GMT. CCTV footage may show her heading towards the town's beachfront, police said. But despite a large search effort, ""no further trace"" of Sophie has been found. On Thursday, members of her family and volunteers went out to search a beach near a pier in Great Yarmouth. Ms Smith's father Martin Knowles said the family was ""still praying and hoping Sophie will walk through her mum's door, just so we can put our arms around her and tell her how much we love her"". He described his daughter as ""happy-go-lucky, full of life, very popular, liked by a lot of people"". ""She's had a bit of hard time recently but I think all youngsters do. It's hard being young,"" Mr Knowles said. Sophie Smith's step-sister Lauren Jayne Shaw led the search in Great Yarmouth A police helicopter, the coastguard and lifeboats had been involved in searches around the beach at Gorleston on Tuesday and Wednesday. ""We have diligently searched for Sophie and have investigated a range of scenarios but unfortunately there have been no confirmed sightings or contact since she left her property,"" said Insp Will Drummond. ""We have a possible CCTV image of Sophie heading towards the seafront but, despite all our efforts, we have found no further trace of her."" Insp Drummond said police officers were in ""close contact with Sophie's family"". ""However, due to the circumstances in which she left home with minimal clothing, no mobile phone, her mental state and the weather conditions, the hope of finding Sophie safe and well diminishes as time goes on,"" he said. Police said they were becoming ""increasingly concerned"" for the University of East Anglia student Ms Smith's family has led a search around the Britannia pier in Great Yarmouth, and police and the Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service were involved in a nine-hour search effort on Tuesday. The search of the beach continued on Wednesday and has involved members of the Norfolk Lowland Search and Rescue. Manager Paul Webber said his volunteers would return to the town in an effort to find Ms Smith, who vanished from Avondale Road without her mobile phone. ""We methodically searched areas within the town,"" he said. ""We have about 15 members going back to continue the search."" Members of the Norfolk Lowland Search and Rescue service scour Gorleston beach Norfolk Police said on Wednesday they were becoming ""increasingly concerned"" for University of East Anglia student Ms Smith and wanted to hear from anyone who may have seen her or knew where she was.

Hospitals made Â£174m in parking charges,"Hospitals in England collected more than Â£174m in car parking fees in the last year Hospitals in England made a record Â£174m last year in charging for parking, an investigation has found. The figure for 2016-17 was 6% up on the previous financial year, data collected by the Press Association under the Freedom of Information Act showed. The figures also showed a growing amount of revenue being made from fines - up by a third to Â£950,000. The system has been branded a ""tax on sickness"", but hospitals said charging was needed and money made reinvested. Car parking is largely free in Scotland and Wales. PA obtained data from 111 hospital trusts out of the 120 they approached on charges for patients, visitors and staff. The results also showed: Half of all trusts charged disabled people for parking in some or all of their disabled parking spaces The Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust took the most money - over Â£4.8m Two-thirds made more than Â£1m in each of the last three years The most expensive place for a one-hour stay was the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford at Â£4 Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said: ""The vast sums of money that hospitals are making from parking charges reveal the hidden cost of healthcare faced by many patients and their families. ""Hospital car park charges amount to a tax on sickness, with people who are chronically ill or disabled bearing the brunt."" Hospitals told to cut parking charges Minister urges NHS parking discounts Hospital parking 'unreasonably stressful' Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, added: ""Hospital parking charges are an entirely unfair and unnecessary burden, which disproportionately affect the most vulnerable people."" Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association, said the current state of NHS finances meant it was sometimes hard to blame hospitals for trying to find money. But she said that did not make the current situation acceptable. ""For patients, parking charges amount to an extra charge for being ill,"" she said. Hospitals have defended their approach to charging.

SNP calls for Labour help on single market,"The Scottish National Party is calling on Labour to work with other opposition parties to keep Britain in the single market and customs union after Brexit. Its Commons leader Ian Blackford asked for help to stop the ""catastrophic damage"" of ""extreme"" Brexit. ""It is time for MPs of all parties to put politics aside,"" he said. Labour saysthe UK should ""stay aligned"" to the EU after Brexitand could pay to access the single market like Norway. Mr Blackford said he would invite other opposition leaders to a summit on 8 January when MPs return from the Christmas recess. He said: ""As we saw with the successful amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill, when opposition parties work together effectively it is possible to secure a parliamentary majority and deliver change in the national interest."" The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Greens have all said they want the UK to stay in the single market and customs union after Brexit - something Prime Minister Theresa May has already ruled out. Heseltine: Labour government better than Brexit Hammond urged to release Brexit studies Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has also faced criticism over his refusal to support a second referendum on the final terms of the UK's exit from the EU. He told the i newspaper: ""We have had a referendum which came to a decision. The negotiations are still ongoing, albeit well behind schedule, and we've set out the kind of relationship we want to have with Europe in the future."" Tom Brake, Brexit spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said the Labour leadership had ""shirked their responsibility"" to provide effective opposition to the government. ""The Labour leadership has constantly played a game of smoke and mirrors over their Brexit position. ""But here they are nailing their colours to the mast in support of hard Brexit,"" he added.

Sophie Smith, 21, left her home in Gorleston, Norfolk, dressed in shorts and a vest top at 03:00 GMT. CCTV footage may show her heading towards the town's beachfront, police said. But despite a large search effort, ""no further trace"" of Sophie has been found. On Thursday, members of her family and volunteers went out to search a beach near a pier in Great Yarmouth. Ms Smith's father Martin Knowles said the family was ""still praying and hoping Sophie will walk through her mum's door, just so we can put our arms around her and tell her how much we love her"". He described his daughter as ""happy-go-lucky, full of life, very popular, liked by a lot of people"". ""She's had a bit of hard time recently but I think all youngsters do. It's hard being young,"" Mr Knowles said. Sophie Smith's step-sister Lauren Jayne Shaw led the search in Great Yarmouth A police helicopter, the coastguard and lifeboats had been involved in searches around the beach at Gorleston on Tuesday and Wednesday. ""We have diligently searched for Sophie and have investigated a range of scenarios but unfortunately there have been no confirmed sightings or contact since she left her property,"" said Insp Will Drummond. ""We have a possible CCTV image of Sophie heading towards the seafront but, despite all our efforts, we have found no further trace of her."" Insp Drummond said police officers were in ""close contact with Sophie's family"". ""However, due to the circumstances in which she left home with minimal clothing, no mobile phone, her mental state and the weather conditions, the hope of finding Sophie safe and well diminishes as time goes on,"" he said. Police said they were becoming ""increasingly concerned"" for the University of East Anglia student Ms Smith's family has led a search around the Britannia pier in Great Yarmouth, and police and the Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service were involved in a nine-hour search effort on Tuesday.

Miss Americas asked to help solve scandal,"Miss America 2018 Cara Mund celebrates her win, nearly a century after the competition began The Miss America group is seeking the help of former pageant winners and directors, after a scandal over vulgar emails disparaging contestants. In the emails, published by theHuffington Post,external, pageant officials made degrading remarks about past winners' appearance, intellect, and sex lives. Executive director Sam Haskell, president Josh Randle, and other board members resigned over the scandal. Now the group is contacting former Miss Americas to help find new leaders. Dan Meyers, the interim board chairman, said the group wanted former winners to recommend members for a search committee that would determine the group's future leadership structure. In a statement to the Associated Press, he said: ""The board wanted to have a process that was unprecedented in terms of openness, transparency and inclusion. Given the turbulent nature of leadership transitions, asking all the stakeholders to be a part of this process was the best way."" Miss America boss 'mocked past winners' How beauty queens got political in 2017 Miss Peru Pageant turns into protest The leaked emails contained three years worth of messages between Mr Haskell and other pageant officials. They referred to contestants by a vulgar term for female genitalia, expressed a wish that one particular Miss America had died, and speculated about the number of sex partners another had had. CEO Sam Haskell exchanged vulgar emails with other staff Under the new plan, the search committee would be made up of seven members - four people recommended by former Miss Americas and state directors, one former state title holder named by the current board, and two board members, AP reported. Responding to the news, some former winners called for a complete replacement of the existing board. ""At this time all remaining members must step aside so we can take our beloved program back,"" 1977's Miss America, Dorothy Benham, told AP. ""They have underestimated the strength, intelligence, and determination of the women who have worn the Miss America crown, as well as every young woman who is currently wearing, or has worn the local and state crown. We stand united,"" she said. Jennifer Vaden Barth, a former Miss North Carolina, said: ""The board needs to accept responsibility for the damage they have caused. They need to step aside quickly and allow new leadership to save the Miss America program."" Journalist and Miss America 1989 Gretchen Carlson criticised the move, saying it ""pays lip service to groups of stakeholders, while guaranteeing that the majority of the current board will stay on"".

US to resume Turkey visas services,"Visa applications at the embassy in Ankara were suspended in October US missions in Turkey are to resume full visa services following security assurances from Turkey's government on US consular staff. The US had suspended all non-immigrant visa services after the arrest of one of its consulate employees in October. The worker had been detained over suspected links to a cleric blamed for last year's failed coup in Turkey. The US state department said it was ""confident that the security posture has improved sufficiently"". Turkey had ""adhered to high level assurances"" made to the US, it said. Erdogan's Turkey: The full story Turkey brain drain: Crackdown pushes intellectuals out Turkey's coup attempt: What you need to know The state department said the US had been assured no additional local employees of its missions were under investigation, and that staff would not be detained or arrested performing their official duties. However, it also said it still had serious concerns about allegations against its arrested local employees and about cases against US citizens detained under the state of emergency imposed after the botched July 2016 coup. There are at least 11 US citizens currently under arrest in Turkey. The Turkish embassy in Washington welcomed the US decision and said visa restrictions for US citizens imposed since the start of the dispute would also be lifted. However, it said Turkey had given no assurances to the US about cases being processed by Turkish courts, and that it still had concerns about Turkish nationals undergoing court cases in the US. Washington condemned the arrest of the consulate employee, a male Turkish citizen, as baseless and damaging to bilateral relations. The US mission in Ankara said it had suspended all non-immigrant visa services,externalin order to ""reassess"" Turkey's commitment to staff security. Turkey's embassy in Washington responded,externalby suspending ""all visa services"". It came less than a month after US President Donald Trump said the two countries were as ""close as we've ever been"". But tensions had been brewing for some time, with the US complaining of heavy-handed treatment of pro-Kurdish demonstrators by Turkish security officials during Mr Erdogan's visit to Washington in May. This video can not be played The violence took place outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC The Turkish embassy said Turkish-Americans who had come to see the president were provoked by the protesters. And in September, demonstrators were beaten and ejected from a New York hotel after interrupting a speech by Mr Erdogan, who was in the city to speak at the United Nations General Assembly. Turkey accuses Fethullah Gulen of being behind the failed coup - a charge he denies Turkey has been pressing Washington to extradite US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen over his alleged role in the botched coup in July 2016. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Mr Gulen of instigating the unrest - a charge the cleric denies. In the aftermath of the coup attempt, which was led by military officers, 40,000 people were arrested and 120,000 sacked or suspended. Relations between Turkey and other countries have also become strained as Mr Erdogan appears to be taking a more assertive approach to foreign relations.

'Tallest' Lego tower built in Israel,"Thousands of people have attempted to build the world's tallest Lego tower in memory of an eight-year-old cancer victim. ""Omer Tower"" is named after Omer Sayag, who died in 2014. The tower in Tel Aviv, which is 36 metres tall, is made up of more than half a million plastic bricks and took more than two weeks to build. Guinness World Records now needs to verify that it has beaten the previous 35.05-metre record set in 2015. The ""Omer Tower"" stands at 36-metres tall The multi-coloured tower was completed on 27 December in Rabin Square, using cranes and the help of thousands of volunteers. The project was started just over a year ago by teachers of eight-year-old Omer Sayag who died of cancer in 2014. He liked to build Lego towers during his illness. A spokesperson for the mayor's office said: ""Building blocks were donated by residents, companies and some were purchased using municipality funds."" Thousands of volunteers helped build the tower in Tel Aviv There was no Guinness World Records adjudicator on site to measure Omer Tower, but drone pictures are being submitted to get the attempt verified. The previous record for the tallest Lego tower was set at 35.05 metres in Milan in 2015.

Sweden's giant goat survives Christmas,"It is a good year for the giant goat in snow-covered Gavle There is extra Christmas cheer in the Swedish town of Gavle this year because its annual giant straw goat has survived for more than three weeks. Last year's goat fell victim to an arsonist on 27 November, less than 24 hours after it had been erected. Standing 13 metres (43ft) tall, it is the world's biggest straw goat. Most of its incarnations have been burnt or vandalised since 1966, when the tradition began. However this year, thegoat is still sending merry tweets.,external Allow Twitter content?

Maria Wallberg, who handles the goat's public relations, said: ""It's great that he has been left standing for so long."" She said new higher and double fences had kept intruders away. This year a non-profit organisation, X-Cons Gavleborg, also deployed volunteers to protect the goat, she told the BBC. News site The Local has compiled a list ofthe ""weirdest attacks"" on the yule goat,,externalincluding an attempted kidnapping via helicopter and the time a person dressed as a gingerbread man shot it with flaming arrows.

By tradition, the goat effigy goes up in Gavle, 158km (98 miles) north of Stockholm, on the first Sunday of Christian Advent. This year it has been standing since 3 December, and the town hopes the 3.6-tonne effigy will survive until 2 January. Last year the Gavle Goat was destroyed by fire just hours after being inaugurated Gavle's official tourism website says the famous effigy was invented by Stig Gavlen,external, a man who proposed a giant version of the straw goat ornaments that Swedes put on show at Christmas. The intention was to boost business at shops and restaurants in the area. Giant Goat facts: It is made from a lorryload of straw from a nearby village, Mackmyra Its straw coat is made from 56 five-metre straw mats Its wooden skeleton is made from 1,200 metres of Swedish pine Construction involves 1,000 hours of labour Gavle sent the goat to Zhuhai, a twin town in China, in 2015 and it drew 420,000 admirers It has 14,600 Twitter followers. Ms Wallberg said the Gavle Goat ""is very popular and has fans all over the world"". ""We are often asked if it's better for Gavle that the goat burns down. We say it's the opposite - he is an attraction, a reason to visit Gavle. ""When he stays safe our visitors can experience him at Castle Square in Gavle and that's much better for the shops, restaurants and hotels.""

Bishop criticises Christian Trump backers,"A Church of England bishop has criticised American religious leaders who support Donald Trump, saying they cannot justify their Christian faith. The Bishop of Liverpool, the Right Reverend Paul Bayes, toldthe Guardian,externalsome evangelical leaders were ""uncritically accepting"" of things said by the US president and his allies. He said it amounted to collusion with a system that builds walls not bridges. Mr Trump has previously said he is proud to be Christian. Archbishop: Populist leaders 'deceitful' Trump's unlikely Christian covenant Trump administration in two legal defeats Bishop Bayes told the newspaper: ""Some of the things that have been said by religious leaders seem to collude with a system that marginalises the poor, a system which builds walls instead of bridges, a system which says people on the margins of society should be excluded, a system which says we're not welcoming people any more into our country."" A travel ban currently prevents nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. The president has also backed an immigration overhaul that would end diversity lottery visas and curb the number of refugees offered permanent residency in the US. And last month, a presidential order to cut funding from US cities that refuse to co-operate with immigration officials and his administration's ban on transgender people from serving in the military were both blocked by judges. Bishop Bayes, who became the eighth Bishop of Liverpool in 2014, said people were free to support right-wing populism, but questioned how that would relate to the Christian faith. ""Whenever people say those kinds of things, they need to be able to justify that they're saying those things as Christians, and I do not believe it's justifiable,"" he said. But the bishop also stressed that not all evangelicals were Trump supporters. He was speaking to mark the launch of the Ozanne Foundation, a charity aimed at eliminating discrimination based on sexuality or gender. His comments follow the Archbishop of Canterbury's Christmas sermon, in which the Most Rev Justin Welby criticised ""populist leaders"" but did not specifically name Mr Trump. And last year, the Pope questioned Mr Trump's Christianity over his call to build a border wall with Mexico. Pope Francis said ""a person who thinks only about building walls... and not of building bridges, is not Christian"". In response, Mr Trump, who has since met the Pope, said: ""For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian.""

Security guru McAfee says he was hacked,"Mr McAfee has attracted several controversies in his long career John McAfee has said his Twitter account was hacked and used to promote lesser-known crypto-currencies. The cyber-security pioneer hasrebuffed suggestions that the alleged incident,externalundermined his own credentials saying: ""I have no control over Twitter's security"". But he also posted that hebelieved his mobile phone,externalhad likely been compromised. Twitter declined to commentbut highlighted its security advice guide,external. The social network offers two-factor authentication - in which a person must enter a code sent to a mobile phone in addition to a password to access an account - to avoid such incidents. Mr McAfee told the BBC that he had activated the option, but added that he believed the hacker had intercepted the authentication code. ""The first indication that I had been hacked was turning on my cell phone and seeing the attached image,"" he said. Mr McAfee shared this smartphone screenshot, which he suggests indicates his calls and texts had been hijacked by a hacker ""I knew at that point that my phone had been compromised. ""I was on a boat at the time and could not go to my carrier (AT&T) to have the issue corrected. ""All that the hacker did was compromise my Twitter account. It could have been worse."" Mr McAfee added that he had since removed two-factor authentication from all of his accounts as a precaution. The former presidential candidate is currently working on plans to sell the world's most ""hack-proof"" smartphone. John McAfee's Privacy Phone promises to ""lock down communications"" A press release issued earlier this month said it wasdue for release in February,external. Mr McAfee came to prominence in the 1980s when hefounded a companythat released the first commercial anti-virus software - McAfee VirusScan - and helped spark a multi-billion dollar industry. Although that business has since been sold to Intel, he still develops cyber-security products of his own. The Scotland-born entrepreneur also heads up the Bitcoin mining operation MGT Capital Investments, which solves complicated mathematical problems to verify transactions in the virtual currency. In recent times, he has come to be seen by some as a crypto-currency guru. Earlier this month, Mr McAfee began issuing a daily recommendation about which of the more obscure virtual currencies he recommended others should invest in. These ""coin of the day"" picks often pre-empted a spike in the value of the selected assets. On Tuesday, Mr McAfee declared he would slow down his recommendations to once a week, with the next one due out on 1 January. But the next day, his Twitter account began firing off picks in rapid succession. These messages were later deleted and Mr McAfee posted that he had been hacked, adding that he had no clue how this had been achieved. Allow Twitter content?

Several of his 530,000 followers have speculated that the person responsible might have been able to profit by encouraging others to push the mentioned crypto-currencies higher. Mr McAfee is often perceived to be both a colourful and divisive figure. Following the report that his Twitter account had been hacked, some other security experts took the opportunity to poke fun at him. They include Marcus Hutchins, the 23-year-old who thwarted a giant ransomware attack earlier this year, only to face controversy himself when he was arrested by the FBI and accused of making other hacks possible.

Who has troops in Afghanistan?,"After months of speculation about how President Trump would approach Afghanistan, his new strategy for America's longest running war scrapped deadlines for withdrawal and didn't include any commitments on troop numbers. He did, though, give the green light to sending more US troops to Afghanistan. So Reality Check decided to look into which countries have a military presence in Afghanistan and how numbers have changed over the course of nearly 16 years of armed conflict. Of any foreign country, the US has deployed by far the largest number of troops. The majority of the American servicemen and women work with the Nato mission ""Resolute Support"", which comprises troops from 39 nations (full list at the end of this article), to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces. A recent official figure put the total number of troops involved in Resolute Support at 13,576. The sizeable number of US troops not deployed with the Nato mission conduct counter-terrorism operations. The Nato combat mission, which numbered more than 130,000 in 2011, ended in December 2014. Some of the wealthiest Nato members, like France and Canada, no longer contribute troops. During a violent part of the war in 2011, with troop levels at their peak, the UK had 9,500 troops in the country. It now has 500 in support of the Nato train-and-assist mission. But over the last year, the Taliban has made significant territorial gains and security incidents have reached their highest level since 2007. In February, Gen John Nicholson, senior commander of US forces in Afghanistan, told a senate committee that there was a shortfall of a few thousand troops needed to help break the ""stalemate"". Although President Trump did not reveal exactly how many more military personnel might be deployed, it is thoughtaround 4,000may be added to the roughly 8,300 currently there. Even with an additional few thousand, US troop numbers are significantly down on recent years. The Taliban government was toppled less than two months after the war began in October 2001 and the US military declared an end to major combat in May 2003. However the new Afghan government struggled to establish control and Taliban fighters regrouped. President Obama announced an additional 30,000 troops in 2009 and by 2011 there were 100,000 US troops in the country. Numbers dropped back again after the US surge.

"UK 'had greenest year for electricity'Renewables provided more electricity than coal for 90% of year, National Grid figures show.10h10 hours agoUK","Wind farms helped the UK experience its first coal-free day since the Industrial Revolution The UK has achieved its greenest year ever in terms of how the nation's electricity is generated, National Grid figures reveal. The rise of renewable energy helped break 13 clean energy records in 2017. In June, for the first time, wind, nuclear and solar power generated more UK power than gas and coal combined. Britain has halved carbon emissions in the electricity sector since 2012 to provide the fourth cleanest power system in Europe and seventh worldwide. In April, the UK had its first 24-hour period without using any coal power since the Industrial Revolution. The government iscommitted to phasing out unabated coal by 2025as part of efforts to cut the UK's greenhouse gas emissions in line with legal obligations. Separate findings from power research group MyGridGB show that renewable energy sources provided more power than coal for 90% of 2017, figures up to 12 December show. British wind farms produced more electricity than coal plants on more than 75% of days this year. This changing landscape saw thecost of offshore wind power fall below the price of nuclearfor the first time. But despite the successes, groups warned the UK must now tackle its reliance on gas if it is to meet its emission targets. The daily output of gas was outstripped by wind on just two days of the year. The UK must reduce its gas use to reach its emission targets Renewables overall - including wind, solar, biomass and hydropower - beat fossil fuels for only 23 days of the year. Dr Andrew Crossland from MyGridGB and the Durham Energy Institute said: ""The government has focused on reducing coal use which now supplies less than 7% of our electricity. ""However, if we continue to use gas at the rate that we do, then Britain will miss carbon targets and be dangerously exposed to supply and price risks in the international gas markets."" He added that ""refreshed government support for low carbon alternatives"" is now needed to ""avoid price and supply shocks for our heat and electricity supplies"". Emma Pinchbeck, executive director of Industry body RenewableUK, called for ""more boldness"" from the government. She urged onshore wind to be developed across the UK in an ""ambitious sector deal with the off shore wind industry"" that could help secure a ""golden age for renewables"" in 2018. An Energy Department spokesman said the UK was reducing emissions faster than any other G7 country - which includes the US, Japan, Germany, Italy, France and Canada. He said the government plans to reduce carbon emissions throughout the 2020s, while supporting the creation of well-paid jobs in the low carbon sector.

The ANA plane turned back four hours into its journeyto Tokyo, reportedly because a passenger boarded in error. Teigen documented the drama on Twitter and continued to live tweet once she and Legend were put on another plane. The model, who is expecting her second child, also explained why she and her husband had not used a private jet. ""A lot of people have been asking this and I would just like you all to know that a round trip international private flight is like...300,000 dollars,""she tweeted on Wednesday,external. According to US media, the mix-up happened after two brothers who were both bound for Tokyo were seated on the same flight, despite one of the siblings having booked with a different airline.

Airline sorry over 'blanket theft' claim,"American Airlines has apologised to two professional basketball players who were kicked off a flight after being wrongly accused of theft. Marquis Teague and Trahson Burrell boarded a plane on Christmas Eve, en route to a game. But before take off, a flight attendant claimed the men had taken blankets from the first class cabin, and they were forced off the plane. It later emerged the pair had been given the blankets by passengers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Both of the basketball players are African American, as was the flight attendant involved. Neither of the athletes, who play for the National Basketball Association's minor league team Memphis Hustle, has commented on the incident. But Hustle assistant coach Darnell Lazere tweeted that he believed the incident was driven by race. The players were flying from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Sioux Falls, South Dakota on a flight operated by Envoy Air, a subsidiary of American Airlines. American Airlines spokesman Joshua Freed said the carrier was now reviewing the incident. Marquis Teague (left) and Trahson Burrell (right) have yet to comment. ""We apologise for what occurred on this flight. We take pride in bringing people together, and we know that on this flight we let some of our customers down,"" he said. Mr Teague and Mr Burrell were given first class tickets and flown to their final destination on a later flight. Their team won the Christmas Day game against Sioux Falls Skyforce  131-115, with Burrell scoring 15 points and Teague getting 11. American Airlines has been trying to address accusations of bias in the way it has treated some customers. In October, the civil rights group NAACP warned of ""a pattern of disturbing incidents reported by African-American passengers, specific to American Airlines"". The carrier later pledged to put its 120,000 employees through new training.

Young MS woman was in elderly care home,"Joanne Head was placed in a home where most of the residents were over 65 A woman has called for better care for young disabled people after her sister had to share a care home with people more than twice her age. Before 38-year-old Joanne Head died in 2015, she had to have 24-hour care due to advanced multiple sclerosis. Her sister Vicky Cook, from Nottingham, said most residents in the home were over 65 and some had dementia. Lincolnshire County Council, who provided the care, said it works with families to find the right placements. Vicky Cook (left) said her sister Joanne (right) was her best friend Mrs Cook said it was ""horrible"" to see her sister in an environment where no suitable therapies or social interaction and activities were offered. She said her sister was ""full of life"" and working as a marketing manager in London when she was diagnosed with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), in 2008 at the age of 31. ""After two years she struggled to walk, [the MS] affected her bladder control, her memory, she suffered from tiredness. ""She became someone who didn't want to leave the house."" Joanne Head (middle) was sporty and active, but lost confidence when she was diagnosed with MS In 2012, Ms Head moved back home to Boston, Lincolnshire, before developing secondary progressive MS. Ms Cook said her sister's cognitive ability had deteriorated, her speech was reduced to just ""yes"" and ""no"" and she sounded ""muddled"" because she was losing her short-term memory. She needed 24-hour care and was placed in a mixed age home at 35, but most of the residents were over 65. ""It was horrible to see your younger sister there with people with dementia and unsettling behaviour,"" said Ms Cook. ""She shouldn't have been there. It wasn't dignified."" Ms Head was later moved to a home that was more suitable, with more activities and social evenings, but was still at least 10 years younger than the other residents. Joanne Head had a full life in London The MS Society said the social care system was ""failing"" thousands of younger disabled adults. The charity said only 32% of 18-29 year olds with MS had all their care needs met and it was ""fundamentally wrong"" that younger adults with the condition were living in older people's care homes. One in seven younger disabled adults in residential care could be in homes for older people, a spokesperson said. Lincolnshire County Council, who provided Ms Head's care, said while they could not comment on the details of individual cases, a wide range of factors were explored to ensure the appropriate placement was made. It said a number of care homes were registered units for both under 65s and over 65s, and many specialised in specific types of care depending on an individuals' needs. Multiple sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition which can affect the brain and/or spinal cord It can cause problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS It is estimated that there are more than 100,000 people diagnosed with MS in the UK There is currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition Source:NHS,external Multiple sclerosis drug 'a landmark' Risky treatment can stop MS for years DVLA revealed medical condition on letter Multiple Sclerosis Society UK Lincolnshire County Council Gross misconduct ruling: Former inspectorâs use of force âentirely unnecessaryâ Nottinghamshire weather forecast for Thursday 9 January Gedling to introduce borough-wide Smoke Control Area with Â£175 fines for first offence Stars including Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench need help of Worksop residents to speed up ban on trophy hunting imports in Parliament Â£5.4million Nottingham College centre for supported learners now complete Desperate Mansfield drug addict stole Â£8k after accessing employerâs online banking app At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Rogue landlords targeted by government,"Rogue landlords are the target of new measures being considered by both the government and Labour. The government says landlords in England who want to rent a property to five or more people, from at least two different families, should be licensed. Under the plan, the maximum number of people who can occupy a room would be specified in the property's licence. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says his party wants tenants to have more powers to avoid eviction. There are about 4.3 million households in the private rented sector in England. About 500,000 are houses in multiple occupation. 'My landlord made sexual advances, then tried to evict me' Rent rises ahead as 'landlords pull out' 'New dawn' for Scottish private renters Life in a rented wreck The Department for Communities and Local Government said the changes, subject to Parliamentary approval, would make flats and one and two-storey properties subject to licensing. National mandatory licensing currently only applies if properties are three or more storeys. It estimated that about 160,000 homes will be affected by the new proposals. The government has also brought forward minimum bedroom sizes in a bid to deal with overcrowding and poor accommodation. It is already waiting for approval from Parliament for regulations, which outline offences including burglary, blackmail, stalking, fraud and fire safety offences that will lead to a landlord being banned from letting out property. Those who are banned will be listed on a database from April. Housing minister Alok Sharma said he was seeking to target ""unscrupulous"" landlords who profit from offering ""overcrowded, squalid and sometimes dangerous homes"". He said: ""Through a raft of new powers we are giving councils the further tools they need to crack down on these rogue landlords and kick them out of the business for good."" Elsewhere,Mr Corbyn told the Independent that he would abolish so-called ""no fault"" evictions,externalin which people are asked to leave without reason. ""I think it's a moral litmus test for the country: do we just put up with so many rough sleepers or do we do something about it,"" he said. Under Labour there would be an emphasis on longer tenancies are part of a ""more regulated"" private rented system, he said. ""I am very determined to bring some order and stability to their lives by longer tenancies and eviction that can only be there for good reason rather than just what can be retaliatory eviction,"" he said.

Iconic White House tree to be cut back,"The ""Jackson"" magnolia has sat on the White House lawn for almost two centuries A historic tree that has stood at the White House for nearly 200 years is scheduled to be cut back. The ""Jackson"" magnolia was planted by President Andrew Jackson as a tribute to his recently deceased wife. It has been a backdrop to historic ceremonies and even featured on the $20 note between 1928 and 1988. But experts say the tree is damaged and poses a safety hazard. First Lady Melania Trump has called for a large portion of it to be removed. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Mrs Trump had requested that seedlings be maintained so that a new tree could possibly be replanted in the same area. She said Mrs Trump had taken the decision because the tree posed a threat to ""the safety of visitors and members of the press who are often standing right in front"" of it when the presidential helicopter takes off. Is the White House really a dump? Pest problem revealed in White House logs The magnolia originally came from a cutting from Mrs Rachel Jackson's favourite magnolia tree on the couple's Tennessee farm. Its first problems began in the early 1970s when a section of its base was displaced and its exposed cavity was cemented. This was standard practice for the era, but some said it damaged the tree irrevocably. The presidential helicopter, Marine One, often takes off close to the tree in the White House grounds In 1981, the cement was removed and replaced with a large pole and cable system to hold it up. Although at first sight the tree appears normal, a report from the United States National Arboretum, quoted by CNN, said ""the tree is greatly compromised"" and ""completely dependent on the artificial support"". The magnolia tree's life has spanned 39 presidencies, as well as the American Civil War and two World Wars. Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of ex-President Bill Clinton, tweeted her thanks to those who have looked after it over the years and to Mrs Trump for the re-planting plan. Allow Twitter content?

Scale of attacks on children 'shocking',"This child was one of many who fled fighting near Mosul, Iraq, in 2017 The UN children's fund says the scale of attacks on children in the world's conflict zones reached ""shocking"" levels in 2017. In a new report, Unicef said there was widespread and blatant disregard for international laws designed to protect the most vulnerable. Unicef director Manuel Fontaine said children were being targeted in their homes, schools and playgrounds. He said such brutality ""cannot be the new normal"". The report highlights several conflict zones,externalwhere it said children had suffered in the past year. It included: In the Central African Republic, children were killed, raped, abducted and recruited by armed groups in a dramatic increase in violence Islamist militants Boko Haram forced at least 135 children in north-east Nigeria and Cameroon to act as suicide bombers, almost five times the number in 2016 Muslim Rohingya children in Myanmar suffered ""shocking and widespread violence"" as they were driven from their homes in Rakhine state In South Sudan, more than 19,000 children were recruited into armed forces and armed groups Fighting in Yemen has left at least 5,000 children dead or injured according to official figures, with the real number expected to be much higher In eastern Ukraine, 220,000 children are living under the constant threat from landmines and other unexploded devices left over from the war ""Children are being targeted and exposed to attacks and brutal violence in their homes, schools and playgrounds,"" said Mr Fontaine, Unicef's director of emergency programmes. ""As these attacks continue year after year, we cannot become numb. Such brutality cannot be the new normal."" In Aleppo, Syria, Unicef gave children literature on reporting unexploded ordnance The report says that in some places, children abducted by extremist groups suffer further abuse when they are released to security forces. Millions more children suffer from malnutrition, disease and trauma when access to food, water, sanitation and health is prevented by fighting, it says. Central African Republic: The country where teachers disappear The children who fled Boko Haram Myanmar Rohingya: What you need to know ""Unicef calls on all parties to conflict to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools and hospitals,"" the reports adds. ""Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.""

Landlady disappearance a '20-year burden',"This video can not be played Missing pub landlady a '20-year burden' for sister The sister of a pub landlady who vanished in 1997 has said the unsolved murder is a ""20-year burden"" that ""blackens"" her heart. Deborah Steel, 37, went missing after an evening shift at the Royal Standard in Ely, Cambridgeshire. The case, classified as amurder inquiry in 2014, has seen two addresses excavated and three people arrested. No-one has ever been charged. Gini Secker, 54, said she has a ""little cry"" for her sister every Christmas. Gini Secker says the mystery of her sister's disappearance 'blackens her heart' ""I've always been a massive lover of Christmas, but it fills me with sadness now,"" she said. ""I still buy her presents every year - they're all in the bottom of my wardrobe - but I know when I buy them that she's never going to have them. ""It's a 20-year burden."" Three men, then aged 50, 70 and 73, all from Ely, were arrested during the investigation - but released with no action taken in 2015. Detectives believe Ms Steel was murdered in Longfields, Ely where she had taken a taxi for the mile-long journey home on 28 December 1997. Bulldozers unearth the garden at Deborah Steel's home in Longfields in 2014 Excavatorspeeled back the patio areaof the pub and the garden of her home in Longfields but nothing was found. Ms Steel was not reported missing for several days after leaving the pub. Her partner, Brian McDermott, had thought she had travelled without notice to visit friends in London, as she had done before. Mrs Secker, who runs a pub in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, said: ""She was popular, bubbly, flirtatious - my best friend. ""The pub was doing well, she had money in the bank, properties. She'd have seen pound signs at this time of year."" Deborah Steel's 1997 disappearance became a murder inquiry in 2014 Mrs Secker said she was certain her sister had been murdered. ""One hundred per cent, she's been murdered,"" she said. ""It blackens my heart."" Police say Ms Steel had no reason to disappear - having secured finance on a new catering business. Det Ch Insp Adam Gallop, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: ""If you live in the UK you leave a footprint somewhere, it's very difficult to disappear. ""But there is no sign that Debbie is alive. She had plans in life, she had aspirations. ""I really believe that she was murdered and her body concealed somewhere, within easy travelling distance of Ely."" Deborah Steel's father's dying words were an appeal to find her Mrs Secker said the most heartbreaking moment was an appeal from their father, Bill, on his deathbed in 2010. ""Debbie was a very hard person and a bit of a rebel when she was younger - but dad didn't love her any less,"" she said. ""It broke his heart when she went missing. His last words were 'Find out what happened to my girl'. He never gave up looking for an answer but I think he gave up on ever seeing her alive.""

Dozens killed in Kabul suicide attack,"This video can not be played ""My face was burning"", one man told reporters At least 41 people have been killed and more than 80 wounded in a suicide bomb attack in the Afghan capital, Kabul. A Shia cultural organisation was the target but the Afghan Voice news agency was also hit. So-called Islamic State said it was behind the attack. The interior ministry told the BBC an explosion at the Shia centre was followed by at least two more blasts. IS has been behind a number of attacks on Shia targets across the country in recent months. Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new ""Great Game"" IS in Afghanistan: How successful has the group been? The main blast went off inside the Tabayan cultural centre, but offices of Afghan Voice are also at the location of the attack. Dust blows down a street after one of the explosions Students were among those who had gathered at the Shia centre for a discussion forum. The interior ministry said the event was to mark the 38th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The initial explosion was followed by at least two others, although the ministry said these did not cause any fatalities. The health ministry's latest figures say 41 people died and 84 were hurt, with women and children among the casualties. Student Mohammad Hasan Rezayee told Tolo News: ""We were inside the hall in the second row when an explosion from behind took place. After the blast there was fire and smoke inside the building and everyone was pleading for help."" Another witness, Sayed Jan, told reporters from his hospital bed: ""There was a book reading event and academic discussion, and I was one of the participants. During the speech a huge bang was heard and smoke rose from inside the hall. ""My face was burning. I fell down from the chair and I saw the other colleagues around me on the ground. The smoke was everywhere."" Sayed Abbas Hussaini, a journalist at Afghan Voice, told Reuters that one reporter at the agency had been killed and two wounded. Distraught relatives gathered at local hospitals, which are treating the dozens of wounded people. The Islamic State group said on its propaganda outlet Amaq that it had targeted the Shia centre with a suicide bomber and other bombs. The Taliban had earlier issued a statement saying they were not involved. The Taliban are not known to specifically target Shias, although both militant groups have carried out frequent attacks across the country. Analysis: Zia Shahreyar, BBC Persian, Kabul In recent months IS has attacked many Shia targets in the west of Kabul, where the majority of the city's Shia population live. The Tabayan centre also has offices in the Iranian cities of Tehran and Mashhad and is believed to have close ties with religious and cultural centres in Iran. There are growing fears that IS is trying to spark a Sunni-Shia sectarian war in Afghanistan and the Shia community is increasingly dissatisfied with President Ashraf Ghani's government for failing to protect them. US-led foreign forces meanwhile continue to engage IS in eastern Afghanistan and President Trump, in his new Afghan strategy, has pledged to root out IS in the country, as it has been in Iraq and Syria. IS announced the establishment of its ""Khorasan"" branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015. It initially gained ground in the east and north, although it has lost territory there and was largely eliminated from southern and western Afghanistan by the Taliban and operations conducted by Afghan and US/Nato forces. Afghan security forces have been battling IS fighters, but the group has survived the onslaught IS has since resorted mainly to guerrilla tactics and is estimated to have a force of between  1,000 and 5,000 fighters. IS considers Shia apostates and aims to turn the conflict in Afghanistan into a sectarian war between Sunnis and Shias. In October, at least 39 people were killed in an attack on a mosque belonging to the Shia minority. In April, the US said it haddropped the ""Mother of All Bombs"" on IS in eastern Afghanistan, but the group continues its attacks. President Ashraf Ghani's spokesman issued a statement describing the latest attack as an ""unpardonable"" crime against humanity. Amnesty International's South Asia director, Biraj Patnaik, said: ""This gruesome attack underscores the dangers faced by Afghan civilians. In one of the deadliest years on record, journalists and other civilians continue to be ruthlessly targeted by armed groups."" Nato's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan called the attack ""heinous"". It is unclear whether Afghan Voice was a specific part of the target, but it has been a difficult year for the media. Afghanistan remains one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists and media workers. In November, IS said it was behinda gun attack on the Shamshad TV station that killed one staff member. In May, two media workers, including a BBC driver, were killed in a massive bomb attack in Kabul. The first six months of 2017 saw a surge in violence against journalists, with local monitorthe Afghan Journalists Safety Committee,externalrecording 73 cases, an increase of 35% in comparison to the same period in 2016. Last year seven members of staff from the private Tolo television station were killed in a Taliban suicide bombing in Kabul. Who has troops in Afghanistan?

Fears raised over Syria child evacuations,"This video can not be played Campaigners are covering their eyes in solidarity with baby Karim A senior UN official says he fears children waiting to be evacuated from the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area near the Syrian capital, Damascus, are being used as bargaining chips. The UN's humanitarian co-ordinator, Jan Egeland, told the BBC he believed that rebels had agreed to free government workers in exchange for the children. Another 12 patients were evacuated on Wednesday, following four on Tuesday. Thirteen more urgent cases are expected to be evacuated on Thursday. News of the latest evacuations from the Eastern Ghouta came in a tweet from the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), a medical relief organisation that supports hospitals in rebel-held Syria.

However, SAMS advocacy manager Mohamad Katoub told the BBC that it was hard to keep up with who needed to be evacuated as people continued to die. ""The last one was a girl from the list, from the 29. This morning, when the local staff reached the family to tell them that finally the approval to evacuate your little daughter arrived, the family said that our daughter died a few days ago."" Mr Katoub also tweeted that a 13th patient had refused to be evacuated on Wednesday,externalbecause he was concerned about being arrested by the Syrian government. ""No safety guarantees were given to the patients,"" he added. About 400,000 residents in the war-torn district have been under siege by government forces since 2013. ""Let's hope that the agreements are good when they come,"" Mr Egeland told the BBC. ""There can also be bad agreements. It is a not a good agreement if they exchange sick children for detainees that means children become bargaining chips in some tug of war. That shouldn't happen. They have a right to the evacuation and we have an obligation to evacuate them."" The main rebel group in the Eastern Ghouta, Jaysh al-Islam, said on Wednesday that the government had agreed to the evacuations in exchange for the release of 29 of its prisoners. Mr Egeland said those still in the Eastern Ghouta had very little left in the way of medical facilities. ""The Syrian war has been a war against the medical profession in many ways,"" he said. ""Too many hospitals have been bombed, have been hit on both sides, hundreds of doctors and nurses have been killed or wounded so what is left in Eastern Ghouta for the 400,000 civilians is not that much."" The Eastern Ghouta has been designated a ""de-escalation zone"" by the Syrian government's main allies, Russia and Iran, along with Turkey, which backs the opposition. But hostilities intensified six weeks ago when the Syrian military stepped up attacks in response to a rebel offensive, reportedly killing dozens of civilians. Scale of attacks on children in conflict zones ""shocking"" 'Critical point' in Syria's Eastern Ghouta Why is there a war in Syria? There are also severe shortages of food, fuel and medicines, and the cold weather is threatening to worsen the hardship. On Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed that four critically ill people had been taken with their families to hospitals in Damascus, and that it hoped a total of 29 people would be evacuated ""over the coming few days"". ""The operation is clearly a positive step that will give some respite to the people in Eastern Ghouta, especially those who are in dire need of life-saving medical treatment,"" spokeswoman Anastasia Isyuk told the BBC. ""We hope this medical evacuation will only be the beginning of more to come, as there are many more people in need. It is also vital for humanitarian organisations to reach people in Eastern Ghouta with aid on a regular basis and without conditions."" Last week, Mr Egeland said 494 people were on the priority list for medical evacuations submitted in November. He said the number was going down, not because people were being evacuated but because people were dying. Race to rescue injured Syrian baby.

Rescuing the lost children of IS,"Tens of thousands of foreign fighters joined so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria - many of them from Russia. What has become of their families now the self-declared caliphate is crumbling? In the breakfast room of Baghdad's grandest hotel, among the businessmen and official delegations, they look so out of place - four pale-faced children, aged between about three and six. They're wolfing down their bowls of cereal with determination, but in silence. You can tell they're not on a family holiday. There are two women sitting with them, one nursing a small baby. But unlike the children, the women look Iraqi - and the body language is strangely distant. The children seem lost, mistrustful. Suddenly, several important-looking men in suits at the next table glance at their watches. They stand up and motion to the women and children - who hurry off behind them as they stride down the hotel's marble-lined corridors. Outside, two big cars are waiting. Security men in camouflage fatigues and dark glasses mutter into walkie-talkies as they hustle the children in, along with one of the women - they're hired nannies - who's holding the baby. The guards jump in too, the doors slam, and the cars head off in close convoy for the airport. The children in the hotel What I've been watching is Russia, its diplomats and intelligence agents - plucking some of its youngest citizens from the maelstrom of post-war Iraq - and taking them home. They're three brothers and two sisters - and I'll see them again that evening, on Russian television, at the end of their journey, being led or carried down the steps of a plane by one of the men who was at the next table at breakfast. Cameras flash, the children, looking completely dazed, are handed over to relatives wailing with joy, and the man - in his 50s, tall and imposing with a clipped white moustache but strangely soft, diffident face - struggles through an interview until he too is overcome by emotion. His name is Ziyad Sabsabi - a Russian politician and official envoy to the Middle East of the president of Chechnya, Russia's southern, Muslim republic. Late the night before, I sat with him on a sofa at the hotel as he scrolled through pictures and videos on his phone - footage of the boys and girls in the Baghdad orphanage he'd taken them from - and of scores of other children, a few he's already rescued, many more still missing. With me too, he breaks into tears as he talks about them. Ziyad Sabsabi brings back a child from Syria to Chechnya They're the children of men who left their country to bring death and destruction to Iraq and Syria, volunteer fighters for so-called Islamic State, guilty of or complicit in horrific crimes. But, as this weirdly unofficial-seeming official asks again and again, what have they, the children, done wrong? Their mothers, he says - young Russian Muslim women - were usually tricked by their husbands into travelling to join IS. They apparently thought they were going on holiday, or to work, in Turkey - but were then taken across the border into Syria or Iraq. Listen to Tim Whewell's documentary on the lost children of IS on BBC Radio 4's Crossing Continents at 11:00 GMT on Thursday 7 December Or catch up late onthe BBC iPlayer Now, with IS largely defeated on the battlefield, those husbands are mostly dead or imprisoned, their wives and children missing without trace. Hundreds of families of foreign IS fighters are detained in Iraq, but their names haven't all been disclosed yet, even to relatives. Children like the ones I saw, who were taken to orphanages, whom Ziyad Sabsabi has been able to identify and get permission, after long negotiations, to repatriate - are the lucky ones. As for the others, I've talked by phone to some of their grandmothers - middle-aged women in Chechnya desperate for news of daughters and grandchildren. One is a woman I'll call Zamira. Her daughter Seda called her regularly for two and half years - first from Syria, where she was living with one fighter husband, and then, after he was killed, from Iraq where she lived with a second. Seda and her daughter But as Iraqi forces advanced steadily towards the centre of Mosul, in July - and bombs rained down - the phone went silent. Since then, Zamira has had no idea whether her daughter, and two small grandchildren, are alive or dead. Even now, she doesn't doubt her daughter's innocence. ""Seda tried again and again to persuade her husband to come back,"" she insists. ""But once they were there, they were trapped."" When Seda is found - if she is - the Russian state might not agree. Some repatriated IS widows have been arrested on arrival back home. And yet Chechnya's repressive leader Ramzan Kadyrov insists it's a point of honour to bring back all children of the fatherland. But the campaign may take years. In the Baghdad hotel he returns to on mission after mission, Kadyrov's envoy Sabsabi, scrolls on through the chain of angelic faces he's searching for - and wipes away another tear.

IS a success in Afghanistan?,"IS's Afghanistan chief Hafiz Saeed Khan was killed in a US air strike in July last year Amid a rise in attacks in Afghanistan attributed to the so-called Islamic State (IS), the BBC's Dawood Azami examines what kind of threat the militant group poses in the conflict-hit nation and the wider region. IS announced the establishment of its Khorasan branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015. It was the first time that IS had officially spread outside the Arab world. Within a few weeks, the group appeared in at least five Afghan provinces, including Helmand, Zabul, Farah, Logar and Nangarhar, trying to establishpockets of territory from which to expand. It was the first major militant group to directly challenge the Afghan Taliban's dominance over the local insurgency. Its first aim was to drive Afghan Taliban fighters out of the area and it also hoped to evict Taliban ally al-Qaeda from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, or absorb its fighters. Yet despite efforts to energise battle-weary militants, IS struggled to build a wide political base and the indigenous support it expected in Afghanistan. Instead, it made enemies of almost everyone, including the Afghan Taliban. In the first half of 2015, IS managed to capture large chunks of territory in eastern Nangarhar province. This became the de facto ""capital"" principally for two reasons - its proximity to the tribal areas of Pakistan, home of IS Khorasan's top leaders, and the presence of some people who follow a similar Salafi/Wahhabi interpretation of Islam to IS. IS is also trying to get a foothold in northern Afghanistan, where it aims to link up with Central Asian, Chechen and Chinese Uighur militants. But it has largely been eliminated from southern and western Afghanistan by the Afghan Taliban and military operations conducted by Afghan and US/Nato forces. Six Red Cross workers were killed earlier this month in northern Afghanistan by suspected IS militants It has also lost territory in eastern Afghanistan in recent months. But it still has control over some parts of Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, where it plans attacks and trains fighters. Small IS pockets have also been reported in Zabul and Ghazni, as well as a few northern provinces. Since its emergence in Afghanistan, IS has lost hundreds of militants in US air strikes and ground fighting with the Afghan military. Meanwhile, several hundred IS fighters have been killed in clashes with the Afghan Taliban. Around a dozen top leaders of the group's Afghanistan-Pakistan branch, including founding leader Hafiz Saeed Khan, a former Pakistani Taliban commander, and his deputies, have been killed in Afghanistan, mostly in US drone attacks. Estimates about IS's numerical strength inside Afghanistan vary, ranging from 1,000 to 5,000. US General John Nicholson, the top commander of US and Nato troops in Afghanistan, estimates that between 1,000 and 1,500 IS fighters are in Afghanistan. He says their number has been cut in half, from an estimated 3,000, by military operations over the past year or so. Afghan security forces have been battling IS fighters, but the group has survived the onslaught He adds that about 70% of those fighters come from the Pakistani Taliban group (TTP), some of whom moved to Afghanistan after the Pakistani military launched an operation in North Waziristan tribal area in 2014. But Afghan security officials insist that 80% of IS militants are Pakistanis. The other members were part of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), a group focused on Central Asian countries, and former Afghan Taliban or new recruits, they say. IS has so far survived the onslaught and it seems the group is attracting new recruits to replace those killed. After losing territory, IS Khorasan is emulating its Middle East counterparts by resorting to guerrilla tactics such as suicide attacks, targeted killings and the use of IEDs. It says it carried out some of the deadliest recent attacks in Afghanistan, several of them in the capital, Kabul. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed around 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. All of these attacks targeted minority Shia Muslims. IS has also claimed responsibility for attacks in other parts of the country and has killed civilians, including tribal elders and religious scholars opposed to its extreme ideology and brutal tactics. Nato estimates that there are between 1,000 and 1,500 IS fighters in Afghanistan Like its counterparts in the Middle East, IS Khorasan has taken violence to new levels, even by the bloody standards of the region. While al-Qaeda introduced suicide bombings into the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, IS brought new and more ruthless tactics. In one notorious example an IS video released in August 2015 showed 10 blindfolded community elders in Achin district in Nangarhar being forced to sit on holes in the ground filled with explosives. They were then blown to pieces. Beheadings and abductions, including of women and children, are other tactics. In addition, IS propaganda on the internet and air waves is strong. The group has several Twitter and Facebook accounts and has been broadcasting on an FM radio station in Nangarhar since December 2015. Radio Caliphate can be heard in Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, as well as adjacent parts of Pakistan. The station was once hit in a US airstrike but was back on air within a few weeks. IS has also carried out attacks in Pakistan, where it relies mainly on the support of certain anti-Shia sectarian groups. The first major attack in Pakistan for which IS claimed responsibility was in May 2015 when about 40 minority Shias were killed in a gun attack on a bus in the country's biggest city, Karachi. On 16 February, IS said it carried outan attack on the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar Sufi shrinein the town of Sehwan in Sindh province. Police say 90 people were killed. The attack at the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar Sufi shrine shocked Pakistan The conflict in Afghanistan has been going on for nearly four decades, but the country has largely remained immune to the sectarian violence that has hit other regional nations. IS, however, aims to turn the conflict in Afghanistan into a sectarian war between the majority Sunnis and minority Shias, as it has tried in Syria and Iraq. Shias are considered apostates by IS, which follows an austere version of Sunni Islam. The new 'Great Game' in Afghanistan Pakistan's bloody week: Who is to blame? Islamic State group: The full story Although IS has also killed many of its Sunni opponents, it has clearly stated sectarian goals in a number of its attacks. Justifying the July 2016 attack on the Shia rally in Kabul, IS called it retaliation for the activities of Afghan Shia Hazaras who have gone to Syria via Iran to fight for the government of President Bashar al-Assad, an Alawi-Shia, against the Islamic State group. Deliberate attacks by IS against Shia in Afghanistan add a dangerous complication to the conflict. The future of IS in Afghanistan and Pakistan is in many ways linked to the fate of IS in Syria and Iraq. Western and Afghan military officials confirm the group has financial ties to, and is in communication with, the main IS leadership. It also has contacts with IS cells operating in South and Central Asian countries. So far, IS has not been able to carry out attacks outside Afghanistan and Pakistan. But the group has many sympathisers in the region. Additionally, thousands of volunteers from nine South and Central Asian states - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight for IS. They have been trained and radicalised there. The return of these militants will pose a new threat and might strengthen the existing IS infrastructure in the region. Such developments further complicate the conflict in Afghanistan and pose a long term risk to regional stability. Regional powers, such as Russia, China and Iran, are concerned about the threat that IS poses to their internal security. These powers have established contacts withthe Afghan Taliban, which is fighting IS, to hedge against the potential risk. Mutual mistrust is preventing regional players from reaching a consensus to end the conflict in Afghanistan. Six Afghan ICRC workers 'killed by IS' Pakistan's bloody week: Who is to blame?

Yemen: Who is fighting whom?,"Thousands of civilian deaths have reportedly been the result of Saudi-led coalition air strikes The warring sides in Yemen are swapping hundreds of prisoners - a move which has built hopes for a permanent ceasefire between the Saudi-backed government forces and the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The eight year-long civil war has led to the deaths of thousands of Yemenis, and created a major humanitarian crisis. In 2011, a popular uprising in Yemen forced its long-standing authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. However, the new president was overwhelmed with Yemen's economic problems, and security problems such as attacks by jihadists. Furthermore, most of Yemen's armed forces felt more loyalty to the ousted president than they did to Mr Hadi. Ali Abdullah Saleh (R) was forced to hand over power to Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi (L) The Houthis took advantage of his weakness. Formally known as the Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), they champion Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority. In early 2014, they seized control of Saada province, in the north of the country and then captured the nation's capital, Sanaa, forcing President Hadi to flee abroad in March 2015. A Saudi-led multinational coalition intervened in the conflict in Yemen in March 2015 Yemen's neighbour Saudi Arabia was alarmed by the prospect of the Houthis taking control of Yemen, fearing it would become a satellite of Saudi Arabia's rival, Iran. In March 2015, it and other Arab states began an air campaign aimed at ousting the Houthis and restoring Mr Hadi's government. The coalition received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France. In August 2015, coalition ground troops landed in the port city of Aden and drove the Houthis out of the south of Yemen. However, they could not dislodge them from Sanaa or the north of the country. Yemen's official government is now in Aden, while President Hadi himself is based in Saudi Arabia. The Houthis allied with the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to form a ""political council"" to govern the area under their control. However, in December 2017, Saleh broke with the Houthis and called for his followers to fight them. Saleh was killed and the Houthis defeated his forces. In 2018, the Saleh loyalists joined the Saudi-led coalition. Together, they launched a major offensive against the Houthis to recapture the Red Sea city of Hudaydah. The port there is the principal lifeline for millions of Yemenis at risk of famine. After six months of fierce fighting, the two sides agreed a truce in the city. In 2021, the Houthis launched an attack on Marib, the government's last stronghold in the north and the centre of an oil-rich province. Fighting escalated in March this year across the province, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes. This video can not be played 'Double tap' attacks in Yemen's civil war The Houthis have attacked targets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE with ballistic missiles and drones, targeting sites including oil installations but also injuring civilians. Saudi and US officials have accused Iran of smuggling weapons such as drones to the Houthis, in violation of a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied the allegation. The Saudi-led coalition has carried out thousands of air strikes which have killed tens of thousands of people, according to the UN. These include ""double tap"" attacks, in which the first strike hits a group of enemy troops and the second one hits the people who go to their rescue. The UN says both sides in the civil war may have committed war crimes. Both sides deny the allegation. In April 2022, the UN brokered a ceasefire between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi rebels, though the sides failed to renew it six months later. However they recently agreed to swap approximately 900 prisoners as a confidence measure which it is hoped could lead to a permanent ceasefire. Saudi-Houthi talks bring hope of Yemen ceasefire Four million people have been forced to flee their homes The UN says Yemen is experiencing the world's worst humanitarian crisis. It says 4.5 million people, one in seven of the population, have been displaced. while 24.1 million people, 80% of the population, are in need of humanitarian aid and protection. The UN says that tens of thousands of people in Yemen are currently living in famine-like conditions, while some six million people are on the verge of famine. More than 10,000 children have been killed in the fighting, according to the UN The UN estimated that by the start of 2022, the conflict in Yemen had caused over 377,000 deaths, with 60% the result of hunger, lack of healthcare and unsafe water. It says more than 11,000 children are known to have been killed or wounded as a direct result of the fighting. Yemen has also suffered from one of the largest cholera outbreaks ever recorded, with 2.5 million suspected cases and about 4,000 related deaths since 2016.

Robots at work 'could worsen wage inequality',"The IPPR said robots would not take all our jobs, but could increase pay inequality The government must intervene to stop automation driving up wage inequality, a think tank has warned. The Institute for Public Policy Research said,externalrobots would not necessarily be bad for the economy. However, it warned lower-skilled jobs were much more likely to be phased out in the coming decades, and only higher-skilled workers would be able to command better wages. The government said it was committed to making automation work for everyone.

Airline sorry over 'blanket theft' claimAmerican Airlines wrongly accused two professional basketball players of stealing first class blankets.3h3 hours agoBusiness,"American Airlines has apologised to two professional basketball players who were kicked off a flight after being wrongly accused of theft. Marquis Teague and Trahson Burrell boarded a plane on Christmas Eve, en route to a game. But before take off, a flight attendant claimed the men had taken blankets from the first class cabin, and they were forced off the plane. It later emerged the pair had been given the blankets by passengers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Both of the basketball players are African American, as was the flight attendant involved. Neither of the athletes, who play for the National Basketball Association's minor league team Memphis Hustle, has commented on the incident. But Hustle assistant coach Darnell Lazere tweeted that he believed the incident was driven by race. The players were flying from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Sioux Falls, South Dakota on a flight operated by Envoy Air, a subsidiary of American Airlines. American Airlines spokesman Joshua Freed said the carrier was now reviewing the incident. Marquis Teague (left) and Trahson Burrell (right) have yet to comment. ""We apologise for what occurred on this flight. We take pride in bringing people together, and we know that on this flight we let some of our customers down,"" he said. Mr Teague and Mr Burrell were given first class tickets and flown to their final destination on a later flight. Their team won the Christmas Day game against Sioux Falls Skyforce  131-115, with Burrell scoring 15 points and Teague getting 11. American Airlines has been trying to address accusations of bias in the way it has treated some customers. In October, the civil rights group NAACP warned of ""a pattern of disturbing incidents reported by African-American passengers, specific to American Airlines"". The carrier later pledged to put its 120,000 employees through new training.

Syrian children in 'toxic stress',"At least three million Syrian children under the age of six have known nothing but war Millions of Syrian children could be living in a state of ""toxic stress"" due to prolonged exposure to the horrors of war, aid group Save the Children says. The damage to an entire generation of children could soon become irreversible without immediate help, it adds. The stress of war has led to increased bedwetting, self-harm, suicide attempts and aggressive behaviour among many children, according to a new report. The findings are based on hundreds of interviews in Syria. Save the Children says its study is the largest of its kind into the mental health and well-being of Syria's children amid the war, which began in 2011 and has left more than 300,000 people dead. The report,Invisible Wounds,external, reveals a ""terrifying mental health crisis among children trapped in Syria"". Save the Children spoke to more than 450 people in seven of Syria 14 governorates as part of its study, including children of varying ages, parents, caregivers, social workers, aid workers and teachers. It found: Almost all children and 84% of adults said that bombing and shelling was the number one cause of psychological stress for children Two-thirds of children have either lost a loved one, had their house bombed or shelled, or been injured as a result of the war, according to adults interviewed (some had suffered more than one of these traumatic events) 71% of interviewees said that children were increasingly suffering from frequent bedwetting and ""involuntary urination"" - symptoms of toxic stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 48% of adults said they had seen children who had lost their ability to speak or begun to suffer from speech impediments since the war began Nearly half of those interviewed said children ""regularly or always have feelings of grief or extreme sadness"" Some 2.3m children have fled Syria, and at least three million children under the age of six have known nothing but war, the report says. Toxic stress can disrupt the development of the brain and other organs and increasing the risk of addiction and mental health disorders in adulthood, said Alexandra Chen, a child protection and mental health specialist at Harvard University. This video can not be played Syrian kids explain the war ""After six years of war we are at a tipping point, after which the impact on children's formative years and childhood development may be so great that the damage could be permanent and irreversible,"" said Dr Marcia Brophy, a senior mental health adviser with Save the Children. ""The risk of a broken generation, lost to trauma and extreme stress, has never been greater."" Hisham and his five children fled their home in Deir al-Zour Hisham (not his real name) is a school teacher from the eastern city of Deir al-Zour, which is partially held by IS and partially by the government. He, his wife and five children have now fled to the al-Hol refugee camp. When the war first started, he said, children in Deir al-Zour found the sounds of shelling entertaining, like a game, until their relatives and people they know started dying. Soon, they were spending all their time on the streets ""because there was nothing to keep them occupied"", including schools. His oldest child is nine, but ""doesn't even know how to add one plus one"". ""The children have seen all kinds of violence,"" he says. ""They saw some of the violence through the television or the mobile, and some in real life. They saw things happening live, real things in front of them. You wouldn't even see most of the things they have seen in films."" Source: Save the Children Research for the report was carried out in areas where Save the Children and its local partner organisations are able to work, which the group says are mainly opposition-held areas. The report adds however that children in areas under control of the government or so-called Islamic State (IS) - where Save the Children is unable to operate - ""are also likely to be experiencing traumatic events"". The aid group says that despite its pessimistic findings, the evidence suggested that it was not too late for the right support to be provided. It said mental health and psychosocial support programmes were showing success and needed to be ""scaled up"" across Syria, with support from the international community.

UK enjoyed 'greenest year ever' in 2017,"Wind farms helped the UK experience its first coal-free day since the Industrial Revolution The UK has achieved its greenest year ever in terms of how the nation's electricity is generated, National Grid figures reveal. The rise of renewable energy helped break 13 clean energy records in 2017. In June, for the first time, wind, nuclear and solar power generated more UK power than gas and coal combined. Britain has halved carbon emissions in the electricity sector since 2012 to provide the fourth cleanest power system in Europe and seventh worldwide. In April, the UK had its first 24-hour period without using any coal power since the Industrial Revolution. The government iscommitted to phasing out unabated coal by 2025as part of efforts to cut the UK's greenhouse gas emissions in line with legal obligations. Separate findings from power research group MyGridGB show that renewable energy sources provided more power than coal for 90% of 2017, figures up to 12 December show. British wind farms produced more electricity than coal plants on more than 75% of days this year. This changing landscape saw thecost of offshore wind power fall below the price of nuclearfor the first time. But despite the successes, groups warned the UK must now tackle its reliance on gas if it is to meet its emission targets. The daily output of gas was outstripped by wind on just two days of the year. The UK must reduce its gas use to reach its emission targets Renewables overall - including wind, solar, biomass and hydropower - beat fossil fuels for only 23 days of the year. Dr Andrew Crossland from MyGridGB and the Durham Energy Institute said: ""The government has focused on reducing coal use which now supplies less than 7% of our electricity. ""However, if we continue to use gas at the rate that we do, then Britain will miss carbon targets and be dangerously exposed to supply and price risks in the international gas markets."" He added that ""refreshed government support for low carbon alternatives"" is now needed to ""avoid price and supply shocks for our heat and electricity supplies"". Emma Pinchbeck, executive director of Industry body RenewableUK, called for ""more boldness"" from the government. She urged onshore wind to be developed across the UK in an ""ambitious sector deal with the off shore wind industry"" that could help secure a ""golden age for renewables"" in 2018. An Energy Department spokesman said the UK was reducing emissions faster than any other G7 country - which includes the US, Japan, Germany, Italy, France and Canada. He said the government plans to reduce carbon emissions throughout the 2020s, while supporting the creation of well-paid jobs in the low carbon sector. ""The UK is a world leader in clean growth,"" he said.

"Household debt to keep rising, Labour says","Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says the ""alarming increase"" in average household debt is set to continue over the next four years. Labour warned unsecured borrowing could exceed Â£19,000 per household by 2022. The prediction comes from Labour's analysis of official data. It claims average household debt has risen from Â£10,921 in 2010 to Â£14,426 in 2017. The government said it was helping working families ""earn more and keep more of what they earn"". ""We are cutting taxes, increasing basic pay, freezing fuel duty and helping first-time buyers onto the housing ladder."" Unsecured household debt includes credit cards, bank loans, student loans and car loans but not mortgage debt. Reality Check: Has personal debt been growing? Labour analysed data from the Office for National Statistics and Office for Budget Responsibility. It has predicted that if household debt follows the current trajectory, it will increase to Â£15,035 next year and potentially to Â£19,146 by 2022. Labour obtained its figures by averaging the total amount of unsecured debt across all households. Mr McDonnell said: ""The alarming increase in average household debt already means many families in our country struggling over the Christmas period. ""The Tories have no real answers to tackle the debt crisis gripping our country, and have no solutions to offer those struggling to get by as prices run ahead of wages."" This analysis comes as the Resolution Foundation, an influential research group, said thatthe UK's pay squeeze will end next year,but a meaningful rise in wages remains out of sight.

Hogmanay 'volunteer' roles will be paid,"Organisers of Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations have agreed that about half the voluntary roles advertised at this year's event will now be paid. Plans to use more than 300 unpaid workers in ""Hogmanay ambassador"" rolessparked controversy last month. The event's organisers, Underbelly, were accused of exploitation. Following discussions with unions, it has been announced that supervisors and deputy managers will be paid at least the Scottish minimum wage of Â£8.75. It is understood that these roles will account for about half the voluntary posts originally advertised. A joint statement was issued by Underbelly, the Better Than Zero campaign, the Unite union and the STUC. It said: ""Edinburgh's Hogmanay has ceased advertising Hogmanay ambassador supervisors and deputy managers as volunteer roles and has instead moved them to paid positions. ""These roles will be paid at least the Scottish living wage. ""Non-supervisory Hogmanay ambassadors will still be part of the festival, albeit there will be fewer than initially estimated, and these volunteer roles continue to be advertised.""

He’s unarmed, but his fellow soldiers from the Iraqi police special forces - known as the Emergency Response Division - are armed to the teeth and are not taking any chances. A body and a pile of clothes on the banks of the Tigris Two of the IS fighters are clearly dead. One, most likely a boy, is buried under the rubble of concrete bunker. His small, blackened hand sticks out from mangled remains. Nearby, an older fighter lies in the grass. His eyes are open, but part of his head is missing. He died in the same airstrike that took out the bunker. But it is the third man, lying in the shadows, further ahead on the path alongside the River Tigris, who has the soldiers worried. Be careful … Look to his hand, maybe he has a grenade. Go slowly.” They fire a couple of shots into the prone figure. It does not move. “He is a son of a bitch, he was hiding. Be careful, be careful,” says one of the soldiers. “I don’t think he has a suicide vest,” says another. An Iraqi soldier investigates the scene They are at the foot of an olive grove, which is serving as the temporary base of the ERD as they push towards west Mosul, the last major redoubt of IS in Iraq. Up close I look upon the dead man. His right leg is mangled, sliced through to the bone. He appears to have crawled out of the bunker and found a small hiding place in the rocks by the riverside. Even in death his face is distinctive - a narrow chin and a puckish nose. His beard is wispy. He is more of a boy than a man. Nearby, soldiers find an M16 rifle which is marked as property of the US Government. Close up of the M16 machine gun It is likely to have been among the thousands of weapons and vehicles IS seized from retreating Iraqi forces when it swept through from Syria more than two years previously. “Adel, Adel, does anyone have ammunition? I want a full magazine,” says a fighter searching the dead man. The M16 now belongs to the man who found it. “We have to go, it isn’t safe here,” an officer tells me. The men are jumpy and want to return to the base. There are still other IS fighters in the area, they warn. It is late February and these men are in the midst of the battle of their lives. In three days they made lightning progress across the territory to the south of Mosul. Ahead of them the village of the Al-Buseif, then the ruined airport and the neighbourhoods of the west of the city. All would fall in rapid succession, but the closer to Mosul they come, the more IS fighters they encounter, and the more bodies end up strewn across the roads and pathways. It is already clear from the assault on the city’s east - it took 100 days - that IS prepared well for this fight. Mosul was turned into a giant arsenal, with weapons dumps and hideouts in every neighbourhood. Before we climb back up the hill to the base, I look again on the dead fighters. In the grass beside one, I find a small piece of paper marked with an IS stamp. It is a leave permission slip. On the back, it is smeared with his blood. IS leave permission slip The soldiers do one final check of the bodies. On the young man in the shadows, they find some cash - a small amount of Syrian pounds, almost worthless. But in his other pocket, there is something small and far more valuable - a memory card from a mobile phone. The pictures on it will lead us to uncover fragments of the lives of the dead men, the deep camaraderie among them, their brutality, and their journey through the battle for Mosul. And it will cast light on the dead fighter in the shadows. Who was this young man and what secrets of Islamic State did he leave behind? The photographs begin as bright family snapshots, but soon darken. The young man is seated, with the trace of a smile on his face. He is doe-eyed beside a little girl. Perhaps it is his sister. He holds her close, and she has her index finger raised - the Islamic sign for one true god. His hair is curly, long and parted in the middle, and as the pictures progress they have been edited. His cheeks and lips turned a girlish pink, the whites of his eyes are touched-up and bright. A transformation is taking place. Soon he is in military gear, a Kalashnikov slung over his shoulder, a walkie-talkie in his top pocket. In another photo, he is asleep. It is almost certainly posed, the intention is to show a warrior at rest. This is no longer a family album, it’s now a record of a martyr-to-be, a baby-faced suicide attacker, cleansed and ready to sacrifice himself for his cause. The memory card found on his body has other pictures, too.There is a group shot of young men and boys. The fighter is not in the frame. Maybe he is behind the camera, taking the shot. I would later learn that most of the men and boys were from Mosul and were part of the Nineveh Fire Support Group, a rear-line, back-up unit. Their time in IS has forged a deep bond between them. One of the most striking is a photograph of what appears to be the fighter’s brother-in-arms. This man looks older, his hair is long and is also parted. He stares intently at the camera. My eye is drawn to his hands, which are settled on his waist. Curiously, he is wearing black gloves. Underneath those hands, hidden by his shirt, there is a suicide belt. His thumbs rest on its bulge. The gloves are worn to hide the switch that will detonate the explosives, disguised so that the target does not recognise the threat posed by the smiling young man in khaki, until it is too late. There are group pictures, too, with older men. Battle-hardened and scarred, their faces are unforgettable. And to some in Mosul, they are familiar. But the photographs from the phone card have another secret to reveal, one that was right under my nose the entire time. The photographs begin as bright family snapshots but soon darken.

There are group pictures, too, with older men. Battle-hardened and scarred, their faces are unforgettable. And to some in Mosul, they are familiar. But the photographs from the phone card have another secret to reveal, one that was right under my nose the entire time. The men fighting in the battle for Mosul alternate between two states - the hyper vigilance of the battlefield and a swallowing exhaustion barely touched by a few hours sleep at night. As a journalist following the men, I slip into the same routine. Rising before dawn, driving to the front, watching as they dodge mortar and rocket fire, avoid roadside bombs and drones. And ducking when IS snipers and fighters open fire. At night there is barely time for my crew to edit, recharge our equipment, and get some sleep, before heading out again. Aerial footage of the farmhouse So we do not pay very close attention to our sleeping quarters. In short, it is dark, we are tired, and we have other priorities. All we know is they've been checked for booby traps and that we are relatively safe here. After almost two weeks at the farmhouse, the bodies of the three fighters still lie where they fell. But the dogs and birds are at their corpses. They are increasingly unrecognisable. As I go through the pictures from the mobile phone card again, the penny drops. These men did not just fight at the farmhouse. It was their home too. I recognise its walls and furnishings in some of the pictures. Discovering the hideout: On our last day at the front, with just a few hours to pack and return to the safety of Irbil, I decide to explore. Above my sleeping bag, there is a window. I remove the dusty curtain. Underneath are hidden notices from the caliphate, official IS orders. They show IS struggling for resources, especially manpower and that the caliphate’s ranks are depleting fast. On November 11, the Islamic State’s Minister for War calls for more special forces recruits. By mid-December, new orders are issued to prevent desertion from the front. Brothers are not allowed to retreat - use of force and commensurate violence allowed” At the back of a room, a blanket covers the wall. I can feel a draught from behind it, so I give it a sharp tug. In a cloud of dust, it falls away and reveals another room, small and bright, with a single window to a vegetable garden, and a bed. This is the dead men’s sleeping quarters. Their clothes, and much more besides, lie scattered across the floor. There is a Chelsea Football Club pillowcase lying beside IS wall posters, which list punishments for crimes in the caliphate. Electrical parts are stripped from sockets and flashlights, presumably for military purposes. In the midst of the mess, something catches my eye. It is an anti-fungal medicine box with a blond-haired baby pictured on the front. Its eyes are carefully gouged out. This defacement is likely because of an Islamic prohibition of the depiction of the human form. The room is filthy. Hidden in the piles of material, something important has been left behind. A few pages of detailed handwritten notes and diagrams are carefully folded. They clearly meant a lot to the author, his IS staff number is written in the corner, and in bold English letters, his name: Abu Ali Al Moslaue. Is this the name of the young man depicted in the photos? The handwriting is neat and careful in the beginning, and the notes are meticulous. They serve an important purpose, life and death, in fact. Abu Ali was learning how to fire mortars. It appears that he was an excellent and a diligent student. But like all schoolboys, he becomes more careless and erratic as the lessons drag on. But he takes pride in his work. He notes practice runs in converting coordinates from Google Maps to actual targeting coordinates. He draws compass degrees as well as the curved graph course of mortar rounds. Importantly, in the munitions section and in his own handwriting, he lists “chemical munitions” as a weapon. There’s been much debate over whether IS has used chemical weapons in Mosul. Here at least, we know they are trained and prepared to use them. He personalises his notes, sketching a logo for the unit and a makeshift IS stamp, labelled General Support Units. And there are mottos: “Islamic State: Along the Prophet’s Methodology” and “Islamic State remains, in spite of the haters”. He used an Education Department exam paper as his notebook, and clearly finds this amusing. He records the school year as 2016-17, Subject: Mortar, and scores his own paper: “Final Marks: Congratulations. You passed. Total Marks: 100.” The hideout has even more secrets to reveal. As I search through the detritus something catches my eye. It looks irrelevant at first. The notebook is in tatters, hanging by a thread. Someone has scribbled the same Islamic poem and a prayer verse several times over a few pages, as if to etch them into memory. There are mistakes, the handwriting is shabby, the structure unappealing. This definitely doesn't belong to Abu Ali. But then numbers emerge, names, tables, tabulations and permutations. Whoever scribbled those names and numbers had the authority to dispatch patrols, put men on shifts together, see how many rounds they fired and how many they need for their next outing. It definitely belongs to someone senior at that farmhouse, possibly the commander of those men. I discover his name is Abu Hashem. The notebook reveals its secrets - it is a unit’s logbook from the Al-Buseif Air Defence Brigade, a sub-unit of the Nineveh Fire Support Group. They must have all been sharing the same farmhouse. All in all, Abu Hashem commanded eight men and two vehicles. They formed the bulk of the Al-Buseif Air Defence mobile patrol. They drove a Hyundai pickup truck with a double-barrel anti-air cannon, and another pickup truck with a smaller calibre, single barrel heavy machine gun. Both vehicles were white, which is reportedly the preferred colour for Islamic State combat vehicles because they’re easier to camouflage with dirt and blend into the terrain. Commander Abu Hashem appears to have been diligent. He meticulously records the sorties, the types of weapons used, the chassis number of his trucks, how many rounds they had, their type, how many rounds fired - even the faulty ones. Not only was he a good logistician, but he also understood how small units worked. The record shows how he tried to foster and strengthen bonds between his men. Scheduling their lives, Abu Hashem made sure to couple fighters serving on the same vehicle to have meals together. And so, while he’s having lunch with Abu Riad, his driver, Abu Hafs, the driver of the other vehicle is paired with a gunner, Abu Al-Sham. The commander, his logbook shows, has clearly put some thought into this. He worked on two possible permutations, crossing off names before putting in a clean draft. The burden of command must have weighed heavily on Abu Hashem’s mind while commanding his troops. This, however, didn’t soften him up. Like any seasoned commander, he proved ready to show a tough disciplinary side. In one written order, he tasks one of his subordinates to lead a patrol. “Those who are found lacking must be punished,” he orders. “May Allah reward you with goodness,” wishing him well. Taking the photos and the bundles of documents with me, I leave the farmhouse and finally Iraq. But for months, the men remain in my head. Using what I already know about them, would I be able to find out more? Did they have families? What kind of lives had they led? My search to find out more about the men begins in Mosul. It is early April and the 1st Brigade of Iraq’s ERD forces are deep inside the west of the city. The farmhouse seems like a lifetime ago. Their new base, a house near the front lines is in a residential neighbourhood. The steady thump of mortar fire rattles what is left of the windows. Captured IS suspects are being brought here. One man is pulled from a pick-up truck by the fighters. He has been badly beaten. His T-shirt is covered in blood. It is not clear who hurt him. It may have been the troops, or it could have been locals exacting revenge on those who had controlled and oppressed them in the preceding years. An intelligence major calls me into a back room. “I have someone for you to meet, someone we haven’t shared with anyone else,” he says. A young, shifty-looking man, slight and dressed like an off-duty soldier comes into the room. Let's call him Ibrahim. He fought with IS for two years, but he is not a prisoner. He is a double agent, working for the Iraqi security forces. I show him the photos that I have brought from the farmhouse. Quentin speaks to Ibrahim: “I know them very well,” he says. “Those are fighters. They were with the Khaled Ibn Al-Walid Unit. This one was the section's commander,” he says pointing to one of the older men in the photographs. “They acted as a support unit for the front-line troops. They would spring into action as soon as they were needed.” Along with the intelligence major, he confirms the men were mostly from Mosul. Ibrahim reflects on what his membership of IS had done to him, and most likely to the men and boys in the pictures. I learned how to be tough. How to beat and kill without mercy. Especially with regards to prisoners” He notes that men from the Nineveh Fire Support Group lived spartan lives. “You should live like the Prophet, a simple life. A fighter needs very little to survive,” he says. It is clear from Ibrahim and others that I meet that most of the men and boys in the pictures are dead. Identifying all the men in the photographs has proved impossible. IS fighters use noms de guerre, but there was another factor at play. As one member of the Mosul's special forces team explains, ""When IS came they were children, we don't recognise them as men."" Long before their advance stalled around Mosul’s old city, Iraqi forces advanced far quicker than expected towards the city’s western side. And it appears it was much faster than the Nineveh Fire Support Group anticipated. Abu Ali and his brothers in arms had no time to destroy the material in their hideout. Their grasp of operational security was weak. A slip of paper discovered on the floor of the farmhouse turns out to be coordinates of locations across Mosul. Using Google Earth maps, I plot the information. I recognise one location - an IS mortar factory that I had visited in November 2016. The other coordinates are mortar storage and production units too, according to Iraq security forces. Source: Conflict Monitor by IHS Markit, territory assessed as credible on 19 June 2017 About a dozen men had worked at the factory producing precisely milled mortar shells. They had burned oil fires through holes in the building roof to hide it from coalition aircraft. By the time we return to the mortar foundry in April, it is cleared of the shells and returned to commercial use. Now it is making water tanks and roofing to replace those damaged in the fighting. In November, people were willing to talk about the IS fighters who made weapons there, but by April, a wariness has settled on east Mosul. Locals may be freed from IS, but it feels like the militants are not very far away. The fear of retribution hangs in the air. And it becomes easy to understand why when I make my way to the final destination in the journey to retrace the men of the Nineveh Fire Support Group. In amongst the papers and documents I retrieved from the farmhouse are a number of religious books. All are marked with the stamp of a mosque in east Mosul - one bearing the name of an imam has been dedicated to the young men. The Al Mou’meneen Mosque is not far from the mortar factory, and it is here that the group from the farmhouse prayed and brought terror to the local neighbourhood. The mosque is modest and mostly without adornment. It is a bright spring day, and children are making their way home from school. But I have a sense of trepidation as I knock on the metal door. Is the imam who dedicated the book to the fighters still inside? The caretaker answers and welcomes me inside. I take off my shoes and he sends a boy to find the imam. I sit waiting in the sunshine, drinking some sweet tea, listening to the children playing outside. The imam who signed the book is long gone, he fled with IS. So the caretaker calls to find the man who led prayers before IS took control of Mosul. The imam arrives, his name is Fares Fadel Ibrahim. He is younger than I expected, broad-shouldered and with a quiet confidence. I show him the pictures of the fighters and he recognises most of them. Quentin speaks to the imam: He is nervous, though, and I soon discover why. “Please,” he asks, “Do not film me looking at the pictures.” Why is he afraid of these young men? The fighters, he says, moved their entire families into this neighbourhood. Most were Iraqi, but there were foreigners, from Syria, Morocco and elsewhere, he says. They lived among them for more than a year and fled in November 2016 when Iraqi security forces advanced closer to the area. Mullah Fares is, he explains, the temporary imam until the Department of Religious Affairs appoints someone permanently. That said, it is clear that this is his mosque. He has prayed here since he was a boy - since the mosque was built in 1980. And then he preached there alongside the permanent imam, until IS came. “What happened to the permanent imam,” I ask. “They murdered him,” he replies. And replaced him with their own preacher - the man who dedicated the book to the fighters. He called them ""beloved darlings"". As we sit on the carpet together in the prayer hall, he explains the story of IS in Mosul and his neighbourhood. They corrupted the city, he says, and worse still, the world’s view of Islam. At first they treated people well, he explains. “They came with respect and appreciation and then their true intentions appeared.” For IS, the mosques are a means of control and of recruitment. Mullah Fares was given the option - join IS or stay at home and only return to the mosque he loved, to pray. So, he returned home. They came in the name of faith, the residents of Mosul love faith, so anybody that comes to us as a person of faith we welcome it. But the reality was one thing and truth was another.” IS set about a purge. Other preachers were accused of being “delaying salafies,” and were imprisoned for a month, or longer. When released they promised never to lead prayer again. Others, like the Al Mou’meneen’s permanent imam, were killed. Looking at the pictures of the young men from the Nineveh Fire Support Group, Mullah Fares pauses for a moment, then says: “The power is with the person who holds the gun, even if he is very small and young. Like the young men from ISIS [IS] who killed some strong and old men of ours, like the imam here in the mosque, who was killed by children.” It would soon be time for afternoon prayers and we have to finish the interview. Dozens of curious children are crowded around the mosque’s door, eager to get inside. But before Mullah Fares finishes, he has one more thing to say, about the young men who held this city. They distorted the image of Islam, and this thinking will remain.” He continues, “My dear brother, we are by nature people who love faith, young or old, we love Islam and Muslims. Even the prophet, while he encouraged invading different places, he ordered his men not to kill a child, a woman, or an old man, and not to cut down one tree. So where were these values of Islam?” And with that, he stands up and begins the call to prayer. From the sunshine outside, the waiting children burst through the doors and get ready for their lessons. The three dead fighters on the banks of the Tigris were little more than children. In fact, one was still a child. The Nineveh Fire Support Group were enthusiastic in their campaign of destruction and terror. They helped turn parts of their city into a ruin, and furthered the corruption of their faith. Did they die happy, knowing they had served their cause as was asked of them, I wonder. They died as fighters, but they died as fools. Pity should be reserved for the people they once lived among, who were abused and killed as the young men sacrificed all around them, for their caliphate. When they left Mullah Fares’ neighbourhood, they said to the people, “You did not take care of the caliphate, so you do not deserve it.” But the truth of their cause was revealed when IS went into homes and destroyed them, killing families. IS and the Nineveh Fire Support Group had no love for Mosul nor its people. The young fighters were willing recruits, but they were also manipulated. Quentin studies the photos: As I retrace their steps through Mosul, the thing that strikes me most of all is their youth. It surprised almost everyone we spoke to. For IS, a fighter is anyone above the age of 15, but some of their recruits are much younger. IS has had support in Mosul, but it inflated that support by weaponising children. Taking the young and the gullible and sacrificing them for its malicious cause. In Mosul, IS is on the brink of defeat. The bodies by the riverbank are gone - carried away by dogs and other animals. There is no longer any trace there of the young men. But their legacy of turmoil and destruction remains. It stretches far beyond Mosul, and far beyond the flow of the River Tigris. Built with Shorthand"
Could Jack and Paul have been saved?," Warning: This article contains details that some people will find very distressing. Jack was the older of the two. He was 12 and he was a musician. “Music ran through his veins like water runs down a stream.” He was a talented trumpet player. His music teachers thought he might go all the way. He dreamed of studying music at university. A lovely, quiet, gentle boy. Paul was cheeky and full of confidence. A good sportsman - a runner,  a sprinter. “I think he ran before he could walk.” Jackwas. Paulwas. Both are now dead. On Wednesday 22 October 2014 the boys were murdered by their father. Claire Throssell’s flat is full of photos and other reminders of her two sons. She will never forget the last time she saw them. Since then she has been fighting. Both to remember them but also to try to prevent a tragedy like this happening again. Claire had lived all of her life in a small market town in South Yorkshire. She met her husband Darren at a work function one evening and the relationship moved quickly. His attentive behaviour seemed to be just part of the intensity of a young relationship. There were regular flowers and phone calls. They married and children followed. The family were living in a house by a viaduct, a river and a park. But Claire began to realise something was wrong. Her husband was too “caring”. He was too interested in what she was up to. His behaviour was too intense. There started to be  something slightly sinister in his character. Claire now knows this wascoercive and controlling behaviour. It’s against the law in England and Wales, and Scotland moved to legislate this year. A law has been drafted in Northern Ireland but is yet to go through. Professionals are trained to look out for manipulative and controlling actions. It’s when a person, typically a partner, repeatedly behaves in a way which makes someone feel dependent, isolated or scared. Claire’s husband completely controlled her life. Repeated phone calls while she was at the supermarket, insults about how she looked, calling her stupid, distancing her from her friends and family, controlling the finances. “It had got to a point where I couldn't even look in the mirror and recognise the person that was looking back at me.  My self-confidence had gone.” The boys were becoming more and more cautious around their father. He imposed heavy discipline. With Paul, the younger, his father became bullying over his food - he was made to eat things he didn’t want to. One time he was forced into a chair to eat. The boys regularly saw their father insulting and shouting at their mother. “Jack in particular would say, 'Stop threatening my mum'.” It was April 2014 and after many years of this difficult life, Claire decided she was leaving for good. “The whole process was made even harder by the fact that he was very controlling and aggressive, and things deteriorated very quickly between us.” Her husband stayed in the marital home, while Claire and the boys moved into her mother’s house. Initially Claire and her husband agreed on shared custody, but her husband’s controlling and aggressive behaviour was escalating. He had a track record, having once been cautioned for assaulting a neighbour. The police were aware that there could be trouble. They put a high priority tag on Claire’s phone and her mother’s address - in the event of an emergency call, they would send an immediate response car. But Claire worried every time her boys went to see their father. In June, Paul became very upset at school. He told his teachers that his dad had hurt him in the past - dragging him along by the throat. This was the final straw. Claire applied for an emergency residency order to stop the shared custody of the boys. As well as Paul’s complaint, Claire’s submission included two remarks her husband had made to her - that “he had nothing to live for and intended to commit suicide” and that “he can understand fathers killing their children”. A court hearing concluded with an interim arrangement for much more limited access to the boys for Claire’s husband. Although he had agreed to this, along with Claire, this angered him further. Things really got out of control, because he'd lost control.” He took Claire’s belongings from the family home and threw them into the front garden of her mother’s house. Abusive texts and messages followed in a torrent. After he threatened to kill himself, Claire called the police. Even then he was trying to control Claire. He told the police that he would only talk to them if she came to the house as well. Claire always had a feeling that her estranged husband was capable of hurting the boys. She still questions whether she could have done more to prevent the contact visits they had with their father. “Things really got out of control, because he'd lost control.” The boys were allowed to see their father for five hours each week on Sunday afternoons and Wednesday after school, from August 2014. This was unsupervised. But Claire knew the boys didn’t want to spend any time with their father. By the middle of October 2014, the divorce had come through. Cafcass - the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service - was involved. Claire had warned the service that her estranged husband was often volatile and aggressive, especially when he was told things he didn’t want to hear. There had already been two hearings. The final one was set for 17 November 2014. A “Section 7” was requested. This report was to include the wishes and feelings of Jack and Paul so the judge could help make the decision about the boys’ contact with their father. It was expected to be ready two weeks before the November hearing. That hearing never happened. The morning of Wednesday 22 October 2014 started off the same as any other morning.  Claire went to drop Jack off at his grammar school.  She said “I love you”, as she always did. He called back, as he always did, with Buzz Lightyear’s line from Toy Story, “To infinity and beyond”. Jack always looked back once. But Claire remembers on that morning he turned and looked back a second time before walking into school. Claire dropped Paul off at his school. He had the exact same ritual as his brother. When she said “I love you”, he said, “To infinity and beyond”. She went to work. The boys were due to see their father after school. He had put a train track in the attic in the old family home. He had texted that morning saying he had two new trains for them, and all he needed was two drivers. Just before 5pm, Claire says she got a call from an officer at Cafcass. The officer later said the call was routine, but Claire gives a slightly different account of it. The boy’s father had come into Cafcass on Monday that week, two days before, and it hadn’t gone well. The Cafcass officer wanted to know - Claire recalls - if the visit between the boys and their father was going ahead. Claire said they were already there. The Cafcass officer suggested Claire keep an eye on them when they returned from the visit. It took 15 minutes for my life to end... and my existence to begin” When she got home from work, Claire felt deeply uneasy. There was a knock at the door. Claire’s mother said it would be the boys, back early. But the boys would never have knocked. They used to rush straight in. Claire found a policeman at the front door. “There's been an incident at the house.” She said: “He's done it hasn't he? He's done something to them.” The officer wouldn’t say more but the look on his face was enough. “I knew, I knew. “It took 15 minutes for my life to end... and my existence to begin” Jack and Paul had gone up into the attic to play with their new trains. Their father had blocked the front and back doors before setting fires all around the home. He joined them up in the loft, closing the hatch and trapping them. The first firefighter found Jack on the landing and picked him up. But he was already badly burned. He had tried to escape and get help for his brother. Despite his condition, he went on to reveal what had happened. “My dad did this and he did it on purpose.” He and his brother were rushed to Sheffield Children’s Hospital - Jack had 56% burns and Paul was unconscious. Their father was taken to another hospital in the city, where he died. A police car sped Claire to the hospital to see her children. “I went into a room and the consultant was drenched in sweat. “There was Paul and they were doing CPR on him. I knew pretty much that there was no hope.” The doctor stopped the CPR and Claire held Paul in her arms.  “My tears were in his hair. And his hair was damp. His eyes closed and it was just as if nothing... was looking back. “I promised him that no other parent would have to do what I did... and hold a child in their arms whilst they died, knowing it's at the hands of somebody who should love and protect them.” Jack was transferred to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital for specialist burns treatment. Claire stayed by his bedside for the next five days. She finally said goodbye on 27 October. That was the day that Jack had been due to give his views about his father for the Section 7 report. He never got the chance to be heard. Only a very small proportion of abusive spouses go on to commit murder. Each time though, questions are asked as to whether the authorities could have done more. There are serious case reviews. Claire feels that Cafcass let down her children. Claire learned from the police that the boys’ father had blocked the family liaison officer in her office on Monday 20 October - two days before the fire. Claire says that if only she’d been told promptly about that, she would never have allowed her sons to see their father later in the same week. Cafcass does acknowledge the meeting had to be stopped but doesn’t believe there was any indication that the boys' father might cause immediate harm to them. “Cafcass accepted the findings of the coroner and the serious case review, who agreed that the children died due to unlawful killing and that no public authority could have predicted or prevented the tragedy,” a spokesman says. “However, we do regret that some aspects of our work with Ms Throssell’s family did not meet the high standards we set for our staff.” Cafcass says it has now improved the way it assesses risk. “We continuously develop our practice and this year launched a Domestic Abuse Practice Pathway, which provides our staff with a clear, robust framework to assess cases involving domestic abuse.” Theserious case reviewinto Jack and Paul’s deaths at the hands of their father said: “The vast majority of estranged fathers would not consider such actions and... there is no known way of identifying those who will do so.” But while it is only a small minority who murder, there is a great deal of other harm that is done. Could more be done to put the interests of the children at the heart of how we deal with abusive relationships? Claire now spends her time campaigning and working with the charity Women’s Aid to highlight the effects that domestic violence and coercive behaviour have on children. The charity points to statistics that are sobering. Women’s Aid want the authorities to understand domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour. The group says that a joined-up response, early intervention and support are essential. Claire says that when children witness domestic abuse, it ends up “going into their whole being”. Jane (not her real name) knows exactly what Claire is talking about.  Jane has taken her children and left her controlling and physically abusive partner. She put up with nearly five years of terror. She knew this would affect the rest of her children’s lives. One night she fled with them in a taxi. Jane had been trapped in a life of control. The curtains had to remain shut, family days out didn’t exist. She was told what to wear, she was told who to speak to, and she was made to lie to social workers. She was not allowed to show affection to her children. Jane was left on her own, to care for her children as well as those from his extended family, while regularly being insulted. “Yeah I've had black eyes. Like he never outright punched me in the eye. But I've had elbows and knees… or my head would be bashed off something or stuff might be thrown at me. All of this happened while the kids were there.” As Jane recounts the desperate times, tears pour down her face. “You'd be in the middle of having this fight and you'd be looking at your kids, and you could just see the fear. You can't get out of the situation. I hated the fact that they were so confused by it.” Life was never normal. If the children ever expressed interest in a game or an activity, they were always made to feel it was wrong. They were never allowed to make a mistake. Jane’s case isn’t rare. Dame Vera Baird QC, Police and Crime Commissioner for the Northumbria police force area, has long campaigned about domestic abuse. She has been introducing changes. Northumbria Police was the first to carry out force-wide training on how to spot coercive and controlling behaviour. Dame Vera Baird, QC, Police and Crime Commissioner for the Northumbria police force area Now Dame Vera wants to focus on the court system and give more protection and understanding to victims. She believes there is a problem when access arrangements are being made for families where domestic abuse is prevalent. “The perpetrator can pursue them right or wrong through the family court and actually use that court really to carry out abuse and  continue the abuse.” The Ministry of Justice has accepted the law must change. “We will legislate to give family courts the power to stop abusers from cross-examining their victims in family proceedings,” a spokesman says. “And we are investing more than £1bn to modernise our courts system, to make it more sensitive and accessible to victims and witnesses.” Of course, there are those who think it's easy to go too far in criticising the family court system, and who point out their duty to try to make sure children have their parents in their lives. “Obviously there are tragic cases that have been dealt with by the Family Court and one death is too many,” says Chris Fairhurst, a family law specialist at Slater and Gordon, “but if you look at the private law cases alone that Cafcass is dealing with, it is in excess of 40,000 a year and generally the balance appears right, although there's always room for improvement. “The beauty of our family law system is that it is largely discretionary and flexible, treating people as human beings, taking account of their faults. By all means you should have guidance on these types of issues, but once you start tying the hands of judges too much, you can enter dangerous territory.” It’s the effect on the children that still haunts Jane. One of the boys has become very quiet and withdrawn while another struggles to control his anger. With the help of family and a local charity, Jane is rebuilding her life in a different part of the country. The children are settled in school, and she has a light, airy, clean, welcoming house for them all to come home to. Jane is now getting ready for Christmas. She is determined to make special memories for the rest of their childhood. In Northumbria Police’s control room, domestic abuse calls are prioritised. “It’s come in as a domestic, with reports of someone having been stabbed with a screwdriver.” “Has she got any children at the address do you know?” For any ongoing domestic violence call, a response car goes with blue lights and sirens. The caller is kept on the line. Mark has just had a caller hang up. “I rang it back and spoke to the caller. She said that her ex-partner had threatened to beat her and her 12-year-old child up.” He assures her someone is on the way immediately. The following week, PC Jason Parkin and PC Michael Paul are on a late shift in Sunderland the night we join them. A member of the public has rung in, after seeing a woman being treated violently in the street: “There’s a male who’s got tight hold of a female’s arm and has hit her on the back, she was quite distressed and shouted ‘get off me’.” The team switch on their blue lights and they’re off. If children are involved in a domestic violence call, it is flagged on the police computer system. Every morning a special team at Northumbria Police HQ scans a log of calls, ready to pass information on to schools. Steve Dixon, leader of the Protecting Vulnerable People team, recounts a typical case. “Mam has been assaulted by dad, a child has been present during this incident. The child is 11 years old. Mam has been taken to hospital and dad has been arrested at the scene by police.” When that 11-year old comes into school, there will be someone to greet them who will understand what’s happened to them. It’s all down to Operation Encompass. It began in a Devon primary school when head teacher Elisabeth Carney-Haworth noticed a dramatic behavioural change in one of the children. ‘’We didn’t know why. The child couldn’t tell us. We spoke to the child’s mother and she couldn’t tell us either. ‘’ The little boy had been exposed to domestic violence at home. But it took months for Elisabeth to find that out. She was furious that she had not been told earlier, so that the school could have acted faster to help. Operation Encompass's website She knows how devastating domestic abuse can be to children. “MRI scans showthat the bits of their brains that ‘fire up’ are exactly the same as in soldiers exposed to combat with PTSD.” When she told her police sergeant husband, David, of her frustration, he agreed that things had to change.Operation Encompasswas born with the start of a line of communication between the police and seven schools in Devon. For each school, the police are in direct contact with a trained “key adult” - usually the head teacher. Whenever a child is caught up in an incident of domestic abuse the school is told immediately. Elisabeth says: “The first thing we will do is greet that child with a smile. If they’ve not got school uniform on, we can find school uniform. We can check that they’ve had breakfast and that they are all right. “They need school to be a safe, secure, nurturing environment.” Now Operation Encompass has been taken up by more than 22 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales. The ambition is to eventually cover the entire UK. Things are changing. In September, new guidance was published for judges and magistrates in child contact cases where domestic abuse has been alleged. Sir James Munby, the president of the Family Division of the High Court for England and Wales,made several changes. Wording now sets out what judges and magistrates are “required” to do rather than what they “should” do in cases where there is domestic abuse. It's now mandatory for the courts to determine whether children and non-abusive parents will be at risk of harm from a contact order. The definitions of domestic abuse, coercive control  and the harms caused to children have been clarified. Judges must carefully consider how domestic abuse affects children, and question whether the “presumption of contact” applies. These all change how the courts and other authorities weigh up risk when it comes to allowing allegedly abusive partners access to their children. But for campaigners like Claire there is still more that needs to be done. We met Melissa in the early hours of a Saturday morning. She was sitting in her sparsely furnished flat in the north-east of England. There had been a fire in the stairwell recently and the blackened peeling paint covered the wall. She was curled up on the sofa. She hadn’t eaten all day. He’s taken everything away from me. I’m in so much pain. It’s ruined my life basically.” We had arrived with the domestic abuse response car - police officer PC Michael Urwin and Gemma Ridley from Wearside Women in Need, who has years of experience supporting women like Melissa. PC Michael Urwin and Gemma Ridley Melissa had been in an abusive relationship for nearly five years. When we spoke to her, the tears came as she thought of the baby taken away by social services. Melissa says she was essentially forced to chose between her abusive partner and her newborn baby. “He’s taken everything away from me. I’m in so much pain. It’s ruined my life basically.” The abusive relationship meant that social services couldn’t let Melissa keep her baby son. “He wasn't bothered. He wanted me more than anything. He controlled us really badly.” Melissa is trying to turn her life around. She has Wearside Women in Need for support and she has a job now, for the first time in a long time. She now realises the cost of the years of her ex-partner’s controlling behaviour and she wants change. Her battle is to rebuild her life. For Claire, there is a wider battle - to change attitudes in courts and council offices and police stations. She will continue to fight. Built with Shorthand"
Tory group angry at Heseltine's 'sniping',"Lord Heseltine is a high-profile critic of leaving the EU A conservative think tank is calling for Tory grandee Lord Heseltine to have the whip withdrawn for his ""sniping"" about Brexit. Members of the Bow Group have accused the former deputy prime minister of ""outright sabotage"" and want him expelled from the Tories' Lords group. It comes after he suggested a Labour government would be preferable to the ""long-term disaster"" of Brexit. Lord Heseltine is a high-profile critic of leaving the EU. Publish Brexit studies, MPs tell Hammond How to handle Brexit conversations over Christmas Watch a political review of 2017 Comments made by Lord Heseltine more than a month ago have triggered a backlash from the Bow Group after they were reported inThe Guardian,externaland other newspapers this week. The Bow Group includes big name Tory Brexiteers Lord Tebbit, its chairman, and Lord Lamont, a senior patron. Speaking to theLimehouse Podcast,externalabout the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government, Lord Heseltine said: ""We've survived Labour governments before. ""Their damage tends to be short-term and capable of rectification. ""Brexit is not short-term and is not easily capable of rectification. ""There will be those who question whether the short-term pain justifies the avoidance of the long-term disaster."" Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski, a Bow Group board member, said: ""His lack of respect and loyalty towards the Conservative Party is deeply regrettable."" Brexit: All you need to know And the group's chairman, Ben Harris-Quinney, added: ""Heseltine has made clear it is his aim to prevent Brexit at all costs, including the sabotage of his own party and nation, the Conservative Party must therefore withdraw the whip and end the inevitable continuation of his sniping from inside the tent."" The Bow Group describes itself as ""the United Kingdom's oldest conservative think tank"" which ""represents all strands of conservative opinion"". Ahead of the 2015 general election, Mr Harris-Quinney was rebuked by its patrons when heurged Tory supportersin some areas to ""lend their votes to UKIP"" to help prevent a Labour government.

UK and Canada lead alliance against coal,"The UK and Canada have launched a global alliance of 20 countries committed to phasing out coal for energy production. Members including France, Finland and Mexico, say they will end the use of coal before 2030. Ministers hope to have 50 countries signed up by the time of the next major UN conference in Poland next year. However some important coal consuming nations, including China, the US and Germany have not joined the group. Reducing global coal use is a formidable challenge, as the fuel produces around 40% of the world's electricity at present. As a highly carbon intensive source, coal contributes significantly to the rising levels of CO2 emissions thatscientists reported earlier this week. Researchers say that if the world is to curb dramatic temperature rises this century then coal use must be limited. Called thePowering Past Coal Alliance,external, this new initiative sees countries, regions and provinces, signing up to setting coal phase-out targets and committing to no new investments in coal-fired electricity in their national jurisdictions or abroad. The UK has said it will end the generation of electricity from unabated coal by 2025. Unabated means that the coal is burnt without capturing the resulting carbon emissions. Already, the move away from coal in the UK has been rapid. Around 40% of electricity was still being generated from coal in 2012 but in April this year theUK had its first full day without coal power in 135 years. ""We have not sacrificed growth,"" said Claire Perry, the UK's minister for climate change and industry. ""Since 1990 Britain has cut its emissions buy 42% and our economy has grown by 67%, that's the best performance in the G7 so this is not something that's a win-lose, it's a win-win situation."" Energy ministers assembled at the meeting in Bonn However many of those who have signed up to the alliance have little or no coal production or consumption, among them Fiji, Niue, and Costa Rica. Many of the richer countries involved have already announced their move away from coal and taken together the grouping only represents about 2.5% of global coal consumption. There are also some significant coal consuming countries including Germany and China, absent from the list at present. The anti-coal alliance are confident that by the time of the next major UN climate conference in Poland in 2018, there will be closer to 50 countries on board. The development has been broadly welcomed by environmental groups. ""This is another positive signal of the global momentum away from coal, benefitting the health of the climate, the public and the economy,"" said Jens Mattias Clausen from Greenpeace. ""But it also puts on notice the governments who lag behind on ending coal or those who promote it that the world's dirtiest fossil fuel has no future."" Those involved in the coal industry say the alliance needs to put more efforts into developing technology that will allow coal use to continue. ""With the world set to use fossil fuels, including coal, for the foreseeable future, Canada and the UK should direct efforts to advancing carbon capture and storage technology because that's much more likely to achieve global climate objectives than unrealistic calls to eliminate coal in major emerging economies,"" said Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association. With Canada and the UK leading the group, it means that two of the closest allies of the US are moving away from coal at a time when President Trump is talking about a revival for the fuel. From L-R: Catherine McKenna, Canada's environment minister; Michael Liebreich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance; Claire Perry, UK climate change and industry minister The White House has had a presence at this meeting with the President's special adviser on climate change, George David Banks telling reporters that coal and other fossil fuels were an important part of the solution to climate change. Mr Banks believes that a so-called ""clean coal alliance"" involving the US, Japan and others would be something the Trump team would favour. ""I would say that the administration is interested in the idea,"" he told reporters. ""I'm guessing that would mean a clean coal alliance that would focus on highly efficient low emission coal plants and carbon capture utilisation and storage.  I think there would be interest in exploring that."" Many environmental campaigners though, believe that attempts to produce clean coal are essentially efforts to prolong the dominance of the fossil fuel industry. ""People were worried that this summit would see Trump assaulting the Paris Agreement with his coal lobbyists,"" said Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid. ""But his actions have actually galvanised other nations into action, with a new alliance making it clear that coal's climate change threat must be taken seriously. ""The bottom line is coal is a dirty, unnecessary, polluting fuel that deserves to remain in a more ignorant and backward era. These countries are showing they understand that.""

Fears raised over Syria child evacuationsThe UN says sick children from a rebel-held Damascus suburb should not be used to trade prisoners.,"This video can not be played Campaigners are covering their eyes in solidarity with baby Karim A senior UN official says he fears children waiting to be evacuated from the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area near the Syrian capital, Damascus, are being used as bargaining chips. The UN's humanitarian co-ordinator, Jan Egeland, told the BBC he believed that rebels had agreed to free government workers in exchange for the children. Another 12 patients were evacuated on Wednesday, following four on Tuesday. Thirteen more urgent cases are expected to be evacuated on Thursday. News of the latest evacuations from the Eastern Ghouta came in a tweet from the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), a medical relief organisation that supports hospitals in rebel-held Syria.

However, SAMS advocacy manager Mohamad Katoub told the BBC that it was hard to keep up with who needed to be evacuated as people continued to die. ""The last one was a girl from the list, from the 29. This morning, when the local staff reached the family to tell them that finally the approval to evacuate your little daughter arrived, the family said that our daughter died a few days ago."" Mr Katoub also tweeted that a 13th patient had refused to be evacuated on Wednesday,externalbecause he was concerned about being arrested by the Syrian government. ""No safety guarantees were given to the patients,"" he added. About 400,000 residents in the war-torn district have been under siege by government forces since 2013. ""Let's hope that the agreements are good when they come,"" Mr Egeland told the BBC. ""There can also be bad agreements. It is a not a good agreement if they exchange sick children for detainees that means children become bargaining chips in some tug of war. That shouldn't happen. They have a right to the evacuation and we have an obligation to evacuate them."" The main rebel group in the Eastern Ghouta, Jaysh al-Islam, said on Wednesday that the government had agreed to the evacuations in exchange for the release of 29 of its prisoners. Mr Egeland said those still in the Eastern Ghouta had very little left in the way of medical facilities. ""The Syrian war has been a war against the medical profession in many ways,"" he said. ""Too many hospitals have been bombed, have been hit on both sides, hundreds of doctors and nurses have been killed or wounded so what is left in Eastern Ghouta for the 400,000 civilians is not that much."" The Eastern Ghouta has been designated a ""de-escalation zone"" by the Syrian government's main allies, Russia and Iran, along with Turkey, which backs the opposition. But hostilities intensified six weeks ago when the Syrian military stepped up attacks in response to a rebel offensive, reportedly killing dozens of civilians. Scale of attacks on children in conflict zones ""shocking"" 'Critical point' in Syria's Eastern Ghouta Why is there a war in Syria? There are also severe shortages of food, fuel and medicines, and the cold weather is threatening to worsen the hardship. On Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed that four critically ill people had been taken with their families to hospitals in Damascus, and that it hoped a total of 29 people would be evacuated ""over the coming few days"". ""The operation is clearly a positive step that will give some respite to the people in Eastern Ghouta, especially those who are in dire need of life-saving medical treatment,"" spokeswoman Anastasia Isyuk told the BBC. ""We hope this medical evacuation will only be the beginning of more to come, as there are many more people in need. It is also vital for humanitarian organisations to reach people in Eastern Ghouta with aid on a regular basis and without conditions."" Last week, Mr Egeland said 494 people were on the priority list for medical evacuations submitted in November. He said the number was going down, not because people were being evacuated but because people were dying. Race to rescue injured Syrian baby.

Raheem Sterling scored the only goal in a dominant display by the visitors to St James' Park in which they clocked up 78% of possession and 21 shots to Newcastle's six. ""We did absolutely everything but it is difficult to play when the other team doesn't want to play,"" said Guardiola. ""In the last minutes we played in their rhythm and then it was not easy because it is not over at 1-0 - we created enough chances to win 2-0, 3-0, 4-0. ""As a manager I have to adapt. We have played teams who high press, low press, attack us. Any manager and team can play how they want. And you have to find a way to beat them."" England winger Sterling poked home from Kevin de Bruyne's lobbed pass after Sergio Aguero had twice hit the woodwork in the opening half hour. Rolando Aarons saw a shot cleared off the line by Nicolas Otamendi in a rare Newcastle raid forward before the break, but City should have been well clear after De Bruyne thumped the post and then side-footed wide in the second half. The hosts showed more ambition late on and Christian Atsu teed up fellow substitute Dwight Gayle to head wide in the final five minutes. Reaction from St James' Park as leaders City march on City were not to be denied an 18th successive league victory however as they extended an English top-flight record. The Magpies' fifth successive home defeat leaves them a point off the relegation zone. Raheem Sterling has scored 17 goals in all competitions this season With the very first kick of the match, Jonjo Shelvey thumped a shot at goal which was easily gathered by Ederson. But for the next 30 minutes Newcastle did not get close to another. Instead the hosts sat so deep they were practically subterranean with lone striker Joselu playing 15 yards inside his own half. City, brimming with confidence and well used to such tactics, sniffed out space and carved out chances regardless. Between being denied by the frame, Aguero brought a superb one-handed stop from Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot. WhenVincent Kompany pulled up injured,Pep Guardiola felt confident enough to replace the defender with striker Gabriel Jesus. The home fans were reduced to cheering throw-ins as their side's possession statistic stayed stubbornly south of 20%. To hold out would have been one of the great rearguard actions. De Bruyne ensured it wasn't to be. Allowed space and time 40 yards from goal, the Belgian scooped a sublime pass onto Sterling's instep for his team-mate's 13th Premier League goal of the season. Manchester City - whose first-half attacking heat map is on the right - had 85% of possession before the break. Newcastle, on the left, rarely entered City's half This video can not be played Benitez pleased Newcastle stayed in the game After surviving a raft of City chances, Newcastle gave the leaders some concerns in the final 15 minutes. Manager Rafael Benitez brought on Gayle and Atsu, urged his side to press higher and generally threw caution to the wind. A home point would have been a heist of the highest order. Benitez is the most streetwise of tacticians but the Spaniard is hamstrung by a squad that lacks the quality that comes with serious, sustained investment. The prospect of relegation hangs over thetakeover talksbetween owner Mike Ashley and British businesswoman Amanda Staveley that could be the key to a new era. Club legend Alan Shearer, watching for BBC Radio 5 live, described his former team as ""a Championship side playing in the Premier League"". Encounters against all-conquering City are unlikely to decide Newcastle's fate, but their next three league matches - against Brighton, Stoke and Swansea - will provide a better indication of which side of the relegation divide they will end up in May. Guardiola won three successive German titles with Bayern Munich Another win, another milestone for Manchester City. This was their 11th consecutive away victory, matching the record for the English top flight set by Chelsea between April and December 2008. Next on the horizon is one of their manager's own. Beating Crystal Palace away on Sunday would equal the 19 successive wins that Bayern Munich strung together in the 2013-14 season under Guardiola. No team in the English, Italian, German, Spanish or French top flights have ever managed more than that. De Bruyne set up four chances including Sterling's decisive goal Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez:""We had some chances at the end, and we expected to have to defend and play counter-attack. We needed to stay compact and defend well to play like that. ""In the last 20 minutes we did what was expected, being on top of them and expecting to press high. I am really pleased with the team in terms of organisation, but we discussed we could be better on the ball in the first half. ""We have to bring someone in to help the team but still have a lot of confidence in the team."" Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola:""Any manager can decide what he wants - I prefer to try to play but I respect a lot what opponents do and we have to try to discover how to attack against them. This video can not be played Newcastle didnât want to play - Guardiola ""Always you have to expect this kind of situation - and it is not always easy to maintain that level. ""Raheem Sterling is scoring a lot and is playing good - so we are happy with that."" Newcastle have lost five consecutive home league matches for the first time since October 1953. Nicolas Otamendi completed 122 passes for Man City in this match - seven more than all the outfield players of Newcastle managed combined (115). Rafael Benitez has now lost six of his past 10 home Premier League matches - he had lost six of his previous 110 before this run; 38% of Benitez's total home Premier League defeats have come this season, six of 16. Since his Premier League debut for Manchester City, Kevin de Bruyne has 36 assists - four more than any other player. In all competitions this season, only Harry Kane (24) has scored more goals than Raheem Sterling (17) among English Premier League players. The Magpies have collected 18 points from their 20 Premier League matches this season - just one more than they managed after 20 games in the 2015-16 season, when they were relegated. Newcastle play Brighton at home at 15:00 GMT on Saturday, with Manchester City travelling to Crystal Palace on New Year's Eve at 12:00. How do your team rate this season?

Prince Harry to 'shine spotlight' on issues,"This video can not be played Prince Harry: ""It's been a big learning curve"" Prince Harry says he will go on using his position to ""shine a spotlight"" on issues close to his heart. He was speaking as he guest edited BBC Radio 4's Today programme, which focused on the armed forces, mental health, youth crime and climate change. He interviewed former US president Barack Obama and his own father, Prince Charles, as part of the radio show. He also said his fiancee Meghan Markle had enjoyed spending Christmas with the family ""she's never had"". Ahead of his wedding in May, Prince Harry said he was determined 2018 would be a ""fantastic year"". He said: ""Post-Christmas... I just hope everyone out there has had a chance to just think about the things that really matter and the difference that every single one of us can make. ""Part of my role and part of my job is to shine a spotlight on issues that need that spotlight, whether it's people, whether it's causes, issues, whatever it is. ""So I will continue to play my part in society and do my job to the best of my abilities so that I can wake up in the morning and feel energised."" Download podcasts from Prince Harry's Today programme In the interviews,Mr Obama said irresponsible use of social media was distorting the public's understanding of complex issues, while the Prince of Wales said climate change was causing ""untold horrors"" in different part of the world. As the programme ended, presenters Justin Webb and Sarah Montague turned the microphone on the fifth in line to the throne, who spent Christmas at Sandringham with members of the Royal Family and his fiancÃ©e. This video can not be played Prince Harry discusses Meghan Markle's first Christmas with the Royal Family Prince Harry said he had an ""amazing time"" - Ms Markle ""really enjoyed it and the family really loved having her there"" although there were ""plenty"" of family traditions he needed to explain. The 33-year-old said they had a ""great time"" with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and ""running around with the kids"". American actress Ms Markle's presence at Sandringham was the first time someone yet to marry into the Royal Family has been invited to join their Christmas celebrations. Prince Harry said: ""She's done an absolutely amazing job, she's getting in there and it's the family that I suppose she's never had"". Meanwhile, boxer Anthony Joshua, who was a guest on the programme, tweeted a picture of himself with Prince Harry and offered to be his best man. The world heavyweight champion wrote: ""Back to work this morning! Congrats on everything this year and no pressure on the R4 guest edit! P.S. Need a best man?"" Allow Twitter content?

BBC royal editor Nicholas Witchell said the prince had previously expressed doubts about his public role but the programme showed that was no longer the case and he ""wants to make a real difference in the work that he does"". However, he added Prince Harry was not able to ask genuinely probing questions in the interviews because, as a member of the Royal Family, he has to avoid areas that might be deemed to be political. It is the 14th year public figures have been in control of Today's output between Christmas and New Year. Prince Harry in the Today studio with presenters Justin Webb and Sarah Montague Other guest editors include a robot, Bletchley Park code-breaker Baroness Trumpington, Tamara Rojo of the English National Ballet and poet and novelist Benjamin Okri. Prince Harry's programme also featured an audio diary recordedin Toronto at the Invictus Games,the Paralympic-style competition for injured service personnel he launched in 2014. And he conducted aninterview with British artificial intelligence entrepreneurDemis Hassabis. Another section saw Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick interviewed live in the studio as Prince Harry sat in the editor's chair. Prince Harry chose Abdurahman Sayed, from the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in North Kensington, which has been helping people affected by June's fire at nearby Grenfell Tower, to speak in Today's Thought for the Day spot. On his editing role, Prince Harry said: ""I haven't done that many interviews but it was quite fun, especially interviewing President Obama. ""It's been a big learning curve, but also these are incredibly important topics that I think we all need to think about that need to be discussed and I'm incredibly fortunate to have a platform like this."" By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent One claims to speak for the nation and one claims to speak to the nation. On Radio 4's Today, the Royal Family and the BBC came together in a cosy embrace. Few of the prince's causes were unrepresented and he was himself dotted through the programme, encouraging and enthusing about nearly everything. He is clearly bouncing towards the new year, a time he insisted would be full of ""great change - good things are going to happen in 2018"". There was little in the way of actual hard news - former US President Barack Obama has more time on his hands; the Prince of Wales - ""Pa"" as Harry called him - is concerned about the environment; Harry doesn't drink coffee, or much of it. But there were glimpses of the gilded cage. A note of wistfulness in his voice when he asked Mr Obama about ""stepping off the treadmill"" of constant exposure. Prince Harry, who was in the Army for 10 years, said he wanted the armed forces to feature because ""there's a huge role they play and we must make sure it's not sympathy but respect we show"".

Prince Harry grills Barack Obama on his likes and dislikes In his interview, the Prince of Wales said he had ""bored you [the prince] to tears over so many years"" with discussions on the environment but the public was ""beginning to realise that what I was trying to say may not have been as dotty as they thought"". Prince Charles said he wanted to ""ensure that you and your children, my grandchildren...  have a world fit to live in, that provides them with opportunity"".

US officer punches ice pond to rescue boy,"Sgt Aaron Thompson found the boy floating beneath the ice A US police officer has told how he broke through the ice on a frozen pond and jumped in to rescue an eight-year-old boy on Christmas Day. Sgt Aaron Thompson was called to the pond in New Harmony, Utah, after reports that the child had fallen in while chasing his dog. He told a news conference he had found the boy floating beneath the surface about 25ft (7m) from the pond's edge. He said he believed the boy had been in the water for about 30 minutes. The Washington County Sheriff's Office said in a statement on Wednesday that the boy - named only as Jason - was awake in hospital and recovering. His father has described the rescue as ""a Christmas miracle"", it added. Sgt Thompson told reporters that when he arrived at the pond in the late afternoon he was directed to an area where a woman had seen the boy's hand protruding from the ice some minutes earlier.

""So I started to jump up and down on it, putting my weight on it, and then pound on it to get it to break,"" he said. He said that he dived down to the bottom to gauge how deep and how cold the water was and then began to search. ""On my tippytoes, floating in the water up to my neck... moving my arms up and down I knew eventually I was going to bump into him and that is exactly what happened,"" he said. ""Once I saw his face I pulled his head up above the water and called out to the paramedics."" Sgt Thompson was treated for hypothermia and cuts and bruises but later returned to work. Although hailed as a hero by his colleagues and the community, he said he wanted to share any credit with other members of the emergency services, the Spectrum newspaper of nearby St George reported.

Iconic White House tree to be cut down,"The ""Jackson"" magnolia has sat on the White House lawn for almost two centuries A historic tree that has stood at the White House for nearly 200 years is scheduled to be cut back. The ""Jackson"" magnolia was planted by President Andrew Jackson as a tribute to his recently deceased wife. It has been a backdrop to historic ceremonies and even featured on the $20 note between 1928 and 1988. But experts say the tree is damaged and poses a safety hazard. First Lady Melania Trump has called for a large portion of it to be removed. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Mrs Trump had requested that seedlings be maintained so that a new tree could possibly be replanted in the same area. She said Mrs Trump had taken the decision because the tree posed a threat to ""the safety of visitors and members of the press who are often standing right in front"" of it when the presidential helicopter takes off. Is the White House really a dump? Pest problem revealed in White House logs The magnolia originally came from a cutting from Mrs Rachel Jackson's favourite magnolia tree on the couple's Tennessee farm. Its first problems began in the early 1970s when a section of its base was displaced and its exposed cavity was cemented. This was standard practice for the era, but some said it damaged the tree irrevocably. The presidential helicopter, Marine One, often takes off close to the tree in the White House grounds In 1981, the cement was removed and replaced with a large pole and cable system to hold it up. Although at first sight the tree appears normal, a report from the United States National Arboretum, quoted by CNN, said ""the tree is greatly compromised"" and ""completely dependent on the artificial support"". The magnolia tree's life has spanned 39 presidencies, as well as the American Civil War and two World Wars. Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of ex-President Bill Clinton, tweeted her thanks to those who have looked after it over the years and to Mrs Trump for the re-planting plan. Allow Twitter content?
