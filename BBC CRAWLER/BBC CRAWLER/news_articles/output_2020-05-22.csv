"Time to end Clap for Carers, says founder","This video can not be played Founder Annemarie Plas said it would be ""beautiful"" to end it after its 10th week and make it an annual event The UK's weekly applause for front-line workers tackling the coronavirus outbreak has ""had its moment"" and should end next Thursday, the woman behind it has suggested. It would be ""beautiful"" to end Clap for Carers after its 10th week, and make it an annual event, Annemarie Plas said. She said the public had ""shown our appreciation"" and it was now up to ministers to ""reward"" key workers. The government has said it is considering how best to do so. When is it hypocritical to clap for carers? What are key workers paid? Resort locals 'shocked and angry' at beach crowds Some have taken to incorporating pots and pans during into their weekly claps The event originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown. However, after proving very popular, it was expanded to cover all key workers and has continued every Thursday at 20:00 BST, with people peering out of their windows or standing on their doorsteps to show their appreciation by clapping, cheering, banging saucepans and playing instruments. Dutch-born Londoner Ms Plas,who is credited with starting the nationwide applause, told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show that it was inspired by similar events in the Netherlands and around the world. But she said: ""Because this is the ninth time - and next week will be 10 times - I think that would be beautiful, to be the end of the series."" This video can not be played From a helipad to the streets, millions join the UK's ninth Clap for Carers From that point, she said maybe it should stop and ""then move to an annual moment"" - noting that ""other opinions"" are starting to ""rise to the surface"". She added: ""So I feel like this had its moment and then we can adapt - let's continue to something else."" People in London took to the street for the ninth Clap for Carers on Thursday The applause has been called into question in recent weeks.Some NHS staff have said they felt ""stabbed in the back""by people breaking lockdown guidelines to hold VE Day street parties or flock to the beach. Others have suggested the NHS would benefit more from extra funding rather than applause, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer hassaid many key workersare ""overlooked and underpaid"". Ms Plas said she feels that people have shown key workers their appreciation and it is now the responsibility of ""the people that are in power... to reward and give them the respect they deserve"". In a later interview, she added: ""Without getting too political, I share some of the opinions that some people have about it becoming politicised. ""I think the narrative is starting to change and I don't want the clap to be negative."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ministers were ""thinking [about] how to recognise the work of healthcare staff, of carers, of many others"".

Biden: Black voters considering Trump 'ain't black',"Democratic White House candidate Joe Biden is in damage limitation mode after saying African Americans ""ain't black"" if they even consider voting for President Donald Trump over him. Gaffe-prone Mr Biden made the remark in an interview on Friday with a prominent black radio host, Charlamagne Tha God, about his outreach to black voters. Mr Biden later expressed regret for the ""cavalier"" comment. The black vote has been key to the Biden candidacy. Throughout the 18-minute interview, Mr Biden, 77, stressed his longstanding ties to the black community, noting his overwhelming win this year in South Carolina's presidential primary, a state where the Democratic electorate is more than 60% African American. Will Joe Biden's record come back to haunt him? Biden bid to take on Trump gets major boost Black and voting for Donald Trump ""I won every single county. I won the largest share of the black vote that anybody had, including Barack,"" he said of President Barack Obama, the country's first African-American president, who picked Mr Biden as his running mate. The presumptive nominee for November's election also ""guaranteed"" that several black women were being considered to serve as his vice-president. He has already committed to selecting a woman to join him on the Democratic ticket. Toward the end of the interview, a campaign aide interrupted to say the former vice-president was out of time. When an aide for Mr Biden tried to end the interview, Charlamagne protested, saying: ""You can't do that to black media."" ""I do that to white media and black media,"" Mr Biden replied, adding that his wife was waiting to use their home broadcast studio. This video can not be played The biggest myth about the 'black vote' Charlamagne urged Mr Biden to return for another interview, saying he had more questions. ""If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black,"" Mr Biden responded. Charlamagne's nationally syndicated Breakfast Club show reaches more than 8 million listeners each month. Joe Biden just touched a live electrical wire of racial identity in US politics. Until now his support among black voters has been rock-solid, and there's little chance Friday's line will do much by itself to dent that. The Trump campaign will be happy, however, if they can chip away even a sliver of Mr Biden's support, particularly in key electoral states like Wisconsin and Michigan, where black voter apathy hurt Democrats in 2016. Mr Biden's gaffe came at the end of an interview, as he was being pressed on whether he favoured Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar over a black woman as his running mate. That he responded with indignation - and then veered dangerously off-script - suggests his preference might lie with someone like Ms Klobuchar, who shares Mr Biden's pragmatic political sensibilities. If Friday's kerfuffle has staying power, however, he might feel compelled to pick a black female candidate like Kamala Harris or Stacey Abrams - if only to clean up the mess he created. Biden campaign adviser Symone Sanders defended the comments on Friday, saying they were made ""in jest"". ""Let's be clear about what the VP was saying: he was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump's any day. Period."" Mr Biden scrambled to make amends on a call later to black business leaders. ""I should not have been so cavalier,"" he said. ""I've never, never, ever taken the African American community for granted."" He added: ""I shouldn't have been such a wise guy."" He continued: ""No-one should have to vote for any party based on their race, their religion, their background."" Mr Biden's resounding win among black voters in South Carolina healed seal his status as presumptive nominee The Trump campaign seized on the remarks, which senior campaign adviser Katrina Pierson described as ""racist and dehumanising"". ""He truly believes that he, a 77-year-old white man, should dictate how black people should behave,"" she said. Her comment was echoed by Senator Tim Scott, a black Republican. ""That is the most arrogant, condescending comment I've heard in a very long time,"" he told on Fox News. ""He's saying that 1.3 million African Americans, that you're not black? Who in the heck does he think he is?"" the South Carolina lawmaker said, referring to the black Americans who voted for Mr Trump in 2016. Mr Biden's words also provoked criticism from his side of the aisle. Mr Biden often references his record as Barack Obama's running mate. Keith Boykin, a former aide to Democratic President Bill Clinton, tweeted: ""Yes, Biden is a much better choice for black people than racist Trump. ""But white people don't get to tell black people what is black. Biden still has to EARN our vote."" Derrick Johnson, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), told CBS News that Mr Biden could not ""take the African-American vote for granted"". One disappointed black voter's response went viral. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

America knows Joe Biden as the vice-president to the first black president in history. Mr Obama endorsed him last month, saying in a video that Mr Biden ""has all the qualities we need in a president right now"". A Quinnipiac University poll released this week showed Mr Biden's support among black voters at a stunning 81%, compared with 3% for Mr Trump. The remainder said they didn't know. A former Senate aide who accuses Mr Biden of sexual assault has been dropped as a client by a prominent lawyer who has represented several #MeToo cases. Tara Reade says Mr Biden attacked her in a Senate hallway in 1993. On Thursday, attorney Douglas Wigdor said his office's decision was no reflection on Ms Reade's credibility, and he accused the media of trying to victim-shame her. It came as questions were raised about Ms Reade's past. A spokesperson for Antioch University in Seattle told the New York Times that she did not receive a degree from the university, though she had listed one on her CV. She also claimed to have been a legislative assistant to Mr Biden. But she was actually a staff assistant - a more junior role. However, Seattle University confirmed to Politico that Ms Reade did have a law degree from there. Lawyers in legal cases in which she testified as an expert witness on domestic violence are reportedly now seeking to reopen them on the grounds that her credentials could have been faked.

Dozens die as Pakistan jet crashes into homes,"This video can not be played The crash happened in the Model Colony residential area A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) passenger plane flying from Lahore has crashed into a residential area of Karachi, killing at least 76 people. The pilots of flight PK8303, an Airbus A320 carrying 91 passengers and eight crew, were attempting to land at the city's Jinnah International Airport. The plane had attempted one landing but as it went round again lost its engines and issued a mayday call. At least two passengers are confirmed to have survived the crash. Air disasters timeline One, Muhammad Zubair, has been describing his ordeal, recalling how he lost consciousness then woke up to smoke and screaming. It has yet to be confirmed but here is what we know so far. Flight PK8303 was approaching Jinnah International Airport at about 14:30 local time (09:30 GMT). It had been given permission to land but the pilots decided to abort and go around for a second attempt. The reason is not yet known, but one civil aviation official told Reuters the plane may have been unable to lower its undercarriage. Images posted on social media appeared to show scorch marks under both engines, with no undercarriage visible on approach. Purported audio of the conversation between air traffic control and a pilot for the second attempt was published by Pakistani media outlets, in which the pilot is heard saying the plane has ""lost engines"". An air traffic controller asks whether it is going to carry out a ""belly landing"", to which the pilot replies ""mayday, mayday, mayday"" - the final communication from the plane. The survivor, Muhammad Zubair, said there were 10-15 minutes between the first attempt at landing and the crash. ""No-one was aware that the plane was about to crash; they were flying the plane in a smooth manner,"" he said. Investigators will try to retrieve the so-called black box recorders to help determine the cause. A committee of investigation has already been set up. PIA said the plane had joined the fleet in 2014 and passed its annual airworthiness inspection last November. The crash came just days after Pakistan began allowing commercial flights to resume after a coronavirus lockdown. Pakistanis across the country are preparing to celebrate the end of Ramadan, with many travelling back to their homes in cities and villages. The plane was only just short of the runway perimeter when it struck houses in the Model Colony residential area. TV footage showed rescue crews combing through debris strewn across the streets of the densely populated zone. A number of cars were set on fire. Passenger Muhammad Zubair, who suffered only minor injuries, said that, when he came to, ""I could hear screams from all directions. Kids and adults. All I could see was fire. I couldn't see any people - just hear their screams"". He added: ""I opened my seatbelt and saw some light - I went towards the light. I had to jump down about 10ft (3m) to get to safety."" Rescuers evacuate an injured resident from the site, where a number of houses were destroyed Eyewitness Mohammed Uzair Khan told the BBC he had heard a massive sound and went outside his home. ""Almost four houses were completely collapsed, there was so much fire and smoke,"" he said. ""They are almost my neighbours, I can't tell you what a horrible thing it was."" Local health officials at two hospitals, the Jinnah and Civic hospitals, gave death tolls to the BBC and Pakistani media, adding up to 76 confirmed deaths. But it was not clear how many of the dead were passengers and how many residents on the ground. Zafar Masud, president of the Bank of Punjab, was the other passenger who survived the crash, a provincial government spokesman said. Both were at the front of the plane. There are reports of other survivors but these have not been confirmed. A senior journalist at TV channel 24 News, Ansar Naqvi, and an ex-head of the Punjab Disaster Management Authority, Khalid Sherdil, were also listed on the passenger manifest. The crash site was just short of the airport perimeter Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the crash,external, promising an immediate investigation. Pakistan has a chequered aviation safety record, including a number of airliner crashes. In 2010, an aircraft operated by private airline Airblue crashed near Islamabad, killing all 152 people on board - the deadliest air disaster in Pakistani history. In 2012, a Boeing 737-200 operated by Pakistan's Bhoja Air crashed in bad weather on its approach to land in Rawalpindi, killing all 121 passengers and six crew. And in 2016, a Pakistan International Airlines plane burst into flames while travelling from northern Pakistan to Islamabad, killing 47 people. Are you in Karachi? Did you witness the crash?

Missing girl feared dead 'had heart of gold',"Louise Smith was described as a ""lovely girl with a heart of gold"" by a friend Friends and neighbours of a missing teenager have said they are ""devastated"" after a body was found in woodland. The 16-year-old, named locally as Louise Smith, was last seen on 8 May - VE Day- Havant, Hampshire. Officers discovered the remains in Havant Thicket on Thursday. Formal identification has yet to take place. Forensic officers continue to search the woods and a flat in Somborne Drive, where Louise was last seen. Mandy Ferdinando, who had known Louise since she was a young girl, laid flowers at the entrance to the thicket. She told the Press Association: ""She was a lovely girl with a heart of gold. ""The community is devastated, sad, shocked, I can't speak for everybody but when anyone hears of a young person, whoever it may be, it's very sad."" Neighbour John Singleton said: ""I saw her on the day she went missing, she just went out walking, I didn't know where she was going. ""It's very sad, the outcome is the saddest, for a while we had some hope."" Flowers have been left at Havant Thicket where a body was found Detectives said they were treating the death as suspicious and urged people not to speculate on the circumstances. Louise had not been in touch with her friends or family since being seen in Somborne Drive, a short distance from where the body was found. A man and a woman, both aged 29, had previously been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and released on bail. Hampshire police previously asked people in the area to save any dashcam and CCTV footage from 7 and 8 May - particularly any filmed at VE Day anniversary celebrations - for officers to review. Forensics officers have been searching a flat in Somborne Drive, the road where Louise was last seen Louise went shopping at a Tesco store on the evening before she was reported missing Body found in search for missing teenager CCTV image of missing teenager released Woodland search for missing teenager Pair bailed after teen kidnap arrest Kidnap arrests over missing teenager Hampshire Constabulary 'Alternative options' for new hospital could be considered as next steps delayed Estate agents brings pair of 'investment opportunities' to market in Winchester Basingstoke man to stand trial after pleading not guilty to escaping custody Isle of Wight Council WILL bid to fast-track towards devolution Flu hospital admission almost doubled in Portsmouth in the first week of 2025 compared to the last week of 2024 ""Marvellous"" new cruise ship Viking Vela makes historic city visit Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

NHS may need to hire airline staff,"The NHS in England may start hiring airline staff who have lost their jobs to fill a gap in nurse numbers, its chief executive has said. Sir Simon Stevens told MPs airlines hired nurses from the NHS to work as cabin crew in the early 2000s. It was now possible the NHS would consider hiring these staff back as the airline industry continues to struggle due to coronavirus. He was speaking to the Commons Public Accounts Committee. Sir Simon told the committee the health service had seen an ""amazing response"" from former NHS staff who were prepared to return to the frontline to help the fight against Covid-19. British Airways set to cut up to 12,000 jobs NHS fees to be scrapped for overseas health staff 'I returned to nursing the day the pandemic was declared' But he added that international recruitment for NHS staff would be a problem for the first half of this year due to the pandemic. The NHS in England currently has a nursing staff gap of 40,000. Sir Simon said he wanted to see 50,000 nurses join the service. Sir Simon told the MPS that the NHS would have to change the way it offers care, with coronavirus constantly ""in the background"". Agreements struck with private hospitals to supply beds during the coronavirus crisis would need to continue, he added, and Nightingale hospitals, set up to treat Covid-19 patients and manage excess demand for hospital beds, would be kept ""in reserve"". NHS hospitals had treated 89,000 coronavirus patients since the outbreak began in the UK in February, Sir Simon told the committee. And standard emergency and A&E attendances, which had seen a drop, were starting to increase back to expected levels. Chris Wormald, the top civil servant at the Department for Health and Social Care, told the committee that the UK ""never ran out of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) nationally"". But he said ""there were a lot of issues"" in getting PPE to NHS staff and care workers. The government was looking at producing PPE domestically, he added, but there would be ""no imminent replacement of what we need to buy on international markets"".

One of Belgium's old water mills has been working flat out to meet the needs of the new wannabe bakers. Miller Adrienne Delacroix, whose mill in the Ardennes region has been producing flour for six centuries, said: ""We've witnessed an explosion in demand from individuals"". Ms Delacroix believes the love of baking will continue after the pandemic is over. ""I think the crisis has also brought home
the importance of eating local produce.""  BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast has been speaking to Amanda, who was sleeping rough in Manchester city centre before the coronavirus pandemic. During the lockdown, thousands of homeless people have been helped into homes and shelters, and Amanda was given a room in a Holiday Inn. She said on the first night âI think I slept for two daysâ. Amanda said the security of having a room is something thatâs made a huge difference to a lot of people.

Many parks are currently closed in the French capital and, amid good weather and the easing of other restrictions, the government has resisted calls from the mayor to open them. Instead, a man, who has revealed himself as ""Jose"" to a local newspaper, has been unlocking the parks in poorer areas of the city at night. Two handwritten posters hanging from the railings of the Parc de Belleville on Friday read ""Thank you, Jose!"". The closure of parks has been an increasingly controversial topic in France with police forced to clear open lawns in central Paris of twice in recent days. Cyprus is to reopen its airports to commercial flights from 9 June. The reopening will start by allowing flights from 20 countries, the country's transport minister announced. People arriving from those countries will be required to produce evidence of a negative coronavirus test from within the previous 72 hours. The UK and Russia are not part of the first group, due to the government believing Covid-19 has not been sufficiently contained in the two countries, which are the biggest markets for Cyprus tourism. The Endeavour launched in 2011 from Florida's Cape Canaveral SpaceX and Nasa are urging spectators to stay away from next Wednesday's rocket launch on Florida's Space Coast. But officials in Brevard County, home of the Kennedy Space Center, hope the event will help boost tourism to the state, where visitor revenue is down sharply during the pandemic. In a news conference with reporters earlier this month, Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine noted that previous launches had brought hundreds of thousands of sightseers to Florida beaches. But Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey has actively encouraged visitors, as long as they practise social distancing. ""We are not going to keep the great Americans that want to come watch that from coming here,"" Ivey said. ""If Nasa is telling people to not come here and watch the launch, that's on them. I'm telling people what I believe as an American. And so Nasa has got their guidelines, and I got mine."" The 27 May launch of a SpaceX rocket with two astronauts aboard will be the first launch of astronauts from US soil since the end of the US space shuttle program in 2011. Dominic Cummings, a top adviser to PM Boris Johnson, travelled hundreds of miles from London to County Durham during the lockdown when he had virus symptoms, the BBC has been told. A source close to the PM's chief aide confirmed reports he and his wife went to his parents' home to self-isolate. But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told Mr Cummings did not break government guidance because he and his wife stayed in a separate building. Labour said No 10 needed to provide a ""very swift explanation"" for Mr Cummings' actions. ""If accurate, the prime minister's chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules. The government's guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel,"" a spokesman said. ""The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings."" See here for more. The US state of Washington lost ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars to benefits scammers, officials there have acknowledged, as the number of workers laid off due to coronavirus continues to rise. The loss was disclosed by the state's Employment Security Department on Thursday. Last week, the US Secret Service warned that states were being targeted by a âwell-organised Nigerian fraud ring exploiting the COVID-19 crisis to commit large-scale fraud against state unemployment insurance programsâ adding up to âpotential losses in the hundreds of millions of dollarsâ. The agency added that there was also evidence of attacks in North Carolina, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Florida, the Seattle Times reports. The news came on the same day that the federal government reported another 2.4m American workers filed for jobless benefits last week. In total, 38.6m unememployment claims have been filed in the past nine weeks. Reality Check Thereâs been interest in whether alcohol-based hand cleaners can
overheat and catch fire inside cars after a warning from a local fire service
in the US. TheFacebook post,externalappeared to suggest that a
bottle of hand sanitiser left inside a car led to a fire which burnt
the car door. But should we be worried about leaving hand sanitiser bottles in
our cars during hot weather? Alcohol-based products are flammable and there isguidance from the WHO,externalwhich advises them to be
stored safely - but it is very unlikely they would catch fire from hot weather
alone. There have been various reports of alcohol-based cleaning products
catching fire in different circumstances, but usually because theyâve been
spilled onto something or have been left too close to an open flame. Professor of Chemistry at Nottingham University, Steven Howdle
says: âUnless you have a lighted match or another ignition source in the car,
it is very unlikely there is going to be any problem with fire."" It's been one of the key questions behind the debate about reopening schools.

Ikea will reopen 19 stores across England and Northern Ireland from 1 June, with new safety measures to ensure social distancing, the Swedish retailer says. The homewares chain said social distancing wardens will patrol the stores and the number of customers will be limited. Stores in Scotland, Wales and Ireland will remain closed, in line with government coronavirus guidance. Restaurants and play areas will remain closed, but the food market will reopen for customers to make food like Swedish meatballs at home. Ikea stores have reopened in several European countries including Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. Dan Smith from the band Bastille has told the BBC that he thinks the music industry needs to ""rethink"" how much artists are paid by online streaming sites. âThe money is there, itâs about how itâs distributed"" said the singer. ""I hope that across the music industry, and so many other things â looking at the NHS, and nurses and wages â I hope thereâs a real rethinking across the board of how people are remunerated and whatâs important.â Speaking to The Coronavirus Newscast, Smith said that although things were âuncertainâ now he hoped the industry would be more ""thoughtfulâ after the pandemic. Spotify said in a statement to the BBC that ""the vast majority of revenue generated is paid out to rights holders, including labels, publishing companies, and distributors"". Dan also talked about how the pandemic is having a tougher impact on smaller artists. âLike Spotify pointed out [in their statement to the BBC], the money is there, but I think the most important thing is not these huge artists who get to play arenas and get to play stadiums and headline festivalsâ¦ but it's smaller artists who I think are really, really suffering here and looking ahead of them and just totally questioning how they're going to pay rent and feed themselves.â People in England are being urged to stay away from tourism hotspots over the bank holiday weekend, with warm weather again forecast. Pictures of large numbers visiting beaches in Brighton and Southend in recent days have raised fears over social distancing, with no limit in place on how far people can travel. Visitors to Brighton will find stewards stationed around the beach to encourage physical distancing and direct people to less busy parts of the seafront if it becomes too busy. Councillor Carmen Appich, from Brighton & Hove City Council, said it would be an ""insult to the NHS staff and frontline workers"" to promote the city as a destination to visit. Hastings Borough Council says the area is ""closed to visitors from outside the town"" and on the Isle of Wight the council's ""clear advice"" is to stay away. People are also being advised not to visit Blackpool and have been asked to think twice before visiting the Peak District or Morecambe Bay. In Cornwall, council leaders have warned there is no lifeguard cover,  and a large coastal swell and spring tide will bring hazardous sea conditions over the weekend. The National Trust is urging people across England to stay close to home and explore local green spaces and countryside this weekend. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Home Secretary Priti Patel said people can enjoy the outdoors as long as they follow social distancing advice. The president of the Canadian Medical Association, which represents
physicians across the country, has called Canada's health-care system
""sick"" and is warning that a second wave of coronavirus could strike. Dr Sandy Buchman criticised the lack of personal protection equipment,
contact tracing and testing, and warned government officials they were
""gambling by reopening"". Dr Buchman was speaking before a Senate committee on Wednesday. ""We'd never permit a firefighter to go into a burning building without
adequate protection. We can't expect our frontline health care workers to put
themselves in harm's way,"" he said. Canadian labs have the capacity to process 60,000 tests a day, say public health
officials. But between 17 and 18 May, only about 23,000 tests were conducted. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged to get PPE to the front lines, and
ramp up contract tracing. His warning is a sharp rebuke for a country that prides itself on its public
health-care system. White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx was asked during a briefing about a large study of hydroxychloroquine, which found an increased risk of death for those taking it as a Covid-19 treatment. The Lancet study of 96,000 coronavirus patients found treatment with hydroxychloroquine - an anti-malaria drug - was also more likely to cause heart arrhythmia in patients. Dr Birx said the study revealed more about underlying health conditions, and said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ""has been very clear"" about their concerns in using the drug as a coronavirus prevention (as President Trump has said he is doing) or as a treatment course. Time to catch up on the latest developments: Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News A study of Covid-19 patients in hospitals has found no benefits to treating them with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. In fact, the patients given the drug were more likely to die in hospital and develop heart rhythm complications than other Covid patients in a comparison group. Nearly 15,000 patients took the drug (or a related form chloroquine) either alone or with an antibiotic, in The Lancet study. The researchers warn that the drug - which is safe for treating malaria and diseases such as lupus and arthritis - should not be used outside of clinical trials. But US President Donald Trump has been taking it, despite warnings it might be unsafe. In a bid to find out more, a trial to see whether the anti-malarial drug could prevent Covid-19 is under way. More than 40,000 healthcare workers from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America who are in contact with patients with the disease will be given the drugs to see if they work. Opening day at the Minnesota State Fair The Minnesota State Fair - one of the largest state fairs in the US with over 2m annual visitors - will close for the first time since 1946. Back then it was cancelled due to a polio outbreak. ""This isnât a difficult decision. Itâs the only decision,"" Minnesota State Fair General Manager Jerry Hammer said. ""Itâs the right thing to do."" According to the fair website, it has been cancelled only six times in total since its founding in 1859. ""By taking the tough road today, we guarantee that the fairâs future remains hopeful and bright,"" Hammer said. ""We want to see you all for many years to come, when we can celebrate in true State Fair style."" Coronavirus has been blamed for the collapse into administration of travel company Specialist Leisure Group. About 2,500 jobs have been lost, and 64,000 bookings cancelled, as a result. The company, based in Wigan, Greater Manchester, specialised in breaks and events for the over 50s. The group included well-known coach holiday brands Shearings and National Holidays. The firm said on its website that all tours, cruises, holidays and hotel breaks had been cancelled and would not be rescheduled, and blamed the impact of coronavirus. Travel trade organisation Abta said the hotel and travel company had been ""significantly impacted"" by the pandemic.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Quarantine plans for UK arrivals unveiled,"People arriving in the UK must self-isolate for 14 days from 8 June to help slow the spread of coronavirus, the government has said. Travellers will need to tell the government where they will quarantine, with enforcement through random spot checks and Â£1,000 fines in England. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the measure would ""reduce the risk of cases crossing our border"". Lorry drivers, seasonal farm workers, and coronavirus medics will be exempt. The requirement will also not apply to those travelling from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. This video can not be played The home secretary said the measures would be reviewed every three weeks If a person does not have suitable accommodation to go to, they will be required to stay in ""facilities arranged by the government"" at the person's own expense, according to Border Force chief Paul Lincoln. According to the Home Office, the new policy will be in place across the UK, although how it is enforced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be determined by the devolved administrations. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said discussions would take place with Police Scotland to work out how the policy will be implemented. Ms Patel told the daily Downing Street briefing the measures were not the same as completely shutting the UK border to visitors. ""We are not shutting down completely. We are not closing our borders,"" she said. And asked about the prospect of foreign holidays this summer, she added: ""This is absolutely not about booking holidays. We want to avoid a second wave and that is absolutely vital."" What are the new quarantine rules for passengers? Will I be able to go on holiday this year? Why the NHS may need to hire cabin crew So-called ""air bridges"" - agreements with countries that have low infection rates allowing tourists to travel without quarantining - will not be in place initially, the government said. The new measure, previously announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, will be reviewed every three weeks once it is introduced. But airlines have said a quarantine requirementwould ""effectively kill air travel""- and one airport bossdescribed the plans as a ""blunt tool"". The government currently recommends international travel only when absolutely necessary, and nobody should travel if they display anycoronavirus symptoms. Victoria Bacon from ABTA, the travel industry trade body, told the BBC the government needs to come up with some ""wider, more forward thinking"" strategies for the industry. She said: ""There's a whole range of support, not just financial, that the government can put in place to start helping the sector and we've heard very little from them. We really desperately need some help."" Passengers arriving in the UK will be required to fill out an online locator contact form - providing details of where they will spend their 14 days in self-isolation. The Home Office said the proposed accommodation will need to meet necessary requirements, such as a hotel or a private address with friends or family. There will be a fine of Â£100 for failure to complete the form, and the Border Force will have the power to refuse entry to non-UK citizens who do not comply with the new regulations. New arrivals will be told they may be contacted at any time during their quarantine and, in England, may be visited by public health authorities conducting spot checks. They will be told to avoid public transport and travel to their accommodation by car ""where possible"", and not to go out to buy food or other essentials ""where they can rely on others"". In England, a breach of self-isolation would be punishable by a Â£1,000 fixed penalty notice, or prosecution and an unlimited fine for persistent offenders. Analysis by Helen Catt, political correspondent The big question being asked about quarantine is: why now? The government argues that it simply wouldn't have made enough of a difference while the virus was spreading widely within the UK. But it hasn't, so far, fully explained why such a blanket measure was not introduced much earlier in the outbreak, before the virus took hold. People returning from Wuhan city and Hubei province in China were put into isolation for 14 days from late January. Later, those returning from Italy were told to self-isolate. But the measure was not extended to travellers from every country. There are also questions about how this will work in practice and what it will mean for the travel industry, which is already suffering huge losses. The Home Office has published afull list of exemptions,externalto the new requirements. The list includes road haulage and freight workers, medical professionals travelling to fight Covid-19, and seasonal farm workers who will self-isolate where they are working. TRAVEL:Can I get a holiday refund? FACE MASKS:Should I be wearing one? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? The home secretary said the new measures aim to ""keep the transmission rate down and prevent a devastating second wave"". She added: ""I fully expect the majority of people will do the right thing and abide by these measures. But we will take enforcement action against the minority of people who endanger the safety of others."" Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the party supported the new measures ""but is clear they are no substitute for a long-term, well thought through approach"". The number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK has reached 36,393 - a rise of 351 on Thursday's figure. Meanwhile, the government's scientific advice group Sage published the key evidenceon safety and the impact of reopening schools. At the daily briefing, government chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said children were at ""low risk, not zero risk"" from coronavirus and that reopening schools would push up infection rates. It came as teachers' union leaders said theyremained unconvinced it will be safeto reopen primary schools in England on 1 June.

If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. Anyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before. People travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law.

Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Face coverings are no longer required by law inEngland, although the government ""expects and recommends"" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. However, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets. Wearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces inWales,Scotland, andNorthern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. Where do I still need to wear a mask? Museums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. However, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. You may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. Businesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed.

"Travel firm collapses with loss of 2,500 jobs","Shearings Holidays is part of the group About 2,500 jobs have been lost and 64,000 bookings cancelled with the collapse into administration of Specialist Leisure Group. The hotel and travel company included well-known coach holiday brands Shearings and National Holidays. Trade organisation Abta said the company, which specialised in products for the over-50s, was ""significantly impacted"" by the coronavirus pandemic. One hotel owner predicted its demise would leave ""a void in the market"". Abta said the company had struggled to provide thousands of refunds for cancelled trips. It added that the vast majority of cancelled bookings were coach package holidays, which are financially protected, and customers with these bookings would receive a full refund. The Specialist Leisure Group,external, based in Wigan, also operated Caledonian Travel and hotel businesses such as Bay Hotels, Coast and Country Hotels and Country Living Hotels.

UK borrowing at record high as virus cost soars,"This video can not be played How are we going to pay for the coronavirus crisis? Government borrowing surged to Â£62bn in April, the highest monthly figure on record, after heavy spending to ease the coronavirus crisis. It means the deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - was larger last month than forecast for the whole year at the time of the Budget. The data from the Office for National Statistics,externalrevealed the soaring cost of support, such as furlough schemes. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said things would be worse without government aid. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has predicted that borrowing for the whole year could reach Â£298bn, more than five times the estimate at the time of the March Budget. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, described April's figure as ""pretty much unprecedented"". It said the cost of furlough schemes alone was Â£14bn in April. ""Borrowing now is about six times what it was [in April] last year, so we are talking about some really significant changes in the government finances,"" Mr Athow told the BBC. Coronavirus: How much will it cost the UK? How do government finances work? Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops He added it was impossible to forecast the current year's public finances because of the ""high amounts of uncertainty"". Tax receipts have fallen heavily, as the Treasury has allowed companies to defer some payments. The amount received from VAT in April was negative, with the government collecting less than was handed back in repayments. More than Â£880bn was spent on services such as defence, policing, the NHS, schools and welfare benefits in the last financial year Most of this comes from taxes, which totalled about Â£840bn last year Usually the government spends more money than it has. It borrows money by selling bonds - a promise to repay the money with interest The total debt has increased over time. It is currently Â£1.9 trillion - about Â£28,000 per person in the UK Although the debt in cash terms has gone up, money raised from taxes has risen too, which means the debt can be manageable Meanwhile, borrowing by the state in March 2020 has been revised up by Â£11.7bn to Â£14.7bn, the ONS said. It said this was driven by a reduction in previous estimates of tax receipts and National Insurance contributions. The surge in borrowing comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak stepped up financial support for businesses and employees after vast areas of the economy were forced to halt due to the coronavirus lockdown. After publication of the figures, Mr Sunak said that if the government had not provided financial support, the cost to the economy and people's livelihoods would be much worse. ""Our top priority is to support people, jobs and businesses through this crisis and ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible,"" he said. ""That's why we've taken unprecedented steps to provide lifelines to people and businesses with our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts."" For the past decade, the government had been trying to practise strict financial housekeeping, aiming for position where it could cover day-to-day spending with the money form our taxes and eliminate the deficit. But then the crisis hit - and as the chancellor claims, the schemes put in place have provided a lifeline to tide millions over, to prevent an even bigger economic disaster. It was worth ripping up the rulebook for, he said. However the bills are mounting, just as the amount received from taxpayers slumped. This year's deficit could be the equivalent of the biggest slice of our income since the Second World War - and that hole needs plugging. For the moment, the government has increased its borrowing on financial markets, through bonds, effectively IOUs - but there is a limit to how much it can  do so. Ultimately, economists say taxes will have to rise, or spending cut - the emergency raft will have a price tag which we can't escape. But the chancellor will have to impose those carefully to avoid jeopardising a recovery. And if he opts for tax hikes, he'll risk breaking some election promises. The scale of the economic consequences was underlined on Friday in separate retail sales data from the ONS. These showed thatHigh Street sales crashed last monthas shops closed for the lockdown. It was also announced on Friday that a mortgage payment holiday scheme for homeowners in financial difficulty during the pandemichas been extended for another three months. As a result of the jump in borrowing, total public sector debt rose to Â£1,888bn at the end of April - Â£118.4bn higher than April 2019. Former chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: ""We have to come to terms with the fact that Britain is poorer and the economy is smaller than it would have been."" Asked if the economy would bounce back, he said: ""Bounce is the wrong word, but it will recover."" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, described April's borrowing as ""alarmingly high"", but added that a small easing of the lockdown from 13 May probably meant the government would not have to borrow as much this month. And despite the pressure on public finances, Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation, said there were no signs the government was struggling to raise money on the financial markets. ""Record low interest rates mean the UK's higher debt burden should remain more than manageable,"" he said. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

NHS may need to hire airline staffThe Chief Executive of NHS England says it is considering hiring cabin crew to train as nurses.,"The NHS in England may start hiring airline staff who have lost their jobs to fill a gap in nurse numbers, its chief executive has said. Sir Simon Stevens told MPs airlines hired nurses from the NHS to work as cabin crew in the early 2000s. It was now possible the NHS would consider hiring these staff back as the airline industry continues to struggle due to coronavirus. He was speaking to the Commons Public Accounts Committee. Sir Simon told the committee the health service had seen an ""amazing response"" from former NHS staff who were prepared to return to the frontline to help the fight against Covid-19. British Airways set to cut up to 12,000 jobs NHS fees to be scrapped for overseas health staff 'I returned to nursing the day the pandemic was declared' But he added that international recruitment for NHS staff would be a problem for the first half of this year due to the pandemic. The NHS in England currently has a nursing staff gap of 40,000. Sir Simon said he wanted to see 50,000 nurses join the service. Sir Simon told the MPS that the NHS would have to change the way it offers care, with coronavirus constantly ""in the background"". Agreements struck with private hospitals to supply beds during the coronavirus crisis would need to continue, he added, and Nightingale hospitals, set up to treat Covid-19 patients and manage excess demand for hospital beds, would be kept ""in reserve"". NHS hospitals had treated 89,000 coronavirus patients since the outbreak began in the UK in February, Sir Simon told the committee. And standard emergency and A&E attendances, which had seen a drop, were starting to increase back to expected levels. Chris Wormald, the top civil servant at the Department for Health and Social Care, told the committee that the UK ""never ran out of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) nationally"". But he said ""there were a lot of issues"" in getting PPE to NHS staff and care workers. The government was looking at producing PPE domestically, he added, but there would be ""no imminent replacement of what we need to buy on international markets"".

"Time to end Clap for Carers, says founderThe nationwide applause has ""had its moment"" and should end after 10 weeks, Annemarie Plas says.UK","This video can not be played Founder Annemarie Plas said it would be ""beautiful"" to end it after its 10th week and make it an annual event The UK's weekly applause for front-line workers tackling the coronavirus outbreak has ""had its moment"" and should end next Thursday, the woman behind it has suggested. It would be ""beautiful"" to end Clap for Carers after its 10th week, and make it an annual event, Annemarie Plas said. She said the public had ""shown our appreciation"" and it was now up to ministers to ""reward"" key workers. The government has said it is considering how best to do so. When is it hypocritical to clap for carers? What are key workers paid?

However, after proving very popular, it was expanded to cover all key workers and has continued every Thursday at 20:00 BST, with people peering out of their windows or standing on their doorsteps to show their appreciation by clapping, cheering, banging saucepans and playing instruments. Dutch-born Londoner Ms Plas,who is credited with starting the nationwide applause, told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show that it was inspired by similar events in the Netherlands and around the world.

US condemns Chinaâs Hong Kong security law,"Protesters say China's new security law would erode Hong Kong's freedoms US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has condemned China's plan to impose a new security law in Hong Kong, calling it a ""death knell"" for the city's freedoms. China is seeking to pass a law that would ban ""treason, secession, sedition and subversion"" in Hong Kong. Critics say the law would strip Hong Kong of the rights it currently enjoys, that are not seen in mainland China. Mr Pompeo said the decision to bypass Hong Kong's lawmakers ignores ""the will of the people"". ""The United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal, abide by its international obligations, and respect Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions, and civil liberties,"" Mr Pompeo said in a statement on Friday. Mr Pompeo's intervention is likely to infuriate the Chinese government, whose relations with the US have been strained recently by disputes over trade and the coronavirus pandemic. This video can not be played Hong Kongers give their reaction to the controversial national security law in May A joint statement from UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and his Australian and Canadian counterparts also expressed ""deep concern"" at China's proposal. It said: ""Making such a law on Hong Kong's behalf without the direct participation of its people, legislature or judiciary would clearly undermine the principle of 'one country, two systems', under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy."" In Hong Kong, pro-democracy activists have been calling for support from Western governments after China announced the law. On Friday, campaigners urged mass protests over the weekend. The law was submitted at the annual National People's Congress (NPC), which largely rubber-stamps decisions already taken by the Communist leadership, but is still the most important political event of the year. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong so worried? All the context you need on Hong Kong's protests How bad are China's economic woes? Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region and an economic powerhouse, was required to introduce such a law after the handover from British control to Chinese rule in 1997. But its unpopularity means it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after 500,000 people took to the streets. Now, after a wave of sustained and often violent protests in Hong Kong last year, Beijing is attempting to push the law through. The Chinese government argues the law is necessary to ""prevent, stop and punish"" such protests in the future. Hong Kong's government said it would co-operate with Beijing to enact the law, adding it would not affect the city's freedoms. Hong Kong is what is known as a ""special administrative region"" of China. It has observed ""one country, two systems"" since Britain returned sovereignty in 1997, which has allowed it certain freedoms the rest of China does not have. What is the Basic Law and how does it work? How is Hong Kong run? Pro-democracy activists fear that China pushing through the law could mean ""the end of Hong Kong"" - that is, the effective end of its autonomy and these freedoms. This video can not be played Former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten: ""UK should tell China this is outrageous"" In his statement, Mr Pompeo said any decision to impinge on Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms would ""inevitably impact our assessment"" of the territory's status. The US is currently considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges. President Trump has also weighed in, saying the US would react strongly if it went through - without giving details. The ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by the NPC - was explained by Wang Chen, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC. It consists of an introduction and seven articles. Article 4 may prove the most controversial. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes China scraps annual growth target for first time That article says Hong Kong ""must improve"" national security, before adding: ""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law."" That means China could potentially have its own law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, alongside the city's own. A group of pro-democracy activists marched on the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong on Friday Addressing the congress, Premier Li Keqiang said: ""We'll establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the two Special Administrative Regions."" Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment, said the law would help authorities tackle illegal activity in the city. Robin Brant, BBC China Correspondent China has long desired a new national security law for Hong Kong. Beijing believes almost a year of mass protests and, at times, paralysing confrontations on the streets shows that now it is needed more than ever. But critics point to what they say are ambiguities inherent in such a law and the broad, generalist framework it would bring to a place which has a very different legal tradition than the communist-controlled mainland. ""Treason, sedition and subversion"" are all open to a very wide interpretation. Up to now, the worst charge most arrested protesters have faced has been for rioting. The notion of ""terrorism"" also features in this proposed law. That too could encompass wide-ranging acts and activities that the authoritarian rulers on the mainland consider far more menacing than those in Hong Kong, or for that matter elsewhere. China could essentially place the draft law intoAnnex III of the Basic Law,external, which covers national laws that must be implemented in Hong Kong - either by legislation, or decree. The NPC is expected to vote on the draft law at the end of its annual session, on 28 May. It will then be forwarded to the NPC's Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which is expected to finalise and enact the law by the end of June. Last year, Hong Kong was rocked by months of protests sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Mr Wang said the security risks had become ""increasingly notable"" - a reference to last year's protests. ""Considering Hong Kong's situation at present, efforts must be made at the state-level to establish and improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms,"" he is quoted as saying in state media. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Beijing may also fear September's elections to Hong Kong's legislature. If last year's success for pro-democracy parties in district elections is repeated, government bills could potentially be blocked.

Will I be able to go on holiday this year?,"Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. What are the current rules? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. Anyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before. People travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law. Some UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding.SagaandP&Ohave said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. How do I get my free Covid tests? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales. However people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. There are still some restrictions in place inNorthern Ireland: 10 people from three households can meet and stay indoors in private dwellings and holiday accommodation Unlimited households can meet outdoors Social distancing of 1m (3ft) remains for many indoors activities, including restaurants, retail and shopping centres No social distancing laws outdoors, or on public transport, but 1m (3ft) recommended The Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September. What can you now do across the UK? How are social distancing rules changing now? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Face coverings are no longer required by law inEngland, although the government ""expects and recommends"" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. However, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets. Wearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces inWales,Scotland, andNorthern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. Where do I still need to wear a mask? Museums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. However, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. You may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. Businesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. Indoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue tocollect customer contact details,external. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. Nightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.

"Quarantine plans for UK arrivals unveiledFrom 8 June, people arriving in the UK must self-isolate for 14 days - but some workers will be exempt.","People arriving in the UK must self-isolate for 14 days from 8 June to help slow the spread of coronavirus, the government has said. Travellers will need to tell the government where they will quarantine, with enforcement through random spot checks and Â£1,000 fines in England. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the measure would ""reduce the risk of cases crossing our border"". Lorry drivers, seasonal farm workers, and coronavirus medics will be exempt. The requirement will also not apply to those travelling from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. This video can not be played The home secretary said the measures would be reviewed every three weeks If a person does not have suitable accommodation to go to, they will be required to stay in ""facilities arranged by the government"" at the person's own expense, according to Border Force chief Paul Lincoln. According to the Home Office, the new policy will be in place across the UK, although how it is enforced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be determined by the devolved administrations. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said discussions would take place with Police Scotland to work out how the policy will be implemented. Ms Patel told the daily Downing Street briefing the measures were not the same as completely shutting the UK border to visitors. ""We are not shutting down completely. We are not closing our borders,"" she said. And asked about the prospect of foreign holidays this summer, she added: ""This is absolutely not about booking holidays. We want to avoid a second wave and that is absolutely vital."" What are the new quarantine rules for passengers? Will I be able to go on holiday this year? Why the NHS may need to hire cabin crew So-called ""air bridges"" - agreements with countries that have low infection rates allowing tourists to travel without quarantining - will not be in place initially, the government said. The new measure, previously announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, will be reviewed every three weeks once it is introduced. But airlines have said a quarantine requirementwould ""effectively kill air travel""- and one airport bossdescribed the plans as a ""blunt tool"". The government currently recommends international travel only when absolutely necessary, and nobody should travel if they display anycoronavirus symptoms. Victoria Bacon from ABTA, the travel industry trade body, told the BBC the government needs to come up with some ""wider, more forward thinking"" strategies for the industry. She said: ""There's a whole range of support, not just financial, that the government can put in place to start helping the sector and we've heard very little from them. We really desperately need some help."" Passengers arriving in the UK will be required to fill out an online locator contact form - providing details of where they will spend their 14 days in self-isolation. The Home Office said the proposed accommodation will need to meet necessary requirements, such as a hotel or a private address with friends or family. There will be a fine of Â£100 for failure to complete the form, and the Border Force will have the power to refuse entry to non-UK citizens who do not comply with the new regulations. New arrivals will be told they may be contacted at any time during their quarantine and, in England, may be visited by public health authorities conducting spot checks. They will be told to avoid public transport and travel to their accommodation by car ""where possible"", and not to go out to buy food or other essentials ""where they can rely on others"". In England, a breach of self-isolation would be punishable by a Â£1,000 fixed penalty notice, or prosecution and an unlimited fine for persistent offenders. Analysis by Helen Catt, political correspondent The big question being asked about quarantine is: why now? The government argues that it simply wouldn't have made enough of a difference while the virus was spreading widely within the UK. But it hasn't, so far, fully explained why such a blanket measure was not introduced much earlier in the outbreak, before the virus took hold. People returning from Wuhan city and Hubei province in China were put into isolation for 14 days from late January. Later, those returning from Italy were told to self-isolate. But the measure was not extended to travellers from every country. There are also questions about how this will work in practice and what it will mean for the travel industry, which is already suffering huge losses. The Home Office has published afull list of exemptions,externalto the new requirements. The list includes road haulage and freight workers, medical professionals travelling to fight Covid-19, and seasonal farm workers who will self-isolate where they are working.

The home secretary said the new measures aim to ""keep the transmission rate down and prevent a devastating second wave"". She added: ""I fully expect the majority of people will do the right thing and abide by these measures. But we will take enforcement action against the minority of people who endanger the safety of others."" Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the party supported the new measures ""but is clear they are no substitute for a long-term, well thought through approach"". The number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK has reached 36,393 - a rise of 351 on Thursday's figure. Meanwhile, the government's scientific advice group Sage published the key evidenceon safety and the impact of reopening schools. At the daily briefing, government chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said children were at ""low risk, not zero risk"" from coronavirus and that reopening schools would push up infection rates. It came as teachers' union leaders said theyremained unconvinced it will be safeto reopen primary schools in England on 1 June.

UK borrowing at record high as virus cost soarsThe government borrowed Â£62bn in April - the highest monthly figure since records began.BusinessComments,"This video can not be played How are we going to pay for the coronavirus crisis? Government borrowing surged to Â£62bn in April, the highest monthly figure on record, after heavy spending to ease the coronavirus crisis. It means the deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - was larger last month than forecast for the whole year at the time of the Budget. The data from the Office for National Statistics,externalrevealed the soaring cost of support, such as furlough schemes. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said things would be worse without government aid. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has predicted that borrowing for the whole year could reach Â£298bn, more than five times the estimate at the time of the March Budget. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, described April's figure as ""pretty much unprecedented"". It said the cost of furlough schemes alone was Â£14bn in April. ""Borrowing now is about six times what it was [in April] last year, so we are talking about some really significant changes in the government finances,"" Mr Athow told the BBC. Coronavirus: How much will it cost the UK? How do government finances work? Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops He added it was impossible to forecast the current year's public finances because of the ""high amounts of uncertainty"". Tax receipts have fallen heavily, as the Treasury has allowed companies to defer some payments. The amount received from VAT in April was negative, with the government collecting less than was handed back in repayments. More than Â£880bn was spent on services such as defence, policing, the NHS, schools and welfare benefits in the last financial year Most of this comes from taxes, which totalled about Â£840bn last year Usually the government spends more money than it has. It borrows money by selling bonds - a promise to repay the money with interest The total debt has increased over time. It is currently Â£1.9 trillion - about Â£28,000 per person in the UK Although the debt in cash terms has gone up, money raised from taxes has risen too, which means the debt can be manageable Meanwhile, borrowing by the state in March 2020 has been revised up by Â£11.7bn to Â£14.7bn, the ONS said. It said this was driven by a reduction in previous estimates of tax receipts and National Insurance contributions. The surge in borrowing comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak stepped up financial support for businesses and employees after vast areas of the economy were forced to halt due to the coronavirus lockdown. After publication of the figures, Mr Sunak said that if the government had not provided financial support, the cost to the economy and people's livelihoods would be much worse. ""Our top priority is to support people, jobs and businesses through this crisis and ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible,"" he said. ""That's why we've taken unprecedented steps to provide lifelines to people and businesses with our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts."" For the past decade, the government had been trying to practise strict financial housekeeping, aiming for position where it could cover day-to-day spending with the money form our taxes and eliminate the deficit. But then the crisis hit - and as the chancellor claims, the schemes put in place have provided a lifeline to tide millions over, to prevent an even bigger economic disaster. It was worth ripping up the rulebook for, he said. However the bills are mounting, just as the amount received from taxpayers slumped. This year's deficit could be the equivalent of the biggest slice of our income since the Second World War - and that hole needs plugging. For the moment, the government has increased its borrowing on financial markets, through bonds, effectively IOUs - but there is a limit to how much it can  do so. Ultimately, economists say taxes will have to rise, or spending cut - the emergency raft will have a price tag which we can't escape. But the chancellor will have to impose those carefully to avoid jeopardising a recovery. And if he opts for tax hikes, he'll risk breaking some election promises. The scale of the economic consequences was underlined on Friday in separate retail sales data from the ONS. These showed thatHigh Street sales crashed last monthas shops closed for the lockdown. It was also announced on Friday that a mortgage payment holiday scheme for homeowners in financial difficulty during the pandemichas been extended for another three months. As a result of the jump in borrowing, total public sector debt rose to Â£1,888bn at the end of April - Â£118.4bn higher than April 2019. Former chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: ""We have to come to terms with the fact that Britain is poorer and the economy is smaller than it would have been."" Asked if the economy would bounce back, he said: ""Bounce is the wrong word, but it will recover."" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, described April's borrowing as ""alarmingly high"", but added that a small easing of the lockdown from 13 May probably meant the government would not have to borrow as much this month. And despite the pressure on public finances, Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation, said there were no signs the government was struggling to raise money on the financial markets. ""Record low interest rates mean the UK's higher debt burden should remain more than manageable,"" he said. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Mortgage payment holiday extended for three months,"More than a million and a half people took up the opportunity to delay their mortgage payments under the scheme. Homeowners struggling financially due to coronavirus will be able to extend their mortgage payment holiday for a further three months, or cut payments. Mortgage holidays started in March, allowing people to defer payments without affecting their credit rating. That respite from payments would end for the first applicants in June and the Treasury said the extension would provide certainty for those affected. However, it said borrowers should still pay their mortgages if they were able. The deferred payments will still have to be paid back later on, so mortgage customers will face higher bills once the so-called holiday comes to an end. However, the Treasury was concerned an abrupt end to the scheme could produce a cliff-edge effect, with families facing money problems as bad, if not worse, as they did when the virus struck. Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at financial regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said that if customers could afford to restart mortgage payments ""it is in their best interests to do so"". ""But where they can't, a range of further support will be available,"" he added. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, said: ""A payment holiday may not be the right choice for everyone, and borrowers should only apply if they need one. We would encourage any borrowers concerned about their financial situation to check with their lender."" The Money Advice Trust, a charity which runs the National Debtline advice service, said the extension was good news, but urged the government to help private renters, too. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said: ""People in private rented accommodation are among the most exposed to financial difficulty in the wake of the outbreak, and the government should listen to calls to help people meet their rent payments by increasing the Local Housing Allowance rate to cover 50% of average market rents."" The date for homeowners to apply to extend their mortgage holidays has also been extended, with customers able to apply until the end of  October, so if someone applied for one then, it would take them through to January. More than 1.8 million mortgage customers have taken advantage of the relief from making payments so far. The banking body, UK Finance, estimates this is an average of Â£755 a month. A cliff edge was looming. The first borrowers to have put off their mortgage payments would have had to start paying again next month. The proposal to extend the scheme puts off the day of reckoning, but it could create an even bigger financial challenge for families later on. Because the so-called mortgage holidays do not involve free money. You have to make up the shortfall afterwards. It means that mortgage bills will be slightly higher when you resume paying, and they will be higher still if you extend for another three months. Mortgage rates are relatively low and the cost is spread over 25 years, so hopefully the increase will be bearable. That may not be the case with higher cost borrowing. The FCA will have to think much harder about whether extending holidays for credit cards and other debt is a good idea. Lenders will be expected to contact customers affected by the extension, to discuss the options available to them. ""Some may be able to resume their full monthly payments, others may be able to pay a proportion of their monthly payment, or temporarily switch to an interest only mortgage, and others will opt to extend their mortgage payment holiday,"" the government said.

Tesco expands priority list for disabled shoppersHundreds of disabled people are to be added to Tesco's priority shopping list after legal action was taken by a disabled mother unable to buy food.,"Hundreds of disabled people can now be added to Tesco's priority shopping list after legal action was taken by a disabled mother unable to buy food. Joanne Baskett, 48, who cannot leave her house, says she was discriminated against because she could not secure an online shopping slot. A further 318 people sent claims to all of the UK's major supermarkets for breaching the Equality Act 2010. Tesco has now agreed to add all those people to its priority list. The individuals were not named on the Government's Extremely Clinically Vulnerable list, but nevertheless felt their access requirements should be taken into consideration by supermarkets. Ms Baskett from Swindon, who has multiple organ paralysis, says she was unable to secure an online shopping slot after returning home from hospital at the end of March. She said: ""For six weeks I would stay awake until midnight to try and get a slot but I couldn't. It has had a huge mental and physical effect on me."" She took legal action and accused the supermarket of breaching the Equality Act 2010 for not making reasonable adjustments to enable her, as a disabled person, to shop. Chris Fry, from Fry Law, who handled the case, said:  ""We have been hearing so many heart-breaking stories about people unable to leave the house and having to rely on the charity of friends and families and even foodbanks. ""This is just the first step but it's going to improve many people's lives.""

US condemns Chinaâs Hong Kong security lawSecretary of State Mike Pompeo says the law would be a âdeath knellâ for Hong Kongâs special freedoms.China,"Protesters say China's new security law would erode Hong Kong's freedoms US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has condemned China's plan to impose a new security law in Hong Kong, calling it a ""death knell"" for the city's freedoms. China is seeking to pass a law that would ban ""treason, secession, sedition and subversion"" in Hong Kong. Critics say the law would strip Hong Kong of the rights it currently enjoys, that are not seen in mainland China. Mr Pompeo said the decision to bypass Hong Kong's lawmakers ignores ""the will of the people"". ""The United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal, abide by its international obligations, and respect Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions, and civil liberties,"" Mr Pompeo said in a statement on Friday. Mr Pompeo's intervention is likely to infuriate the Chinese government, whose relations with the US have been strained recently by disputes over trade and the coronavirus pandemic. This video can not be played Hong Kongers give their reaction to the controversial national security law in May A joint statement from UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and his Australian and Canadian counterparts also expressed ""deep concern"" at China's proposal. It said: ""Making such a law on Hong Kong's behalf without the direct participation of its people, legislature or judiciary would clearly undermine the principle of 'one country, two systems', under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy."" In Hong Kong, pro-democracy activists have been calling for support from Western governments after China announced the law. On Friday, campaigners urged mass protests over the weekend. The law was submitted at the annual National People's Congress (NPC), which largely rubber-stamps decisions already taken by the Communist leadership, but is still the most important political event of the year. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong so worried? All the context you need on Hong Kong's protests How bad are China's economic woes? Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region and an economic powerhouse, was required to introduce such a law after the handover from British control to Chinese rule in 1997. But its unpopularity means it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after 500,000 people took to the streets. Now, after a wave of sustained and often violent protests in Hong Kong last year, Beijing is attempting to push the law through. The Chinese government argues the law is necessary to ""prevent, stop and punish"" such protests in the future. Hong Kong's government said it would co-operate with Beijing to enact the law, adding it would not affect the city's freedoms. Hong Kong is what is known as a ""special administrative region"" of China. It has observed ""one country, two systems"" since Britain returned sovereignty in 1997, which has allowed it certain freedoms the rest of China does not have. What is the Basic Law and how does it work? How is Hong Kong run? Pro-democracy activists fear that China pushing through the law could mean ""the end of Hong Kong"" - that is, the effective end of its autonomy and these freedoms. This video can not be played Former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten: ""UK should tell China this is outrageous"" In his statement, Mr Pompeo said any decision to impinge on Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms would ""inevitably impact our assessment"" of the territory's status. The US is currently considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges. President Trump has also weighed in, saying the US would react strongly if it went through - without giving details. The ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by the NPC - was explained by Wang Chen, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC. It consists of an introduction and seven articles. Article 4 may prove the most controversial. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes China scraps annual growth target for first time That article says Hong Kong ""must improve"" national security, before adding: ""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law."" That means China could potentially have its own law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, alongside the city's own. A group of pro-democracy activists marched on the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong on Friday Addressing the congress, Premier Li Keqiang said: ""We'll establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the two Special Administrative Regions."" Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment, said the law would help authorities tackle illegal activity in the city. Robin Brant, BBC China Correspondent China has long desired a new national security law for Hong Kong. Beijing believes almost a year of mass protests and, at times, paralysing confrontations on the streets shows that now it is needed more than ever. But critics point to what they say are ambiguities inherent in such a law and the broad, generalist framework it would bring to a place which has a very different legal tradition than the communist-controlled mainland. ""Treason, sedition and subversion"" are all open to a very wide interpretation. Up to now, the worst charge most arrested protesters have faced has been for rioting. The notion of ""terrorism"" also features in this proposed law. That too could encompass wide-ranging acts and activities that the authoritarian rulers on the mainland consider far more menacing than those in Hong Kong, or for that matter elsewhere. China could essentially place the draft law intoAnnex III of the Basic Law,external, which covers national laws that must be implemented in Hong Kong - either by legislation, or decree. The NPC is expected to vote on the draft law at the end of its annual session, on 28 May. It will then be forwarded to the NPC's Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which is expected to finalise and enact the law by the end of June. Last year, Hong Kong was rocked by months of protests sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.

Mortgage payment holiday extended for three monthsThe Treasury cautions that borrowers should continue to pay their mortgages if they are able.BusinessComments,"More than a million and a half people took up the opportunity to delay their mortgage payments under the scheme. Homeowners struggling financially due to coronavirus will be able to extend their mortgage payment holiday for a further three months, or cut payments. Mortgage holidays started in March, allowing people to defer payments without affecting their credit rating. That respite from payments would end for the first applicants in June and the Treasury said the extension would provide certainty for those affected. However, it said borrowers should still pay their mortgages if they were able. The deferred payments will still have to be paid back later on, so mortgage customers will face higher bills once the so-called holiday comes to an end. However, the Treasury was concerned an abrupt end to the scheme could produce a cliff-edge effect, with families facing money problems as bad, if not worse, as they did when the virus struck. Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at financial regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said that if customers could afford to restart mortgage payments ""it is in their best interests to do so"". ""But where they can't, a range of further support will be available,"" he added. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, said: ""A payment holiday may not be the right choice for everyone, and borrowers should only apply if they need one. We would encourage any borrowers concerned about their financial situation to check with their lender."" The Money Advice Trust, a charity which runs the National Debtline advice service, said the extension was good news, but urged the government to help private renters, too. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said: ""People in private rented accommodation are among the most exposed to financial difficulty in the wake of the outbreak, and the government should listen to calls to help people meet their rent payments by increasing the Local Housing Allowance rate to cover 50% of average market rents."" The date for homeowners to apply to extend their mortgage holidays has also been extended, with customers able to apply until the end of  October, so if someone applied for one then, it would take them through to January. More than 1.8 million mortgage customers have taken advantage of the relief from making payments so far. The banking body, UK Finance, estimates this is an average of Â£755 a month. A cliff edge was looming. The first borrowers to have put off their mortgage payments would have had to start paying again next month. The proposal to extend the scheme puts off the day of reckoning, but it could create an even bigger financial challenge for families later on. Because the so-called mortgage holidays do not involve free money. You have to make up the shortfall afterwards. It means that mortgage bills will be slightly higher when you resume paying, and they will be higher still if you extend for another three months. Mortgage rates are relatively low and the cost is spread over 25 years, so hopefully the increase will be bearable. That may not be the case with higher cost borrowing. The FCA will have to think much harder about whether extending holidays for credit cards and other debt is a good idea. Lenders will be expected to contact customers affected by the extension, to discuss the options available to them. ""Some may be able to resume their full monthly payments, others may be able to pay a proportion of their monthly payment, or temporarily switch to an interest only mortgage, and others will opt to extend their mortgage payment holiday,"" the government said.

UK arrivals could be fined for breaking quarantine,"Anyone arriving in the UK from abroad could be fined Â£1,000 if they fail to self-isolate for 14 days, the government is expected to announce. Under the plans, health officials would be able to carry out spot checks to check whether people were complying. The new rules to help tackle Covid-19, which will also apply to British people returning from abroad, are not expected to come into force until next month. Home Secretary Priti Patel will give more details at the daily briefing. The number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK has reached 36,393 - a rise of 351 on Thursday's figure. What are the new travel quarantine rules? How coronavirus is driving a revolution in travel Will I be able to go on holiday this year? Will camping be on the cards this summer? As part of the quarantine proposals, which are aimed at guarding against a second wave of coronavirus infections, any passengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train would be asked to fill in a form with their contact information. They would need to provide UK Border Force officials with an address where they would self-isolate, otherwise accommodation would be arranged by the government. Road hauliers and medical officials would be exempt, as well as those arriving from the Republic of Ireland. However, people travelling from France will not be exempt, the government has previously confirmed,after it was initially suggested otherwise. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: ""The reality is we are saying to people if you are going to go abroad you need to look at the fact you may well need to do quarantine when you come back."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth backed the plans, but said there were ""lots of questions as to why we didn't do this sooner"". He added: ""I would urge the government to get on with it and give us the details about how it's going to work in practice."" Many other countries already require arriving passengers to enter a 14-day quarantine, including New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea, Spain and the US. Former head of Border Force, Tony Smith - now chairman of the International Border Management and Technologies Association - said he was ""surprised"" quarantine measures hadn't been brought in sooner at UK borders. He told the Commons Home Affairs Committee on Friday that he would have expected a more ""incremental approach"" from the government ""that might have reduced the transmission from abroad"". Also speaking to MPs, the boss of the Airport Operators Association, Karen Dee, said there had been no ""specific discussions"" as yet on how a quarantine would be implemented, but said it would be ""odd"" to introduce them now. She said quarantine proposals were a ""blunt tool"" because it would  apply ""to everybody in all circumstances"" and airports would prefer a risk-based approach, with agreements between countries. This video can not be played Will thermal cameras help at airports? Airlines have warned quarantine measures could make an already critical situation worse for them, asair travel has plummetedby as much as 99% due to the pandemic. Virgin Atlantic said the government's proposal would ""prevent flights from resuming"" before August because there ""simply won't be sufficient demand"". A Ryanair spokeswoman said the plans were completely ""unenforceable"" and the isolation measure would not work unless passengers arriving in UK airports from abroad are ""detained in airport terminals or hotels"" for the 14-day period. She added: ""If this measure had any basis in science, then the Irish visitors would not and could not be exempt."" Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK - which represents the industry - said introducing a quarantine at this stage ""makes no sense"". He said the government should support ""a common-sense approach"" involving ""health corridors with low-risk countries"" - these have also been called air bridges and would allow tourists to travel between two countries without needing to quarantine. Downing Streetpreviously saidits plans would be reviewed every three weeks once they were introduced. The government currently recommends international travel only when absolutely necessary, and nobody should travel if they display any coronavirus symptoms. TRAVEL:Can I get a holiday refund?

Where do governments go when they need money?,"Governments borrow to fund ""day-to-day"" spending, as well as long-term infrastructure projects like the Elizabeth Line The UK government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest. The government gets most of its income from taxes. For example, workers payincome tax and national insurance, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on profits. It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and that sometimes happens. But, if it can't, the government covers the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending or borrowing. Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax. So, governments often decide to borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects, like new railways and roads. How the government raises and spends Â£1 trillion a year The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds. A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments. UK government bonds - known as ""gilts"" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. The government sells short and long-term gilts to let it borrow money over different time periods, with varying interest rates. The amount the government borrows fluctuates from month to month. For instance, it tends to borrow less in January, when many people pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go. So, it is more helpful to look across a whole year, or the year-to-date. In the last full financial year, to March 2024, the government borrowed Â£125.1bn. The most recent monthly figures show thegovernment borrowed Â£11.2bn in November 2024,which was Â£3.4bn lower than in the same month the previous year, and the lowest November figure since 2021. Borrowing since March stands at Â£113.2bn, which is the third highest financial year-to-November borrowing total since monthly records began in 1993. The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about Â£2.8 trillion - or Â£2,800,000,000,000. That is roughly the same asthe value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP. The current level is more than double that seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008. The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up. But, in relation to the size of the economy, UK debt figures are still low compared with much of the last century. They are also less than the equivalent figures for some other leading economies. The larger the national debt, the more interest the government pays. That cost was not as great when interest rates were low during the 2010s, but became more noticeable after the Bank of England started raising interest rates in 2021. The amount of interest the government pays on national debt also varies from month to month. It was Â£3bn in November 2024, the lowest November figure for five years. However, interest rates for long-term borrowing have risen to theirhighest levels this century., with the government paying 5.25% on 30-year gilts. If the government has to set aside more cash for paying debts, it may mean it has less to spend on public services. Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost. Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax in the long run. The increase in long-term interest rates seen in January prompted some economists to warn that the government is ""on course"" to miss its own borrowing targets. Labour decided to stick to a rule followed by the previous government that the total amount of money owed must have fallen as a proportion of the UK economy in five years' time. In October's Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeveschanged the definition of debt that the government would use in the target to enable her to raise more money for investment. It will now track a different, broader measure of debt called public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL). This includes, for example, the money the government gets from people repaying their student loans. Downing Street said there was ""no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability"", and that ""meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable"". The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)- which monitors the government's financial performance - will present its latest economic forecast to Parliament in late March. It has previously warned that public debt could soar as the population ages and tax income falls. In an ageing population, the proportion of people of working age drops, meaning the government takes less in tax while paying out more in pensions.

Thedeficitis the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends. When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus.

The orchestra stranded in a castle,"The sound of panpipes, flutes and snare drums fills the rehearsal space of the Orquesta Experimental de Instrumentos Nativos. ""The breathing techniques required to play these instruments for a few hours put you in a kind of trance,"" says Miguel Cordoba, who plays the siku flute. But as soon as the rehearsal finishes they are all too aware of how their life has changed. Because they are not rehearsing back home in La Paz, Bolivia, but in the shadow of a German castle where they have been stranded for 73 days. The musicians, most of whom have never left Bolivia before, were expecting to spend just over a fortnight this spring touring east Germany's concert halls. Instead they are holed up in the buildings and grounds of the sprawling estate of Rheinsberg Palace, a moated castle which has been home to generations of German royalty and aristocracy, an hour and a half's drive northwest of Berlin. As the musicians, some of whom are as young as 17, touched down in Germany on 10 March for their tour, news broke that Berlin had become the seventh German region to impose a ban on gatherings of 1,000 people or more in response to the coronavirus pandemic. ""Our bus broke down on the motorway. I remember joking that this was bad luck and perhaps our concerts would be cancelled,"" recollects Carlos, ""but never did I think it would actually happen."" Their three planned performances were cancelled in the days that followed, and as Bolivia's government announced it would close its borders, the orchestra scrambled to get home but failed. Germany's ban on mass gatherings was swiftly followed by a full lockdown, meaning the musicians are only allowed to roam as far as the forest that lines the perimeter of the estate. So their free time is spent rehearsing in the nearly 600-year-old palace grounds and exploring the surrounding woodland, home to 23 packs of wolves. Only on Monday did they get the chance to step inside the castle for the first time as tours for the public reopened. ""It's very different to my home, it's very beautiful,"" says 25-year-old Miguel. Rehearsing in the guest house of Rheinsberg Palace ""There are worse places to be trapped. When I wake up, I watch the sun rise over the forest and the lake. Back home, I only hear the sound of traffic."" But despite the picturesque natural surroundings, the musicians are worried they have been forgotten. ""We feel abandoned,"" says Carlos, who's spent several thankless hours on the phone to the Bolivian embassy trying to find a way to get home.Â The group had only been in Germany for a week when Bolivia's president announced the country's border was set to close within days, and all international flights had been suspended.Â Arrangements were swiftly made by the German foreign office and Bolivian embassy to reserve seats on one of the last flights out of Germany to South America, landing in Lima, Peru.Â The group was initially relieved. ""When we were on the way to the airport, we were all in good spirits, laughing and chatting,"" says Camed Martela, 20.Â But then Carlos received a call to say the flight had been cancelled as the plane was not allowed to land in Peru.Â ""The mood suddenly became sombre - everyone on the bus went quiet,"" he says. From that moment, the 6,000 miles (9,656km) between Germany and Bolivia seemed further than ever. Tracy Prado, who only joined the orchestra in December, remembers thinking about her daughter's 11th birthday which was coming up a few weeks later. ""I had got my hopes up and it was devastating to think I would miss this important day,"" she says.Â The group decided the only way to cope was to put together a strict practice schedule - three hours before lunch, three hours after, experimenting with a fusion of traditional Andean music and more contemporary genres.Â ""Indigenous music is all about the principle of community - everybody can take something from what they are and offer it to the group,"" says Carlos. ""You feel the same as your ancestors felt when playing these traditional instruments, which is a beautiful thing,"" adds Miguel, whose roots stretch back to Bolivia's Kallawaya people known for their musical healing ceremonies. Some members of the orchestra speak to their families in Bolivia. For others, communication is near impossible as internet and telephone signals are patchy outside Bolivia's main cities. Many of the musicians play a major role in providing for their families financially, and being unable to do this at the moment is exacerbating their anxiety. In an interview with Bolivia's flagship station Radio Panamericana, foreign minister Karen Longaric was asked for her response to the orchestra's case after a distraught mother of one of the musicians called in.Â Longaric suggested the orchestra left knowing the borders were set to soon close, although Bolivia had not recorded a single coronavirus case on the day they left. She also said the government's priorities were elsewhere - repatriating ""the most vulnerable - women, children, sick people and the elderly"". Carlos says there seems to be little sympathy for the orchestra back in Bolivia. ""People back home think we're in a fairytale land,"" he says, rolling his eyes. ""I've had hundreds of messages telling me to stop complaining, and that I'm living like a princess in a German castle."" Camed is disappointed they have not been able to perform as planned. ""We'd been preparing since January so I became quite depressed as I watched everything we'd prepared for get taken away like this. ""The orchestra helped me get back on track after the death of my dad. My family were so proud of me when they heard I was flying to Europe to perform my country's music."" The town of just over 8,000 people, also called Rheinsberg, has largely been welcoming towards the Bolivian visitors, if a little bemused by their presence. ""When I leave the hostel alone, I do feel a little self-conscious,"" Camed says. ""Sometimes I get strange looks and people stop and stare."" Some go further than a raised eyebrow, perhaps confused by the fact that the musicians appear to be flouting Germany's social distancing rules, as it may not be immediately obvious that they have been allowed to classify themselves as a family unit. He says on one of the occasions the Bolivians played a game of football on the meadow directly in front of the castle. They soon found themselves surrounded by six police officers ""in full riot gear, just short of a helmet"", says Timo Kreuser, one of three German musicians who helped facilitate the tour and are staying with them. ""They came from from left and right and started to encircle us and things got a little tense,"" recalls Miguel. ""In the end, they just told us that we couldn't congregate in such a large group, but it wasn't too serious."" ""The police are used to it now, so they just phone me and it's always resolved,"" says Timo. Timo has been keen to help the musicians, partly to repay the favour of their own hospitality when he was with them in La Paz in October. Violent protests led to the resignation of the president and Carlos and the orchestra helped Timo evacuate to Peru.Â Generosity and offers of help have been in plentiful supply from most people.Â The kitchen staff at the guest house the musicians are living in come in to work wearing masks and maintain a distance from their Bolivian guests.Â ""We are so grateful for the food and the roofs over our heads,"" says Tracy, who speculates she's one of only a few in the group who enjoy the local delicacies.Â And, of course, they have the woodland to explore. Tracy says she spotted three wolves while out walking recently ""I froze in fear but they were just play fighting and moved on."" It is not just wolves they look out for. One of the palace's former inhabitants was Frederick the Great, who was given ownership of the estate by his father in 1736 before he ascended to the throne, and described his time at Rheinsberg as his ""happiest years"". The musicians are very aware of the palace's previous inhabitants, including Frederick the Great A close friend of Frederick, reflecting on his impressions of Rheinsberg, wrote ""the evenings are dedicated to music. The prince has concerts in his salon, where no-one is admitted unless called"". One of those who performed was reportedly JC Bach.Â ""We all joke that Frederick's ghost is following us and trying to trip us up,"" says Camed. ""I don't usually believe in such things but it does feel as if there are ghosts on the grounds."" As the seasons shifted from early spring to summer, the musicians' heavy clothes packed in anticipation of colder weather were too warm for their long walks around the estate.Â But a concerned Bolivian expat in Hamburg has helped out on this front.Â ""She collected mountains of clothes and sent them to us. We have seven big boxes so far - perhaps too many, we may need to return some or pass them onto someone else in need,"" says Carlos. But despite the generosity and good will, the orchestra worries that its stay cannot be bankrolled forever.Â ""Accommodation costs are mounting to more than â¬35,000 ($38,400) a month alone,"" says Berno Odo Polzer, the director of MaerzMusik, the festival at which the orchestra were set to perform. It is one of several publicly funded arts programmes which has supported the orchestra's longer than expected stay. Germany is allowing international flights again but Bolivia's borders remain shut for the foreseeable future.Â The Bolivian embassy told the BBC it is trying to get the orchestra on a flight to Bolivia in early June out of Madrid. But Carlos is worried about how things will be once they return too. ""Covid is getting very political back home,"" says Carlos. The Bolivian government delayed the presidential election that was due in March and later tried and failed to force through a decree limiting freedom of expression and criticisms over the handling of the coronavirus crisis.Â ""I'm dreaming of the day I will be at my bed in Bolivia and say, 'OK, this is over' but I also know that on that day I will start missing what is happening here,"" admits Carlos.

UK borrowing at record high as virus cost soarsThe government borrowed Â£62bn in April - the highest monthly figure since records began.,"This video can not be played How are we going to pay for the coronavirus crisis? Government borrowing surged to Â£62bn in April, the highest monthly figure on record, after heavy spending to ease the coronavirus crisis. It means the deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - was larger last month than forecast for the whole year at the time of the Budget. The data from the Office for National Statistics,externalrevealed the soaring cost of support, such as furlough schemes. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said things would be worse without government aid. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has predicted that borrowing for the whole year could reach Â£298bn, more than five times the estimate at the time of the March Budget. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, described April's figure as ""pretty much unprecedented"". It said the cost of furlough schemes alone was Â£14bn in April. ""Borrowing now is about six times what it was [in April] last year, so we are talking about some really significant changes in the government finances,"" Mr Athow told the BBC. Coronavirus: How much will it cost the UK? How do government finances work? Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops He added it was impossible to forecast the current year's public finances because of the ""high amounts of uncertainty"". Tax receipts have fallen heavily, as the Treasury has allowed companies to defer some payments. The amount received from VAT in April was negative, with the government collecting less than was handed back in repayments. More than Â£880bn was spent on services such as defence, policing, the NHS, schools and welfare benefits in the last financial year Most of this comes from taxes, which totalled about Â£840bn last year Usually the government spends more money than it has. It borrows money by selling bonds - a promise to repay the money with interest The total debt has increased over time. It is currently Â£1.9 trillion - about Â£28,000 per person in the UK Although the debt in cash terms has gone up, money raised from taxes has risen too, which means the debt can be manageable Meanwhile, borrowing by the state in March 2020 has been revised up by Â£11.7bn to Â£14.7bn, the ONS said. It said this was driven by a reduction in previous estimates of tax receipts and National Insurance contributions. The surge in borrowing comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak stepped up financial support for businesses and employees after vast areas of the economy were forced to halt due to the coronavirus lockdown. After publication of the figures, Mr Sunak said that if the government had not provided financial support, the cost to the economy and people's livelihoods would be much worse. ""Our top priority is to support people, jobs and businesses through this crisis and ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible,"" he said. ""That's why we've taken unprecedented steps to provide lifelines to people and businesses with our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts."" For the past decade, the government had been trying to practise strict financial housekeeping, aiming for position where it could cover day-to-day spending with the money form our taxes and eliminate the deficit. But then the crisis hit - and as the chancellor claims, the schemes put in place have provided a lifeline to tide millions over, to prevent an even bigger economic disaster. It was worth ripping up the rulebook for, he said. However the bills are mounting, just as the amount received from taxpayers slumped. This year's deficit could be the equivalent of the biggest slice of our income since the Second World War - and that hole needs plugging. For the moment, the government has increased its borrowing on financial markets, through bonds, effectively IOUs - but there is a limit to how much it can  do so. Ultimately, economists say taxes will have to rise, or spending cut - the emergency raft will have a price tag which we can't escape. But the chancellor will have to impose those carefully to avoid jeopardising a recovery. And if he opts for tax hikes, he'll risk breaking some election promises. The scale of the economic consequences was underlined on Friday in separate retail sales data from the ONS. These showed thatHigh Street sales crashed last monthas shops closed for the lockdown. It was also announced on Friday that a mortgage payment holiday scheme for homeowners in financial difficulty during the pandemichas been extended for another three months. As a result of the jump in borrowing, total public sector debt rose to Â£1,888bn at the end of April - Â£118.4bn higher than April 2019. Former chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: ""We have to come to terms with the fact that Britain is poorer and the economy is smaller than it would have been."" Asked if the economy would bounce back, he said: ""Bounce is the wrong word, but it will recover."" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, described April's borrowing as ""alarmingly high"", but added that a small easing of the lockdown from 13 May probably meant the government would not have to borrow as much this month. And despite the pressure on public finances, Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation, said there were no signs the government was struggling to raise money on the financial markets. ""Record low interest rates mean the UK's higher debt burden should remain more than manageable,"" he said. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

US condemns Chinaâs Hong Kong security lawSecretary of State Mike Pompeo says the law would be a âdeath knellâ for Hong Kongâs special freedoms.,"Protesters say China's new security law would erode Hong Kong's freedoms US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has condemned China's plan to impose a new security law in Hong Kong, calling it a ""death knell"" for the city's freedoms. China is seeking to pass a law that would ban ""treason, secession, sedition and subversion"" in Hong Kong. Critics say the law would strip Hong Kong of the rights it currently enjoys, that are not seen in mainland China. Mr Pompeo said the decision to bypass Hong Kong's lawmakers ignores ""the will of the people"". ""The United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal, abide by its international obligations, and respect Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions, and civil liberties,"" Mr Pompeo said in a statement on Friday. Mr Pompeo's intervention is likely to infuriate the Chinese government, whose relations with the US have been strained recently by disputes over trade and the coronavirus pandemic. This video can not be played Hong Kongers give their reaction to the controversial national security law in May A joint statement from UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and his Australian and Canadian counterparts also expressed ""deep concern"" at China's proposal. It said: ""Making such a law on Hong Kong's behalf without the direct participation of its people, legislature or judiciary would clearly undermine the principle of 'one country, two systems', under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy."" In Hong Kong, pro-democracy activists have been calling for support from Western governments after China announced the law. On Friday, campaigners urged mass protests over the weekend. The law was submitted at the annual National People's Congress (NPC), which largely rubber-stamps decisions already taken by the Communist leadership, but is still the most important political event of the year. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong so worried? All the context you need on Hong Kong's protests How bad are China's economic woes? Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region and an economic powerhouse, was required to introduce such a law after the handover from British control to Chinese rule in 1997. But its unpopularity means it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after 500,000 people took to the streets. Now, after a wave of sustained and often violent protests in Hong Kong last year, Beijing is attempting to push the law through. The Chinese government argues the law is necessary to ""prevent, stop and punish"" such protests in the future. Hong Kong's government said it would co-operate with Beijing to enact the law, adding it would not affect the city's freedoms. Hong Kong is what is known as a ""special administrative region"" of China. It has observed ""one country, two systems"" since Britain returned sovereignty in 1997, which has allowed it certain freedoms the rest of China does not have. What is the Basic Law and how does it work? How is Hong Kong run? Pro-democracy activists fear that China pushing through the law could mean ""the end of Hong Kong"" - that is, the effective end of its autonomy and these freedoms. This video can not be played Former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten: ""UK should tell China this is outrageous"" In his statement, Mr Pompeo said any decision to impinge on Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms would ""inevitably impact our assessment"" of the territory's status. The US is currently considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges. President Trump has also weighed in, saying the US would react strongly if it went through - without giving details. The ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by the NPC - was explained by Wang Chen, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC. It consists of an introduction and seven articles. Article 4 may prove the most controversial. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes China scraps annual growth target for first time That article says Hong Kong ""must improve"" national security, before adding: ""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law."" That means China could potentially have its own law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, alongside the city's own. A group of pro-democracy activists marched on the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong on Friday Addressing the congress, Premier Li Keqiang said: ""We'll establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the two Special Administrative Regions."" Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment, said the law would help authorities tackle illegal activity in the city. Robin Brant, BBC China Correspondent China has long desired a new national security law for Hong Kong. Beijing believes almost a year of mass protests and, at times, paralysing confrontations on the streets shows that now it is needed more than ever. But critics point to what they say are ambiguities inherent in such a law and the broad, generalist framework it would bring to a place which has a very different legal tradition than the communist-controlled mainland. ""Treason, sedition and subversion"" are all open to a very wide interpretation. Up to now, the worst charge most arrested protesters have faced has been for rioting. The notion of ""terrorism"" also features in this proposed law. That too could encompass wide-ranging acts and activities that the authoritarian rulers on the mainland consider far more menacing than those in Hong Kong, or for that matter elsewhere. China could essentially place the draft law intoAnnex III of the Basic Law,external, which covers national laws that must be implemented in Hong Kong - either by legislation, or decree. The NPC is expected to vote on the draft law at the end of its annual session, on 28 May. It will then be forwarded to the NPC's Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which is expected to finalise and enact the law by the end of June. Last year, Hong Kong was rocked by months of protests sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Mr Wang said the security risks had become ""increasingly notable"" - a reference to last year's protests. ""Considering Hong Kong's situation at present, efforts must be made at the state-level to establish and improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms,"" he is quoted as saying in state media. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Beijing may also fear September's elections to Hong Kong's legislature.

Pakistan passenger plane crashes in Karachi,"This video can not be played The crash happened in the Model Colony residential area A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) passenger plane flying from Lahore has crashed into a residential area of Karachi, killing at least 76 people. The pilots of flight PK8303, an Airbus A320 carrying 91 passengers and eight crew, were attempting to land at the city's Jinnah International Airport. The plane had attempted one landing but as it went round again lost its engines and issued a mayday call. At least two passengers are confirmed to have survived the crash. Air disasters timeline One, Muhammad Zubair, has been describing his ordeal, recalling how he lost consciousness then woke up to smoke and screaming. It has yet to be confirmed but here is what we know so far. Flight PK8303 was approaching Jinnah International Airport at about 14:30 local time (09:30 GMT). It had been given permission to land but the pilots decided to abort and go around for a second attempt. The reason is not yet known, but one civil aviation official told Reuters the plane may have been unable to lower its undercarriage. Images posted on social media appeared to show scorch marks under both engines, with no undercarriage visible on approach. Purported audio of the conversation between air traffic control and a pilot for the second attempt was published by Pakistani media outlets, in which the pilot is heard saying the plane has ""lost engines"". An air traffic controller asks whether it is going to carry out a ""belly landing"", to which the pilot replies ""mayday, mayday, mayday"" - the final communication from the plane. The survivor, Muhammad Zubair, said there were 10-15 minutes between the first attempt at landing and the crash. ""No-one was aware that the plane was about to crash; they were flying the plane in a smooth manner,"" he said. Investigators will try to retrieve the so-called black box recorders to help determine the cause. A committee of investigation has already been set up. PIA said the plane had joined the fleet in 2014 and passed its annual airworthiness inspection last November. The crash came just days after Pakistan began allowing commercial flights to resume after a coronavirus lockdown. Pakistanis across the country are preparing to celebrate the end of Ramadan, with many travelling back to their homes in cities and villages. The plane was only just short of the runway perimeter when it struck houses in the Model Colony residential area. TV footage showed rescue crews combing through debris strewn across the streets of the densely populated zone. A number of cars were set on fire. Passenger Muhammad Zubair, who suffered only minor injuries, said that, when he came to, ""I could hear screams from all directions. Kids and adults. All I could see was fire. I couldn't see any people - just hear their screams"". He added: ""I opened my seatbelt and saw some light - I went towards the light. I had to jump down about 10ft (3m) to get to safety."" Rescuers evacuate an injured resident from the site, where a number of houses were destroyed Eyewitness Mohammed Uzair Khan told the BBC he had heard a massive sound and went outside his home. ""Almost four houses were completely collapsed, there was so much fire and smoke,"" he said. ""They are almost my neighbours, I can't tell you what a horrible thing it was."" Local health officials at two hospitals, the Jinnah and Civic hospitals, gave death tolls to the BBC and Pakistani media, adding up to 76 confirmed deaths. But it was not clear how many of the dead were passengers and how many residents on the ground. Zafar Masud, president of the Bank of Punjab, was the other passenger who survived the crash, a provincial government spokesman said. Both were at the front of the plane. There are reports of other survivors but these have not been confirmed. A senior journalist at TV channel 24 News, Ansar Naqvi, and an ex-head of the Punjab Disaster Management Authority, Khalid Sherdil, were also listed on the passenger manifest. The crash site was just short of the airport perimeter Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the crash,external, promising an immediate investigation. Pakistan has a chequered aviation safety record, including a number of airliner crashes. In 2010, an aircraft operated by private airline Airblue crashed near Islamabad, killing all 152 people on board - the deadliest air disaster in Pakistani history. In 2012, a Boeing 737-200 operated by Pakistan's Bhoja Air crashed in bad weather on its approach to land in Rawalpindi, killing all 121 passengers and six crew. And in 2016, a Pakistan International Airlines plane burst into flames while travelling from northern Pakistan to Islamabad, killing 47 people. Are you in Karachi? Did you witness the crash?

One of Belgium's old water mills has been working flat out to meet the needs of the new wannabe bakers. Miller Adrienne Delacroix, whose mill in the Ardennes region has been producing flour for six centuries, said: ""We've witnessed an explosion in demand from individuals"". Ms Delacroix believes the love of baking will continue after the pandemic is over. ""I think the crisis has also brought home
the importance of eating local produce.""  BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast has been speaking to Amanda, who was sleeping rough in Manchester city centre before the coronavirus pandemic. During the lockdown, thousands of homeless people have been helped into homes and shelters, and Amanda was given a room in a Holiday Inn. She said on the first night âI think I slept for two daysâ. Amanda said the security of having a room is something thatâs made a huge difference to a lot of people. This video can not be played Amanda got a room in the lockdown, after sleeping rough Some parks in Paris have reopened but many others are closed A mysterious lock-picker has been unlocking parks in Paris for local residents to use during lockdown. Many parks are currently closed in the French capital and, amid good weather and the easing of other restrictions, the government has resisted calls from the mayor to open them. Instead, a man, who has revealed himself as ""Jose"" to a local newspaper, has been unlocking the parks in poorer areas of the city at night. Two handwritten posters hanging from the railings of the Parc de Belleville on Friday read ""Thank you, Jose!"". The closure of parks has been an increasingly controversial topic in France with police forced to clear open lawns in central Paris of twice in recent days. Cyprus is to reopen its airports to commercial flights from 9 June. The reopening will start by allowing flights from 20 countries, the country's transport minister announced. People arriving from those countries will be required to produce evidence of a negative coronavirus test from within the previous 72 hours. The UK and Russia are not part of the first group, due to the government believing Covid-19 has not been sufficiently contained in the two countries, which are the biggest markets for Cyprus tourism. The Endeavour launched in 2011 from Florida's Cape Canaveral SpaceX and Nasa are urging spectators to stay away from next Wednesday's rocket launch on Florida's Space Coast. But officials in Brevard County, home of the Kennedy Space Center, hope the event will help boost tourism to the state, where visitor revenue is down sharply during the pandemic. In a news conference with reporters earlier this month, Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine noted that previous launches had brought hundreds of thousands of sightseers to Florida beaches. But Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey has actively encouraged visitors, as long as they practise social distancing. ""We are not going to keep the great Americans that want to come watch that from coming here,"" Ivey said. ""If Nasa is telling people to not come here and watch the launch, that's on them. I'm telling people what I believe as an American. And so Nasa has got their guidelines, and I got mine."" The 27 May launch of a SpaceX rocket with two astronauts aboard will be the first launch of astronauts from US soil since the end of the US space shuttle program in 2011. Dominic Cummings, a top adviser to PM Boris Johnson, travelled hundreds of miles from London to County Durham during the lockdown when he had virus symptoms, the BBC has been told. A source close to the PM's chief aide confirmed reports he and his wife went to his parents' home to self-isolate. But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told Mr Cummings did not break government guidance because he and his wife stayed in a separate building. Labour said No 10 needed to provide a ""very swift explanation"" for Mr Cummings' actions. ""If accurate, the prime minister's chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules. The government's guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel,"" a spokesman said. ""The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings."" See here for more. The US state of Washington lost ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars to benefits scammers, officials there have acknowledged, as the number of workers laid off due to coronavirus continues to rise. The loss was disclosed by the state's Employment Security Department on Thursday. Last week, the US Secret Service warned that states were being targeted by a âwell-organised Nigerian fraud ring exploiting the COVID-19 crisis to commit large-scale fraud against state unemployment insurance programsâ adding up to âpotential losses in the hundreds of millions of dollarsâ. The agency added that there was also evidence of attacks in North Carolina, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Florida, the Seattle Times reports. The news came on the same day that the federal government reported another 2.4m American workers filed for jobless benefits last week. In total, 38.6m unememployment claims have been filed in the past nine weeks. Reality Check Thereâs been interest in whether alcohol-based hand cleaners can
overheat and catch fire inside cars after a warning from a local fire service
in the US. TheFacebook post,externalappeared to suggest that a
bottle of hand sanitiser left inside a car led to a fire which burnt
the car door. But should we be worried about leaving hand sanitiser bottles in
our cars during hot weather? Alcohol-based products are flammable and there isguidance from the WHO,externalwhich advises them to be
stored safely - but it is very unlikely they would catch fire from hot weather
alone. There have been various reports of alcohol-based cleaning products
catching fire in different circumstances, but usually because theyâve been
spilled onto something or have been left too close to an open flame. Professor of Chemistry at Nottingham University, Steven Howdle
says: âUnless you have a lighted match or another ignition source in the car,
it is very unlikely there is going to be any problem with fire."" It's been one of the key questions behind the debate about reopening schools. This video looks at whether children can catch coronavirus - and whether they can spread it as well. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Can children catch and pass on coronavirus? Ikea will reopen 19 stores across England and Northern Ireland from 1 June, with new safety measures to ensure social distancing, the Swedish retailer says. The homewares chain said social distancing wardens will patrol the stores and the number of customers will be limited. Stores in Scotland, Wales and Ireland will remain closed, in line with government coronavirus guidance. Restaurants and play areas will remain closed, but the food market will reopen for customers to make food like Swedish meatballs at home. Ikea stores have reopened in several European countries including Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. Dan Smith from the band Bastille has told the BBC that he thinks the music industry needs to ""rethink"" how much artists are paid by online streaming sites. âThe money is there, itâs about how itâs distributed"" said the singer. ""I hope that across the music industry, and so many other things â looking at the NHS, and nurses and wages â I hope thereâs a real rethinking across the board of how people are remunerated and whatâs important.â Speaking to The Coronavirus Newscast, Smith said that although things were âuncertainâ now he hoped the industry would be more ""thoughtfulâ after the pandemic. Spotify said in a statement to the BBC that ""the vast majority of revenue generated is paid out to rights holders, including labels, publishing companies, and distributors"". Dan also talked about how the pandemic is having a tougher impact on smaller artists. âLike Spotify pointed out [in their statement to the BBC], the money is there, but I think the most important thing is not these huge artists who get to play arenas and get to play stadiums and headline festivalsâ¦ but it's smaller artists who I think are really, really suffering here and looking ahead of them and just totally questioning how they're going to pay rent and feed themselves.â People in England are being urged to stay away from tourism hotspots over the bank holiday weekend, with warm weather again forecast. Pictures of large numbers visiting beaches in Brighton and Southend in recent days have raised fears over social distancing, with no limit in place on how far people can travel. Visitors to Brighton will find stewards stationed around the beach to encourage physical distancing and direct people to less busy parts of the seafront if it becomes too busy. Councillor Carmen Appich, from Brighton & Hove City Council, said it would be an ""insult to the NHS staff and frontline workers"" to promote the city as a destination to visit. Hastings Borough Council says the area is ""closed to visitors from outside the town"" and on the Isle of Wight the council's ""clear advice"" is to stay away. People are also being advised not to visit Blackpool and have been asked to think twice before visiting the Peak District or Morecambe Bay. In Cornwall, council leaders have warned there is no lifeguard cover,  and a large coastal swell and spring tide will bring hazardous sea conditions over the weekend. The National Trust is urging people across England to stay close to home and explore local green spaces and countryside this weekend. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Home Secretary Priti Patel said people can enjoy the outdoors as long as they follow social distancing advice. The president of the Canadian Medical Association, which represents
physicians across the country, has called Canada's health-care system
""sick"" and is warning that a second wave of coronavirus could strike. Dr Sandy Buchman criticised the lack of personal protection equipment,
contact tracing and testing, and warned government officials they were
""gambling by reopening"". Dr Buchman was speaking before a Senate committee on Wednesday. ""We'd never permit a firefighter to go into a burning building without
adequate protection. We can't expect our frontline health care workers to put
themselves in harm's way,"" he said. Canadian labs have the capacity to process 60,000 tests a day, say public health
officials. But between 17 and 18 May, only about 23,000 tests were conducted. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged to get PPE to the front lines, and
ramp up contract tracing. His warning is a sharp rebuke for a country that prides itself on its public
health-care system. White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx was asked during a briefing about a large study of hydroxychloroquine, which found an increased risk of death for those taking it as a Covid-19 treatment. The Lancet study of 96,000 coronavirus patients found treatment with hydroxychloroquine - an anti-malaria drug - was also more likely to cause heart arrhythmia in patients. Dr Birx said the study revealed more about underlying health conditions, and said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ""has been very clear"" about their concerns in using the drug as a coronavirus prevention (as President Trump has said he is doing) or as a treatment course. Time to catch up on the latest developments: Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News A study of Covid-19 patients in hospitals has found no benefits to treating them with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. In fact, the patients given the drug were more likely to die in hospital and develop heart rhythm complications than other Covid patients in a comparison group. Nearly 15,000 patients took the drug (or a related form chloroquine) either alone or with an antibiotic, in The Lancet study. The researchers warn that the drug - which is safe for treating malaria and diseases such as lupus and arthritis - should not be used outside of clinical trials. But US President Donald Trump has been taking it, despite warnings it might be unsafe. In a bid to find out more, a trial to see whether the anti-malarial drug could prevent Covid-19 is under way. More than 40,000 healthcare workers from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America who are in contact with patients with the disease will be given the drugs to see if they work. Opening day at the Minnesota State Fair The Minnesota State Fair - one of the largest state fairs in the US with over 2m annual visitors - will close for the first time since 1946. Back then it was cancelled due to a polio outbreak. ""This isnât a difficult decision. Itâs the only decision,"" Minnesota State Fair General Manager Jerry Hammer said. ""Itâs the right thing to do."" According to the fair website, it has been cancelled only six times in total since its founding in 1859. ""By taking the tough road today, we guarantee that the fairâs future remains hopeful and bright,"" Hammer said. ""We want to see you all for many years to come, when we can celebrate in true State Fair style."" Coronavirus has been blamed for the collapse into administration of travel company Specialist Leisure Group. About 2,500 jobs have been lost, and 64,000 bookings cancelled, as a result. The company, based in Wigan, Greater Manchester, specialised in breaks and events for the over 50s. The group included well-known coach holiday brands Shearings and National Holidays. The firm said on its website that all tours, cruises, holidays and hotel breaks had been cancelled and would not be rescheduled, and blamed the impact of coronavirus. Travel trade organisation Abta said the hotel and travel company had been ""significantly impacted"" by the pandemic.  Â© 2025 BBC.

One of Belgium's old water mills has been working flat out to meet the needs of the new wannabe bakers. Miller Adrienne Delacroix, whose mill in the Ardennes region has been producing flour for six centuries, said: ""We've witnessed an explosion in demand from individuals"". Ms Delacroix believes the love of baking will continue after the pandemic is over. ""I think the crisis has also brought home
the importance of eating local produce.""  BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast has been speaking to Amanda, who was sleeping rough in Manchester city centre before the coronavirus pandemic. During the lockdown, thousands of homeless people have been helped into homes and shelters, and Amanda was given a room in a Holiday Inn. She said on the first night âI think I slept for two daysâ. Amanda said the security of having a room is something thatâs made a huge difference to a lot of people. This video can not be played Amanda got a room in the lockdown, after sleeping rough Some parks in Paris have reopened but many others are closed A mysterious lock-picker has been unlocking parks in Paris for local residents to use during lockdown. Many parks are currently closed in the French capital and, amid good weather and the easing of other restrictions, the government has resisted calls from the mayor to open them. Instead, a man, who has revealed himself as ""Jose"" to a local newspaper, has been unlocking the parks in poorer areas of the city at night. Two handwritten posters hanging from the railings of the Parc de Belleville on Friday read ""Thank you, Jose!"". The closure of parks has been an increasingly controversial topic in France with police forced to clear open lawns in central Paris of twice in recent days. Cyprus is to reopen its airports to commercial flights from 9 June. The reopening will start by allowing flights from 20 countries, the country's transport minister announced. People arriving from those countries will be required to produce evidence of a negative coronavirus test from within the previous 72 hours. The UK and Russia are not part of the first group, due to the government believing Covid-19 has not been sufficiently contained in the two countries, which are the biggest markets for Cyprus tourism. The Endeavour launched in 2011 from Florida's Cape Canaveral SpaceX and Nasa are urging spectators to stay away from next Wednesday's rocket launch on Florida's Space Coast. But officials in Brevard County, home of the Kennedy Space Center, hope the event will help boost tourism to the state, where visitor revenue is down sharply during the pandemic. In a news conference with reporters earlier this month, Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine noted that previous launches had brought hundreds of thousands of sightseers to Florida beaches. But Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey has actively encouraged visitors, as long as they practise social distancing. ""We are not going to keep the great Americans that want to come watch that from coming here,"" Ivey said. ""If Nasa is telling people to not come here and watch the launch, that's on them. I'm telling people what I believe as an American. And so Nasa has got their guidelines, and I got mine."" The 27 May launch of a SpaceX rocket with two astronauts aboard will be the first launch of astronauts from US soil since the end of the US space shuttle program in 2011. Dominic Cummings, a top adviser to PM Boris Johnson, travelled hundreds of miles from London to County Durham during the lockdown when he had virus symptoms, the BBC has been told. A source close to the PM's chief aide confirmed reports he and his wife went to his parents' home to self-isolate. But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told Mr Cummings did not break government guidance because he and his wife stayed in a separate building. Labour said No 10 needed to provide a ""very swift explanation"" for Mr Cummings' actions. ""If accurate, the prime minister's chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules. The government's guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel,"" a spokesman said. ""The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings."" See here for more. The US state of Washington lost ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars to benefits scammers, officials there have acknowledged, as the number of workers laid off due to coronavirus continues to rise. The loss was disclosed by the state's Employment Security Department on Thursday. Last week, the US Secret Service warned that states were being targeted by a âwell-organised Nigerian fraud ring exploiting the COVID-19 crisis to commit large-scale fraud against state unemployment insurance programsâ adding up to âpotential losses in the hundreds of millions of dollarsâ. The agency added that there was also evidence of attacks in North Carolina, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Florida, the Seattle Times reports. The news came on the same day that the federal government reported another 2.4m American workers filed for jobless benefits last week. In total, 38.6m unememployment claims have been filed in the past nine weeks. Reality Check Thereâs been interest in whether alcohol-based hand cleaners can
overheat and catch fire inside cars after a warning from a local fire service
in the US. TheFacebook post,externalappeared to suggest that a
bottle of hand sanitiser left inside a car led to a fire which burnt
the car door. But should we be worried about leaving hand sanitiser bottles in
our cars during hot weather? Alcohol-based products are flammable and there isguidance from the WHO,externalwhich advises them to be
stored safely - but it is very unlikely they would catch fire from hot weather
alone. There have been various reports of alcohol-based cleaning products
catching fire in different circumstances, but usually because theyâve been
spilled onto something or have been left too close to an open flame. Professor of Chemistry at Nottingham University, Steven Howdle
says: âUnless you have a lighted match or another ignition source in the car,
it is very unlikely there is going to be any problem with fire."" It's been one of the key questions behind the debate about reopening schools. This video looks at whether children can catch coronavirus - and whether they can spread it as well. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Can children catch and pass on coronavirus? Ikea will reopen 19 stores across England and Northern Ireland from 1 June, with new safety measures to ensure social distancing, the Swedish retailer says. The homewares chain said social distancing wardens will patrol the stores and the number of customers will be limited. Stores in Scotland, Wales and Ireland will remain closed, in line with government coronavirus guidance. Restaurants and play areas will remain closed, but the food market will reopen for customers to make food like Swedish meatballs at home. Ikea stores have reopened in several European countries including Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. Dan Smith from the band Bastille has told the BBC that he thinks the music industry needs to ""rethink"" how much artists are paid by online streaming sites. âThe money is there, itâs about how itâs distributed"" said the singer. ""I hope that across the music industry, and so many other things â looking at the NHS, and nurses and wages â I hope thereâs a real rethinking across the board of how people are remunerated and whatâs important.â Speaking to The Coronavirus Newscast, Smith said that although things were âuncertainâ now he hoped the industry would be more ""thoughtfulâ after the pandemic. Spotify said in a statement to the BBC that ""the vast majority of revenue generated is paid out to rights holders, including labels, publishing companies, and distributors"". Dan also talked about how the pandemic is having a tougher impact on smaller artists. âLike Spotify pointed out [in their statement to the BBC], the money is there, but I think the most important thing is not these huge artists who get to play arenas and get to play stadiums and headline festivalsâ¦ but it's smaller artists who I think are really, really suffering here and looking ahead of them and just totally questioning how they're going to pay rent and feed themselves.â People in England are being urged to stay away from tourism hotspots over the bank holiday weekend, with warm weather again forecast. Pictures of large numbers visiting beaches in Brighton and Southend in recent days have raised fears over social distancing, with no limit in place on how far people can travel. Visitors to Brighton will find stewards stationed around the beach to encourage physical distancing and direct people to less busy parts of the seafront if it becomes too busy. Councillor Carmen Appich, from Brighton & Hove City Council, said it would be an ""insult to the NHS staff and frontline workers"" to promote the city as a destination to visit. Hastings Borough Council says the area is ""closed to visitors from outside the town"" and on the Isle of Wight the council's ""clear advice"" is to stay away. People are also being advised not to visit Blackpool and have been asked to think twice before visiting the Peak District or Morecambe Bay. In Cornwall, council leaders have warned there is no lifeguard cover,  and a large coastal swell and spring tide will bring hazardous sea conditions over the weekend. The National Trust is urging people across England to stay close to home and explore local green spaces and countryside this weekend. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Home Secretary Priti Patel said people can enjoy the outdoors as long as they follow social distancing advice. The president of the Canadian Medical Association, which represents
physicians across the country, has called Canada's health-care system
""sick"" and is warning that a second wave of coronavirus could strike. Dr Sandy Buchman criticised the lack of personal protection equipment,
contact tracing and testing, and warned government officials they were
""gambling by reopening"". Dr Buchman was speaking before a Senate committee on Wednesday. ""We'd never permit a firefighter to go into a burning building without
adequate protection. We can't expect our frontline health care workers to put
themselves in harm's way,"" he said. Canadian labs have the capacity to process 60,000 tests a day, say public health
officials. But between 17 and 18 May, only about 23,000 tests were conducted. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged to get PPE to the front lines, and
ramp up contract tracing. His warning is a sharp rebuke for a country that prides itself on its public
health-care system. White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx was asked during a briefing about a large study of hydroxychloroquine, which found an increased risk of death for those taking it as a Covid-19 treatment. The Lancet study of 96,000 coronavirus patients found treatment with hydroxychloroquine - an anti-malaria drug - was also more likely to cause heart arrhythmia in patients. Dr Birx said the study revealed more about underlying health conditions, and said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ""has been very clear"" about their concerns in using the drug as a coronavirus prevention (as President Trump has said he is doing) or as a treatment course. Time to catch up on the latest developments: Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News A study of Covid-19 patients in hospitals has found no benefits to treating them with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. In fact, the patients given the drug were more likely to die in hospital and develop heart rhythm complications than other Covid patients in a comparison group. Nearly 15,000 patients took the drug (or a related form chloroquine) either alone or with an antibiotic, in The Lancet study. The researchers warn that the drug - which is safe for treating malaria and diseases such as lupus and arthritis - should not be used outside of clinical trials. But US President Donald Trump has been taking it, despite warnings it might be unsafe. In a bid to find out more, a trial to see whether the anti-malarial drug could prevent Covid-19 is under way. More than 40,000 healthcare workers from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America who are in contact with patients with the disease will be given the drugs to see if they work. Opening day at the Minnesota State Fair The Minnesota State Fair - one of the largest state fairs in the US with over 2m annual visitors - will close for the first time since 1946. Back then it was cancelled due to a polio outbreak. ""This isnât a difficult decision. Itâs the only decision,"" Minnesota State Fair General Manager Jerry Hammer said. ""Itâs the right thing to do."" According to the fair website, it has been cancelled only six times in total since its founding in 1859. ""By taking the tough road today, we guarantee that the fairâs future remains hopeful and bright,"" Hammer said. ""We want to see you all for many years to come, when we can celebrate in true State Fair style."" Coronavirus has been blamed for the collapse into administration of travel company Specialist Leisure Group. About 2,500 jobs have been lost, and 64,000 bookings cancelled, as a result. The company, based in Wigan, Greater Manchester, specialised in breaks and events for the over 50s. The group included well-known coach holiday brands Shearings and National Holidays. The firm said on its website that all tours, cruises, holidays and hotel breaks had been cancelled and would not be rescheduled, and blamed the impact of coronavirus. Travel trade organisation Abta said the hotel and travel company had been ""significantly impacted"" by the pandemic.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Councils throw 1 June schools plan into doubt,"Scores of councils in England say they cannot guarantee primaries will reopen on 1 June, throwing government plans to get pupils back to school into chaos. Only 20 of 99 councils to respond to a BBC Breakfast survey said they were advising schools to open more widely on Boris Johnson's target date. Of the 99 who responded, two thirds (68), could not guarantee schools would reopen to Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. It comes as the government prepares to publish scientific advice on its plan. Ministers have been insisting that they would only be calling on schools in England to reopen in June if the scientific advice said it was safe to do so. Teaching unions, heads and politicians have been calling for that advice to be made public. BBC Breakfast carried out a snap-shot survey of the 150  local authorities that oversee primary schools over the past 48 hours. It also showed: 14 local authorities, mainly in the north-west of England, said they would not be advising schools to open their doors to more pupils 11 said they were still considering the issue 54 leaving the decision up to individual schools The local authorities which have said they will not open on 1 June include: Blackburn, Bury, Calderdale, Cheshire East, Cheshire West, East Riding, Knowsley, Newcastle City, Rochdale, Stockport, Trafford and Wirral. It is the head teachers and the governing bodies on the ground who need to make arrangements for social distancing or keeping children within small groups to limit the potential spread of infection. Is your local authority reopening schools? Nurseries are also due to open on June 1. Schools across England have been open to small numbers of vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers since they formally closed at the end of March. But the prime minister announced plans for a phased reopening of primaries from 1 June, when he set out the government's plans to move gradually out of lockdown measures on 10 May. Almost immediately, teaching unions and head teachers warned of safety concerns and practicalities in many schools which, they argued, made safety measures unfeasible. And, with scientific evidence on the way the virus is spread by children limited, there are concerns the wider opening of schools could lead to a second spike in Covid-19. Teaching unions also called for a more regional approach, with local authorities being given the final call. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson made a plea for the sector to let children get back to school, and a string of ministers lined up to try to persuade parents, many of whom are concerned about a return, that schools would  be safe. But, as opposition continued to grow, there has been a softening of the government's approach. On Wednesday, Justice Minister Robert Buckland, said the government was prepared to listen to the concerns of head teachers and council leaders, and hinted it might step back from the 1 June date. He also acknowledged schools would not reopen in a uniform way across England after half term. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We want children back in schools as soon as possible because being with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their well-being."" He added that plans for a cautious, phased return of some children was based on the best scientific and medical advice and insisted the department had been engaging closely with a range of organisations including the teaching unions. But Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said support for a fixed date for school return was vanishing quickly. ""What is needed now is local flexibility to determine when it is right for schools to open up to more pupils."" Councillor Judith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, backed calls for decisions to be made locally. ""As there are different Covid-19 infection rates around the country, schools and councils must be able to work together to decide how and when schools open to more children,"" said Ms Blake. Councils also needed crucial testing data to be shared with them to boost confidence about reopening schools among teachers and parents, along with powers to manage outbreaks in schools, care homes and the community, she argued. Meanwhile Unison, which represents many school support staff, said members had little confidence in government reassurances that English schools will be safe to open to more pupils from 1 June. An overwhelming 96% of 42,000 teaching assistants, cleaners, technicians and office staff surveyed by the union, said they felt ministers had not put safety first in their reopening plans. On Thursday the governments ofScotlandandNorthern Irelandannounced plans for a phased return to school for pupils, starting in August.  Wales has not yet set a date.

China moves to impose security law on Hong Kong,"A number of pro-democracy lawmakers were dragged out of Hong Kong's legislative chamber during a row about a Chinese national anthem bill China's ruling Communist Party has set in motion a controversial national security law for Hong Kong, a move seen as a major blow to the city's freedoms. The law to ban ""secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism"" could bypass Hong Kong's lawmakers. Critics say Beijing is breaking its promise to allow Hong Kong freedoms not seen elsewhere in China. Pro-democracy activists have called for mass protests against what they see erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy. Anger was already apparent on Friday, as a group of protesters descended on China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. The draft law was submitted at the annual National People's Congress (NPC), which largely rubber-stamps decisions already taken by the Communist leadership, but is still the most important political event of the year. Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region and an economic powerhouse, was required to introduce security legislation after the handover from British control to Chinese rule in 1997. After last year's wave of sustained and violent protest, Beijing is now attempting to push them through, arguing ""law-based and forceful measures"" must be taken to ""prevent, stop and punish"" such protests in the future. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? How bad are China's economic woes? China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes China scraps annual growth target for first time On Friday, Hong Kong's government said it would co-operate with Beijing to enact the law, adding it would not affect the city's freedoms. The law has rattled financial markets, causing Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) to drop by more than 5% on Friday. The ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by the NPC - was explained by Wang Chen, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC. It consists of an introduction and seven articles. Article 4 may prove the most controversial. How is Hong Kong run? Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions That article says Hong Kong ""must improve"" national security, before adding: ""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law."" A group of pro-democracy activists marched on the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong on Friday Addressing the congress, Premier Li Keqiang said: ""We'll establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the two Special Administrative Regions."" Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment, said the law would help authorities tackle illegal activity in the city. Robin Brant, BBC China Correspondent China has long desired a new national security law for Hong Kong. Beijing believes almost a year of mass protests and, at times, paralysing confrontations on the streets shows that now it is needed more than ever. But critics point to what they say are ambiguities inherent in such a law and the broad, generalist framework it would bring to a place which has a very different legal tradition than the communist-controlled mainland. ""Secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism"" are open to some interpretation. Up to now, the worst charge most arrested protesters have faced has been for rioting. The notion of ""terrorism"" also features in this proposed law. That too could encompass wide-ranging acts and activities that the authoritarian rulers on the mainland consider far more menacing than those in Hong Kong, or for that matter elsewhere. China could essentially place the draft law intoAnnex III of the Basic Law,external, which covers national laws that must be implemented in Hong Kong - either by legislation, or decree. The NPC is expected to vote on the draft law at the end of its annual session, on 28 May. It will then be forwarded to the NPC's Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which is expected to finalise and enact the law by the end of June. Hong Kong is what is known as a ""special administrative region"" of China. It has observed a ""one country, two systems"" policy since Britain returned sovereignty in 1997, which has allowed it certain freedoms the rest of China does not have. Pro-democracy activists fear that China pushing through the law could mean ""the end of Hong Kong"" - that is, the effective end of its autonomy and these freedoms. ""This is the largest nuclear weapon the Chinese Communist Party has used in its mutual destruction of Hong Kong,"" Jimmy Sham, a pro-democracy activist who played a leading role in last year's protests. Last year's mass protests in Hong Kong were sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. This video can not be played Former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten: ""UK should tell China this is outrageous"" The bill was paused, then withdrawn - but the protests continued until the coronavirus outbreak at the end of the year. The US has also weighed in, with President Trump saying the US would react strongly if it went through - without giving details. It is currently considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was ""following reports and monitoring the situation closely"". ""We expect China to respect Hong Kong's rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy. As a party to the [Sino-British] Joint Declaration, the UK is committed to upholding Hong Kong's autonomy and respecting the 'One Country, Two Systems' model,"" a statement said. Mr Wang said the security risks had become ""increasingly notable"" - a reference to last year's protests. ""Considering Hong Kong's situation at present, efforts must be made at the state-level to establish and improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms,"" he is quoted as saying in state media. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Beijing may also fear September's elections to Hong Kong's legislature. If last year's success for pro-democracy parties in district elections is repeated, government bills could potentially be blocked. In a separate development, a number of pro-democracy lawmakers were dragged out of Hong Kong's legislative chamber during a row about a Chinese national anthem bill on Friday. Hong Kong was under British control for more than 150 years up to 1997. The British and Chinese governments signed a treaty - the Sino-British Joint Declaration - that agreed Hong Kong would have ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"", for 50 years. Those freedoms, contained in the Basic Law, are only enshrined until 2047 and it is not clear what will happen then. What is the Basic Law and how does it work? Why are there protests in Hong Kong?

Tesco expands priority list for disabled shoppers,"Hundreds of disabled people can now be added to Tesco's priority shopping list after legal action was taken by a disabled mother unable to buy food. Joanne Baskett, 48, who cannot leave her house, says she was discriminated against because she could not secure an online shopping slot. A further 318 people sent claims to all of the UK's major supermarkets for breaching the Equality Act 2010. Tesco has now agreed to add all those people to its priority list. The individuals were not named on the Government's Extremely Clinically Vulnerable list, but nevertheless felt their access requirements should be taken into consideration by supermarkets. Ms Baskett from Swindon, who has multiple organ paralysis, says she was unable to secure an online shopping slot after returning home from hospital at the end of March. She said: ""For six weeks I would stay awake until midnight to try and get a slot but I couldn't. It has had a huge mental and physical effect on me."" She took legal action and accused the supermarket of breaching the Equality Act 2010 for not making reasonable adjustments to enable her, as a disabled person, to shop. Chris Fry, from Fry Law, who handled the case, said:  ""We have been hearing so many heart-breaking stories about people unable to leave the house and having to rely on the charity of friends and families and even foodbanks. ""This is just the first step but it's going to improve many people's lives."" The other claimants include people with sight loss, mobility issues, agoraphobia and some who have to shield due to multiple health conditions. In a statement, Tesco urged customers facing similar issues to contact them directly.

Lesley Manville: 'Most actors are not loaded',"Manville, pictured here in World on Fire, was Oscar-nominated for Phantom Thread Lesley Manville has said she ""feels for young actors"" during the coronavirus crisis, most of whom she says are not as well-off as some people may assume. The Mum star, who was nominated for an Oscar in 2018 for her role in Phantom Thread, is among a host of big names to have delivered a new monologue online for theEquity Benevolent Fund.,external The union is offering support to actors in need of help during the pandemic. Sirs Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi also uploaded solo performances from home. ""I really feel for young actors at the moment, who are just getting going,"" Manville told BBC News. ""They're now stuck in this real kind of critical situation that we can't see at the moment quite how we are going to get out of."" Shakespeare's Globe is 'critically vulnerable' Theatres 'clinging on' but face precarious future ""You know, will theatres survive even? And when are we ever going to be in front of a camera again?"" she continued. ""It's just very scary. They've devoted their time to studying and becoming actors, and then suddenly they can't do what they're trained to do."" Manville believes there is ""an illusion"", or general perception that ""if you're an actor, you must be loaded"". ""I'm not denying that there are some very well-paid actors around without question, who are not going to be knocking on the door of the Equity Benevolent Fund at all,"" she went on. ""But that is not the case of the majority. This is about them just needing support at a time when hopefully we're going to get through and there will be an industry when we come out the other side."" Michelle Collins is also involved in the For the Love of Arts initiative The star was asked to take part in the collaborative new project, called For the Love of Arts, by Michelle Collins, whom she acted alongside in Real Women. It arrives during a period of great uncertainty for British theatres and cinemas, which remain closed and are grappling with how to reopen and, in some cases survive. Manville said she was working on the National Theatre's production of The Visit by Friedrich Durrenmatt when the virus ""pulled the rug [from] under our feet"". The 64-year-old believes that out-of-work actors of all ages are at risk of falling through the gaps of the benefits system and government furlough schemes due to the unsteady nature of their profession. Collins, who had been rehearsing for a tour of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party before the lockdown, told PA this week that young people were at risk because Downing Street officials were ""ignoring"" the crisis facing her industry. Alan Ayckbourn: Streaming 'just isn't theatre' National Theatre to pay actors for streamed plays In response, a DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC: ""The government has announced unprecedented support for the cultural and creative sectors, including the Self Employed Support Scheme, the job retention scheme, a years' business rates holiday, and the Arts Council's Â£160 million emergency response package. ""We're working closely with the industry to plan for the future and support its recovery. [On Wednesday] we announced the appointment of Neil Mendoza as commissioner for cultural recovery and renewal and the creation of the Entertainment and Events Working Group as part of our commitment to getting our cultural and creative sectors back up and running again.""

Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops,"This video can not be played Theo Paphitis: 'Retail will never, ever be the same again' British retail sales plummeted by a record amount in April as many stores closed amid the coronavirus outbreak. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalsaid that the amount of goods sold fell by 18.1% last month. Clothing sales also halved as many High Street shops were shut under the lockdown measures introduced by the government in March. Online shopping as a proportion of all retail reached a record high of 30.7%, the ONS said. All types of shop, other than those selling clothing or household goods, saw record amounts being spent with them online. But the pick-up in online shopping failed to offset the collapse in spending on the High Street. ""The effects of Covid-19 have contributed to a record monthly fall in retail sales of nearly a fifth,"" ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said. He added that ""online shopping has again surged as people purchased goods from their homes"" amid lockdown. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said that the shift to online had benefitted ""those retailers with the slickest e-commerce operations and who managed to cope with the shift in demand. ""Online grocery retailers were one of the major beneficiaries as they worked at an incredible pace to boost capacity."" In April, the proportion of online spending on food increased from 5.7% to 9.3%, according to the ONS. Elsewhere, off-licence sales also continued to increase, seeing a slight uptick after a 23.9% jump in March. Mr Lim added that that the impact of lockdown had ""paralysed"" the industry. ""Clothing retailers were the hardest hit as the absence of social interaction, whether that's going to work, seeing friends or heading off on holiday, decimated demand for new outfits,"" he said. The fall in non-food sales in April resulted in the lowest levels of clothing and shoe sales seen since the ONS starting collecting the data. Separate figures from retail research firm Springboardshow that the number of shoppers visiting UK High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres fell by 80% in April amid the lockdown. That was almost double the level of March's downturn when there was a 41.3% drop in visits to shopping locations. Several fashion firms have been struggling as customers stay at home. Clothing giant Primark, for example,said last month it had gone from making Â£650m in sales a month to nothing after the coronavirus outbreak forced it to close its stores in Europe and the US. Despite the gloomy news, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Retail sales should recover some of April's lost ground in May."" He said that was despite the fact that lockdown measures on store closures in England have not changed significantly since they were introduced. Toy and vegetable costs rise as fuel price drops High Streets see 'fastest ever' footfall drop This point was echoed by Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC: ""However bad April's figures are, we believe that retail has reached a turning point in the Covid-19 crisis. ""In the short term, May has already seen a loosening of lockdown restrictions across all the home nations."" Since the start of lockdown, garden centres have been allowed to open again in England. Other retailers classified as essential, such as DIY stores Homebase and B&Q, re-opened some sites around the end of April.

"Pakistan passenger plane crashes in KarachiA PIA jet crashes in a residential area on a flight from Lahore, with more than 100 on board.Asia","This video can not be played The crash happened in the Model Colony residential area A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) passenger plane flying from Lahore has crashed into a residential area of Karachi, killing at least 76 people. The pilots of flight PK8303, an Airbus A320 carrying 91 passengers and eight crew, were attempting to land at the city's Jinnah International Airport. The plane had attempted one landing but as it went round again lost its engines and issued a mayday call. At least two passengers are confirmed to have survived the crash. Air disasters timeline One, Muhammad Zubair, has been describing his ordeal, recalling how he lost consciousness then woke up to smoke and screaming. It has yet to be confirmed but here is what we know so far. Flight PK8303 was approaching Jinnah International Airport at about 14:30 local time (09:30 GMT). It had been given permission to land but the pilots decided to abort and go around for a second attempt. The reason is not yet known, but one civil aviation official told Reuters the plane may have been unable to lower its undercarriage. Images posted on social media appeared to show scorch marks under both engines, with no undercarriage visible on approach. Purported audio of the conversation between air traffic control and a pilot for the second attempt was published by Pakistani media outlets, in which the pilot is heard saying the plane has ""lost engines"". An air traffic controller asks whether it is going to carry out a ""belly landing"", to which the pilot replies ""mayday, mayday, mayday"" - the final communication from the plane. The survivor, Muhammad Zubair, said there were 10-15 minutes between the first attempt at landing and the crash. ""No-one was aware that the plane was about to crash; they were flying the plane in a smooth manner,"" he said. Investigators will try to retrieve the so-called black box recorders to help determine the cause. A committee of investigation has already been set up. PIA said the plane had joined the fleet in 2014 and passed its annual airworthiness inspection last November. The crash came just days after Pakistan began allowing commercial flights to resume after a coronavirus lockdown. Pakistanis across the country are preparing to celebrate the end of Ramadan, with many travelling back to their homes in cities and villages. The plane was only just short of the runway perimeter when it struck houses in the Model Colony residential area. TV footage showed rescue crews combing through debris strewn across the streets of the densely populated zone. A number of cars were set on fire. Passenger Muhammad Zubair, who suffered only minor injuries, said that, when he came to, ""I could hear screams from all directions. Kids and adults. All I could see was fire. I couldn't see any people - just hear their screams"". He added: ""I opened my seatbelt and saw some light - I went towards the light. I had to jump down about 10ft (3m) to get to safety."" Rescuers evacuate an injured resident from the site, where a number of houses were destroyed Eyewitness Mohammed Uzair Khan told the BBC he had heard a massive sound and went outside his home. ""Almost four houses were completely collapsed, there was so much fire and smoke,"" he said. ""They are almost my neighbours, I can't tell you what a horrible thing it was."" Local health officials at two hospitals, the Jinnah and Civic hospitals, gave death tolls to the BBC and Pakistani media, adding up to 76 confirmed deaths. But it was not clear how many of the dead were passengers and how many residents on the ground. Zafar Masud, president of the Bank of Punjab, was the other passenger who survived the crash, a provincial government spokesman said. Both were at the front of the plane. There are reports of other survivors but these have not been confirmed. A senior journalist at TV channel 24 News, Ansar Naqvi, and an ex-head of the Punjab Disaster Management Authority, Khalid Sherdil, were also listed on the passenger manifest. The crash site was just short of the airport perimeter Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the crash,external, promising an immediate investigation. Pakistan has a chequered aviation safety record, including a number of airliner crashes. In 2010, an aircraft operated by private airline Airblue crashed near Islamabad, killing all 152 people on board - the deadliest air disaster in Pakistani history. In 2012, a Boeing 737-200 operated by Pakistan's Bhoja Air crashed in bad weather on its approach to land in Rawalpindi, killing all 121 passengers and six crew. And in 2016, a Pakistan International Airlines plane burst into flames while travelling from northern Pakistan to Islamabad, killing 47 people. Are you in Karachi? Did you witness the crash?

China begins move to impose HK security laws,"A number of pro-democracy lawmakers were dragged out of Hong Kong's legislative chamber during a row about a Chinese national anthem bill China's ruling Communist Party has set in motion a controversial national security law for Hong Kong, a move seen as a major blow to the city's freedoms. The law to ban ""secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism"" could bypass Hong Kong's lawmakers. Critics say Beijing is breaking its promise to allow Hong Kong freedoms not seen elsewhere in China. Pro-democracy activists have called for mass protests against what they see erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy. Anger was already apparent on Friday, as a group of protesters descended on China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. The draft law was submitted at the annual National People's Congress (NPC), which largely rubber-stamps decisions already taken by the Communist leadership, but is still the most important political event of the year. Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region and an economic powerhouse, was required to introduce security legislation after the handover from British control to Chinese rule in 1997. After last year's wave of sustained and violent protest, Beijing is now attempting to push them through, arguing ""law-based and forceful measures"" must be taken to ""prevent, stop and punish"" such protests in the future. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? How bad are China's economic woes? China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes China scraps annual growth target for first time On Friday, Hong Kong's government said it would co-operate with Beijing to enact the law, adding it would not affect the city's freedoms. The law has rattled financial markets, causing Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) to drop by more than 5% on Friday. The ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by the NPC - was explained by Wang Chen, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC. It consists of an introduction and seven articles. Article 4 may prove the most controversial. How is Hong Kong run? Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions That article says Hong Kong ""must improve"" national security, before adding: ""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law."" A group of pro-democracy activists marched on the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong on Friday Addressing the congress, Premier Li Keqiang said: ""We'll establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the two Special Administrative Regions."" Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment, said the law would help authorities tackle illegal activity in the city. Robin Brant, BBC China Correspondent China has long desired a new national security law for Hong Kong. Beijing believes almost a year of mass protests and, at times, paralysing confrontations on the streets shows that now it is needed more than ever. But critics point to what they say are ambiguities inherent in such a law and the broad, generalist framework it would bring to a place which has a very different legal tradition than the communist-controlled mainland. ""Secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism"" are open to some interpretation. Up to now, the worst charge most arrested protesters have faced has been for rioting. The notion of ""terrorism"" also features in this proposed law. That too could encompass wide-ranging acts and activities that the authoritarian rulers on the mainland consider far more menacing than those in Hong Kong, or for that matter elsewhere. China could essentially place the draft law intoAnnex III of the Basic Law,external, which covers national laws that must be implemented in Hong Kong - either by legislation, or decree. The NPC is expected to vote on the draft law at the end of its annual session, on 28 May. It will then be forwarded to the NPC's Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which is expected to finalise and enact the law by the end of June. Hong Kong is what is known as a ""special administrative region"" of China. It has observed a ""one country, two systems"" policy since Britain returned sovereignty in 1997, which has allowed it certain freedoms the rest of China does not have. Pro-democracy activists fear that China pushing through the law could mean ""the end of Hong Kong"" - that is, the effective end of its autonomy and these freedoms. ""This is the largest nuclear weapon the Chinese Communist Party has used in its mutual destruction of Hong Kong,"" Jimmy Sham, a pro-democracy activist who played a leading role in last year's protests. Last year's mass protests in Hong Kong were sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. This video can not be played Former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten: ""UK should tell China this is outrageous"" The bill was paused, then withdrawn - but the protests continued until the coronavirus outbreak at the end of the year. The US has also weighed in, with President Trump saying the US would react strongly if it went through - without giving details. It is currently considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was ""following reports and monitoring the situation closely"". ""We expect China to respect Hong Kong's rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy. As a party to the [Sino-British] Joint Declaration, the UK is committed to upholding Hong Kong's autonomy and respecting the 'One Country, Two Systems' model,"" a statement said. Mr Wang said the security risks had become ""increasingly notable"" - a reference to last year's protests. ""Considering Hong Kong's situation at present, efforts must be made at the state-level to establish and improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms,"" he is quoted as saying in state media. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Beijing may also fear September's elections to Hong Kong's legislature. If last year's success for pro-democracy parties in district elections is repeated, government bills could potentially be blocked. In a separate development, a number of pro-democracy lawmakers were dragged out of Hong Kong's legislative chamber during a row about a Chinese national anthem bill on Friday. Hong Kong was under British control for more than 150 years up to 1997. The British and Chinese governments signed a treaty - the Sino-British Joint Declaration - that agreed Hong Kong would have ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"", for 50 years. Those freedoms, contained in the Basic Law, are only enshrined until 2047 and it is not clear what will happen then. What is the Basic Law and how does it work? Why are there protests in Hong Kong?

UK borrowing soars to cope with impact of virus,"This video can not be played How are we going to pay for the coronavirus crisis? Government borrowing surged to Â£62bn in April, the highest monthly figure on record, after heavy spending to ease the coronavirus crisis. It means the deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - was larger last month than forecast for the whole year at the time of the Budget. The data from the Office for National Statistics,externalrevealed the soaring cost of support, such as furlough schemes. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said things would be worse without government aid. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has predicted that borrowing for the whole year could reach Â£298bn, more than five times the estimate at the time of the March Budget. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, described April's figure as ""pretty much unprecedented"". It said the cost of furlough schemes alone was Â£14bn in April. ""Borrowing now is about six times what it was [in April] last year, so we are talking about some really significant changes in the government finances,"" Mr Athow told the BBC. Coronavirus: How much will it cost the UK? How do government finances work? Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops He added it was impossible to forecast the current year's public finances because of the ""high amounts of uncertainty"". Tax receipts have fallen heavily, as the Treasury has allowed companies to defer some payments. The amount received from VAT in April was negative, with the government collecting less than was handed back in repayments. More than Â£880bn was spent on services such as defence, policing, the NHS, schools and welfare benefits in the last financial year Most of this comes from taxes, which totalled about Â£840bn last year Usually the government spends more money than it has. It borrows money by selling bonds - a promise to repay the money with interest The total debt has increased over time. It is currently Â£1.9 trillion - about Â£28,000 per person in the UK Although the debt in cash terms has gone up, money raised from taxes has risen too, which means the debt can be manageable Meanwhile, borrowing by the state in March 2020 has been revised up by Â£11.7bn to Â£14.7bn, the ONS said. It said this was driven by a reduction in previous estimates of tax receipts and National Insurance contributions. The surge in borrowing comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak stepped up financial support for businesses and employees after vast areas of the economy were forced to halt due to the coronavirus lockdown. After publication of the figures, Mr Sunak said that if the government had not provided financial support, the cost to the economy and people's livelihoods would be much worse. ""Our top priority is to support people, jobs and businesses through this crisis and ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible,"" he said. ""That's why we've taken unprecedented steps to provide lifelines to people and businesses with our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts."" For the past decade, the government had been trying to practise strict financial housekeeping, aiming for position where it could cover day-to-day spending with the money form our taxes and eliminate the deficit. But then the crisis hit - and as the chancellor claims, the schemes put in place have provided a lifeline to tide millions over, to prevent an even bigger economic disaster. It was worth ripping up the rulebook for, he said. However the bills are mounting, just as the amount received from taxpayers slumped. This year's deficit could be the equivalent of the biggest slice of our income since the Second World War - and that hole needs plugging. For the moment, the government has increased its borrowing on financial markets, through bonds, effectively IOUs - but there is a limit to how much it can  do so. Ultimately, economists say taxes will have to rise, or spending cut - the emergency raft will have a price tag which we can't escape. But the chancellor will have to impose those carefully to avoid jeopardising a recovery. And if he opts for tax hikes, he'll risk breaking some election promises. The scale of the economic consequences was underlined on Friday in separate retail sales data from the ONS. These showed thatHigh Street sales crashed last monthas shops closed for the lockdown. It was also announced on Friday that a mortgage payment holiday scheme for homeowners in financial difficulty during the pandemichas been extended for another three months. As a result of the jump in borrowing, total public sector debt rose to Â£1,888bn at the end of April - Â£118.4bn higher than April 2019. Former chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: ""We have to come to terms with the fact that Britain is poorer and the economy is smaller than it would have been."" Asked if the economy would bounce back, he said: ""Bounce is the wrong word, but it will recover."" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, described April's borrowing as ""alarmingly high"", but added that a small easing of the lockdown from 13 May probably meant the government would not have to borrow as much this month. And despite the pressure on public finances, Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation, said there were no signs the government was struggling to raise money on the financial markets. ""Record low interest rates mean the UK's higher debt burden should remain more than manageable,"" he said. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Councils throw 1 June schools plan into doubtA snap-shot survey of councils in England reveals only a minority are advising schools to reopen on 1 June.Family & Education,"Scores of councils in England say they cannot guarantee primaries will reopen on 1 June, throwing government plans to get pupils back to school into chaos. Only 20 of 99 councils to respond to a BBC Breakfast survey said they were advising schools to open more widely on Boris Johnson's target date. Of the 99 who responded, two thirds (68), could not guarantee schools would reopen to Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. It comes as the government prepares to publish scientific advice on its plan. Ministers have been insisting that they would only be calling on schools in England to reopen in June if the scientific advice said it was safe to do so. Teaching unions, heads and politicians have been calling for that advice to be made public. BBC Breakfast carried out a snap-shot survey of the 150  local authorities that oversee primary schools over the past 48 hours. It also showed: 14 local authorities, mainly in the north-west of England, said they would not be advising schools to open their doors to more pupils 11 said they were still considering the issue 54 leaving the decision up to individual schools The local authorities which have said they will not open on 1 June include: Blackburn, Bury, Calderdale, Cheshire East, Cheshire West, East Riding, Knowsley, Newcastle City, Rochdale, Stockport, Trafford and Wirral. It is the head teachers and the governing bodies on the ground who need to make arrangements for social distancing or keeping children within small groups to limit the potential spread of infection. Is your local authority reopening schools? Nurseries are also due to open on June 1. Schools across England have been open to small numbers of vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers since they formally closed at the end of March. But the prime minister announced plans for a phased reopening of primaries from 1 June, when he set out the government's plans to move gradually out of lockdown measures on 10 May. Almost immediately, teaching unions and head teachers warned of safety concerns and practicalities in many schools which, they argued, made safety measures unfeasible. And, with scientific evidence on the way the virus is spread by children limited, there are concerns the wider opening of schools could lead to a second spike in Covid-19. Teaching unions also called for a more regional approach, with local authorities being given the final call. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson made a plea for the sector to let children get back to school, and a string of ministers lined up to try to persuade parents, many of whom are concerned about a return, that schools would  be safe. But, as opposition continued to grow, there has been a softening of the government's approach. On Wednesday, Justice Minister Robert Buckland, said the government was prepared to listen to the concerns of head teachers and council leaders, and hinted it might step back from the 1 June date. He also acknowledged schools would not reopen in a uniform way across England after half term. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We want children back in schools as soon as possible because being with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their well-being."" He added that plans for a cautious, phased return of some children was based on the best scientific and medical advice and insisted the department had been engaging closely with a range of organisations including the teaching unions. But Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said support for a fixed date for school return was vanishing quickly. ""What is needed now is local flexibility to determine when it is right for schools to open up to more pupils."" Councillor Judith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, backed calls for decisions to be made locally. ""As there are different Covid-19 infection rates around the country, schools and councils must be able to work together to decide how and when schools open to more children,"" said Ms Blake. Councils also needed crucial testing data to be shared with them to boost confidence about reopening schools among teachers and parents, along with powers to manage outbreaks in schools, care homes and the community, she argued. Meanwhile Unison, which represents many school support staff, said members had little confidence in government reassurances that English schools will be safe to open to more pupils from 1 June. An overwhelming 96% of 42,000 teaching assistants, cleaners, technicians and office staff surveyed by the union, said they felt ministers had not put safety first in their reopening plans. On Thursday the governments ofScotlandandNorthern Irelandannounced plans for a phased return to school for pupils, starting in August.  Wales has not yet set a date.

China to present HK 'sedition' law at parliament,"A number of pro-democracy lawmakers were dragged out of Hong Kong's legislative chamber during a row about a Chinese national anthem bill China's ruling Communist Party has set in motion a controversial national security law for Hong Kong, a move seen as a major blow to the city's freedoms. The law to ban ""secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism"" could bypass Hong Kong's lawmakers. Critics say Beijing is breaking its promise to allow Hong Kong freedoms not seen elsewhere in China. Pro-democracy activists have called for mass protests against what they see erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy. Anger was already apparent on Friday, as a group of protesters descended on China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. The draft law was submitted at the annual National People's Congress (NPC), which largely rubber-stamps decisions already taken by the Communist leadership, but is still the most important political event of the year. Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region and an economic powerhouse, was required to introduce security legislation after the handover from British control to Chinese rule in 1997. After last year's wave of sustained and violent protest, Beijing is now attempting to push them through, arguing ""law-based and forceful measures"" must be taken to ""prevent, stop and punish"" such protests in the future. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? How bad are China's economic woes? China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes China scraps annual growth target for first time On Friday, Hong Kong's government said it would co-operate with Beijing to enact the law, adding it would not affect the city's freedoms. The law has rattled financial markets, causing Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) to drop by more than 5% on Friday. The ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by the NPC - was explained by Wang Chen, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC. It consists of an introduction and seven articles. Article 4 may prove the most controversial. How is Hong Kong run?

A group of pro-democracy activists marched on the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong on Friday Addressing the congress, Premier Li Keqiang said: ""We'll establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the two Special Administrative Regions."" Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment, said the law would help authorities tackle illegal activity in the city. Robin Brant, BBC China Correspondent China has long desired a new national security law for Hong Kong. Beijing believes almost a year of mass protests and, at times, paralysing confrontations on the streets shows that now it is needed more than ever. But critics point to what they say are ambiguities inherent in such a law and the broad, generalist framework it would bring to a place which has a very different legal tradition than the communist-controlled mainland. ""Secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism"" are open to some interpretation. Up to now, the worst charge most arrested protesters have faced has been for rioting. The notion of ""terrorism"" also features in this proposed law. That too could encompass wide-ranging acts and activities that the authoritarian rulers on the mainland consider far more menacing than those in Hong Kong, or for that matter elsewhere. China could essentially place the draft law intoAnnex III of the Basic Law,external, which covers national laws that must be implemented in Hong Kong - either by legislation, or decree. The NPC is expected to vote on the draft law at the end of its annual session, on 28 May. It will then be forwarded to the NPC's Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which is expected to finalise and enact the law by the end of June. Hong Kong is what is known as a ""special administrative region"" of China. It has observed a ""one country, two systems"" policy since Britain returned sovereignty in 1997, which has allowed it certain freedoms the rest of China does not have. Pro-democracy activists fear that China pushing through the law could mean ""the end of Hong Kong"" - that is, the effective end of its autonomy and these freedoms. ""This is the largest nuclear weapon the Chinese Communist Party has used in its mutual destruction of Hong Kong,"" Jimmy Sham, a pro-democracy activist who played a leading role in last year's protests.

"Job adverts increase in rural areas despite virusRoofers and security guards are among professions with increased demand, one study suggests.Business","Some rural parts of the UK have seen a surge in job adverts posted, despite the coronavirus pandemic, one study suggests. Job postings in Breckland and South Norfolk jumped 8.7% between early and mid-May. Parts of Scotland and north-eastern England also saw an increase, according to the Recruitment & Employment Confederation (REC). Its chief executive described the new data as ""encouraging"". ""Hopefully other regions will start to follow in the coming weeks,"" said REC boss Neil Carberry. The largest weekly falls in vacancies were reported to be in the South West and North West. Chancellor Rishi Sunak warns of 'significant recession' 'Losing my job pushed me to set up a business' But the new report also identified several sectors where demand for workers was rising. Between the start and the middle of May, companies were looking for more pharmacists and nurses as the coronavirus pandemic continued. There was also an increase in vacancies for roofers (+5.4%), security guards (+3.8%) and artists (+4.1%). Mr Carberry added: ""Health and social care workers being in high demand isn't a surprise, but as more workplaces start to reopen, we are likely to see similar trends emerging for other roles. ""The increase in job adverts for cleaners and security guards could be the first sign of this... the economy will begin to bounce back from Covid-19 in the coming months, as businesses start to hire again."" The REC also found that there were about 950,000 job adverts in the UK between 11 and 17 May. The new study comes after official statistics showed on Tuesday thatthe number of people claiming unemployment benefit soared to 2.1 million in April. The jump of 856,500 claims in April reflected the impact of the first full month of lockdown, the Office for National Statistics said. The government has made some changes to who can claim work-related benefits during the pandemic, but this figure is one of a series that show the stress Covid-19 has been putting on the jobs market. When quizzed on unemployment by the Lords Economic Affairs Committee, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he did not have a precise estimate for what the numbers would be at the end of the year.

"China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes","China wants to be in control - of both the virus and Hong Kong China's National People's Congress is a key date in Beijing's choreography of politics and power and despite the coronavirus pandemic, this year's focus is a controversial security law aimed at silencing Hong Kong's protests. The annual meeting is usually scheduled for early March but was postponed due to the virus. It now takes place as the country emerges from the crisis - and seeks to bolster its authority both on the domestic and the global stage. So while the expectation was for a show of confidence and triumph over the pandemic, the framing shifted dramatically when Beijing announced the discussion of a new national security law for Hong Kong, likely to inflame tensions in the territory. The law could seriously curb freedoms in Hong Kong and comes after waves of pro-democracy protests that have sometimes turned violent - and have always angered Beijing. Yet despite Hong Kong topping the agenda, the fallout from the pandemic remains a challenge the NPC will discuss as well. China is where the pandemic started and, as much as the delay of the congress highlighted the severity of the crisis, its rescheduling is a show of strength - a sign, Beijing hopes, that things are under control. The economic fallout, though, remains dramatic - in the first quarter, China'sGDP contracted for the first time in decades. Added to those domestic challenges, Beijing is facing increasing scrutiny and criticism from abroad overwhat it did - and didn't do- when the virus emerged. The NPC is China's parliament, the top legislative body. It usually meets once a year in early March and is all about economic targets, approving budgets, and passing legislation. Although in theory the country's most powerful institution, it is seen as largely a rubber-stamp assembly in Beijing's theatrics of democracy. It approves what has been decided beforehand. Nearly 3,000 delegates from around the country are gathering for 10 days in Beijing, representing provinces, autonomous regions, the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the armed forces. Parallel to the NPC there's also the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the most powerful political advisory body in the country. The Wuhan writer who angered China In Pictures: Shanghai Disneyland reopens Wuhan plans to virus test 11 million residents The territory falls under a ""one country, two systems"" policy and has had a ""high degree of autonomy"" since Britain returned sovereignty to China in 1997. The proposed new security law could ban sedition, secession and treason which means any protests could be punished much more severely than in the past. When the Hong Kong government tried to pass similar legislation in 2003, about 500,000 people took part in street protests against it, and it was eventually shelved. Pro-democracy demonstrations have led to frequent clashes with the police A spokesman for the NPC said on Thursday that that legislation was ""highly necessary"" and would ""safeguard national security in Hong Kong"". However, pro-democracy activists believe that Beijing is slowly eroding Hong Kong's judicial independence and other freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China. China security law 'could be end of Hong Kong' Why are there protests in Hong Kong? All the context you need According to state media, topping the agenda will also be: epidemic control, economic growth, poverty alleviation, employment policy, and drafting China's first civil code. Premier Li Keqiang - the number two in Chinese politics - spoke a the opening on Friday but he omitted a 2020 target for the economy battered by the virus fallout. President Xi wants the virus to be seen as China's triumph, not failure Failure to steer the economy through the crisis could undermine Beijing's domestic legitimacy - a real problem for a party that promises growing prosperity in exchange for authoritarian rule. Despite being accused of suppressing early warnings, China insists it alerted the world of the severity of the virus in time. Beijing says other countries simply neglected to heed those warnings. This video can not be played Mr Trump has criticised China's handling of the outbreak The novel coronavirus emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan in China's Hubei province but wide-ranging lockdown and quarantine measures eventually slowed the number of new infections to a single-digit trickle. Out of about 84,000 confirmed infections, almost 80,000 have recovered while more than 4,500 have died. There are currently only a handful of active cases and lockdowns are being lifted across the country. So what DID China do when outbreak emerged? Can we trust China claims of virus success? Chinese official admits health system weaknesses Concern over a second wave though remains. New clusters near the Russian border have brought home the dangers of re-importing the virus. The coronavirus pandemic is expected to have a profound impact on economies around the globe. For China, we already have a shocking data point: in the first three months of the year,the economy contracted by 6.8%, the first contraction in decades. Although factory work is resuming, the economic and social consequences of a slowing economy will continue and notably, there will be no official target set for 2020 growth. China has already unveiled a range of support measures to cushion the impact - though not on the same scale of some other major economies. And with an export-dependent economy, much of the recovery will depend not just on China - but on how the rest of the world recovers.

One of Belgium's old water mills has been working flat out to meet the needs of the new wannabe bakers. Miller Adrienne Delacroix, whose mill in the Ardennes region has been producing flour for six centuries, said: ""We've witnessed an explosion in demand from individuals"". Ms Delacroix believes the love of baking will continue after the pandemic is over. ""I think the crisis has also brought home
the importance of eating local produce.""  BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast has been speaking to Amanda, who was sleeping rough in Manchester city centre before the coronavirus pandemic. During the lockdown, thousands of homeless people have been helped into homes and shelters, and Amanda was given a room in a Holiday Inn. She said on the first night âI think I slept for two daysâ. Amanda said the security of having a room is something thatâs made a huge difference to a lot of people. This video can not be played Amanda got a room in the lockdown, after sleeping rough Some parks in Paris have reopened but many others are closed A mysterious lock-picker has been unlocking parks in Paris for local residents to use during lockdown. Many parks are currently closed in the French capital and, amid good weather and the easing of other restrictions, the government has resisted calls from the mayor to open them. Instead, a man, who has revealed himself as ""Jose"" to a local newspaper, has been unlocking the parks in poorer areas of the city at night. Two handwritten posters hanging from the railings of the Parc de Belleville on Friday read ""Thank you, Jose!"". The closure of parks has been an increasingly controversial topic in France with police forced to clear open lawns in central Paris of twice in recent days. Cyprus is to reopen its airports to commercial flights from 9 June. The reopening will start by allowing flights from 20 countries, the country's transport minister announced. People arriving from those countries will be required to produce evidence of a negative coronavirus test from within the previous 72 hours. The UK and Russia are not part of the first group, due to the government believing Covid-19 has not been sufficiently contained in the two countries, which are the biggest markets for Cyprus tourism. The Endeavour launched in 2011 from Florida's Cape Canaveral SpaceX and Nasa are urging spectators to stay away from next Wednesday's rocket launch on Florida's Space Coast. But officials in Brevard County, home of the Kennedy Space Center, hope the event will help boost tourism to the state, where visitor revenue is down sharply during the pandemic. In a news conference with reporters earlier this month, Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine noted that previous launches had brought hundreds of thousands of sightseers to Florida beaches. But Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey has actively encouraged visitors, as long as they practise social distancing. ""We are not going to keep the great Americans that want to come watch that from coming here,"" Ivey said. ""If Nasa is telling people to not come here and watch the launch, that's on them. I'm telling people what I believe as an American. And so Nasa has got their guidelines, and I got mine."" The 27 May launch of a SpaceX rocket with two astronauts aboard will be the first launch of astronauts from US soil since the end of the US space shuttle program in 2011. Dominic Cummings, a top adviser to PM Boris Johnson, travelled hundreds of miles from London to County Durham during the lockdown when he had virus symptoms, the BBC has been told. A source close to the PM's chief aide confirmed reports he and his wife went to his parents' home to self-isolate. But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told Mr Cummings did not break government guidance because he and his wife stayed in a separate building. Labour said No 10 needed to provide a ""very swift explanation"" for Mr Cummings' actions. ""If accurate, the prime minister's chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules. The government's guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel,"" a spokesman said. ""The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings."" See here for more. The US state of Washington lost ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars to benefits scammers, officials there have acknowledged, as the number of workers laid off due to coronavirus continues to rise. The loss was disclosed by the state's Employment Security Department on Thursday. Last week, the US Secret Service warned that states were being targeted by a âwell-organised Nigerian fraud ring exploiting the COVID-19 crisis to commit large-scale fraud against state unemployment insurance programsâ adding up to âpotential losses in the hundreds of millions of dollarsâ. The agency added that there was also evidence of attacks in North Carolina, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Florida, the Seattle Times reports. The news came on the same day that the federal government reported another 2.4m American workers filed for jobless benefits last week. In total, 38.6m unememployment claims have been filed in the past nine weeks. Reality Check Thereâs been interest in whether alcohol-based hand cleaners can
overheat and catch fire inside cars after a warning from a local fire service
in the US. TheFacebook post,externalappeared to suggest that a
bottle of hand sanitiser left inside a car led to a fire which burnt
the car door. But should we be worried about leaving hand sanitiser bottles in
our cars during hot weather? Alcohol-based products are flammable and there isguidance from the WHO,externalwhich advises them to be
stored safely - but it is very unlikely they would catch fire from hot weather
alone. There have been various reports of alcohol-based cleaning products
catching fire in different circumstances, but usually because theyâve been
spilled onto something or have been left too close to an open flame. Professor of Chemistry at Nottingham University, Steven Howdle
says: âUnless you have a lighted match or another ignition source in the car,
it is very unlikely there is going to be any problem with fire."" It's been one of the key questions behind the debate about reopening schools.

Ikea will reopen 19 stores across England and Northern Ireland from 1 June, with new safety measures to ensure social distancing, the Swedish retailer says. The homewares chain said social distancing wardens will patrol the stores and the number of customers will be limited. Stores in Scotland, Wales and Ireland will remain closed, in line with government coronavirus guidance. Restaurants and play areas will remain closed, but the food market will reopen for customers to make food like Swedish meatballs at home. Ikea stores have reopened in several European countries including Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. Dan Smith from the band Bastille has told the BBC that he thinks the music industry needs to ""rethink"" how much artists are paid by online streaming sites. âThe money is there, itâs about how itâs distributed"" said the singer. ""I hope that across the music industry, and so many other things â looking at the NHS, and nurses and wages â I hope thereâs a real rethinking across the board of how people are remunerated and whatâs important.â Speaking to The Coronavirus Newscast, Smith said that although things were âuncertainâ now he hoped the industry would be more ""thoughtfulâ after the pandemic. Spotify said in a statement to the BBC that ""the vast majority of revenue generated is paid out to rights holders, including labels, publishing companies, and distributors"". Dan also talked about how the pandemic is having a tougher impact on smaller artists. âLike Spotify pointed out [in their statement to the BBC], the money is there, but I think the most important thing is not these huge artists who get to play arenas and get to play stadiums and headline festivalsâ¦ but it's smaller artists who I think are really, really suffering here and looking ahead of them and just totally questioning how they're going to pay rent and feed themselves.â People in England are being urged to stay away from tourism hotspots over the bank holiday weekend, with warm weather again forecast. Pictures of large numbers visiting beaches in Brighton and Southend in recent days have raised fears over social distancing, with no limit in place on how far people can travel. Visitors to Brighton will find stewards stationed around the beach to encourage physical distancing and direct people to less busy parts of the seafront if it becomes too busy. Councillor Carmen Appich, from Brighton & Hove City Council, said it would be an ""insult to the NHS staff and frontline workers"" to promote the city as a destination to visit. Hastings Borough Council says the area is ""closed to visitors from outside the town"" and on the Isle of Wight the council's ""clear advice"" is to stay away. People are also being advised not to visit Blackpool and have been asked to think twice before visiting the Peak District or Morecambe Bay. In Cornwall, council leaders have warned there is no lifeguard cover,  and a large coastal swell and spring tide will bring hazardous sea conditions over the weekend. The National Trust is urging people across England to stay close to home and explore local green spaces and countryside this weekend. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Home Secretary Priti Patel said people can enjoy the outdoors as long as they follow social distancing advice. The president of the Canadian Medical Association, which represents
physicians across the country, has called Canada's health-care system
""sick"" and is warning that a second wave of coronavirus could strike. Dr Sandy Buchman criticised the lack of personal protection equipment,
contact tracing and testing, and warned government officials they were
""gambling by reopening"". Dr Buchman was speaking before a Senate committee on Wednesday. ""We'd never permit a firefighter to go into a burning building without
adequate protection. We can't expect our frontline health care workers to put
themselves in harm's way,"" he said. Canadian labs have the capacity to process 60,000 tests a day, say public health
officials. But between 17 and 18 May, only about 23,000 tests were conducted. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged to get PPE to the front lines, and
ramp up contract tracing. His warning is a sharp rebuke for a country that prides itself on its public
health-care system. White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx was asked during a briefing about a large study of hydroxychloroquine, which found an increased risk of death for those taking it as a Covid-19 treatment. The Lancet study of 96,000 coronavirus patients found treatment with hydroxychloroquine - an anti-malaria drug - was also more likely to cause heart arrhythmia in patients. Dr Birx said the study revealed more about underlying health conditions, and said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ""has been very clear"" about their concerns in using the drug as a coronavirus prevention (as President Trump has said he is doing) or as a treatment course. Time to catch up on the latest developments: Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News A study of Covid-19 patients in hospitals has found no benefits to treating them with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. In fact, the patients given the drug were more likely to die in hospital and develop heart rhythm complications than other Covid patients in a comparison group. Nearly 15,000 patients took the drug (or a related form chloroquine) either alone or with an antibiotic, in The Lancet study. The researchers warn that the drug - which is safe for treating malaria and diseases such as lupus and arthritis - should not be used outside of clinical trials. But US President Donald Trump has been taking it, despite warnings it might be unsafe. In a bid to find out more, a trial to see whether the anti-malarial drug could prevent Covid-19 is under way. More than 40,000 healthcare workers from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America who are in contact with patients with the disease will be given the drugs to see if they work. Opening day at the Minnesota State Fair The Minnesota State Fair - one of the largest state fairs in the US with over 2m annual visitors - will close for the first time since 1946. Back then it was cancelled due to a polio outbreak. ""This isnât a difficult decision. Itâs the only decision,"" Minnesota State Fair General Manager Jerry Hammer said. ""Itâs the right thing to do."" According to the fair website, it has been cancelled only six times in total since its founding in 1859. ""By taking the tough road today, we guarantee that the fairâs future remains hopeful and bright,"" Hammer said. ""We want to see you all for many years to come, when we can celebrate in true State Fair style."" Coronavirus has been blamed for the collapse into administration of travel company Specialist Leisure Group. About 2,500 jobs have been lost, and 64,000 bookings cancelled, as a result. The company, based in Wigan, Greater Manchester, specialised in breaks and events for the over 50s. The group included well-known coach holiday brands Shearings and National Holidays. The firm said on its website that all tours, cruises, holidays and hotel breaks had been cancelled and would not be rescheduled, and blamed the impact of coronavirus. Travel trade organisation Abta said the hotel and travel company had been ""significantly impacted"" by the pandemic.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woesThe session comes as China emerges from their virus crisis, yet appears set to limit Hong Kong's freedoms.","China wants to be in control - of both the virus and Hong Kong China's National People's Congress is a key date in Beijing's choreography of politics and power and despite the coronavirus pandemic, this year's focus is a controversial security law aimed at silencing Hong Kong's protests. The annual meeting is usually scheduled for early March but was postponed due to the virus. It now takes place as the country emerges from the crisis - and seeks to bolster its authority both on the domestic and the global stage. So while the expectation was for a show of confidence and triumph over the pandemic, the framing shifted dramatically when Beijing announced the discussion of a new national security law for Hong Kong, likely to inflame tensions in the territory. The law could seriously curb freedoms in Hong Kong and comes after waves of pro-democracy protests that have sometimes turned violent - and have always angered Beijing. Yet despite Hong Kong topping the agenda, the fallout from the pandemic remains a challenge the NPC will discuss as well. China is where the pandemic started and, as much as the delay of the congress highlighted the severity of the crisis, its rescheduling is a show of strength - a sign, Beijing hopes, that things are under control. The economic fallout, though, remains dramatic - in the first quarter, China'sGDP contracted for the first time in decades. Added to those domestic challenges, Beijing is facing increasing scrutiny and criticism from abroad overwhat it did - and didn't do- when the virus emerged. The NPC is China's parliament, the top legislative body. It usually meets once a year in early March and is all about economic targets, approving budgets, and passing legislation. Although in theory the country's most powerful institution, it is seen as largely a rubber-stamp assembly in Beijing's theatrics of democracy. It approves what has been decided beforehand. Nearly 3,000 delegates from around the country are gathering for 10 days in Beijing, representing provinces, autonomous regions, the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the armed forces. Parallel to the NPC there's also the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the most powerful political advisory body in the country. The Wuhan writer who angered China In Pictures: Shanghai Disneyland reopens Wuhan plans to virus test 11 million residents The territory falls under a ""one country, two systems"" policy and has had a ""high degree of autonomy"" since Britain returned sovereignty to China in 1997. The proposed new security law could ban sedition, secession and treason which means any protests could be punished much more severely than in the past. When the Hong Kong government tried to pass similar legislation in 2003, about 500,000 people took part in street protests against it, and it was eventually shelved. Pro-democracy demonstrations have led to frequent clashes with the police A spokesman for the NPC said on Thursday that that legislation was ""highly necessary"" and would ""safeguard national security in Hong Kong"". However, pro-democracy activists believe that Beijing is slowly eroding Hong Kong's judicial independence and other freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China. China security law 'could be end of Hong Kong' Why are there protests in Hong Kong? All the context you need According to state media, topping the agenda will also be: epidemic control, economic growth, poverty alleviation, employment policy, and drafting China's first civil code. Premier Li Keqiang - the number two in Chinese politics - spoke a the opening on Friday but he omitted a 2020 target for the economy battered by the virus fallout. President Xi wants the virus to be seen as China's triumph, not failure Failure to steer the economy through the crisis could undermine Beijing's domestic legitimacy - a real problem for a party that promises growing prosperity in exchange for authoritarian rule. Despite being accused of suppressing early warnings, China insists it alerted the world of the severity of the virus in time. Beijing says other countries simply neglected to heed those warnings. This video can not be played Mr Trump has criticised China's handling of the outbreak The novel coronavirus emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan in China's Hubei province but wide-ranging lockdown and quarantine measures eventually slowed the number of new infections to a single-digit trickle. Out of about 84,000 confirmed infections, almost 80,000 have recovered while more than 4,500 have died. There are currently only a handful of active cases and lockdowns are being lifted across the country. So what DID China do when outbreak emerged? Can we trust China claims of virus success? Chinese official admits health system weaknesses Concern over a second wave though remains. New clusters near the Russian border have brought home the dangers of re-importing the virus. The coronavirus pandemic is expected to have a profound impact on economies around the globe. For China, we already have a shocking data point: in the first three months of the year,the economy contracted by 6.8%, the first contraction in decades. Although factory work is resuming, the economic and social consequences of a slowing economy will continue and notably, there will be no official target set for 2020 growth. China has already unveiled a range of support measures to cushion the impact - though not on the same scale of some other major economies. And with an export-dependent economy, much of the recovery will depend not just on China - but on how the rest of the world recovers.

Nearly 15,000 patients took the drug (or a related form chloroquine) either alone or with an antibiotic, in The Lancet study. The researchers warn that the drug - which is safe for treating malaria and diseases such as lupus and arthritis - should not be used outside of clinical trials. But US President Donald Trump has been taking it, despite warnings it might be unsafe. In a bid to find out more, a trial to see whether the anti-malarial drug could prevent Covid-19 is under way. More than 40,000 healthcare workers from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America who are in contact with patients with the disease will be given the drugs to see if they work. Opening day at the Minnesota State Fair The Minnesota State Fair - one of the largest state fairs in the US with over 2m annual visitors - will close for the first time since 1946. Back then it was cancelled due to a polio outbreak. ""This isnât a difficult decision. Itâs the only decision,"" Minnesota State Fair General Manager Jerry Hammer said. ""Itâs the right thing to do."" According to the fair website, it has been cancelled only six times in total since its founding in 1859. ""By taking the tough road today, we guarantee that the fairâs future remains hopeful and bright,"" Hammer said. ""We want to see you all for many years to come, when we can celebrate in true State Fair style."" Coronavirus has been blamed for the collapse into administration of travel company Specialist Leisure Group. About 2,500 jobs have been lost, and 64,000 bookings cancelled, as a result. The company, based in Wigan, Greater Manchester, specialised in breaks and events for the over 50s. The group included well-known coach holiday brands Shearings and National Holidays. The firm said on its website that all tours, cruises, holidays and hotel breaks had been cancelled and would not be rescheduled, and blamed the impact of coronavirus. Travel trade organisation Abta said the hotel and travel company had been ""significantly impacted"" by the pandemic.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Dr Murad Ghrew was treating patients on the Covid-19 ward at Salford Royal Hospital when he became seriously ill. Watch Dr Murad's return home in the video below.

One of Belgium's old water mills has been working flat out to meet the needs of the new wannabe bakers. Miller Adrienne Delacroix, whose mill in the Ardennes region has been producing flour for six centuries, said: ""We've witnessed an explosion in demand from individuals"". Ms Delacroix believes the love of baking will continue after the pandemic is over. ""I think the crisis has also brought home
the importance of eating local produce.""  BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast has been speaking to Amanda, who was sleeping rough in Manchester city centre before the coronavirus pandemic. During the lockdown, thousands of homeless people have been helped into homes and shelters, and Amanda was given a room in a Holiday Inn. She said on the first night âI think I slept for two daysâ. Amanda said the security of having a room is something thatâs made a huge difference to a lot of people. This video can not be played Amanda got a room in the lockdown, after sleeping rough Some parks in Paris have reopened but many others are closed A mysterious lock-picker has been unlocking parks in Paris for local residents to use during lockdown. Many parks are currently closed in the French capital and, amid good weather and the easing of other restrictions, the government has resisted calls from the mayor to open them. Instead, a man, who has revealed himself as ""Jose"" to a local newspaper, has been unlocking the parks in poorer areas of the city at night. Two handwritten posters hanging from the railings of the Parc de Belleville on Friday read ""Thank you, Jose!"". The closure of parks has been an increasingly controversial topic in France with police forced to clear open lawns in central Paris of twice in recent days. Cyprus is to reopen its airports to commercial flights from 9 June. The reopening will start by allowing flights from 20 countries, the country's transport minister announced. People arriving from those countries will be required to produce evidence of a negative coronavirus test from within the previous 72 hours. The UK and Russia are not part of the first group, due to the government believing Covid-19 has not been sufficiently contained in the two countries, which are the biggest markets for Cyprus tourism. The Endeavour launched in 2011 from Florida's Cape Canaveral SpaceX and Nasa are urging spectators to stay away from next Wednesday's rocket launch on Florida's Space Coast. But officials in Brevard County, home of the Kennedy Space Center, hope the event will help boost tourism to the state, where visitor revenue is down sharply during the pandemic. In a news conference with reporters earlier this month, Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine noted that previous launches had brought hundreds of thousands of sightseers to Florida beaches. But Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey has actively encouraged visitors, as long as they practise social distancing. ""We are not going to keep the great Americans that want to come watch that from coming here,"" Ivey said. ""If Nasa is telling people to not come here and watch the launch, that's on them. I'm telling people what I believe as an American. And so Nasa has got their guidelines, and I got mine."" The 27 May launch of a SpaceX rocket with two astronauts aboard will be the first launch of astronauts from US soil since the end of the US space shuttle program in 2011. Dominic Cummings, a top adviser to PM Boris Johnson, travelled hundreds of miles from London to County Durham during the lockdown when he had virus symptoms, the BBC has been told. A source close to the PM's chief aide confirmed reports he and his wife went to his parents' home to self-isolate. But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told Mr Cummings did not break government guidance because he and his wife stayed in a separate building. Labour said No 10 needed to provide a ""very swift explanation"" for Mr Cummings' actions. ""If accurate, the prime minister's chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules. The government's guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel,"" a spokesman said. ""The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings."" See here for more. The US state of Washington lost ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars to benefits scammers, officials there have acknowledged, as the number of workers laid off due to coronavirus continues to rise. The loss was disclosed by the state's Employment Security Department on Thursday. Last week, the US Secret Service warned that states were being targeted by a âwell-organised Nigerian fraud ring exploiting the COVID-19 crisis to commit large-scale fraud against state unemployment insurance programsâ adding up to âpotential losses in the hundreds of millions of dollarsâ. The agency added that there was also evidence of attacks in North Carolina, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Florida, the Seattle Times reports. The news came on the same day that the federal government reported another 2.4m American workers filed for jobless benefits last week. In total, 38.6m unememployment claims have been filed in the past nine weeks. Reality Check Thereâs been interest in whether alcohol-based hand cleaners can
overheat and catch fire inside cars after a warning from a local fire service
in the US. TheFacebook post,externalappeared to suggest that a
bottle of hand sanitiser left inside a car led to a fire which burnt
the car door. But should we be worried about leaving hand sanitiser bottles in
our cars during hot weather? Alcohol-based products are flammable and there isguidance from the WHO,externalwhich advises them to be
stored safely - but it is very unlikely they would catch fire from hot weather
alone. There have been various reports of alcohol-based cleaning products
catching fire in different circumstances, but usually because theyâve been
spilled onto something or have been left too close to an open flame. Professor of Chemistry at Nottingham University, Steven Howdle
says: âUnless you have a lighted match or another ignition source in the car,
it is very unlikely there is going to be any problem with fire."" It's been one of the key questions behind the debate about reopening schools. This video looks at whether children can catch coronavirus - and whether they can spread it as well. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Can children catch and pass on coronavirus? Ikea will reopen 19 stores across England and Northern Ireland from 1 June, with new safety measures to ensure social distancing, the Swedish retailer says. The homewares chain said social distancing wardens will patrol the stores and the number of customers will be limited. Stores in Scotland, Wales and Ireland will remain closed, in line with government coronavirus guidance. Restaurants and play areas will remain closed, but the food market will reopen for customers to make food like Swedish meatballs at home. Ikea stores have reopened in several European countries including Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. Dan Smith from the band Bastille has told the BBC that he thinks the music industry needs to ""rethink"" how much artists are paid by online streaming sites. âThe money is there, itâs about how itâs distributed"" said the singer. ""I hope that across the music industry, and so many other things â looking at the NHS, and nurses and wages â I hope thereâs a real rethinking across the board of how people are remunerated and whatâs important.â Speaking to The Coronavirus Newscast, Smith said that although things were âuncertainâ now he hoped the industry would be more ""thoughtfulâ after the pandemic. Spotify said in a statement to the BBC that ""the vast majority of revenue generated is paid out to rights holders, including labels, publishing companies, and distributors"". Dan also talked about how the pandemic is having a tougher impact on smaller artists. âLike Spotify pointed out [in their statement to the BBC], the money is there, but I think the most important thing is not these huge artists who get to play arenas and get to play stadiums and headline festivalsâ¦ but it's smaller artists who I think are really, really suffering here and looking ahead of them and just totally questioning how they're going to pay rent and feed themselves.â People in England are being urged to stay away from tourism hotspots over the bank holiday weekend, with warm weather again forecast. Pictures of large numbers visiting beaches in Brighton and Southend in recent days have raised fears over social distancing, with no limit in place on how far people can travel. Visitors to Brighton will find stewards stationed around the beach to encourage physical distancing and direct people to less busy parts of the seafront if it becomes too busy. Councillor Carmen Appich, from Brighton & Hove City Council, said it would be an ""insult to the NHS staff and frontline workers"" to promote the city as a destination to visit. Hastings Borough Council says the area is ""closed to visitors from outside the town"" and on the Isle of Wight the council's ""clear advice"" is to stay away. People are also being advised not to visit Blackpool and have been asked to think twice before visiting the Peak District or Morecambe Bay. In Cornwall, council leaders have warned there is no lifeguard cover,  and a large coastal swell and spring tide will bring hazardous sea conditions over the weekend. The National Trust is urging people across England to stay close to home and explore local green spaces and countryside this weekend. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Home Secretary Priti Patel said people can enjoy the outdoors as long as they follow social distancing advice. The president of the Canadian Medical Association, which represents
physicians across the country, has called Canada's health-care system
""sick"" and is warning that a second wave of coronavirus could strike. Dr Sandy Buchman criticised the lack of personal protection equipment,
contact tracing and testing, and warned government officials they were
""gambling by reopening"". Dr Buchman was speaking before a Senate committee on Wednesday. ""We'd never permit a firefighter to go into a burning building without
adequate protection. We can't expect our frontline health care workers to put
themselves in harm's way,"" he said. Canadian labs have the capacity to process 60,000 tests a day, say public health
officials. But between 17 and 18 May, only about 23,000 tests were conducted. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged to get PPE to the front lines, and
ramp up contract tracing. His warning is a sharp rebuke for a country that prides itself on its public
health-care system. White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx was asked during a briefing about a large study of hydroxychloroquine, which found an increased risk of death for those taking it as a Covid-19 treatment. The Lancet study of 96,000 coronavirus patients found treatment with hydroxychloroquine - an anti-malaria drug - was also more likely to cause heart arrhythmia in patients. Dr Birx said the study revealed more about underlying health conditions, and said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ""has been very clear"" about their concerns in using the drug as a coronavirus prevention (as President Trump has said he is doing) or as a treatment course.

"Body found in search for missing teenagerAfter a two-week search for Louise Smith, 16, officers find human remains in a Hampshire woodland.","The more recent photo on the right shows the coat Louise was wearing when she went missing, police said A body has been found by police searching for a missing teenager. The 16-year-old, named locally as Louise Smith, was last seen on 8 May - VE Day - in Somborne Drive, Havant, Hampshire. Detectives said they were treating the death of a person found in woodland in Havant Thicket as suspicious. Formal identification has not taken place but Louise's family has been informed of the discovery, Hampshire Constabulary said. Det Ch Supt Scott Mackechnie said the news would be ""very upsetting for the community"". He urged people to avoid speculation and to ""provide all information to the police in the first instance"". ""We will endeavour to provide you with further updates as soon as we can,"" he said. A man and a woman, both aged 29, have previously been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and released on bail. The force previously asked people in the area to save any dashcam and CCTV footage from 7 and 8 May - particularly any filmed at VE Day celebrations - for officers to review.

"China security law 'could be end of Hong Kong'Pro-democracy activists say the move by Beijing may mean ""one country, two systems"" is erased.","A number of pro-democracy lawmakers were dragged out of Hong Kong's legislative chamber during a row about a Chinese national anthem bill China's ruling Communist Party has set in motion a controversial national security law for Hong Kong, a move seen as a major blow to the city's freedoms. The law to ban ""secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism"" could bypass Hong Kong's lawmakers. Critics say Beijing is breaking its promise to allow Hong Kong freedoms not seen elsewhere in China. Pro-democracy activists have called for mass protests against what they see erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy. Anger was already apparent on Friday, as a group of protesters descended on China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. The draft law was submitted at the annual National People's Congress (NPC), which largely rubber-stamps decisions already taken by the Communist leadership, but is still the most important political event of the year. Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region and an economic powerhouse, was required to introduce security legislation after the handover from British control to Chinese rule in 1997. After last year's wave of sustained and violent protest, Beijing is now attempting to push them through, arguing ""law-based and forceful measures"" must be taken to ""prevent, stop and punish"" such protests in the future. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? How bad are China's economic woes? China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes China scraps annual growth target for first time On Friday, Hong Kong's government said it would co-operate with Beijing to enact the law, adding it would not affect the city's freedoms. The law has rattled financial markets, causing Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) to drop by more than 5% on Friday. The ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by the NPC - was explained by Wang Chen, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC. It consists of an introduction and seven articles. Article 4 may prove the most controversial. How is Hong Kong run? Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions That article says Hong Kong ""must improve"" national security, before adding: ""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law."" A group of pro-democracy activists marched on the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong on Friday Addressing the congress, Premier Li Keqiang said: ""We'll establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the two Special Administrative Regions."" Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment, said the law would help authorities tackle illegal activity in the city. Robin Brant, BBC China Correspondent China has long desired a new national security law for Hong Kong. Beijing believes almost a year of mass protests and, at times, paralysing confrontations on the streets shows that now it is needed more than ever. But critics point to what they say are ambiguities inherent in such a law and the broad, generalist framework it would bring to a place which has a very different legal tradition than the communist-controlled mainland. ""Secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism"" are open to some interpretation. Up to now, the worst charge most arrested protesters have faced has been for rioting. The notion of ""terrorism"" also features in this proposed law. That too could encompass wide-ranging acts and activities that the authoritarian rulers on the mainland consider far more menacing than those in Hong Kong, or for that matter elsewhere. China could essentially place the draft law intoAnnex III of the Basic Law,external, which covers national laws that must be implemented in Hong Kong - either by legislation, or decree. The NPC is expected to vote on the draft law at the end of its annual session, on 28 May. It will then be forwarded to the NPC's Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which is expected to finalise and enact the law by the end of June. Hong Kong is what is known as a ""special administrative region"" of China. It has observed a ""one country, two systems"" policy since Britain returned sovereignty in 1997, which has allowed it certain freedoms the rest of China does not have. Pro-democracy activists fear that China pushing through the law could mean ""the end of Hong Kong"" - that is, the effective end of its autonomy and these freedoms. ""This is the largest nuclear weapon the Chinese Communist Party has used in its mutual destruction of Hong Kong,"" Jimmy Sham, a pro-democracy activist who played a leading role in last year's protests. Last year's mass protests in Hong Kong were sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. This video can not be played Former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten: ""UK should tell China this is outrageous"" The bill was paused, then withdrawn - but the protests continued until the coronavirus outbreak at the end of the year. The US has also weighed in, with President Trump saying the US would react strongly if it went through - without giving details. It is currently considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was ""following reports and monitoring the situation closely"". ""We expect China to respect Hong Kong's rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy.

If last year's success for pro-democracy parties in district elections is repeated, government bills could potentially be blocked. In a separate development, a number of pro-democracy lawmakers were dragged out of Hong Kong's legislative chamber during a row about a Chinese national anthem bill on Friday. Hong Kong was under British control for more than 150 years up to 1997. The British and Chinese governments signed a treaty - the Sino-British Joint Declaration - that agreed Hong Kong would have ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"", for 50 years.

How do schools double classes with no extra rooms?,"Here's a practical maths conundrum, rather than a political question, about the plan to reopen schools in England. And as a spoiler - the Department for Education says it will need to issue new guidance to sort it out. The government announced that to keep children and teachers safe there should be no more than 15 pupils per class - so in effect, every class of 30 would have to be spread over two classrooms. This might work for the phased return of the first few year groups. But the government is also aiming, if the safety advice permits, for all primary year groups to be back in school for a month before the end of term. The complication is that if each class is occupying two or more classrooms, how could all the year groups be back full time at the same time? There wouldn't be enough classrooms or teachers. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, says the sums don't add up: ""It seems to us a non-starter."" ""It is impossible to reconcile this ambition with the current guidance about limiting class sizes to 15 and keeping groups in 'bubbles' to reduce mixing,"" says Mr Barton. Councils warn of delay to 1 June school reopening What unions and parents think about return to school How will they reopen and do children have to go? It's an example of how the plan to reopen schools is being road-tested against reality - before the final decision is taken, on or before 28 May, on whether to go ahead with reopening schools. A Department for Education spokesman says new safety guidance will be provided if it's decided all primary pupils are going back: ""We'll revisit the advice when the science indicates it is safe to invite more children back to schools and colleges."" Primary schools are going to have to be adapted in many other ways. Secondary schools will be closed for most year groups until September They're designed to be welcoming, family-friendly places, with lots of shared play areas. But now they will need a safety-first environment. It's goodbye to the soft toys and anything which might be hard to clean and might spread infection. Instead there will be marked out spaces, gaps between desks, one-way systems and a routine of frequent hand washing. There's a big encouragement on fresh air and ventilation - with the safety guidance urging outdoor classes where possible and doors and windows to be kept open. Anything that can be touched will have to be frequently cleaned - light switches, books, tables, chairs, bannisters. Bringing books or anything else between school and home is discouraged - and in school there shouldn't be a sharing of pencil and paper, and libraries will be closed. But it's not about masks or social distancing - with the guidelines accepting that a two-metre exclusion zone is not realistic between young children. Instead the safety guidance is based on keeping children in closed groups of no more than 15, which stay separate from the rest of the school, and so minimise the risk of spreading infection. These small groups will have one teacher and will learn, play and eat separately, arriving and leaving school at a different time from other small groups of pupils - each group staying two metres apart from any other. It's a system that's followedDenmark's ""protective bubble"" approach- and teachers there suggest that pupils adapt surprisingly quickly and seem to enjoy seeing their friends again. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis academy trust which runs 35 primary schools, says it is very hard to have a catch-all set of national guidelines - because every school will have different buildings and circumstances. Access to outside spaces, the design and size of rooms, the layout of schools and corridors will be different. Every building will need a ""bespoke plan"", he says. Mr Chalke, who supports reopening schools, says the pressure on space from class sizes of 15 will mean that schools are likely to need rota systems, such as different classes having morning and afternoon shifts. If schools have to spread out classes, how will all year groups be able to return? That might raise childcare questions for parents, if they have to work around part-time school timetables. Mr Chalke says while there are political debates going on between the government and teachers' unions, the key demographic to persuade over reopening schools will be parents. ""If I'm a mum or a dad, am I going to send my child?"" He expects at first there might be relatively few arriving. ""I'm guessing it's going to be a trickle,"" he says. But he thinks if schools can show that schools are safe and children are glad to be back, the numbers will start increasing. Schools were closed in a rush more than eight weeks ago - reopening them could prove a more complicated process. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

How will contact tracing work in the UK?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate.

Why can some of us meet six people in lockdown?,"Graffiti on a wall in Edinburgh England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have their own powers when it comes to easing the lockdown. In Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people who do not share a household can now meet outdoors, with social-distancing measures in place. But in England, the guidance is to meet only one other person outside your household outdoors. The different policies are down to a number of factors, including geography, science and politics, experts say. And as we ""tiptoe out of lockdown"", the lines between science and policy are likely to become ever more blurred. Northern Ireland: ""Groups of four to six people who do not share a household can meet outdoors maintaining social distancing."" England: ""You can meet one other person from outside your household if you are outdoors. Public gatherings of more than two people from different households are prohibited in law. There are no limits on gatherings in the park with members of your household."" Wales: The advice remains to stay at home, except to go outside for food, health reasons or work (but only if is not reasonably practicable to work from home). ""The overarching aim is that people should stay at home as much as possible. However, exercising outdoors is an important exception to this rule and is encouraged..."" Wales' health minister is considering whether people should be able to meet loved ones not in their household outdoors. The next review of the rules is on 28 May. Scotland: The advice is similar to that in Wales. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says her ""route map"" to lifting lockdown will be published on Thursday, with restrictions likely to be eased from 28 May. The ""Stay home,"" message still applies Even within the UK, we should think of ""a lot of different epidemics"" rather than a single pandemic, according to Keith Neal, emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases, at the University of Nottingham. It is ""quite reasonable"" for Northern Ireland, which shares a border with the Republic of Ireland, to be out of step with the rest of the UK. Andstudies suggests,externalthe reproduction (R) number, a measure of virus transmission, varies by region. If the R number is above one, the number of cumulative cases takes off - but if it is below one, the outbreak eventually stops The UK government is advised by a panel of scientific experts, including epidemiologists, infectious disease modellers, virologists and medical doctors. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters COMPARING COUNTRIES:The pitfalls of doing so R0, FURLOUGH:The language of the outbreak RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? But Prof James Wilsdon, an expert in science policy, at the University of Sheffield, says the lines between evidence-based science and politics are becoming ""very blurred"" and this will increase ""as we try and tiptoe our way out of lockdown"". There are ""very difficult decisions to navigate"" and the ""cracks are starting to show"". Rowland Kao, a professor of epidemiology and data science, at the University of Edinburgh, says different governments have to consider ""all sorts of balancing acts"", when it comes to using science to inform policy. ""Policy decisions will inevitably be a mixture of scientific advice, an understanding of social and economic impacts and the ability to carry out any decisions,"" he adds.

How safe are takeaways and supermarket deliveries?,"With pubs, restaurants and cafes nearly all closed because of lockdowns across the UK, there's been a growth in takeaway and delivery of food and drink. But what are the Covid-19 risks? Covid-19 is a respiratory illness - it's mainly spread by droplets of fluid that come out of an infected person's nose and mouth, which can then be breathed in by people nearby. This is thought to be the main way people catch the virus. There is little direct evidence of people catching the virus from droplets that have ended up on objects (such as food or food packaging) - although it's difficult to gather this evidence so we can't rule it out as a route of transmission. Reputable chains and good restaurant kitchens are most likely to be geared towards professional, hygienic food preparation, meaning there would be minimal risk from a freshly cooked takeaway meal. Deliveroo,externalandJust Eat,externalhave issued guidance on how their riders can stay safe and make food deliveries without touching restaurant packaging. Any risk from touching infected objects or surfaces can be pretty much eliminated by washing your hands and not touching your face. If you get a takeaway delivery, the risk of packaging contamination can be minimised. ""Empty the contents [into a clean dish], dispose of the packaging into a refuse bag and wash your hands thoroughly before you eat,"" advises Prof Sally Bloomfield, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""Take food out of a container with a spoon and eat it with a knife and fork - not your fingers."" It might be better in the current circumstances to order hot, freshly cooked food, rather than cold or raw items. The Food Standards Agency does stressthe risk from food is low,externaland ""there is no reason to avoid having ready-to-eat food delivered if it has been prepared and handled properly"". For the most cautious and vulnerable though, careful preparation and cooking may be reassuring. ""With a pizza for example, if you wanted to be really safe, you could even pop it into the microwave for a couple of minutes,"" Prof Bloomfield adds. Delivery slots permitting, a home food drop is less risky than a trip to a supermarket as you will avoid other shoppers. Any risk would be the possible contamination of food or packaging - handled by other people - or from the delivery driver. You could leave a note on your door asking drivers to ring the bell and step back, but Prof Bloomfield says there's no such thing as ""zero risk"". ""For contained or packaged goods, either store them for 72 hours before using them - or spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with bleach [carefully diluted as directed on the bottle]. ""For unwrapped fresh goods, which could have been handled by anyone - wash thoroughly under running water and leave to dry,"" she adds. HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? HOW FAST IS THE VIRUS GROWING?The UK spread compared to other countries UK Food Standards Agency: Advice on food safety at home,external Prof Alison Sinclair, a virology expert from the University of Sussex, adds: ""There should be no more risk from using online deliveries than using a friend or volunteer to collect groceries for you."" Some experts also advise using plastic bags only once during this pandemic. Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can cause an infection if they are breathed in, or potentially if you touch a surface they have landed on. So going shopping and mixing with other people does carry a risk. Wearing a face covering and social distancing - keeping at least 2m (about 6ft) from others - are both important ways to reduce that risk. Supermarkets can provide an ""ideal setting"" for virus transfer, says Prof Bloomfield. ""Many people are touching and replacing items, checkout belts, cash cards, car park ticket machine buttons, ATM payment buttons, paper receipts etc... Not to mention being in the proximity of several other people."" There are ways to offset these risks: Wear a mask if you can Wash hands for 20 seconds with soap and water, or with alcohol-based hand sanitiser before and after shopping Treat surfaces as if they may be contaminated, meaning you avoid touching your face after handling shopping trolleys, baskets, packages and produce Use contactless payment methods Follow Victoria on Twitter,external Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

"China's parliament aims for show of strengthThe session comes as China emerges from the virus crisis, and appears set to limit Hong Kong's freedoms.Asia","China wants to be in control - of both the virus and Hong Kong China's National People's Congress is a key date in Beijing's choreography of politics and power and despite the coronavirus pandemic, this year's focus is a controversial security law aimed at silencing Hong Kong's protests. The annual meeting is usually scheduled for early March but was postponed due to the virus. It now takes place as the country emerges from the crisis - and seeks to bolster its authority both on the domestic and the global stage. So while the expectation was for a show of confidence and triumph over the pandemic, the framing shifted dramatically when Beijing announced the discussion of a new national security law for Hong Kong, likely to inflame tensions in the territory. The law could seriously curb freedoms in Hong Kong and comes after waves of pro-democracy protests that have sometimes turned violent - and have always angered Beijing. Yet despite Hong Kong topping the agenda, the fallout from the pandemic remains a challenge the NPC will discuss as well. China is where the pandemic started and, as much as the delay of the congress highlighted the severity of the crisis, its rescheduling is a show of strength - a sign, Beijing hopes, that things are under control. The economic fallout, though, remains dramatic - in the first quarter, China'sGDP contracted for the first time in decades. Added to those domestic challenges, Beijing is facing increasing scrutiny and criticism from abroad overwhat it did - and didn't do- when the virus emerged. The NPC is China's parliament, the top legislative body. It usually meets once a year in early March and is all about economic targets, approving budgets, and passing legislation. Although in theory the country's most powerful institution, it is seen as largely a rubber-stamp assembly in Beijing's theatrics of democracy. It approves what has been decided beforehand. Nearly 3,000 delegates from around the country are gathering for 10 days in Beijing, representing provinces, autonomous regions, the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the armed forces. Parallel to the NPC there's also the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the most powerful political advisory body in the country. The Wuhan writer who angered China In Pictures: Shanghai Disneyland reopens Wuhan plans to virus test 11 million residents The territory falls under a ""one country, two systems"" policy and has had a ""high degree of autonomy"" since Britain returned sovereignty to China in 1997. The proposed new security law could ban sedition, secession and treason which means any protests could be punished much more severely than in the past. When the Hong Kong government tried to pass similar legislation in 2003, about 500,000 people took part in street protests against it, and it was eventually shelved. Pro-democracy demonstrations have led to frequent clashes with the police A spokesman for the NPC said on Thursday that that legislation was ""highly necessary"" and would ""safeguard national security in Hong Kong"". However, pro-democracy activists believe that Beijing is slowly eroding Hong Kong's judicial independence and other freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China. China security law 'could be end of Hong Kong' Why are there protests in Hong Kong? All the context you need According to state media, topping the agenda will also be: epidemic control, economic growth, poverty alleviation, employment policy, and drafting China's first civil code. Premier Li Keqiang - the number two in Chinese politics - spoke a the opening on Friday but he omitted a 2020 target for the economy battered by the virus fallout. President Xi wants the virus to be seen as China's triumph, not failure Failure to steer the economy through the crisis could undermine Beijing's domestic legitimacy - a real problem for a party that promises growing prosperity in exchange for authoritarian rule. Despite being accused of suppressing early warnings, China insists it alerted the world of the severity of the virus in time. Beijing says other countries simply neglected to heed those warnings. This video can not be played Mr Trump has criticised China's handling of the outbreak The novel coronavirus emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan in China's Hubei province but wide-ranging lockdown and quarantine measures eventually slowed the number of new infections to a single-digit trickle. Out of about 84,000 confirmed infections, almost 80,000 have recovered while more than 4,500 have died. There are currently only a handful of active cases and lockdowns are being lifted across the country. So what DID China do when outbreak emerged? Can we trust China claims of virus success? Chinese official admits health system weaknesses Concern over a second wave though remains. New clusters near the Russian border have brought home the dangers of re-importing the virus. The coronavirus pandemic is expected to have a profound impact on economies around the globe. For China, we already have a shocking data point: in the first three months of the year,the economy contracted by 6.8%, the first contraction in decades. Although factory work is resuming, the economic and social consequences of a slowing economy will continue and notably, there will be no official target set for 2020 growth. China has already unveiled a range of support measures to cushion the impact - though not on the same scale of some other major economies. And with an export-dependent economy, much of the recovery will depend not just on China - but on how the rest of the world recovers.
