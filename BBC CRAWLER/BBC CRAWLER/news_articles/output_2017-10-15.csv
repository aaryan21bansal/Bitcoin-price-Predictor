Austria set to elect world's youngest leader,"This video can not be played Conservative Sebastian Kurz: the frontrunner Austria's conservative People's Party, led by 31-year-old Sebastian Kurz, is set to win the country's general election, projections suggest. Mr Kurz is on course to become the world's youngest national leader. The People's Party was set to win more than 31%. It is so far unclear whether the Social Democrats or the far-right Freedom Party will finish second. Short of a majority, Mr Kurz's party could seek an alliance with the anti-immigration Freedom Party. Addressing his supporters, Mr Kurz said: ""It is time for change in this country. Today is a strong order for us, to change this country, and I say thank you to you all who made this possible. ""I'm overwhelmed, I am happy, and I look forward to working for Austria."" Before the election, Mr Kurz served as Europe's youngest-ever foreign minister, after he was appointed in 2013 aged just 27. In May 2017 he became the leader of the People's Party. He began his political career in the youth wing of the party, which he chaired before moving on to serve on Vienna's city council. Nicknamed ""Wunderwuzzi"" (very roughly translated as wonder hotshot), he has been compared to the young leaders of France and Canada, Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau. Much like Mr Macron, Mr Kurz has created a movement around himself, rebranding the People's Party - which has been in power for more than 30 years - as ""The New People's Party"". Immigration was the dominant issue in the run-up to the vote, and Mr Kurz moved his party to the right in the wake of Europe's 2015 refugee crisis. He appealed to conservative and right-wing voters with pledges to shut down migrant routes to Europe, cap benefit payments to refugees, and bar immigrants from receiving benefits until they have lived in Austria for five years. Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache accuses Mr Kurz of stealing his policies The rightward shift was seen as a response to the success of the Freedom Party, which narrowly missed out on the presidency in December when Norbert Hofer was defeated by Alexander Van der Bellen, head of the Greens. The stance proved popular with Austrian voters after a huge influx of undocumented migrants and refugees from the Middle East and North Africa. The Freedom Party accused Mr Kurz of stealing their policies. Their candidate, Heinz-Christian Strache, has called him an ""imposter"". Parties clash in final TV debate Austrian ban on veil comes into force Austria's far right choose a flower with an ugly past Mr Kurz is on course to win the lion's share of the vote but not a majority. If the forecasts are correct, he will need to form a coalition, most likely with the Freedom Party. The last coalition between the Social Democrats and the conservatives fell apart this spring - and there may be reluctance to renew it. But an alliance with the populist, far-right Freedom Party could prove controversial among Austria's EU counterparts. Mr Kurz refused to discuss his plans, saying only that he would talk to other parties. He says he wants to wait for final results. Population8.7 million Area83,871 sq km (32,383 sq miles) Major languageGerman Major religionChristianity Life expectancy80 years (men), 84 years (women) Currencyeuro Polls have put the Freedom Party at an all all-time high of 26.9%, suggesting that the European far-right is not dead after emphatic defeats in France and the Netherlands. The relative success of the Freedom Party followsan electoral breakthrough by the far right in neighbouring Germanylast month. The current chancellor, Social Democrat leader Christian Kern, could lose his position after a campaign marred by several scandals, including allegations that his adviser led an online smear campaign against Mr Kurz. But Mr Kern said on Sunday he had no intention of standing down as leader, despite the party's loss. ""I have said I will stay in politics for 10 years and there are nine years to go,"" he told broadcaster ORF. After a tumultuous year with internal rifts, the pro-refugee Greens party is among several smaller parties uncertain of reaching the 4% threshold required to enter parliament.

'Tax raid' on older workers and Ophelia 'chaos',"The man expected to be Austria's new leader, Sebastian Kurz, features heavily this morning. The website Politico says a win for Mr Kurz and his People's Partyheralds a ""tectonic shift"" in Austrian politics,externalafter more than a decade under a centrist coalition. It believes his win illustrates the ""continued potency of the refugee crisis in European politics"" and will resonate across the European Union. The Austrian newspaper,Wiener Zeitung,external, writes that Mr Kurz may struggle to woo his fellow European leaders, given that he is tipped to form an alliance with the nationalist Freedom Party - which has raised the prospect of leaving the Euro and perhaps the EU altogether.

N Korea talks 'until first bomb drops',"South Korean forces have been holding exercises along the border with the North US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has insisted President Donald Trump wants to resolve the confrontation with North Korea through diplomacy. It will continue until ""the first bomb drops"", he told CNN. Sanctions and diplomacy, he said, had brought unprecedented international unity against North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. Last month, Mr Trump told Mr Tillerson not to waste time seeking talks with Kim Jong-un. Mr Tillerson's remarks come as the US and South Korea begin their latest joint military exercise in waters surrounding the Korean peninsula, involving fighter jets, destroyers and aircraft carriers. The drills regularly anger the North, and Pyongyang has in the past denounced them as a ""rehearsal for war"". Rex Tillerson said Mr Trump wanted the issue ""solved diplomatically"" In Sunday's interview, Mr Tillerson again refused to comment on whether he had referred to Mr Trump as a moron after a July meeting at the Pentagon. ""I'm not going to deal with that petty stuff,"" he replied, saying he would not dignify the question with an answer. The presidentresponded by challenging the secretary of state to an IQ testbut a spokeswoman said later it had been a joke. In recent months, North Korea has defied international opinion by conducting its sixth nuclear test and launching two missiles over Japan. Analysts say the secretive communist state is clearly set on developing a nuclear-capable missile, able to threaten the continental US, despite UN sanctions. At the end of last month, Mr Tillersondisclosed that the US was in ""direct contact"" with the Northand looking at the possibility of talks. After months of heated rhetoric, it came as a surprise to some that the two countries had lines of communication. However, the next day Mr Trump tweeted Mr Tillerson to say: ""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Storm warnings issued across Ireland,"This video can not be played Amber wind warning issued for Northern Ireland A weather warning has been issued for Northern Ireland as Hurricane Ophelia makes its way across the Atlantic. The Met Office said winds of between 55mph (89km/h) and 65mph (105km/h) are likely across the region, particularly during Monday evening's rush-hour. It added that ""damaging winds"" have the potential to pose ""danger to life"" due to the likelihood of flying debris. All schools, colleges and courts in the Republic of Ireland will close on Monday due to the risk the gusts pose. Fresh warnings as hurricane heads to UK Tail end of hurricane heading to Ireland Disruptive winds for Northern Ireland Hurricane Ophelia will be a storm when it hits Ireland and the UK as it weakens on its path across the Atlantic Ocean. But national weather services in both countries have issued alerts about severe weather. The Met Office said its warning is of a less severe grade than that of Met Ãireann because their systems for gauging the alerts differ. Met Office warnings outline the likely impact of weather, whereas Met Ãireann issues its alerts when forecasted weather meets certain risk levels. In Northern Ireland, the Met Office's amber warning will take effect from 15:00 BST on Monday, lasting until 22:00. Gusts in the far south-east of Northern Ireland could reach speeds of between 70mph (112km/h) and 80mph (129km/h). ""There is the potential for damage to trees, there could be a danger to life from flying debris,"" said John Wylie of the Met Office. ""A very stormy period is to come on Monday evening.""

UK police investigate new Weinstein claims,"UK police are investigating a number of sexual assault allegations involving Harvey Weinstein, the BBC understands. The Metropolitan Police says he is accused of assaulting three women in separate incidents in London in the late 1980s, 1992, 2010, 2011 and 2015. Officers are looking into claims they were attacked in Westminster, Camden and west London. The Hollywood film producer has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex. No arrests have been made over any of the allegations, police say. New York police are also investigating claims against Weinstein, including rape and sexual assault. More than two dozen women - among them actresses Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Rose McGowan - have made a number of accusations against him. Weinstein, 65, is a huge figure in the film world, where his productions have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and won 81. Woody Allen 'sad' for Harvey Weinstein Harvey Weinstein: The accusers' stories James Corden criticised for Weinstein joke Women in his own words Alice Evans: My Weinstein encounter On Saturday, the organisation behind the Oscars(the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) voted to expel Weinstein. Hollywood figures including Tom Hanks and Whoopi Goldberg sit on its board. Announcing its decision, the Academy said the ""era of wilful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behaviour and workplace harassment in our industry is over"". French President Emmanuel Macron has said he has taken steps to revoke Weinstein's Legion d'Honneur - the country's top honour - which he was awarded in 2012. This video can not be played Film Critic Jason Solomons says Harvey Weinstein ""came for me and shook me"" after a bad review British actress Lysette Anthony is the latest named star to accuse Weinstein after she toldthe Sunday Times,externalhe attacked her at her London home in the late 1980s. Anthony says she reported the attack to the Met addingshe met the producer in 1982 when she was in sci-fi film Krulland the alleged assault happened a few years later. It was a ""pathetic, revolting"" attack, the actress said, that had left her ""disgusted and embarrassed"". The Metropolitan Police said it was passed an allegation of sexual assault, without giving details. What it was like to work for Weinstein How the scandal unfolded Did everyone really know? Exploring the casting couch culture of LA BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford says detectives have two problems going forward - one will be gathering evidence from the time of these allegations, including an incident from 35 years ago. He adds the other is that because Weinstein faces allegations in the United States, police will want to deal with that first before agreeing to extradite him to the UK to face any charges against him there. Meanwhile,Woody Allen has said he had heard rumours about Weinsteinbut not ""these horror stories"", adding he was ""sad"" to hear about the numerous allegations. The film-maker later clarified his comments. ""When I said I felt sad for Harvey Weinstein I thought it was clear the meaning was because he is a sad, sick man,""he told Variety,external. Harvey Weinstein's brother has refused to comment on whether the board of Weinstein Company had been aware of settlements with women during recent contract negotiations. But Bob Weinsteintold the Hollywood Reporter,externalhe had no idea of ""the type of predator"" his brother was. Other developments include: Weinstein was an executive producer on The Reader, the film which earned Winslet her Oscar Kate Winslet has revealed she deliberately did not thank Harvey Weinstein when she won her Oscar for The Reader in 2009. ""I remember being told, 'Make sure you thank Harvey if you win,'"" the actresstold the Los Angeles Times,external. ""And I remember turning around and saying, 'No I won't.'"" The British director of Oscar-tipped film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri said he was pleased Weinstein had ""got his comeuppance"". Speaking on the closing night of this year's London Film Festival, Martin McDonagh said: ""Hopefully it's the start of something better."" James Cordenhas apologisedfor making jokes about the Weinstein affair at a charity gala in Los Angeles. ""I am truly sorry for anyone offended, that was never my intention,"" the British talk show hostwrote on Twitter,external.

UK will 'grow more' food if no Brexit deal,"This video can not be played Chris Grayling said that British farmers would produce more if food prices increase post-Brexit British farmers would produce more food themselves in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal, a cabinet minister has suggested. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling was responding to industry claims that food prices could rise sharply in the event of a no-deal Brexit. If this happened, he said the UK would respond by ""growing more here and buying more from around the world"". Labour said his comments amounted to telling people to ""dig for no deal"". The National Farmers Union has argued Brexit is an opportunity to ""reverse the downward trend"" in the UK's self-sufficiency in food but insisted this should not be done by ""closing off markets"". Mr Grayling's comments comes amid fresh warnings from supermarket bosses that the UK leaving the EU in March 2019 without at least the outline of a future trade partnership would be bad for British consumers. Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? MPs can stop no-deal Brexit - McDonnell Farm profits 'may halve' after Brexit CUK imports and exports in six charts Sainsbury's chairman David Tylertold the Sunday Times,externalthat a no-deal Brexit could result in an average 22% tariff on all EU food bought by British retailers. The British Retail Consortium has said this could translate into a minimum 9% rise in the cost of tomatoes, 5% for cheddar and 5% for beef, while warning the figures could actually be much higher. Agricultural products are one of the UK's most important exports while the UK sources roughly 70% of the food it imports from the EU, leading to claims that items could ""rot"" at the border if there are hard customs checks or supply chains are disrupted after Brexit. Broccoli is one of a number of products that could be more expensive in the event of a Brexit no-deal Given the UK's importance to farmers across Europe, Mr Grayling said it was not in their interests to see an outcome which resulted in higher costs and new obstacles to trade. ""You may remember the brouhaha over the Walloon farmers when they objected to the Canadian trade deal. I had a look to see who their biggest customer was - it was us,"" he told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC One. ""We are the biggest customers of the Walloonian farmers - they will be damaged if we don't have a deal."" But if the UK ended up without a deal, which would see it default to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, Mr Grayling suggested domestic producers and retailers would respond by rethinking their sourcing. ""What it would mean would be that supermarkets bought more from home, that British farmers grew more and that they bought more from around the world,"" he added. The UK is forecast to become steadily less self-sufficient in food ""What we will do is grow more here and buy more from around the world but that will mean bad news for continental farmers and that is why it will not happen - it is in their interests to reach a deal."" The British Retail Consortium said maintaining tariff-free trade with the EU during a post-Brexit transitional period was vital to preventing the UK facing potential tariffs straightaway of up to 40% on some beef and dairy products under WTO rules. The trade body,which recently published research on the subject,external, acknowledges forecasting the consequent impact on food costs is complex and a range of other factors would have to be taken into account. But it said there was a risk that domestic producers could put up their own prices to increase their competitiveness and if this happened, the cost of items like tomatoes could rise by up to 18%, broccoli by up to 10% and cheddar by a maximum of 32%. A spokeswoman said that while retailers could review their buying policies in the medium to long term to adjust, it was ""very unrealistic to expect farmers to make up the surplus of produce straight away"". The NFU has said the UK's ability to feed itself has stagnated and if the country relied entirely on home-grown produce, the cupboard would look bare after about seven months. Labour said farmers, as much as anyone, wanted to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" departure from the EU. ""Rather than planning for no deal, ministers appear to be telling us to dig for no deal,"" said shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman. ""British farmers already work incredibly hard and to suggest that they could simply grow more food is ridiculous."" Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like?

Warnings as powerful storm heads to UK,"This video can not be played High winds caused damage across Ireland Two men and a woman have been killed as the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia hit the British Isles. As hurricane-force gusts battered the Republic of Ireland, one woman and a man died in separate incidents when trees fell on their cars. A second man died in a chainsaw accident while attempting to remove a tree felled by the storm. Thousands of homes and businesses lost power in Northern Ireland and Wales, along with 360,000 in the Republic. The power company Northern Ireland Electricity said 15,000 households in the province should prepare to spend Monday night without power. Police in Scotland say the storm has hit Dumfries and Galloway and it is forecast to continue over the region into the evening. And in Cumbria, police in Barrow closed roads around Barrow AFC's stadium after wind damaged its roof. Damage caused by Storm Ophelia in Cork Cumbria Police said it was dealing with ""numerous incidents"" related to the high winds, which reached up to 70mph in the area. The force had received reports of roofs and debris on the roads and overhead cables which had come down and it was urging people to only make essential travel. In Wales, roads and railway lines have been closed and a gust of 90mph was recorded in Aberdaron, Gwynedd. The Welsh Ambulance service said a woman has been injured after being hit by a falling branch in Wrexham. In Ireland, the woman, in her 50s, died near Aglish, County Waterford, and a female passenger, in her 70s, was injured. Her injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, the Gardai, Ireland's police force, said. One of the men died near Dundalk, Co Louth, after his car was struck by a tree at about 14:45 BST, the Gardai said. The other man, in his 30s, was killed in Cahir, Co Tipperary. All road users were urged to stay indoors and not travel unless their journey was absolutely necessary. Flights were also disrupted as several UK planes were forced to land or divert after reports of a ""smoke smell"" linked to weather conditions.

Killer drivers to receive life sentences,"A Government consultation in December 2016 found support for the law change Drivers who kill someone in the most serious cases of dangerous and careless driving will now face life sentences. Causing death by dangerous driving, or death by careless driving while drunk or on drugs, will carry the top-level punishment. Jail terms in cases involving mobile phones, speeding or street racing will now be the equivalent of manslaughter, the Ministry of Justice said. Road safety charity Brake said it was a ""major victory"" for victims' families. It follows criticism that sentences for those convicted over road deaths were too lenient. The increase will apply to offences in England, Scotland and Wales, but not Northern Ireland, which has separate road safety laws. Barrister Matthew Scott told BBC Radio 5 live the change would not increase road safety. Driver who fled crash scene after killing passenger is jailed Speeding driver jailed over boy's death Nine years jail for driver who killed girl, four Announcing the change, justice minister Dominic Raab said: ""Based on the seriousness of the worst cases, the anguish of the victims' families, and maximum penalties for other serious offences such as manslaughter, we intend to introduce life sentences of imprisonment for those who wreck lives by driving dangerously, drunk or high on drugs."" A new offence of causing serious injury through careless driving is also to be created. A woman who lost her partner to a driver distracted by his mobile phone believes a life sentence may be the deterrent needed to make drivers take more care. Meg Williamson's Australian boyfriend Gavin Roberts, 28, died after his BMW was hit by a Vauxhall Corsa driven by Lewis Stratford on the A34 in Oxfordshire in June 2016. Stratford, who was speeding and having an argument with his girlfriend over the phone, admitted death by dangerous driving and was jailed for three years and eight months in March. Gavin Roberts with Meg Williamson in the last photo taken of the couple together, on the night before he died Ms Williamson told BBC Radio 5 live that if a harsher sentence had been in place at the time ""it might have prevented Lewis from doing what he did"". She said: ""It's about re-educating people now. I think it might just take that one person to get the life imprisonment if some fatality occurs then people will start to realize this is something serious."" Ms Williamson met Stratford, who was also badly hurt in the crash, before he was sentenced at Reading Crown Court. She said the meeting had been difficult but had helped them both move towards ""closure"". She said: ""In time I think I will forgive him. It's something everybody has got to live with. ""He now has to live with the guilt of what he has done and we are all dealing with the fact that somebody is missing from our life on a daily basis."" The changes follow a public consultation in December 2016 which generated 9,000 responses. Of them, 70% backed increasing the maximum sentence for death by dangerous driving from the current 14 years to a life term. Death by careless driving carries a maximum term of five years, increasing to 14 years if alcohol or drugs are involved. Atif Dayaji was jailed for four years for death by dangerous driving, after killing a nine-year-old boy Last week a man who killed a nine-year-old boy while driving at more than double the speed limit was jailed for four years. Atif Dayaji, 27, had admitted death by dangerous driving after hitting Adam Imfal-Limbada while travelling at about 67mph (108kph) in a 30mph (48kph) zone in Blackburn, Lancashire, in August 2016. Department for Transport figures show that while three in five killer drivers are jailed, the average sentence is four years. In 2016, 157 people were sentenced for causing death by dangerous driving and 32 were convicted of causing death by careless driving whilst under the influence, the MoJ said. Brake has argued that penalties faced by drivers who kill and injure are ""grossly inadequate"" and cause added anguish to their families. Jason Wakeford, Brake's director of campaigns, said: ""We applaud the government for at last recognising that the statute books have been weighed against thousands of families who have had their lives torn apart through the actions of drivers who have flagrantly broken the law."" Mr Scott argued that the announcement was a ""crowd-pleasing gesture"" and that life sentences ""should be reserved for the most serious offences"". He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Bad though it is and wrong though it is, taking out a mobile phone while driving without any intention to cause death, I don't consider that is the sort of behaviour that could possibly justify a life sentence.""

Why can't California control the wildfires?,"California firefighters have struggled to contain the deadly blazes raging across the state The wildfires raging across northern California are already the most fatal in the state's history; at least 40 people are dead and thousands of homes have been razed. Wildfires are a common occurrence in California towards the tail end of the state's long, hot, dry summers, but this year a combination of extremely high temperatures, strong winds, a long drought, and population growth have produced lethal, fast-moving blazes. The fires are burning in one of the world's most developed countries though. Arrayed against the flames are more than 10,000 firefighters, 880 fire engines, 134 bulldozers, 14 helicopters, and more. So why is this blaze so difficult to control, and the death toll so high? The wind The late summer winds that blow into California from the Great Basin region, east of the state - the so-called ""Diablo winds"" -  drop elevation as they move out towards sea level. That has a few knock-on effects. As the pressure increases at lower altitudes, the air gets warmer, the wind speed increases, and the humidity level drops. This video can not be played Watch: Why the California wildfires are deadly That produces ideal conditions for a fast-moving wildfire. Northern California recorded gusting wind speeds of up to 70 mph this week, spreading the flames faster than firefighters could tackle them, and faster than some people could escape. The high winds also overwhelm man-made and natural firebreaks, such as protection zones and wide highways, carrying embers across gaps in the brush that might otherwise contain the blaze. Hillsides compound the spread, as heat rises quickly up the steep terrain. The heat and the drought California has just experienced its hottest summer on record, with less than 25% average rainfall. The heat dries out vegetation, making it all the more combustible if a spark ignites in the wrong place. The state is also still feeling the effects of a five-year drought that parched its forests, leaving tens of millions of dead trees in its wake - more fuel for the fire. A postman delivers mail in a fire-devastated suburb of Santa Rosa, California And counter-intuitively, California's extremely wet 2016-2017 winter may have also contributed to the spread of the blaze. The large amounts of vegetation that grew in the rain then dried out in the extremely hot summer that followed, providing even more fuel. California's population is growing, and with it the number of homes built in high-risk fire areas. A2014 study,externalof residential growth in the state predicted that by 2050 there will be 645,000 homes built in ""very high severity"" zones. Homes and other structures are increasingly being built adjacent to combustible areas of woodland. California law requires any structures in such a position to create 100 ft of ""defensible space"" - or firebreak - in every direction. But the law is not aggressively enforced, it is left largely up to homeowners to police their own safety measures. And with a conflagration moving as fast as this one, in high winds, even a properly maintained firebreak might prove useless. Firefighters try to extinguish a house fire near Calistoga, California Story after story is emerging from California of people surrounded by fire in the middle of the night before they had a chance to escape, or of slight hesitations and delays that led to tragedy. ""This is what was so extraordinary about this event,"" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, toldInside Climate News,external. ""Essentially it was a forest fire, a wildfire, that moved into an urban area. At some point it was jumping from house to house, not tree to tree."" Even in the world's most developed country, there is no high-tech solution to a wildfire of this size. Firefighters rely on relatively old-fashioned tactics to starve the massive conflagrations. A fleet of planes and helicopters - including DC-10 airliners - is dumping water and fire-retardant on the blazes in an attempt to cool the air temperature and deprive the fires of oxygen. A DC-10 aircraft drops fire retardant on a wind-driven wildfire in Orange, California Firefighters are also creating so-called containment lines, purposefully burning vegetation in the path of the blaze to deprive it of fuel. In recent years, a steep increase in the number of dead trees - from disease and drought - has made it too dangerous for fire crews to enter certain areas, as the trees are more susceptible to sudden collapse. That means containment lines have to be created further back from the blaze itself, allowing more woodland to burn before the fire can be deprived of fuel. One key way to save lives is to warn people early, but questions have been raised about the warning system in this case. Text alert warnings were issued last Saturday night, as the blaze began to spread, but only to those who had signed up to receive them. The emergency ""amber"" alert system, which pings every phone in a region, was not activated by authorities. ""There wasn't time to map out anything. There wasn't time to make a plan,"" Sergeant Spencer Crum of the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office, told theNew York Times,external. Beyond evacuation plans and firefighting tactics, California may need some help from above. A sustained, end-of-season rainfall would soak the vegetation and lower the air temperature.

Great Storm 1987: The day 18 people were killed,"Winds battered the south of England in what was the worst storm to hit the country since 1703 Ask people about the Great Storm which ravaged the south of England in 1987 and most will remember ""that"" forecast by weatherman Michael Fish, or Sevenoaks losing six of the trees that gave the town its name. What is mentioned far less is the loss of 18 lives. ""When we eventually got him out, he had suffocated under the rubble. They couldn't find a broken bone in his body."" Alec Homewood was about five miles away from his childhood home when its roof fell in and killed his brother. Cyril Homewood, known as Bob, was upstairs asleep in his bedroom when the chimney collapsed - the force of which pushed the legs of his bed through the ceiling into the kitchen. ""It just devastated the house,"" his brother said. ""Virtually all the roof came down. Mother said he'd been killed, but we didn't know."" Alec Homewood remembered his brother Bob, pictured, as ""a great bloke"" Mr Homewood set out for the house at Biddenden in Kent, but countless trees felled by ferocious winds had made roads around the village impassable. Using a chainsaw, he hacked at them as he went.  When he arrived at Beacon Hill Farm, he found his mother had been rescued from the drawing room by people living nearby. But when they tried to reach his 59-year-old brother, they found the bedroom was full of bricks and debris. ""It took me ages to get there,"" Mr Homewood, now 72, remembered. ""They [the emergency services] got him out in the end, but he was dead."" This video can not be played Former BBC weatherman Michael Fish during his infamous weather forecast of 15 October 1987 Severe weather had been predicted before the Great Storm - as it later became known - hit the south coast of England in the early hours of 16 October. The previous afternoon, the Met Office had forecast winds for the Channel and very heavy rain overland. The BBC's weather presenter Michael Fish had quashed rumours a hurricane was on the way: ""Don't worry, there isn't"", he infamously told the nation. But just a few hours later, the storm changed direction. Severe weather warnings were issued to emergency responders, including the Ministry of Defence and London Fire Brigade. But what became the worst storm since 1703 was by that point unstoppable. Cars were crushed by trees ripped from their roots The cost of the devastation was estimated at more than Â£1bn A maximum gust of 115mph was recorded at Shoreham in West Sussex, while London was battered by gales of up to 94mph. On the south coast the Royal Sovereign lightship witnessed an average wind speed of 86mph. A ship capsized at Dover and a Channel ferry was driven ashore near Folkestone. Thousands of homes were left without power for several days, and the damage caused by the storm was put at more than Â£1bn. The number of trees lost was estimated at 15 million. Eighteen people in the UK - and four in France - were killed. The roof and chimney of Beacon Hill Farm collapsed, killing Bob Homewood Kent police constable Douglas Stitt was five miles away in Tenterden when he got the call for help. He said the five-mile drive to Biddenden - normally a 10-minute journey - took them more than two hours. Trees were strewn across the road every quarter of a mile and a fireman with a chainsaw had to cut through the debris as they went. Great Storm: The healing power of nature Michael Fish talks about 'that' forecast,external When they got there, they found a scene of devastation. The 999 crews knew they were dealing not with a rescue, but a recovery. ""It was beyond that stage,"" Mr Stitt said. ""We managed to climb through the back door. The whole landing was smashed in. ""It was a case of gradually picking our way over the rubble. It looked like a bomb had hit it."" Bob Homewood was remembered as a ""super person"" who loved working on his father's farm The Met Office was criticised for failing to predict the devastating scale of the storm Though experts agree it was not a hurricane, the country experienced hurricane-strength winds In the months and years that followed, debate raged about whether the storm had been a hurricane. Experts agreed it was not by definition, because it had not originated in the tropics. After an internal inquiry, the Met Office improved its forecasting technology amid allegations it had failed to alert the nation. For Mr Homewood, the shock of his brother's death did not hit him until days after the storm had passed. He remains adamant it was a hurricane - even having words to that effect inscribed on his brother's gravestone. ""I'll never ever forget him. I think of him nearly every day,"" he said. ""When I think back, it was terrible. But you can't defeat nature. ""The Great Storm of 1987 was as bad as having a bomb dropped on the place."" This video can not be played Alec Homewood said he thinks of his brother, Bob, every day Mr Homewood was not the only fatality of the Great Storm, but media coverage of those killed was limited. John Dowling, who was deputy editor of the Bexhill Observer, remembers how Ronald Davies died at the Queens Hotel in Hastings when a chimney crashed through the roof. But the newspaper did not report his death, because it happened outside its patch. Instead it focused on the community's response, including how a group of people in their 70s went out to clear roads with chainsaws. ""Memories are very selective,"" said Mr Dowling. ""Think of memories of '87 and you have certain images and perhaps people tend to wipe out the nasty bits and remember the silly bits."" Emmetts Garden, owned by the National Trust, lost 95% of its woodland to gale-force winds The journalist said it was ""darned difficult"" finding people after the storm. Many had left their houses, and neighbours did not know where they had gone. He remembered a roof being torn off one property leaving a bedroom open to the sea and sky, an entire penthouse that was swept into a car park, and a rowing boat that ended up in a road, 400 yards from the sea. ""It was all hands to the pump, by everyone who could help. Builders, people, emergency services, it was the Dunkirk spirit."" The Great Storm was later categorised as a one-in-200-year event. On top of the environmental cost, there was structural damage as trees, ripped from the ground by their roots, crushed houses and vehicles and blocked roads and railways. Even now, residents and historians agree the loss of an estimated 15 million trees was devastating. ""When we looked and saw the trees, hundreds of years old... that was just heartbreaking,"" said Biddenden parish councillor, Eileen Cansdale. ""There was structural damage that could be addressed, but the trees couldn't be replaced. It completely changed everything."" Alec Homewood had ""killed tragically by the hurricane"" engraved on his brother's headstone Mrs Beryl Agha, Hove John Barton, Petersfield Patricia Bellwood, Wrotham David Birch, lost at sea Sylvia Brown, Canvey Island Anthony Burton, Salisbury Ronald Davies, Hastings Robert Doke, Croydon Robert Homewood, Biddenden Ronald Horlock, lost at sea David Gregory, Christchurch Terence Marrin, Lincoln's Inn Fields James Read, Hastings Sidney Riches, Kings Lynn Sosammi Shilling, Chatham Georgina Wells, Haywards Heath Graham White, Christchurch Source: Windblown, by Tamsin Treverton Jones Historian Bob Ogley said news of the loss of life emerged only in the days after the storm because people in the area were still without power. ""There was no radio communication, because most people used electric radios, and there was no TV at all. ""It was only later we learned people had died."" Cars and houses were crushed by falling trees A light aircraft was blown upside down in Essex He said people remember the damaged landscape more than anything else. ""Here in Sevenoaks, we lost our name. Sevenoaks was reduced to one oak. ""Most people went to bed and woke up and found a tree in their garden. ""So, people think about the countryside. People don't think about those who died, because they were spread over a large area. ""Having said that, every death is a tragedy.""

Can we teach robots ethics?,"We are not used to the idea of machines making ethical decisions, but the day when they will routinely do this - by themselves - is fast approaching. So how, asks the BBC's David Edmonds, will we teach them to do the right thing? The car arrives at your home bang on schedule at 8am to take you to work.  You climb into the back seat and remove your electronic reading device from your briefcase to scan the news. There has never been trouble on the journey before: there's usually little congestion.  But today something unusual and terrible occurs: two children, wrestling playfully on a grassy bank, roll on to the road in front of you.  There's no time to brake.  But if the car skidded to the left it would hit an oncoming motorbike. Neither outcome is good, but which is least bad? The year is 2027, and there's something else you should know. The car has no driver. Dr Amy Rimmer believes self-driving cars will save lives and cut down on emissions I'm in the passenger seat and Dr Amy Rimmer is sitting behind the steering wheel. Amy pushes a button on a screen, and, without her touching any more controls, the car drives us smoothly down a road, stopping at a traffic light, before signalling, turning a sharp left, navigating a roundabout and pulling gently into a lay-by. The journey's nerve-jangling for about five minutes. After that, it already seems humdrum. Amy, a 29-year-old with a Cambridge University PhD, is the lead engineer on the Jaguar Land Rover autonomous car. She is responsible for what the car sensors see, and how the car then responds. She says that this car, or something similar, will be on our roads in a decade. Many technical issues still need to be overcome.  But one obstacle for the driverless car - which may delay its appearance - is not merely mechanical, or electronic, but moral. The dilemma prompted by the children who roll in front of the car is a variation on the famous (or notorious) ""trolley problem"" in philosophy.  A train (or tram, or trolley) is hurtling down a track.  It's out of control.  The brakes have failed.  But disaster lies ahead - five people are tied to the track.  If you do nothing, they'll all be killed.  But you can flick the points and redirect the train down a side-track - so saving the five.  The bad news is that there's one man on that side-track and diverting the train will kill him.  What should you do? This question has been put to millions of people around the world. Most believe you should divert the train. But now take another variation of the problem. A runaway train is hurtling towards five people.  This time you are standing on a footbridge overlooking the track, next to a man with a very bulky rucksack.  The only way to save the five is to push Rucksack Man to his death: the rucksack will block the path of the train. Once again it's a choice between one life and five, but most people believe that Rucksack Man should not be killed. This puzzle has been around for decades, and still divides philosophers.  Utilitarians, who believe that we should act so as to maximise happiness, or well-being, think our intuitions are wrong about Rucksack Man.  Rucksack Man should be sacrificed: we should save the five lives. Trolley-type dilemmas are wildly unrealistic.  Nonetheless, in the future there may be a few occasions when the driverless car does have to make a choice - which way to swerve, who to harm, or who to risk harming?  These questions raise many more.  What kind of ethics should we programme into the car?  How should we value the life of the driver compared to bystanders or passengers in other cars?  Would you buy a car that was prepared to sacrifice its driver to spare the lives of pedestrians?  If so,you're unusual,external. Then there's the thorny matter of who's going to make these ethical decisions.  Will the government decide how cars make choices?  Or the manufacturer?  Or will it be you, the consumer?  Will you be able to walk into a showroom and select the car's ethics as you would its colour? ""I'd like to purchase a Porsche utilitarian 'kill-one-to-save-five' convertible in blue pleaseâ¦"" Listen toCan We Teach Robots Ethics?on Analysis, on BBC Radio 4, at 20:30 on Monday 16 October - orcatch up later on the BBC iPlayer Listen toThe Inquiryon the BBC World Service -click herefor transmission times or to listen online Ron Arkin became interested in such questions when he attended a conference on robot ethics in 2004.  He listened as one delegate was discussing the best bullet to kill people - fat and slow, or small and fast? Arkin felt he had to make a choice ""whether or not to step up and take responsibility for the technology that we're creating"".  Since then, he's devoted his career to working on the ethics of autonomous weapons. There have been calls for a ban on autonomous weapons, but Arkin takes the opposite view:  if we can create weapons which make it less likely that civilians will be killed, we must do so.  ""I don't support war.  But if we are foolish enough to continue killing ourselves - over God knows what - I believe the innocent in the battle space need to be better protected,"" he says. Like driverless cars, autonomous weapons are not science fiction.  There are already weapons that operate without being fully controlled by humans.  Missiles exist which can change course if they are confronted by an enemy counter-attack, for example.  Arkin's approach is sometimes called ""top-down"".  That is, he thinks we can programme robots with something akin to the Geneva Convention war rules - prohibiting, for example, the deliberate killing of civilians. Even this is a horrendously complex challenge: the robot will have to distinguish between the enemy combatant wielding a knife to kill, and the surgeon holding a knife he's using to save the injured. An alternative way to approach these problems involves what is known as ""machine learning"". Susan Anderson is a philosopher, Michael Anderson a computer scientist. As well as being married, they're professional collaborators. The best way to teach a robot ethics, they believe, is to first programme in certain principles (""avoid suffering"", ""promote happiness""), and then have the machine learn from particular scenarios how to apply the principles to new situations. A humanoid robot developed by Aldebaran Robotics interacts with residents at a care home Take carebots - robots designed to assist the sick and elderly, by bringing food or a book, or by turning on the lights or the TV.  The carebot industry is expected to burgeon in the next decade.  Like autonomous weapons and driverless cars, carebots will have choices to make.  Suppose a carebot is faced with a patient who refuses to take his or her medication.  That might be all right for a few hours, and the patient's autonomy is a value we would want to respect.  But there will come a time when help needs to be sought, because the patient's life may be in danger. After processing a series of dilemmas by applying its initial principles, the Andersons believe that the robot would become clearer about how it should act. Humans could even learn from it. ""I feel it would make more ethically correct decisions than a typical human,"" says Susan.  Neither Anderson is fazed by the prospect of being cared for by a carebot.  ""Much rather a robot than the embarrassment of being changed by a human,"" says Michael. However machine learning throws up problems of its own.  One is that the machine may learn the wrong lessons.  To give a related example, machines that learn language from mimicking humans have beenshown to import various biases,external.  Male and female names have different associations.  The machine may come to believe that a John or Fred is more suitable to be a scientist than a Joanna or Fiona.  We would need to be alert to these biases, and to try to combat them. A yet more fundamental challenge is that if the machine evolves through a learning process we may be unable to predict how it will behave in the future; we may not even understand how it reaches its decisions.  This is an unsettling possibility, especially if robots are making crucial choices about our lives.  A partial solution might be to insist that if things do go wrong, we have a way to audit the code - a way of scrutinising what's happened.  Since it would be both silly and unsatisfactory to hold the robot responsible for an action (what's the point of punishing a robot?), a further judgement would have to be made about who was morally and legally culpable for a robot's bad actions. One big advantage of robots is that they will behave consistently.  They will operate in the same way in similar situations. The autonomous weapon won't make bad choices because it is angry. The autonomous car won't get drunk, or tired, it won't shout at the kids on the back seat.  Around the world, more than a million people are killed in car accidents each year - most by human error.  Reducing those numbers is a big prize. Quite how much we should value consistency is an interesting issue, though.  If robot judges provide consistent sentences for convicted criminals, this seems to be a powerful reason to delegate the sentencing role.  But would nothing be lost in removing the human contact between judge and accused?  Prof John Tasioulas at King's College London believes there is value in messy human relations.  ""Do we really want a system of sentencing that mechanically churns out a uniform answer in response to the agonising conflict of values often involved? Something of real significance is lost when we eliminate the personal integrity and responsibility of a human decision-maker,"" he argues. Amy Rimmer is excited about the prospect of the driverless car.  It's not just the lives saved.  The car will reduce congestion and emissions and will be ""one of the few things you will be able to buy that will give you time"".  What would it do in our trolley conundrum?  Crash into two kids, or veer in front of an oncoming motorbike?  Jaguar Land Rover hasn't yet considered such questions but Amy is not convinced that matters:  ""I don't have to answer that question to pass a driving test, and I'm allowed to drive.  So why would we dictate that the car has to have an answer to these unlikely scenarios before we're allow to get the benefits from it?"" That's an excellent question.  If driverless cars save life overall why not allow them on to the road before we resolve what they should do in very rare circumstances?  Ultimately, though, we'd better hope that our machines can be ethically programmed - because, like it or not, in the future more and more decisions that are currently taken by humans will be delegated to robots. There are certainly reasons to worry.  We may not fully understand why a robot has made a particular decision.   And we need to ensure that the robot does not absorb and compound our prejudices.  But there's also a potential upside.  The robot may turn out to be better at some ethical decisions than we are.  It may even make us better people. Illustrations are From Would You Kill The Fat Man?

The Chinese family in five charts,"In the five years since President Xi Jinping moved to the helm, China has become richer and more powerful. But what has this growth meant for the fate and fortunes of the ordinary Chinese family? As China's most powerful decision-makers meet to set the course of the nation for the next five years and a new generation of leaders emerges, we look at data from Chinese authorities and major surveys, to get some clues about how China's family life and society is changing. In 2015, the government threw out its notorious one child policy which had been intended to keep population figures low but had led to a crippling gender imbalance. So while now the door is open for more kids and bigger families, a look at marriage and divorce rates increasingly shows the same trend as the rest of the developed world: Marriage rates are falling while more and more people end up divorced. Yet this first impression might be misleading. ""China has always had and is still having a much lower divorce rate than US and western European countries,"" Xuan Li, assistant professor of psychology at New York University Shanghai, explains. ""A much higher percentage of mainland Chinese people marry eventually, in comparison to those in neighbouring areas and countries. So the idea that the Chinese families (and ergo, the society and nation) are falling apart is statistically ungrounded."" China might have overturned its one-child policy in 2015 yet its legacy will continue to be a problem for years to come. There is even a term for unmarried men over 30: Shengnan, meaning ""leftover men"". In 2015, a Chinese businessman in his 40s reportedly sued a Shanghai-based introductions agency for failing to find him a wife, having paid the company 7m yuan ($1m, Â£780,000) to conduct an extensive search. Counting the cost of Chinaâs left-behind children China's forbidden babies still an issue ""China's one-child policy advanced and amplified a demographic transition,"" explains Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics. ""Falling birth rates and an aging population have been exerting downward pressure on the labour force and thus on economic growth."" ""Although the one-child policy was changed in January 2016 into a two-child policy,higher birth ratesnow will only show up in the labour force in around two decades,"" he estimates. But higher standards of living are slowly affecting traditional gender perceptions and that in turn will have a positive effect on the gender imbalance. ""The gender imbalance is already changing,"" Mu Zheng of the Centre for Family and Population Research at National University of Singapore told the BBC. ""That's because of the relaxed fertility policy, changing attitudes, women's advanced profiles in both education and work, and with a more established social security system,"" But for now, the current gender imbalance does make it hard for men to find wives. Amid the constant talk about China's housing bubble about to burst, here's a detail that stands out: Among millennials, China hasa towering percentage of homeowners, a different league it seems from European countries or the US. While the abovedata from HSBC,externallargely covers urban China, it still illustrates a crucial point: parents are trying whatever they can to equip their sons with some added extras to woo women into wedlock. ""It is the custom that husbands will provide a home,"" Dr Jieyu Liu, deputy director of the SOAS China Institute, told the BBC in April when HSBC released the data. ""Many love stories fail to turn to marriage if the men fail to provide a marital house."" So once charm, luck or a property have helped China's singles get hitched - what is life like for families? China's average income has seen a steady rise, both in rural and in urban areas. While the relative expenses on food have dropped significantly over the past decade, the money spent on things like health, clothes or transport has gone up. The same goes for communications. The surge in mobile phones illustrates that point. Smartphones are not just another communications expense - the WeChat app for instance is so woven into everyday routines that life without a phone is virtually unthinkable. ""WeChat is designed as an app that is like a toolkit for life, sort of a digital Swiss Army knife,"" Beijing-based tech analyst Duncan Clark of ABI Research explains. He says consumers have been embracing the convenience of it covering everything from paying utility bills, cashless payments in shops, taxis and bike rentals, money transfers and of course - communication. Higher incomes translate into more money spent on children's education and recent years have shown a steady rise in parents sending their children overseas to study. What's more, they are coming back. ""A large proportion of these students are returning to China, with 433,000 having returned in 2016,"" explains Rajiv Biswas, APAC chief economist at analytics firm IHS Markit. This rapidly growing pool of Chinese graduates with international degrees and experience of living abroad will make the next generation of Chinese business and government leaders ""very international in their thinking and understanding of other cultures, which will be increasingly important as China assumes the mantle of the world's largest economy in about a decade"". And while a degree from a European or US university is likely to boost your chances on the job market - it might also drive up your chances of bagging the right partner. Reporting by Andreas Illmer.

American cricket gets ready for take-off,"One of the world's most popular sports is barely known in the US. But, driven by a new generation of immigrants, could cricket finally take off? It is a hot, sunny day in Hyattsville, Maryland. Young men play basketball in the park. Barbecue smoke hangs in the hazy, late-summer air. A cyclist rides past with the Stars and Stripes on his trailer. And then, through the trees, comes a most un-American sound. ""Howzat!"" Rikin Parikh, 22 Yards captain, with Imran Awan Imran Awan was 17 when he moved from Pakistan to the US in 1997. He didn't think Americans played cricket but he brought his equipment, just in case. He soon needed it. A day after arriving, Imran played his first game on American soil, for a family friend's team. Within two years he was picked for the US national side. Imran represented his new country in matches around the world - from Abu Dhabi to Nepal - and, aged 38, still plays locally. On this hot day in Hyattsville, he's captain of the Washington Tigers. The Tigers are in the final of the Washington Cricket League Twenty 20 tournament, premier division. With the first and second division finals also taking place, it's a big day. Banners hang from the bleachers. Supporters gather in the shade. Two commentators sit behind a camera, broadcasting the games live across the internet. Imran is a bowler and his side is batting, so he stands on the sideline, waiting for his chance. In his youth, he bowled at 90 miles per hour. Has he still got it? ""I try,"" he says, smiling. ""I try."" England; Australia; South Africa; West Indies; New Zealand; India; Pakistan; Sri Lanka; Zimbabwe; Bangladesh; Afghanistan*; Ireland* (Recently admitted, yet to play a Test) TheWashington Cricket League,externalis thriving. There are 42 teams in total, and new applicants are turned away each year because of a lack of pitches. Another local league, theWashington Metropolitan Cricket Board,external, has 18 clubs. For an area with barely any ""real"" pitches, it's astonishing. Most grounds are hired from schools or counties. Today's game is played on a matting wicket: when the game finishes, the matting is pulled up, and the field reverts to more ""American"" sports. Anand Patel is a 31-year-old engineering professor at Cecil College in Maryland. He moved from Gujarat in India to study at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, in 2007. He started playing for his college side - ""the cricket team was actually one of the reasons I picked the school,"" he says - and now plays for 22 Yards, Washington Tigers' opponents in the final. ""When I arrived, it was hard to get cricket equipment,"" he says. ""We were buying online, importing from India, or going to New York where they might have a vendor. ""Now, just in the state of Maryland you have at least five or six vendors."" The increase in cricket's popularity has followed a rise in immigration from the sub-continent. In 2000, the Indian immigrant population in the US was just over one million, according to theMigration Policy Institute,external. By 2015, it was 2.4 million. That sub-continental influence is clear in the Washington Cricket League. Ram Ragoo, 73 and from Trinidad, has been involved since the league began in the 1960s. Back then - aside from the embassy teams - ""most of the league was West Indian"", he says. Among them was Keith Mitchell, who studied in Washington and is nowthe prime minister of Grenada. ""Keith was the president of the league in 1981,"" says Ram, smiling. ""Really nice guy. But Reagan sent him to Grenada after the overthrow (in 1983)."" Ram, who brims with Caribbean charisma, says the league reflects the changing face of immigration. ""The Indians came in, Pakistanis came in, the Sri Lankans started coming in, and the West Indians started to go out,"" he says. ""The young West Indians didn't want to play cricket. They got 400 or 500 dollars to go and play a soccer game."" In the premier division final, most players have a sub-continental background, but other cricket-playing nations are represented. Derick Narine, the Tigers' left-handed opener, is from Guyana, as is teammate Christopher Vantull. For 22 Yards, Johan de Wet is a South African who moved to the US this summer to be with his wife. ""I arrived just before the 4 July weekend,"" he says. ""That weekend there was a big Twenty 20 tournament, I saw 22 Yards had organised it, so I gave the guys a call. ""I played my first game probably within two weeks."" What did the wife make of it? ""She is Indian so she gets it,"" says Johan, laughing. In a further example of cricket's global reach, WCL side Vikings recently renamed itself. It is now the Afghan Cricket Club of USA. While the Washington Cricket League is certainly cosmopolitan, one thing is missing: Americans from non-cricket backgrounds. ""When we were in school, once in a while you would get an American guy showing up for practice,"" says Anand Patel. ""But it's hard to get used to cricket. For them to learn how to bowl or bat is difficult, even if they've played baseball. In baseball you don't bounce the ball - here you bounce the ball."" Ram Ragoo agrees. ""I only know one or two born Americans who play the game,"" he says. ""The ICC (International Cricket Council) is trying to create (university) scholarships to get American kids involved."" For now, though, American cricket remains an immigrant-driven sport. As the big-hitting Narine scores another six, bhangra blasts out across this small corner of Maryland. Ram Ragoo and Anand Patel Helped by Narine's 71 in 39 balls, the Tigers are impressive, reaching 163-8 in their 20 overs. In reply, 22 Yards start well - nine runs from the first five deliveries - before a certain 38-year-old gets involved. Imran Awan - the Tigers captain who moved to America aged 17 - dismissed Shahid Hanif for 8. He takes another wicket in his next over and 22 Yards end up 80 all out. Imran, certainly, has still got it. The Tigers take the title, the trophy is lifted, and another cricket memory is made in this most unlikely place. It won't be the last.

'The day I met Thomas Sankara',"Becky (aged 11) meeting Thomas Sankara in Ouagadougou in 1987, shortly before his assassination One picture brings it all back home to me again: Me, an 11-year-old London school pupil, gazing up smiling into the eyes of Thomas Sankara, then president of Burkina Faso. The picture is too dark; it isn't particularly well composed - the sound engineer is in the way, getting my fellow interviewer, 14-year-old Dan Meigh, ready to film our encounter. But it's the kindly warmth in Capt Sankara's eyes as he looks back at me that takes me back; the sense of calm composure, of someone at ease with himself, and at ease with his young, potentially unpredictable young interlocutors. It's the simple furniture, the lack of opulence, the lack of Western power-dressing in favour of African fabrics and bare arms. Little did we realise at the time that we would become the last non-Africans to interview the Burkina Faso leader. On 15 October 1987, he was assassinated in a coup led by his erstwhile brother-in-arms and best friend Blaise CampaorÃ© - who went on to lead the country for the next 27 years. We had been in Burkina Faso as winners of a competition run by the BBC news programme for children, Newsround - sent to look at projects run by Sport Aid, a famine-relief fundraising campaign. The interview took place in the spartan presidential palace Hearing the news of Capt Sankara's death back home in London, as editing of our programme was still under way, I was saddened and shocked, but the shock was soon superseded by the interview requests that came flooding in from prime-time chat shows, where I was jokily quizzed about bagging a ""scoop"" at such a young age. It was only as I grew older that I began to appreciate the legendary status of the man I had interviewed - despite some criticism of his rule, his admirers remain numerous and ardent - and of the symbolism of his murder in the political context of post-colonial Africa. Thomas Sankara - 'Africa's Che Guevara' A captain in army of Upper Volta, a former French colony in West Africa Instrumental in the coup that ousted Col Saye Zerbo as president in 1982 Took power from Maj Jean-Baptiste Ouedraogo in an internal power struggle and became president in August 1983 Adopted radical left-wing policies and sought to reduce government corruption Changed the name of the country from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso, which means ""the land of upright men"" Criticised by some as an undemocratic authoritarian Killed in mysterious circumstances by a group of soldiers in October 1987, aged 37 The anti-imperialist revolutionary is still hugely popular across Africa. Thomas Sankara's legacy For Capt Sankara was pursuing a political project described as revolutionary in scope. And unlike many other African icons, such as South Africa's Steve Biko, he did - at least for a time - have the power to begin trying to make his vision a reality. I witnessed some of it for myself when I was there. As I have said, he did away with the ornaments enjoyed by many leaders. We saw few guards at the presidential residence, something Capt Sankara may have come to regret. Outside there were no luxury cars - we heard he had given them to the national lottery as prizes, replacing the fleet with cheap Renaults. One of Capt Sankara's priorities was fighting the desertification of his country. People built ""diguettes"" to fight desertification and improve crop yield He told us he wanted to make it a commonplace that everyone should plant a tree on their birthday - we planted our own. He had sent 200,000 people to plant trees and cordon off land, preventing nomadic animals from stripping the land of vegetation. We saw home-grown solutions being implemented to problems of malnutrition and poverty - for instance, people building ""diguettes"", stone walls which stop fertile topsoil running off arid agricultural land when it rains, permitting more abundant crops to be grown. Statistics suggest that the policies Capt Sankara implemented during his short four years in office yielded some startling results. Many more children went to school under Thomas Sankara's rule School attendance went from 6% to 22%, millions of children were vaccinated and 10 million trees were planted. The number of women in government soared, female genital mutilation was banned, and contraception was promoted. Like me, Lamine Konkobo, a BurkinabÃ© journalist with BBC Afrique, was only a child when Capt Sankara was killed - and, like me, he only came to fully understand his political importance as he grew up. ""I was growing up in a village where Sankara was seen as a challenging figure in terms of the ideas he promoted, in terms of women's independence and empowerment, for instance,"" he told me. ""That did not sit well in the countryside."" Capt Sankara had challenged the old centres of power in Burkina Faso: Traditional leaders and big business. So among them there was a sense of relief when his rule was over, a relief shared by Lamine's father. Most young people supported Capt Sankara, but misgivings about his rule even extended to progressive figures, including some intellectuals, who felt his quest to develop the country had an overly paternalistic, authoritarian edge. This video can not be played A look back at former Burkina Faso President Thomas Sankara's time in power President Sankara made physical exercise mandatory, for example, so he could harness the powers of the population for his projects and do it without relying on external aid. Workers accused of not pulling their weight were sometimes tried in ""revolutionary tribunals"", which were supposed to target corruption. But the perceptions of Capt Sankara changed after Mr CampaorÃ© came to power. Under President CampaorÃ©'s programme of ""rectification"", power was restored to traditional leaders and businessmen. ""Justice for Sankara"" became a rallying cry decades after his demise Opponents were assassinated and a market economy was implemented that many blamed for impoverishing the majority and enriching a tiny elite, including Mr CampaorÃ© and his own family. These changes brought about a reappraisal of Capt Sankara's achievements among many - including Lamine's father. ""After [Sankara] died, we discussed his integrity, his public service, and my dad said everyone had been defending their own interests and had not been not open enough to hear him. 'Now I understand he was much better than what we have now,' my dad said. He died a repentant man."" Although Mr CampaorÃ©, who was overthrown in 2014, erased Capt Sankara's project, ultimately he failed in his aim to erase his vision, Lamine believes. ""This is the real legacy of Thomas Sankara. The ideas he tried to promote remain despite all the efforts of Blaise CampaorÃ© to get people to forget. ""Ultimately those ideas were what spurred people to rise up in 2014 against Blaise CampaorÃ©: They confronted armed police officers and soldiers and they made their point. ""The uprising would not have been possible without young people being driven by this powerful belief within them - the belief that they were pursuing a vindication, that the regime that killed their hopes would go.""

Exploring the casting couch culture of LA,"This video can not be played On some red carpets, Harvey Weinstein is not a welcome subject The casting couch may seem like a relic of the golden age of Hollywood - but women here say sexual harassment is rife and that exploitation is a price you pay for being part of the industry. News that at least 30 women have accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting them - four alleging rape - has been met with sadness and outrage in Tinseltown. But no one seems that surprised and many expect other powerful men will be exposed. ""I think everyone is shocked - not surprised,"" says actress Rita Moreno at a Women in TV gala in Beverly Hills. Ms Moreno, now 85, urged women to tell their stories. She says she was aggressively pursued by the head of a studio when she was 19. ""It was frightening and scary."" Mr Weinstein's Oscar for Shakespeare in Love has been tarnished by reports of lewd abuses of his immense power.  But women in Hollywood say sexual harassment is common - for actresses and for women behind the scenes on film and TV sets. We interviewed dozens of people who work in front of and behind Hollywood's cameras. Almost every person reported experiencing sexism - though no one reported behaviour as severe as the allegations against Weinstein. But a culture of pervasive sexism emerged. Some are stories of producers soliciting casual sex in exchange for jobs. Most stories involved daily ridicule and disrespect. ""The casting couch is still a major issue in Hollywood many women are being victimised and are being asked for sexual favours in order to get a job, to keep a job or to be promoted,"" says attorney Gloria Allred who represents women making complaints against Weinstein. Ms Allred says she has women calling her with stories about other powerful Hollywood players. Rita Moreno, in 2016 and 1952 The organisation Women in Film has been inundated with calls after they set up a hotline for victims to report abuse this week. Women in Film's president Cathy Schulman says the revelations this week about Weinstein may be a tipping point - a chance to reform by employing more women in positions of power. ""It's a sad situation but we have to turn that into action. What angers me is women believing that they don't have the power to make change,"" says Schulman. ""What I get angry about is a system that lets them believe that they deserve to be treated this way."" Many men and women in the industry agree that more women in power would help stop the clichÃ© of powerful Hollywood executives abusing young women. Weinstein denies raping anyone and has apologised for hurting colleagues in the past.  But his company has fired him and his wife has left him. Two weeks ago he was arguably the most powerful producer in Hollywood. Today, he's reportedly seeking therapy in Arizona. While many of the women who say Weinstein harassed them are A-list actors like Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, others had their lives and Hollywood careers shattered before they began. It's worrying for the newest recruits in the business. At the Acting Corps in Los Angeles, Hollywood hopefuls warmed up with word games and improvisational exercises before their big scene. These aspiring actors have yet to catch their big break, but many of them said they fear propositions from powerful people. What it was like to work for Weinstein Harvey Weinstein's accusers How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Several male actors have also said they've been groped and hassled by powerful men in Hollywood. The abuses, they say, are about power, not gender. For years, there have been rumours about A-list actors and producers abusing children and young men in Hollywood. Stacey Morphis came to LA from England. She left a girl band after being harassed by a colleague. ""I feel like in music or movies it's all about who you know and what you're willing to do,"" she said before her acting class. ""I feel like that's the way it is and there's nothing I can do about it."" Auditions have become a little scarier for Fia Mann since news of Weinstein broke. She said auditions were already scary enough and that it's common for actors to be riddled with self-doubt and insecurities. ""Before you even step into the room - am I the right look? Are they going to like me because of this? I don't have that. But what if they ask me to dothat? I can't do that. OK, maybe I shouldn't go. ""It sounds crazy but that's literally the conversation that goes on in your head."" The allegations have brought a darker side to auditions, says Fia Mann But many people interviewed about sexism in Hollywood and Weinstein still do not want to be identified. There is still a fear about speaking out and upsetting someone who might be the ticket to your next job. A woman in the costume department said when she was bent down on her knees fixing a male actor's belt, a fellow crew member took her picture and circulated it on set. She demanded he delete it but doesn't know if he did. Female cinematographers are daily asked how they manage to carry such a heavy camera. ""That's a man's job,"" is a common jibe. Filmmaker Rachel Elder says a lighthearted Facebook group for mothers that she belongs to has transformed into a support group for sexual assault victims. She wrote about how she was sexually assaulted by her first boss in LA when she was 21. ""I'm very overwhelmed. In the last 72 hours I'm reading about all my friends writing about how they were raped and assaulted,"" she said. ""So many people are sharing really graphic stories that they've never told anyone before. You have to read it. You want to make people feel heard. It's really hard."" If more women talk about their experiences, will it really bring about change in a male-dominated industry? A lot of people in Hollywood say they are not surprised Christy Lamb is a co-founder of Moms in Film. She's worked as a producer for 13 years and also as an actress and in the art department. ""It's such a boys' club,"" she says, while on her (6pm) lunch break. ""We are usually 10% of the people working on projects."" Many say Weinstein's career is over. But Hollywood is a forgiving place and they love a comeback story. The town has forgiven men after rape before. Ms Lamb is confident that the culture has changed and that Weinstein will not be welcomed back. ""A year ago when Trump offended all women with 'Grab them by the pussy' we weirdly didn't get to execute much power,"" she says. Trump was elected, after all, with 46% of women's support. ""But in this situation we can fire him [Weinstein] and we can be sure he doesn't work again."" Ms Moreno - who has won an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy and a Tony award - says she's confident that this kind of publicity means young hopefuls in Hollywood won't go through what she did nearly seven decades ago. ""Who knows? Predators are predators,"" she said. ""It's certainly going to make them very careful, I think.""

Vauxhall to cut jobs as sales fall,"Vauxhall is cutting about 400 jobs at its Ellesmere Port car plant due to falling sales. The carmaker, now owned by France's PSA Group - maker of Peugeot and Citroen - is ""facing challenging European market conditions,"" a spokesman said. Ellesmere Port, which makes the Astra models, will move staff from two production shifts to one in early 2018. PSA said that manufacturing costs at Ellesmere were higher than other ""benchmark plants"" in the group. Vauxhall employs about 4,500 people in the UK, with about 1,800 at Ellesmere Port. The company also has a factory at Luton, which makes vans. PSA became Europe's second biggest carmaker after Volkswagen in August when it completed the purchase of Vauxhall and German brand Opel from US car giant General Motors. UK Prime Minister Theresa May personally sought assurances from PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares during a phone call in February. Last month, Mr Tavares said it was hard to decide upon the group's strategy for Vauxhall given a lack of clarity over the UK's plans to leave the European Union. This video can not be played PSA boss Carlos Tavares was asked last month about guarantees for Vauxhall-Opel workers However, a Vauxhall spokesman said the move from two shifts to one was nothing to do with Brexit uncertainty, but was about maintaining competitiveness in a changing industry. He pointed out that sales of so-called sports utility vehicles (SUVs) have grown rapidly across Europe, while the type of five-door estates and saloons made at Ellesmere Port have fallen. Earlier this year, Ellesmere was producing an annual rate of about 140,000 Astra cars. The spokesman said there will be a new-generation Astra model in the early 2020s, so Vauxhall wanted to make Ellesmere Port more productive so it can get this car contract. However, PSA's statement on Sunday suggested there would no decision until Brexit uncertainty had cleared. ""Once [PSA] has enough visibility on the future trading relationship with the EU, and the plant competitiveness has been addressed, the company will be in a position to consider future investments."" Prof David Bailey, from Aston Business School, said the shift in market trends to SUVs was only part of the problem for Ellesmere Port. He told the BBC: ""The depreciation of sterling since the Brexit vote has meant that the cost of importing components has gone up, so it's a more costly plant."" PSA's other acquisition from General Motors, Opel, employs about 33,500 staff in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Austria, Spain and Italy. Prof Bailey said the only way PSA can make the Vauxhall-Opel purchase work is by cutting costs out of the business. Tackling Ellesmere Port's competitiveness now could turn out to be a very positive move for the business, ""but it does show how vulnerable the plant is,"" he said. The Unite union said it would not comment on any job losses until it had spoken to shop stewards at Ellesmere Port on Monday.

Drone near-miss 'put 130 lives at risk',"Many airports have logged near misses between aircraft and drones A drone put 130 lives at risk when it passed directly over the wing of an aircraft approaching Gatwick Airport, a report has revealed. AUK Airprox Board,externalreport said the drone was ""flown into conflict"" with the Airbus 319 on 9 July and said there was a high risk of a collision. It said: ""A larger aircraft might not have missed it and in the captain's opinion, it had put 130 lives at risk."" An ""airprox"" is when distances between aircraft are seen to compromise safety. Former RAF and British Airways pilot Steve Landells said it was a ""worrying near-miss that could have ended in tragedy"". The plane was preparing to land and a small, black object seen by the first officer was thought at first to be a bird before it became apparent it was a drone, the report said. Twilight conditions at 20:35 BST meant the drone appeared black, or dark in colour, the report continued. ""At its closest point, it passed between the wing-tip and the fuselage, above the right wing,"" it said. Research has found drones can smash plane windscreens The plane landed safely and Gatwick police attended the incident at the West Sussex airport. The report said the drone was ""very large, certainly not a toy"", with an estimated diameter of 1m (about 3ft) and four blades. The report said the pilot's estimate of the distance, and his inability to avoid the object ""portrayed a situation where providence had played a major part"" in avoiding a collision. In July, the Department for Transport (DFT) unveiled plans for adrone registration systemafter research found drones could smash plane windscreens. Mr Landells, flight safety specialist at pilots' association Balpa, said the organisation wanted to see details of the legislation and a timescale for implementation.

The fateful life of history's most famous female spy,"On the morning of 15 October 1917 a grey military vehicle left the Saint-Lazare prison in central Paris. On board, accompanied by two nuns and her lawyer, was a 41-year-old Dutch woman in a long coat and a wide, felt hat. A decade earlier this woman had the capitals of Europe at her feet.  She was a legendary 'femme fatale' known for her exotic dancing, and her lovers included ministers, industrialists and generals. But then came the war, and the world changed. She thought she could keep charming her way around Europe. But now the men in top hats wanted something more than sex. They wanted information. And that meant spying. This was Mata Hari, and she was about to be put to death. Her crime? Being an agent in German pay, gleaning secrets from Allied officers who she slept with, and passing them on to her paymaster, leading to lurid newspaper claims about her being responsible for sending thousands of Allied soldiers to their deaths. But the evidence presented at her trial, plus other documents, cast a different light: that she was actually a double agent and may have died as a scapegoat. Now, exactly a hundred years on, new light has been shed on the most famous woman spy of all time with the release of hitherto unseen documents by the French defence ministry. These include transcripts of her interrogation by the French counter-espionage service in 1917. Some are also on display ata new exhibition at the Fries Museum in her hometown,externalof Leeuwarden in the Netherlands. Mata Hari facing the firing squad. There is doubt over this picture and it may be a still from a contemporaneous film Among the papers is the telegram to Berlin from the German military attachÃ© in Madrid which led to Mata Hari's arrest at a hotel on the Champs-Elysees, and later served as a key piece of evidence at her brief trial. Born Margarethe Zelle in 1876, Mata Hari (the name is said to come from the Indonesian for 'eye of the day' - the sun) had an extraordinary and tragic life. After a miserable marriage in the Dutch East Indies she reinvented herself as the louche diva of 'Belle Epoque' Paris, where her sensual dances were a ticket to the inner courts of European society. ""Even without the spying, Mata Hari would be remembered today because of what she did in the capitals of Europe in the early part of the last century,"" says Hans Groeneweg, curator of the Fries Museum. ""She more or less invented the striptease as a form of dance. We have her scrapbooks on display at the exhibition, and there are piles and piles of newspaper clippings and photographs. She was a celebrity socialite."" The French court's notification of Mata Hari's death sentence Sadly though, the Mata Hari myth is dominated by the espionage. Over the years many historians have come to her defence. She was sacrificed - some say - because the French needed to find a spy to explain their succession of reverses in the war. For feminists, she was the perfect scapegoat because ""loose"" morals made it easier to tar her as an enemy of France. Until now the full details of her interrogation by prosecutor Pierre Bouchardon (incidentally the man who later prosecuted Marshal Petain) has been off-limits to historians. It was known, though,  that in 1916 - after a brief sojourn in London where she wasinterrogated by the British security service, MI5,external- Mata Hari returned to France via Spain. In Madrid she made the acquaintance of Arnold von Kalle, the German military attachÃ©. Her later story was that this was all in pursuance of her prior arrangement with French intelligence, under which she undertook to use her pre-war web of German contacts to help the Allied effort. But it was von Kalle's subsequent telegram that led to her undoing. In it he set out to his masters in Berlin the details of a certain Agent H21. It gave addresses, bank details, and even the name of Mata Hari's faithful maid. There could be no question to anyone reading it that Mata Hari was agent H21. The telegram, intercepted by French intelligence, is now available for scrutiny at the Leeuwarden exhibition. Or rather, the official translation of the telegram is available. Because therein lies the rub. According to some historians, the whole telegram episode is fishy. Police photo of Mata Hari from the day of her arrest The French - it is argued - had long since cracked the code in which the telegram was written. The Germans knew the French had cracked it. And yet still von Kalle sent the message. In other words, he wanted the French to read it. So, in this theory, it was the Germans who led the French by the nose into arresting and executing their own agent. Or there is the other theory. Why is there only a translation in the archives? Where is the original telegram? Could it be that the French themselves invented the document in order to pin the blame on Mata Hari? That way they would find their ""spy"". And the public would be satisfied. Both theories make Mata Hari into a victim. One side or the other found it convenient to get rid of her, and so they did. But the French archives throw up another detail, which actually relegates these hypotheses to the junior division. Because what the transcripts also show is that in June 1917, during her umpteenth interrogation, Margarethe Zelle decided to come clean: she confessed. She told Bouchardon that yes, she had been recruited by the Germans. It was back in 1915 in The Hague. Mata Hari's brooch is just one artefact in the Fries museum's exhibition Caught outside France at the start of the war, she was desperate to get back to Paris. Karl Kroemer, German consul in Amsterdam, offered her the meansâ¦ if she would be so good as to help them with certain information from time to time. Thus was created Agent H21. Mata Hari insisted to her interrogators that she just meant to take the money and run. She said her loyalty was to the Allies, as she had shown when she subsequently promised to help French intelligence. But the evidence against her was now clear. Arriving at the Chateau de Vincennes on the eastern outskirts of Paris, Mata Hari was led to a piece of ground where a post had been erected in front of an earthen bank. Twelve soldiers formed the firing squad. Some reports say she refused to be blindfolded. As one hand was being tied to the post, with the other she made a brief wave to her lawyer. The commander lowered his sword in a swift motion, there was the sound of rifle fire, and Mata Hari crumpled to her knees. An officer approached with a revolver and shot her once through the head. After the execution, no-one came to claim Mata Hari's body. So it was delivered to the school of medicine in Paris where it was used for lessons in dissection. Her head was preserved at the Museum of Anatomy. But during an inventory some 20 years ago, it was found to have disappeared. Presumed stolen.

It is so far unclear whether the Social Democrats or the far-right Freedom Party will finish second. Short of a majority, Mr Kurz's party could seek an alliance with the anti-immigration Freedom Party. Addressing his supporters, Mr Kurz said: ""It is time for change in this country. Today is a strong order for us, to change this country, and I say thank you to you all who made this possible. ""I'm overwhelmed, I am happy, and I look forward to working for Austria."" Before the election, Mr Kurz served as Europe's youngest-ever foreign minister, after he was appointed in 2013 aged just 27. In May 2017 he became the leader of the People's Party. He began his political career in the youth wing of the party, which he chaired before moving on to serve on Vienna's city council. Nicknamed ""Wunderwuzzi"" (very roughly translated as wonder hotshot), he has been compared to the young leaders of France and Canada, Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau. Much like Mr Macron, Mr Kurz has created a movement around himself, rebranding the People's Party - which has been in power for more than 30 years - as ""The New People's Party"". Immigration was the dominant issue in the run-up to the vote, and Mr Kurz moved his party to the right in the wake of Europe's 2015 refugee crisis. He appealed to conservative and right-wing voters with pledges to shut down migrant routes to Europe, cap benefit payments to refugees, and bar immigrants from receiving benefits until they have lived in Austria for five years. Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache accuses Mr Kurz of stealing his policies The rightward shift was seen as a response to the success of the Freedom Party, which narrowly missed out on the presidency in December when Norbert Hofer was defeated by Alexander Van der Bellen, head of the Greens. The stance proved popular with Austrian voters after a huge influx of undocumented migrants and refugees from the Middle East and North Africa. The Freedom Party accused Mr Kurz of stealing their policies. Their candidate, Heinz-Christian Strache, has called him an ""imposter"". Parties clash in final TV debate Austrian ban on veil comes into force Austria's far right choose a flower with an ugly past Mr Kurz is on course to win the lion's share of the vote but not a majority. If the forecasts are correct, he will need to form a coalition, most likely with the Freedom Party. The last coalition between the Social Democrats and the conservatives fell apart this spring - and there may be reluctance to renew it. But an alliance with the populist, far-right Freedom Party could prove controversial among Austria's EU counterparts. Mr Kurz refused to discuss his plans, saying only that he would talk to other parties. He says he wants to wait for final results.

The current chancellor, Social Democrat leader Christian Kern, could lose his position after a campaign marred by several scandals, including allegations that his adviser led an online smear campaign against Mr Kurz. But Mr Kern said on Sunday he had no intention of standing down as leader, despite the party's loss. ""I have said I will stay in politics for 10 years and there are nine years to go,"" he told broadcaster ORF. After a tumultuous year with internal rifts, the pro-refugee Greens party is among several smaller parties uncertain of reaching the 4% threshold required to enter parliament.

Patients to be questioned about sexuality,"NHS England advises sexuality is recorded during ""face to face contact"" with patients Health professionals in England are to be told to ask patients aged 16 or over about their sexual orientation, under new NHS guidelines. NHS England said no-one would be forced to answer the question but recording the data would ensure that ""no patient is discriminated against"". Theguidance,externalapplies to doctors and nurses, as well as local councils responsible for adult social care. A spokeswoman said: ""It will have no impact on the care [people] receive."" She added: ""All health bodies and local authorities with responsibility for adult social care are required under the Equality Act to ensure that no patient is discriminated against."" She said the information would help NHS bodies comply with equality legislation by ""consistently collecting, only where relevant, personal details of patients such as race, sex and sexual orientation."" NHS England recommends health professionals - such as GPs and nurses -  ask about a person's sexual orientation at ""every face to face contact with the patient, where no record of this data already exists"". But the Family Doctor Association said it was ""potentially intrusive and offensive"" for GPs to monitor people's sexuality. Chairman Dr Peter Swinyard told the BBC that for older patients in particular, sexuality ""doesn't affect health outcomes or care"". He said that GPs tend to know patients' sexuality, or would ask, if it was relevant to their medical condition. For example, patients at a sexual health clinic are likely to be asked, but not those attending a wart clinic. He added: ""Given the precious short amount of time a GP has with a patient, sexuality is not relevant."" He said there were ""relatively few medical conditions"" that it affected. NHS England said the data was already being collected in many areas but that the new guidance makes it standard, and that it expects sexual orientation monitoring to be in place across England by April 2019. Under the guidance, health professionals are to ask patients: ""Which of the following options best describes how you think of yourself?"". The options include heterosexual or straight, gay or lesbian, bisexual, other sexual orientation, not sure, not stated and not known. NHS England said lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people were ""disproportionately affected"" by health inequalities such as poor mental health and a higher risk of self-harm and suicide. It said public bodies had a legal obligation to pay regard to the needs of LGB people under the Equality Act 2010. ""Collecting and analysing data on sexual orientation allows public sector bodies to better understand, respond to and improve LGB patients' service access,"" the guidance states. Paul Martin, chief executive of Manchester's LGBT Foundation, which worked with NHS England and others to develop sexual orientation monitoring, said he was ""so proud"" of the new standard. He said earlier this week: ""If we're not counted, we don't count."" The launch of sexual orientation monitoring was a ""hugely important step in the right direction"" towards addressing LGB inequality in health and social care, he said. However, the foundation's good practice guide for healthcare professionals concedes that ""some people will feel uncomfortable asking or being asked"" about their sexuality. It warns: ""It would not be appropriate to ask someone's sexual orientation out loud in a busy reception area."" If a patient does not want to disclose their sexuality, ""not stated"" would be recorded as their response. The guidance also says patients who are not able to declare their sexual orientation, for example if they require specialist mental capacity care, would be recorded as ""not known"". Former Conservative education secretary Nicky Morgan said that ""what looks good on paper... actually when translated into real life becomes very intrusive"". She toldITV's Peston on Sunday,external: ""Could it be appropriate in some circumstances about some conditions or problems that people come to see their doctors about? ""But clearly (for) the majority you wonder why on earth they need to know.""

Woody Allen 'sad' for Harvey Weinstein,"Woody Allen has worked with Harvey Weinstein, pictured together in 2008, on many films Woody Allen has described Harvey Weinstein as a ""sad, sick man"", as the producer faces sexual assault claims. His remarks came as he clarified comments to the BBC that the story was tragic for the women involved but also sad for Weinstein as his life was ""so messed up"". The film-maker added he had heard rumours but not ""these horror stories"". Weinstein wasvoted off the board behind the Oscarson Saturday following allegations from numerous women. Allen faced his own sex claims - he was accused of molesting his adopted daughter -a claim he has always strongly denied. Weinstein has been credited with reviving Allen's career after Allen was accused of abusing Dylan Farrow, his daughter with actress Mia Farrow. The allegation emerged in the early 1990s following Allen's separation from Farrow. The actress left Allen after discovering he was having an affair with her adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. Exploring the casting couch culture of LA Harvey Weinstein: The accusers' stories Women in his own words But despite working with Weinstein on a number of films - including the Oscar-winning Mighty Aphrodite - Allen said he had never heard of any allegations of rape and sexual assault. ""No-one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,"" Allen told the BBC. ""And they wouldn't, because you are not interested in it.  You are interested in making your movie. ""But you do hear a million fanciful rumours all the time.  And some turn out to be true and some - many - are just stories about this actress, or that actor."" This video can not be played On some red carpets, Harvey Weinstein is not a welcome subject ""The whole Harvey Weinstein thing is very sad for everybody involved,"" he added. ""Tragic for the poor women that were involved, sad for Harvey that [his] life is so messed up. ""There's no winners in that, it's just very, very sad and tragic for those poor women that had to go through that."" Allen later expanded on his comments in a statement quoted byVariety magazine,external. ""When I said I felt sad for Harvey Weinstein I thought it was clear the meaning was because he is a sad, sick man,"" he said. ""I was surprised it was treated differently. Lest there be any ambiguity, this statement clarifies my intention and feelings."" Allen said earlier in the BBC interview he hoped the revelations, which emerged after an investigation by the New York Times, would lead to ""some amelioration"". He said it was important to avoid ""a witch hunt atmosphere"" where ""every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself"". The star added that his hope was that recent developments could be ""transformed into a benefit for people rather than just a sad or tragic situation"". Among those who investigated Weinstein were Allen's own son, Ronan Farrow, who spoke to 13 women who said the producer had sexually harassed or assaulted them. Weinstein, 65, insists any sexual contacts he had were consensual.

MPs can stop no-deal Brexit - McDonnell,"Leaving the EU without a deal was ""not a realistic option"", Mr McDonnell claimed Parliament can stop the UK leaving the EU without negotiating a deal, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said. There was not a Commons majority for such an outcome, he told the BBC, and Labour would work with other parties to stop the ""damage"" it would cause. He urged ministers to ""come to their senses"" and publish legal advice about what was owed in financial liabilities. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the UK will ""succeed come what may"" but he was confident of a ""sensible deal"". Dismissing Mr McDonnell's comments as ""complete nonsense"", he told the Andrew Marr show on BBC One that it was a ""legal reality"" that the UK would be leaving at the end of March 2019 after Article 50 was triggered earlier this year. Meanwhile, Brexit minister Robin Walker has suggested the three million citizens of other EU countries currently living in the UK will be able to stay regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, telling Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live ""yes, people will be allowed to stay"". UK will 'grow more' food if no Brexit deal What are the Brexit options? EU 'to prepare for Brexit trade talks' Prime Minister Theresa May has said she believes the two sides will reach a deal but the UK must prepare for all eventualities. As it stands, the UK will leave the EU in March 2019 whether it agrees a deal on the terms of withdrawal or not. But Mr McDonnell said he could ""not countenance"" such a situation and Parliament had the power to force the government to conceded a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of exit, by amending the EU Withdrawal Bill or other relevant legislation related to Brexit. This video can not be played What practical steps are being taken to prepare for the possibility of no deal? ""I don't think no deal is a realistic option,"" he said. ""There are enough sensible people in the House of Commons to say 'this cannot happen, we cannot damage our country in this way'."" Urging ministers to stop ""fighting"" among themselves and focus on what was best for the economy, he added: ""They should come to their senses, behave responsibly and look after the interests of the country."" He called on ministers to publish legal advice about the size of the so-called divorce bill, saying the UK should honour its obligations but the final figure should not be anywhere near the Â£60bn quoted in some quarters. The government has appointed a Brexit ""contingency minister"" and will spend Â£250m this year on preparing for the UK's exit, including the possibility of it leaving without an official deal. Speaking on the same programme, Mr Grayling said talks were always going to be ""long and challenging"" and it was fanciful to suggest the two sides would ""shake hands and do a deal in half an hour"". The airline industry was confident things would continue as normal, Mr Grayling said While he believed that the two sides would ultimately reach agreement, he said Labour was wrong to argue for a deal in any circumstances and he was not personally afraid of the UK leaving the EU without one. ""Britain will succeed come what may but I don't think we will come to that. I think we will agree a sensible trading partnership... because it is in both of our interests for this to happen."" He rejected suggestions that flights would be grounded - as one major airline has suggested - in the event of a no-deal Brexit, insisting ""people will be able to carry on making their bookings"". Asked about reported cabinet divisions, Mr Grayling said ministers were ""not clones"" but there was a spirit of collaboration and Philip Hammond, criticised in recent days for being too gloomy, should remain as chancellor. Amid talk of supporters of a ""soft Brexit"" joining forces to put pressure on the government, ex-Tory education secretary Nicky Morgan said most MPs wanted ""a sensible deal that protects our economy and supports jobs"". While the UK would be ""resilient"" whatever happened, she told ITV's Peston on Sunday that she was dismayed that some of her colleagues were talking up a no-deal Brexit as a ""favourable outcome"".

Austrians vote in watershed election,"Sebastian Kurz has taken the conservatives further to the right Austrians are voting in a general election in which the frontrunner, conservative People's Party (ÃVP) leader Sebastian Kurz, is just 31. The far-right Freedom Party (FPÃ) and Social Democrats are competing for second place, opinion polls suggest. The Social Democrats led the outgoing coalition with the ÃVP. Immigration has been a dominant issue in the campaign and the FPÃ is thought to have its best chance in years of returning to government. The party narrowly missed out on the presidency in December when Norbert Hofer was defeated by Alexander Van der Bellen, head of the Greens, who won with about 53% of the votes. The election comes amid anxiety in Europe over the huge influx of undocumented migrants and refugees in 2015, which fuelledan electoral breakthrough by the far right in neighbouring Germanylast month. Parties clash in final TV debate Austrian ban on veil comes into force Austria country profile If the polls are correct, a political shake-up could be on the cards in Austria, the BBC's Bethany Bell reports from Vienna.

Their candidate, Heinz-Christian Strache, has called him an ""imposter"". If his party wins, as polls suggest it will, Mr Kurz would become the youngest leader in Europe, and analysts say his party is likely to form a coalition with the FPÃ. Mr Kern warned on Saturday that the country ""was at the most important crossroads in decades"". His own party has been struggling after several scandals including an online smear campaign against Mr Kurz. The party's campaign focused on economic growth, jobs and social justice. After a tumultuous year with internal rifts, the pro-refugee Greens are among several smaller parties uncertain of reaching the 4% vote threshold required to enter parliament. Austria's far right choose a flower with an ugly past FPÃ leader Heinz-Christian Strache accuses Mr Kurz of stealing his policies Traditionally, the winning party is tasked with forming the next government which, since the 1980s, has been a coalition with one of the other parties.

A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Conjoined twins survive epic journey,"The family lives in a remote village in western Democratic Republic of Congo, in Africa Conjoined twins born in a remote village in the Democratic Republic of Congo have survived a 15-hour journey on the back of a motorbike to be separated. They were then flown to the capital, Kinshasa, where they were operated on by a team of volunteer surgeons. In total, the one-week-old girls had to endure an 870-mile (1,400km) round trip across jungle, on treacherous roads and by air. The twins are now being monitored. The babies - Anick and Destin - will return to their village in three weeks. They were born at 37 weeks in August, were joined at the navel, sharing some internal organs. Conjoined twin girls Anick and Destin survived their birth before being separated About one in every 200,000 live births results in conjoined twins and their survival is never certain, especially in remote areas where no medical help is available. But to the astonishment of doctors, these twins were born naturally in the village of Muzombo, in the west of the African country. Realising that the babies needed surgery, their parents Claudine Mukhena and Zaiko Munzadi wrapped the babies in a blanket and set off on an epic journey through jungle to their nearest hospital in Vanga. Without the equipment or experience to carry out the complex separation surgery in the small hospital, doctors transferred them to a hospital in Kinshasa more than 300 miles away. An emergency plane flew the family to the capital city for surgery To get there, the family was flown by MAF, a humanitarian airline which operates in remote regions, rather than risk another long journey over dangerous roads. Dr Junior Mudji, who is now caring for them at Vanga Evangelical Hospital, said he was delighted. ""At 37 weeks, conjoined twins born naturally - it's unheard of,"" he said. ""They are doing fine, they sleep well and eat well. In general, they are doing well. ""We will keep them here for three more weeks to be sure everything is normal."" Dr Mudji believes the operation was the first to separate conjoined twins in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Forty dead as California blazes worsen,"This video can not be played It's the most lethal outbreak of wildfires in California's history Forty people have died and hundreds are still missing in California after six days of wildfires that have devastated swathes of countryside and destroyed thousands of homes. California's governor said it was ""one of the greatest tragedies"" the state had ever faced. More than 10,000 firefighters are battling 16 remaining blazes. Winds of up to 70 km/h (45mph) brought them to new towns, forcing many more people to evacuate. One of the worst-affected areas is the city of Santa Rosa, in the Sonoma wine region, where 3,000 people were evacuated on Saturday. ""The devastation is just unbelievable,"" Governor Jerry Brown said on a visit to the city. ""It is a horror that no one could have imagined.""

Mick Fleetwood: 'I'm not a good drummer',"Mick Fleetwood backstage at Top of the Pops in 1969 Mick Fleetwood is the backbone of the band that bears his name; the man who kept Fleetwood Mac rolling through the best and hardest of times. In the early days he was their manager, hiring and firing musicians like a soft rock Alan Sugar. By the late 70s, he was the bandage that stopped them falling apart amidst drug abuse, infidelity and betrayal. And sitting behind his ""back to front"" drum kit, Fleetwood is the band's beating heart, constructing dozens of unforgettable rhythms - from the syncopated shuffle ofGo Your Own Way,external, to the fidgety cowbell riff ofOh Well,external. But surprisingly, the 70-year-old doesn't rate his own drumming. ""There's no discipline,"" he says. ""I can't do the same thing every night."" Anyone who's listened to the deluxe edition of Fleetwood Mac's Tusk will know otherwise. There, you can hear multiple outtakes from thetitle track,external, with Fleetwood sitting doggedly on the song's distinctive groove for more than 25 minutes. Still, he insists: ""I am very not conformed, I change all the time."" The star says he can't play a rhythm the same way twice The confession is prompted by a discussion about Fleetwood's lavish new picture book, Love That Burns, which chronicles his early career and the first incarnations of Fleetwood Mac. It's being released 50 years after the band played their first show: A 20-minute set at the Windsor Jazz & Blues Festival alongside artists like Cream, Pink Floyd and Jeff Beck. Back then, they were a hard-edged blues combo, working under the guidance of guitarist Peter Green - who, like Fleetwood and bassist John McVie, had previously played in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Green called the group Fleetwood Mac ""because I knew I was probably going to leave,"" he later recalled, adding: ""I always wanted Mick and John to have a job."" Review: Bruce Springsteen's Broadway show Suzi Quatro: Rock's female role model Is Belinda Carlisle still in Heaven? A strange encounter with St Vincent In the late 60s, the band enjoyed hits withAlbatross,external,Oh Well,externalandBlack Magic Woman,external(later covered by Santana) before the ominousThe Green Manilishi,externalpresaged Green's descent into drug-induced psychosis. It's a period of the band's history that's frequently overshadowed by their wildly-successful 70s incarnation, the one that produced Rumours and Tusk, and that's what Fleetwood hopes to correct in the new book. ""Theother thingis so big and so famous that this [story] could just get swallowed up,"" he says, ""I'm happy that at least there's something that says, 'Hey, this is how it all started.'"" Fleetwood says researching the pictures for his new book brought back unexpected memories As the story begins, the young Fleetwood is a three-time runaway from boarding school, who's been cut loose by his parents and is barrelling around London in a second-hand taxi, dropping in and out of blues bands as he learns his craft. ""In those days, if you had a drum kit that was worth something it was almost more important than if you were a half-way decent drummer,"" he laughs. ""So if you had the drumsandthe taxi it was like, 'Yeah, let's give him the gig!'"" One of his first paid jobs was with The Cheynes, who were hired as the backing band for visiting blues legend Sonny Boy Williamson when he played London's Marquee Club. Unprepared for Williamson's tendency to improvise, the band completely lost their way and got a ""monumental scolding"" in front of the audience. After bouncing between gigs for a couple of years, Fleetwood ended up in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, replacing their previous drummer, Aynsley Dunbar. ""Aynsley is a brilliant drummer,"" says Fleetwood. ""Technically, he's in a whole different league than I am, but he was probably getting a bit too clever. ""The band didn't want any more drum solos, so he was out and I was in."" That didn't go down well with the audience, however, who started chanting ""Where's Aynsley?"" every night. ""And I always remember, in the early days, John [McVie] came to my rescue and basically came to the microphone and told them to shut up."" An early line-up of Fleetwood Mac (L-R): Peter Green, John Mcvie, Jeremy Spencer, Mick Fleetwood and Danny Kirwan It was a beginning of a beautiful friendship. Fleetwood and McVie not only gave their names to Fleetwood Mac, but they are the only constants in the band's ever-changing line-up. In the book, Fleetwood says of McVie: ""Musically, he helped me survive whenever I was drowning."" And it's this comment that prompts the revelation about the drummer's supposed lack of skill. ""For a while, he thought he could train me into doing the same bass drum pattern every night but I couldn't... because of the way my mind works,"" he explains, ""so John learned to push all his notes around what I do."" ""It's become this weird thing. It's not really how a rhythm section should work. They're supposed to be doing exactly the same thing at the same time. I'm doing different stuff and he's falling in between the gaps."" After three years of success, Fleetwood Mac's future was jeopardised when Green quit, giving away most of his earnings in the process. The guitarist's mental health deteriorated soon after, and he was eventually diagnosed with drug-induced schizophrenia, spending long periods in psychiatric hospitals and undergoing electroconvulsive therapy. ""I don't know why I left the group in the end,"" Green writes in Fleetwood's book. ""I know that people looked at me like I was in a dream. I could tell that, even at the time."" Mick Fleetwood: ""Even after Peter left, we didn't realise how serious it had become"" Fleetwood describes Green's decline with tenderness and regret. It's clear he still feels responsible, in some way, for not spotting his friend's illness sooner. ""I wish we had been better equipped,"" he tells me. ""Maybe we could have seen something that could've helped - not to keep him in the band, but to help this person through the beginnings of a very emotional ride that, really, he's still on as we speak. ""It affected his life in a very dramatic way,"" he adds. ""I don't think he was treated right for what turned out to be his illness, but he's healthy now and doing ok. I'm going to go and see him on Sunday, in fact."" After Green left, Fleetwood Mac floundered for a while, before recruiting John's wife Christine McVie - who was already a solo star in her own right. She went on to write some of the band's most memorable songs -Songbird,Don't Stop,external,Over My Head,external- and remains part of the line-up today. But the band's fortunes really turned around in 1974, when they were joined by two young American singers, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. It's at this point that Love That Burns draws to a close. Fleetwood says there are plans for a Volume Two, which promises to go behind-the-scenes on Rumours, the seventh best-selling studio album of all time, and one which was recorded as the personal lives of Fleetwood Mac's five members unravelled. ""That will be a big monster,"" laughs Fleetwood. ""I don't know when we're going to do it, but that story needs to be told.""

Inflation 'to cause Â£300 benefit squeeze',"Benefit freezes combined with the predicted rise in inflation could set some low-income households back Â£300 next year, a think tank has warned. September's inflation data will be released on Tuesday, and some analysts predict the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be 2.9%. The Resolution Foundation says loss of income due to benefit freezes would be Â£225 for a single parent in work. It says the chancellor should ""ease the squeeze"" on benefit households. September inflation data is normally used to adjust benefits and tax thresholds the following April. The think tank's research indicated that Chancellor Philip Hammond's benefit freeze, which will begin its third out of four years in 2018, will hit working families the hardest. Its analysis says: ""2018 is set to be the year the freeze bites deepest. Should CPI hit 2.9% on Tuesday, the freeze will save [the Treasury] Â£1.8bn next year."" The Resolution Foundation's analysis found that a single unemployed person would be Â£115 worse off, a single parent in work with one child would be Â£225 worse off, and a single earner couple with two children would be Â£305 worse off. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said Mr Hammond should use his upcoming Budget to ""ease the squeeze on low and middle income families not make it worse"". But he added: ""Government policy is currently set to do the opposite, freezing the value of crucial support that 11 million families receive. With inflation approaching 3%, families are on course for the biggest real-terms cut in the value of their benefits for decades."" The Resolution Foundation is calling on the chancellor to thaw the benefit freeze and allow working age benefits to rise in line with CPI next April.

Disabled child hate crimes increasing,"Reported hate crimes against disabled children are rising, a BBC investigation has discovered. Figures from police forces across the UK show there were 450 incidents reported last year, up from 181 in 2014-15, 5 live Investigates found. Families with disabled children described being targeted online and verbally abused in the street. The Home Office said the rise was due to better reporting and more victims willing to come forward. Bethan Germon's 23-month-old daughter Lydia has hydrocephalus, or water on the brain, which causes her head to swell. It means at one point Lydia's head was double its natural size. She also has cerebral palsy and is fed through a tube. ""You see a really ugly side of people online to the point where they say they wish she was dead or why don't we kill her,"" Bethan said. ""The online commenting has easily been the worst and my husband has actually made sure that I come offline for a couple of days when things have been said. ""He really does try to protect me as much as he can."" The 29-year-old from Swansea said that while the family was most regularly targeted through social media, abuse was also doled out in the street. ""Some of my friends have had the word cabbage used against their children. ""This isn't unusual for us."" Bethan Germon on a trip out with daughters Lydia and Caitlin and husband David A disability hate crime is defined as anything from online abuse to physical violence in which the victim was targeted because of their disability. 5 live Investigates sent Freedom of Information requests to all 45 police forces in the UK, to find out how often these incidents were happening, and 29 of them provided full responses. Overall the number of disability hate crimes increased by 101%, from 1,531 in 2014-15, to 3,079 in 2016-17. But the crimes against children increased at an even greater rate. The incidents reported to police range from verbal and online abuse to arson and even violent, physical attacks. Amanda Batten of the Disabled Children's Partnership said the findings echo a new survey it carried out of nearly 2,700 parents of disabled children which revealed hate crime and abuse was commonplace. ""Families often feel like they can't go into busy public spaces or post images onto social media for fear of being publicly shamed or having to be submitted to people telling them that their child must lack quality of life because of their disability. ""The idea that so many parents and children with a disability are facing such a lack of support and outright abuse from the general public is truly heart breaking."" The Crown Prosecution Service for England and Wales has seen year on year rises in prosecutions and convictions for disability hate crime. A Home Office spokesman said: ""All forms of hate crime are completely unacceptable and the UK has some of the strongest laws in the world to tackle it. ""Our hate crime action plan has improved the response of law enforcement and the criminal justice system to these horrendous attacks. ""We are still concerned that disability hate crime is significantly under-reported by victims, and that is why the government is working with community groups to raise awareness of how to report it amongst, disabled people, their carers and families."" 5 live Investigates: Hate Crimes against Disabled Children is broadcast on Sunday 15 October at 11:00 BST.
