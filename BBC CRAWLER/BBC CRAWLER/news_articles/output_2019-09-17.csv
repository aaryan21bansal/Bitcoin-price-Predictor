"Global likes for plumber's Â£0 boiler billBurnley plumber gains worldwide attention for not charging an elderly customer ""under any circumstances"".UK","James Anderson says his work has received a ""boost"" from international attention A not-for-profit plumbing company in Burnley has earned worldwide attention after it refused to charge an elderly customer for work on her boiler. A receipt for the work shows a 91-year-old woman with leukaemia would not be charged ""under any circumstances"". The receipt was shared on social media by the woman's daughter in the past week and has since been liked hundreds of thousands of times. Plumber James Anderson says he hopes to expand his altruism across the UK. James is originally from Liverpool, where he was a bin man before he became a plumber in 1998. He has been running Depher - Disabled & Elderly Plumbing and Heating Emergency Repair - as a not-for-profit plumbing company since March 2017. ""There are too many elderly and disabled people suffering in silence,"" he explains. ""They don't like asking for help. They don't want to be a burden. ""We take away the burden, the stigma."" Speaking to the BBC, James says the company's work ""stops them getting into debt"" and helps them regain an independence they fear they may lose ""if they think they can't afford repair costs"". The love letters returned after 70 years Your tips for staying positive Why this 89-year-old is visiting every US national park with her grandson Despite running up debts for such a selfless ethos, James says he will keep doing it until ""the day God calls me"". He now owes ""just under Â£8,000"" but the situation is ""under control,"" because of his arrangements with both his bank and his supplier. The company also has a crowdfunding page, and performs regular plumbing jobs: ""Any money we make goes back into the Depher account"". James says he had to lay off two workers because of a lack of funds. He wants to expand the philanthropic work beyond Burnley, and the attention brought by the receipt could help. ""I've got other plumbers... offering help. My hope is to get Depher national, in every city and town."" ""We need to be a human race, to look out for each other,"" says James, pictured with his daughter James was not initially aware of his note being shared online. ""I was at my grandson's christening,"" he says. ""I got a couple of likes and cheers on Sunday,"" but since then the reaction has been ""absolutely global"". He has been taking calls from as far away as Germany and the US, and from international broadcasters, talking about his aims to help those in need. ""It's going to give it a boost,"" he adds. But he's reluctant to take all the credit, calling his actions ""a community effort"". ""We all do what we can and we all come together as a community.

Flamingo Land withdraw Loch Lomond resort bid,"An artist's impression of how the development at Loch Lomond would look Flamingo Land has formally withdrawn its planning application to build a Â£30m tourist resort on Loch Lomond. The move comes after officials for the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority recommended its boardreject the bidearlier this month. More than 55,000 objections were lodged against the Lomond Banks development between April and May. But the team behind the project have not ruled out submitting a fresh application at a later date. Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer, who led the campaign against the plans, tweeted: ""We've won this battle but it's not over. ""They will resubmit, in a transparent attempt to cancel the 57,000 objections lodged against them this time."" Plans for Â£30m tourist development at Loch Lomond Why did 55,000 people object to Loch Lomond development plans? Flamingo Land Ltd and Scottish Enterprise confirmed that they had informed the National Park Authority they collectively wished to withdraw the live planning application. Andy Miller, director of Lomond Banks, said: ""We've been working hard with all parties, including the National Park Authority, for more than two years to ensure all information relating to the proposed development was made readily available. ""We know the national park recognises that the majority of what we propose fits in with the LDP [local development plan]. ""It is therefore surprising and disappointing that their recommendation report raises previously unidentified concerns and highlights the need for new additional information."" A hotel, lodges and ""glamping pods"" formed part of the plan for the site at Balloch He said the move would grant the team sufficient time to understand new concerns, provide additional information requested and consider the most appropriate course of action. Mr Miller added: ""Our priority now is to fully understand concerns, gather the necessary information and dispel some of the myths that continue to circulate around our ambitions for the site. ""It is only at this point, we will consider re-submitting our plans to ensure decision makers will be able to take a fully informed decision on this important application."" A park authority spokeswoman said that a ""significant amount of time and resource"" went into assessing the application and the report which recommended refusal. She said: ""It is ultimately the applicants' decision not to continue with this process. ""While land within this application site has been identified as suitable for tourism development, it is crucial that any new development protects the character of the existing landscape and the natural and built environment, while making a positive contribution to area as an international tourism destination."" The final say on the development rested with the park authority - not West Dunbartonshire Council. The proposals included a 60-bedroom apart-hotel, a 32-bedroom budget accommodation, a craft brewery, boat house, leisure centre and restaurants. Allow Twitter content?

Scottish Enterprise director Allan McQuade said: ""Any proposed plan and investment of this scale must be considered from all angles and subsequent planning and investment decisions based on hard evidence and fact therefore it is only right that the current planning application be withdrawn to allow sufficient time for all parties to consider additional new information. ""As with previous developments at Loch Lomond, we understand people are concerned and our priority is to ensure that any development on the parcel of derelict land in Balloch is delivered in line with planning policy."" It was estimated the Lomond Banks development at Balloch would create 80 full-time jobs, 50 part-time jobs and 70 seasonal roles in the area. While the proposal was drawn up by the theme-park operator, it was not branded as Flamingo Land. The developers have previously insisted the resort would not be a theme park. Campaigners feared the project would spoil the scenery and limit access to the shoreline for locals. The plans were drawn up Flamingo Land but the Loch Lomond development would not carry the theme park's name. Apark authority report,externalnoted that the plan ""has not demonstrated that there will be no adverse impacts on the character or integrity"" of the existing asset. It stated: ""Two key elements of the application - proposals in Drumkinnon Wood and at the Pierhead area - would result in significant unacceptable impacts on the landscape, visual amenity, and trees and woodland. ""As a result, the proposed development would adversely affect the area's built heritage and the enjoyment of the Pierhead area by both visitors and locals. ""There are no socio-economic reasons, or public benefits that would outweigh these reasons. It is also not considered that the use of planning conditions could reasonably control or mitigate these impacts."" Why did 55,000 object to Loch Lomond plans? Do you know this pooch?

Saudi oil attack drones launched in Iran - US officials,"This video can not be played Abqaiq has the world's largest oil processing plant The US has reportedly identified locations in Iran from which drones and cruise missiles were launched against major Saudi oil facilities on Saturday. Senior US officials told media outlets that the locations were in southern Iran, at the northern end of the Gulf. Saudi air defences did not stop the drones and missiles because they were pointed southwards, to prevent attacks from Yemen, they added. Iran denies involvement in the attacks, which disrupted global oil supplies. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi rebels said they had launched the drones that struck the Abqaiq oil processing plant, the world's largest, and the Khurais oilfield. They have launched attacks into Saudi Arabia before, but US officials said on Sunday they believed the drones and missiles did not originate from the south or south-west, and instead were launched from the north or north-west. Who's using armed drones in the Middle East? Images show detail of attacks on Saudi oil sites Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has called the attack a reciprocal act by the ""Yemeni people"". Oil prices soared 20% after the attacks, at one point reaching $71.95 (Â£57.53) a barrel. But they have since pared their gains as it appeared market disruption would not be as bad as feared. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia's energy minister said he expected production to be fully back online by the end of the month, adding that half the production at the damaged facilities had already been restored. Oil price falls as Saudi Arabia calms supply fears Brent crude - the international benchmark used by traders - was trading at about $64 (Â£51.20) after the announcement. A senior US official told CBS News that a US team had been on the ground at Abqaiq,externaland identified specific drones and missiles used in the attacks. This wreckage will be analysed and used to present ""a very compelling forensic case"" that Iran was responsible, the report says. Vice-President Mike Pence said on Tuesday the US was ""evaluating all the evidence"", and that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was en route to Saudi Arabia ""to discuss our response"". He added: ""The United States of America will take whatever action is necessary to defend our country, our troops, and our allies in the Gulf. You can count on it."" One of the US government's satellite images showing damage at the world's biggest oil-processing facility Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted that ""Yemeni victims"" were responsible for the attacks,external, saying that blaming Iran would not change the situation and saying the US was ""in denial"". Ending the war was the ""only solution for all,"" he added. Attack on Saudis destabilises already volatile region The huge US oil stash hidden in underground caves And in a televised address, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed talks ""at any level"" with the US, saying any dialogue could only happen if the US ""takes back its words and repents"" after withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. Earlier this year,President Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of the landmark agreementthat had limited Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The president told reporters on Tuesday he was not ruling out meeting Mr Rouhani at UN, as has been previously suggested, but added that he would ""prefer not meeting him"". He also said he would be willing to use the US strategic oil reserves if need be. ""I don't believe I need to, but if we want to use strategic oil reserves, I would open them up,"" he said. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson meanwhile has condemned the attacks and spoken of his support for Saudi Arabia, telling Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman there was a need to ""establish the facts of what happened"" and reiterating ""the importance of a collective response"", a spokeswoman said. This is the strongest claim yet from the Americans that the attacks against the Saudi oil facilities were launched from Iran itself. No corroborating evidence or intelligence has yet been provided. But if true, it takes the Gulf crisis to a more dangerous level and it demonstrates a new threshold of brinkmanship by the Iranian authorities. It also raises the question: what response, if any, is required? For past US presidents the security of oil supplies in the Gulf was an absolute priority. But for the ""locked and loaded"" Donald Trump, for all his bluster and apparent affinity with the Saudi royal family, this is not necessarily the case. There is no treaty relationship between Washington and Riyadh, and the Saudis are increasingly unpopular on Capitol Hill. The arguments for a response run both ways. If Iran's alleged escalation is not met by firm action, it might only embolden Tehran to go further. But the attacks have demonstrated Saudi Arabia's extraordinary vulnerability. In any protracted conflict it would be very much in the line of fire. For the White House this is a strategic dilemma with no easy answers. The attacks targeted Abqaiq - run by the Saudi state oil company, Aramco - and the Khurais oilfield. Khurais is the closest of the targets to the Yemen border, but is still a considerable 770km (480 miles) away. US officials said there were 19 points of impact on the targets, which could have come from a mix of drones and cruise missiles. The Houthis have repeatedly launched rockets, missiles and drones at populated areas in Saudi Arabia, attacks which have left at least four civilians dead. The conflict in Yemen escalated in March 2015, when the Houthis took control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Soon after, Saudi Arabia and its allies launched an air campaign in a bid to restore Mr Hadi's government. The UN says at least 7,290 civilians have died and 80% of the population - 24 million people - need humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive.

Israeli election result too close to call,"Exit polls suggest no clear route to government for Benjamin Netanyahu or Benny Gantz Unofficial results in Israel's second election in five months suggest it is too close to call, Israeli media say. Incumbent PM Benjamin Netanyahu's party and that of his main challenger, Benny Gantz, are neck and neck with 32 seats each, the Kan public broadcaster says. A prime minister needs to command a 61-seat majority in parliament. The smaller Yisrael Beiteinu party appears to hold the balance of power. Official partial results are expected on Wednesday. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, has been in office for 10 years and is vying to win a record fifth term in office. The 69-year-old, who leads the right-wing Likud party, has pledged to annex Jewish settlements and a swathe of other territory in the occupied West Bank if he is returned to power. This video can not be played Netanyahu's situation is ""dire"", says biographer Anshel Pfeffer Palestinians, who seek a state in the West Bank and Gaza, with its capital in occupied East Jerusalem, have warned such a move will kill any hopes for peace. Mr Gantz, who leads the centrist Blue and White party, has not advocated any form of annexation though his position on the creation of a Palestinian state is unclear. Like Mr Netanyahu, he has ruled out ever dividing Jerusalem, which Israel considers its capital. On Wednesday morning, Yisrael Beiteinu's leader Avigdor Lieberman, reiterated that he would only support a government comprising both Likud and Blue and White. However, Blue and White has ruled out sitting with Mr Netanyahu in a coalition. Official results have been slow to be released, with only 30% of votes counted by 09:15 (06:15 GMT). They put Likud slightly ahead of Blue and White, with the ultra-Orthodox Shas party third and Yisrael Beiteinu fourth, but without indicating how this translates into seats in the Knesset (parliament). According to the Times of Israel, Kan is reporting unofficial results based on what it says is 96.9% of votes counted. It puts Likud and Blue and White both on 32 seats; the Israeli Arab Joint List second on 12 seats; Yisrael Beiteinu on nine; the ultra-Orthodox parties on 17 between them; the right-wing Yamina alliance on seven; Labour-Gesher on 6 and the centre-left Democratic Camp on 5. Based on these reported results, neither Mr Netanyahu nor Mr Gantz can form a majority coalition without support from Yisrael Beiteinu. Exit polls earlier presented a similar picture. Analysis by Tom Bateman, BBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The prime minister is well short of being able to form a governing bloc of right-wing and religious parties that are prepared to sit with him. In fact the result leaves him in an even weaker position than he was after April's vote. It's almost impossible to predict the outcome, with frenetic horse trading on the way, even the chance of parties fragmenting or politicians shifting allegiances. But as it stands three broad themes seem among the possibilities: A dominant new governing bloc of the two big rival parties: Likud with Blue and White. This only seems possible without Mr Netanyahu as Likud leader. Needless to say that's a deal breaker for him and so far at least, for his party Mr Netanyahu's political rival Avigdor Lieberman miraculously changes his mind and agrees to join a right-wing and religious Netanyahu government - something his voters understood would never happen A third election - which nobody here has an appetite for. In the meantime, Mr Netanyahu stays on, but watch this space. For a few weeks. There was a muted response at Likud's election night headquarters in Tel Aviv. Hundreds of chairs for party supporters remained empty, as activists were kept outside the hall and leaders digested the numbers. Likud's foreign affairs director noted that Israeli exit polls had got things wrong in the past. Last time, they underestimated the number of votes for Likud and also for some of the religious parties allied to Mr Netanyahu. Most important things to know about Israel's election Bowen: A referendum on Netanyahu ""There is no point starting to work out a coalition based on these numbers as they will change,"" Eli Hazan said. But Blue and White was ""cautiously optimistic"" that Israel would get new leadership,spokeswoman Melody Sucharewicz told the Times of Israel,external. The BBC's Tom Bateman says that if the projections are correct Mr Netanyahu has no simple route to government. In fact, the figures put him in an even weaker position than after April's election, when coalition talks collapsed, he adds. Avigdor Lieberman says he wants a ""broad, liberal, national government"" Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Benny Gantz: The Israeli ex-military chief challenging Netanyahu Mr Lieberman prevented Mr Netanyahu from forming a coalition after that vote because he refused to back down over a longstanding dispute with religious parties over exempting ultra-Orthodox young men from military service. Mr Gantz could have an even more complex job to form a government, because of differences between left-wing parties.

Labour would 'carry out' further referendum result,"This video can not be played I want the people to have a choice, says Jeremy Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has refused to say which side he might back in a future Brexit referendum under a Labour government. He said he would offer voters a choice between Remain and a deal negotiated by Labour, and deliver the outcome. Pushed on whether he would personally support Leave or Remain, he refused to commit, saying instead: ""As PM, my job will be to bring people together."" His remarks come ahead of Labour's conference where he is expected to face increasing pressure to back Remain. According to campaign group Another Europe is Possible, more than 80 motions have been submitted by local Labour groups for debate at conference in Brighton calling for the party to back Remain in a future public vote. Mr Corbyn's apparently neutral stance has beenopenly challenged by First Minister of Wales Mark Drakefordon Wednesday. He said Welsh Labour ""must and will campaign to remain in the EU"". Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Labour must unequivocally back Remain, says deputy What's Corbyn's thinking on Brexit? A number of shadow cabinet members, including shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and shadow chancellor John McDonnell, have said they would campaign for Remain. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has called for another public vote on Brexit before any general election, but Mr Corbyn has said an election should come first. A parallel is being drawn with Harold Wilson, who allowed Labour ministers to campaign for either side in the 1975 Common Market referendum while arguing for the UK to stay in Mr Corbyn said Labour was the only party offering a choice and he would be asking the Labour conference to ""realise the importance of giving the people a choice"". ""I want the people to have a choice between the offer of remaining in the EU and the offer of an agreement with the EU which will give us a trade relationship, which will give us a customs union, will give us rights, consumer rights, workers rights and environmental standards. ""My job, as prime minister, will be to deliver that option that is chosen by the British people."" Earlier this week,the Liberal Democrats agreed a new manifesto pledgethat if they won a majority government in a next election, they would scrap Brexit altogether without another vote. But their leader, Jo Swinson, said they would continue to call for another referendum alongside other opposition parties until an election was called. Mr Corbyn initially outlined his position in an interview with the Guardian where he repeated Labour's four sticking points for a ""sensible"" deal with the EU - a new customs union, a close single market relationship, guarantees of workers' rights and promises on environmental protections. Once these were secured, he said they would put that deal to a vote against Remain. This video can not be played Emily Thornberry has said she would back Remain in another referendum. Mr Corbyn said the pledge made Labour ""the only UK-wide party ready to put our trust in the people of Britain"". He said Boris Johnson wanted to ""crash out"" of the EU without a deal, while the new position of the Lib Dems would be a ""parliamentary stitch-up"" and ""simply undemocratic"". But Michael Chessum, national organiser for Another Europe is Possible, said Labour members were the party's ""secret weapon"" at a general election, and Mr Corbyn ""ignores them at its peril"". ""Support for an explicit Remain stance is evidently overwhelming,"" he said. ""Only if Labour can get clarity on this part of its policy can it fight the election on its domestic agenda."" Jeremy Corbyn's political opponents - externally and internally - are already satirising him on social media. They say that he's even sitting on the fence on whether he'd remain neutral in an EU referendum called by his own government. My understanding is he'd decide between Leave and Remain after the election, and once a leave deal had been negotiated. But in his TV interview today, he didn't quite commit to taking a position at all. In Labour circles, they often cite Harold Wilson's position on the 1975 European Community referendum as a precedent. Wilson allowed his cabinet to campaign on either side - Corbyn would do the same. But although taking a back seat in the campaign, Wilson did not remain neutral. He personally backed staying in, or, if you like 'Remain'. In doing so, though, he ignored official party policy - which was to leave. Now, of course, the vast majority of party members want to stay in the EU. So come a referendum, could Jeremy Corbyn yet do a Wilson-in-reverse? It's worth pointing out that only a year ago Labour was not formally committed to a 'public vote' with Remain definitely on the ballot paper. Whatever his own views on Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn is promising what many of his own MPs and members were previously demanding. The Conservatives said the growing movement within Labour for the party to campaign for remain showed it wanted to ""cancel"" the 2016 referendum result. ""They had the chance to let the public decide how to resolve Brexit via a general election - but Jeremy Corbyn doesn't trust the people,"" said party chair James Cleverly. Meanwhile, the party's National Executive Committee has voted to scrap its affiliation with Labour Students - which, up until now, had been the official student wing of the party. Earlier, the chair of Labour's Momentum campaign group, Jon Lansman, put a motion to the NEC calling for it to set up a new student body. Allow Twitter content?

The road to clean energy," by Simon Jack It was here, arguably, where the UK’s green revolution began, with an enterprising local farmer, Martin Edwards. “It all started with a storm,” he says. “We lost the roof of the house and my mother said if only we could use the wind rather than be done in by it – that got me thinking.” The next four years were spent shopping for wind turbines in Denmark, tense negotiations with the local council and overcoming a cautious rural community. In 1991, Edwards and his brother opened the UK’s first commercial wind farm. “The locals thought we were fruitcakes,” says Edwards, “but they didn’t object too much – mostly because they didn’t really know what a wind farm would look like. No-one had ever seen one so they didn’t know what they were getting.” Martin Edwards, Cornish farmer and wind power pioneer Martin Edwards, Cornish farmer and wind power pioneer The original 10 turbines have since been replaced by four bigger, better, more efficient generators of renewable energy. Eerily beautiful to some, an eyesore to others, they emit a low hum audible only when close up. The turbines seem to turn slowly but Edwards assures me the tips of the blades are moving at over 100mph. There are now more than 10,000 of these modern day white windmills in the UK - 8,000 of them onshore, and 2,000 much bigger versions offshore, and the price of wind energy has plummeted since Edwards installed his first turbines. Wind power has made it possible for the UK to contemplate a zero carbon future. What was once a seemingly impossible dream is now a government commitment for the year 2050. The change in our supply of electricity is extraordinary, according to Emma Pinchbeck from RenewableUK, a not-for-profit renewable energy trade association. “We're in the middle of basically an industrial revolution,” she says. “If you look back 10 years ago when we thought about renewables, we only thought about them as this kind of niche climate change technology and now they're the backbone of the energy system.” In the past two years, the cost of large-scale renewables has halved. In May this year, Britain went just over a weekwithout using electricity generated from burning coal- the first time this had happened since the 1880s. “The first time we had no coal was for only half an hour in 2016, so it's a really rapid shift,”  says Pinchbeck. Technical advances, aggressive competition and government support all helped to contribute to the sharp fall in the cost of wind power and surprised many - including Baroness Brown of Cambridge - a member of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the body which recommended the 2050 target of net zero emissions. “We're used to huge cost reductions in electronic devices and to some extent solar and batteries come into that kind of electronic spectrum. But actually offshore wind turbines are big bits of heavy engineering and we're seeing almost the same kind of scale of cost reduction.” Thanks in part to the growth in use and the reduction in cost of renewables - especially offshore wind - the UK has lowered its carbon emissions by 40% since 1990. This game-changing progress in wind didn’t happen all by itself. It was a result of hefty subsidies over the past three decades (subsidies which still account for about 10% of our energy bills). It was a bet that paid off and kickstarted a low-carbon industry in which the UK is a world leader. Some of the data in this article is drawn fromBBC Briefing, a mini-series of downloadable in-depth guides to the big issues in the news, with input from academics, researchers and journalists. It is the BBC's response to audiences demanding better explanation of the facts behind the headlines. However, you don’t need to be an energy expert to notice that the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine all the time. As we electrify transport and heating we will need to generate a lot more low-carbon electricity. In fact, as we move away from petrol and from gas central heating, it’s estimated that we will need nearly three times as much electricity as we currently produce. Renewables can take us a long way – but not all the way to zero if we want an energy system that is reliable and resilient. So where will the rest of our energy come from?  Hinkley Point C construction site, Somerset Hinkley Point C construction site, Somerset The green fields of Cornwall could not seem more remote from the epic scale of construction activity at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Visitors are collected at a park-and-ride stop a couple of miles from the site. Security is tight, safety clothing mandatory and behaviour protocols are strictly enforced – you must stick to the left on stairs and hold the handrail at all times. That would not be unusual for any building site of this magnitude and complexity. Hinkley is the biggest current construction project in Europe - there are 4,000 workers on site, and the project is expected to create 25,000 new jobs. Although it feels much more modern than Martin Edward’s field in Cornwall, Hinkley’s is a much older technology. The UK built 19 nuclear power stations from 1956 onwards and nuclear now contributes 20% of all the UK’s electricity. However, all but one of the present stock of reactors are due to be phased out by 2035. In 2008, the UK government announced the dawn of a new nuclear age and in 2010 it identifiedeight sites suitable for future nuclear power stations, on existing sites including Hinkley Point, Sizewell, Bradwell, Moorside, Wylfa and Oldbury. Of these, only Hinkley is under construction. In November 2018, Toshiba pulled out of the Moorside project and two months later, Hitachi announced it was abandoning its plans to develop Wylfa and Oldbury. French energy giant EDF says Hinkley is proceeding on time and within budget, and it is lobbying hard to replicate the Hinkley project at Sizewell, at lower cost. EDF is also involved with efforts by the Chinese energy company CGN to develop the site at Bradwell in Essex. The attractions of nuclear seem obvious - it is a potentially limitless source of low-carbon electricity. If you compare the UK’s electricity generation with France - EDF’s home country - the difference in carbon dependency is dramatic. You want low carbon at scale – you need nuclear, according to Julia Pyke, head of power at EDF. “We need something reliable to sit alongside the wind power, and what we say is that can be nuclear.” When (and if) commissioned in 2025, the two reactors at Hinkley Point C alone will produce 7% of the UK’s current requirements. However, the epic scale of production at Hinkley is precisely the problem for its detractors. It’s massive, it’s slow and at a cost of £20bn it seems eye-wateringly expensive. So does the electricity it will one day produce. In 2013, the UK government agreed to buy power from Hinkley Point C for a price of £92.50/MWh (megawatt hour). That was more than double the average price of electricity at the time and the price was guaranteed for the next 35 years. Offshore wind power can now be produced for as little as £57/MWh and is headed lower. Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk Making bets on the future is hard when technology is changing rapidly. Sir Ed Davey was energy secretary in the coalition government when he agreed that price. “At the time offshore wind and most renewables were more expensive than nuclear power. And while I was determined to get the price of offshore wind down - and by the way we have dramatically - one couldn't be sure. And yet one was faced with the absolute urgency of tackling climate change.” It’s not all about money, of course. Nuclear is perceived by both governments and the public to be risky – in different ways. Nuclear projects in recent years have been beset by timetable and budget overruns. The Olkiluoto station in Finland and the Flamanville plant in France - which both use the same technology as Hinkley Point C - have overrun by years and many billions of pounds. However, any cost overruns at Hinkley will not hit UK consumers or the government, as it was agreed that EDF would shoulder all the development risk (one of the reasons the electricity price was set so high). Public perceptions of nuclear power have inevitable associations with disasters like Chernobyl and, more recently, Fukushima in Japan. A Greenpeace boat approaches Flamanville power station in France - nuclear energy is distrusted by many environmental activists A Greenpeace boat approaches Flamanville power station in France - nuclear energy is distrusted by many environmental activists The waste products from nuclear energy remain highly toxic for thousands of years. Sellafield in Cumbria is home to more than 100 tonnes of plutonium and the clean-up operation costs the UK government nearly £2bn per year. EDF says that the mistakes of the past have been learnt in design, production, waste management and decommissioning. Nevertheless when you say “low carbon” everyone cheers. When you say nuclear, the response is often mixed. One of the things that almost everyone agrees on is that decarbonising the power supply will need a mix of technologies. Wind, solar, biomass, nuclear, hydro will all play their part - as will increased storage and a smarter energy grid that matches demand and supply more efficiently. The good news is that, according to the CCC, all the technologies we need to decarbonise the energy system currently exist. Eureka breakthroughs may occur but we don’t need them to get there. The renewables revolution happened relatively quietly. When we flick a switch the light comes on just the same as it ever did, with consumers largely unaware of the turbines spinning out in the North Sea and elsewhere. But while carbon emissions from power generation have fallen 64% since 1990, we should remember that the production of electricity only makes up 15% of the UK’s carbon emissions. The next phase will be very different. To get to zero by 2050 will affect what we eat, what we buy, how we travel and how we heat our homes. Oh, andit will cost one trillion pounds, according to former Chancellor Philip Hammond. When we think of images of climate change, we usually picture belching power stations, queues of jets at an airport, or columns of HGVs rumbling down crowded motorways. These are all significant generators of carbon emissions but the biggest consumers of energy are you and me, driving the car to the supermarket, or simply switching on the central heating. Household domestic energy use and private cars account for 48% of the UK’s energy consumption.  To get to zero will require significant changes to our transport and heating systems. Will electric cars ride to the climate rescue? There are some positive signs. In August this year the sales of alternative fuelled (electric or hybrid) vehicles, or EVs, rose five-fold compared with a year earlier. The government has announced its intention to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040 while also committing to buy EVs for a quarter of its own fleet by 2022. However, electric cars currently account for less than 1% of all vehicles on the road. And although take-up is accelerating, CO2 emissions from cars recently started to rise after a decade which saw them fall 15% across Europe. For most of the past decade, the UK government, in common with many other EU member states, decided the best way of meeting emissions targets was to push diesel - which emits less CO2 than petrol. That strategy backfired when Volkswagen was found to have been cheating on the tests that measure how much pollution the engine produces. These revelations coincided with rising concerns about air quality, particularly in urban areas. Cities in the UK and around Europe are now moving to ban older diesels. Many consumers - particularly where there’s less off-street parking - are still unconvinced that sufficient charging infrastructure will be in place to make electric cars viable. That reticence has pushed many back to petrol - hence the rise in CO2 emissions. The CCC has been critical of the progress made on domestic transport. It says that 2040 is too late for the phase-out of petrol and diesel cars and vans, and that current plans for delivering this are “too vague”. However, car manufacturers are spending hundreds of billions retooling their factories, in the biggest revolution in motor production since the internal combustion engine was invented. Ford recently announced it would produce more EVs than conventional cars by 2022. That is a massive change - and reflects the widely held view that we are close to a tipping point in electric transport, after which change will happen quickly. A future of electric cars using power generated by low carbon technologies gets us some of the way to zero emissions. Now the tough bit. The hardest part of getting to zero emissions is a result of something that happened in the 1960s and 1970s - the mass installation of central heating in UK homes. This accounts for the largest single use of energy in the UK.  More than 85% of homes with central heating are connected to the gas grid. The 1960s saw mass adoption of gas central heating in the UK The 1960s saw mass adoption of gas central heating in the UK The CCC says the most expensive part of the transition to zero carbon will be the modification of 28 million home heating systems. Of the £1tn that getting to net zero may cost, half (£500bn) will go towards refitting domestic heating. While it may be possible to convert council and social housing with mandated government initiatives, it may take a powerful combination of stick and carrot to persuade owner-occupiers to replace their gas central heating. So, if we are to say goodbye to our boilers what will replace them? Electric heat pumps offer one solution. They look like large air conditioning units, are usually sited outside the house and use electric compressors to control the heat inside. They are three times more efficient than gas central heating, and - as long as you are using zero-carbon electricity - there are no CO2 emissions. Electric heat pump Electric heat pump The downside is that they take longer to warm up, which makes them less effective in winter cold snaps. That is why hydrogen is seen as a substitute or supplementary technology. Burning hydrogen produces heat but its only by-product is water. The technology to fix this is out there according to Emma Pinchbeck from RenewableUK. “We have alternative gas heating systems, hybrid systems and indeed hydrogen systems coming in. We can do this.” The CCC is less positive. Its report says that more than 10 years after the Climate Change Act 2008 was passed, there is still “no serious plan for decarbonising UK heating systems” and no large-scale trials for either heat pumps or hydrogen. The CCC estimates that the change will also require a massive communication effort on the part of successive governments. But Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, says we only need to look to our own history for encouragement. “The interesting comparison to make is if you go back in history to the 60s and 70s in the UK. We underwent another heating transformation from what was called then town gas from coal to natural gas. And that cost many billions of pounds over that period. “So it's probably going to be of a similar order of cost fall for this time around. It can be done because we've done it before. It can be done because other countries have already done it.” Coal-fired power plant, Shanxi, China Coal-fired power plant, Shanxi, China So what have we learned? Decarbonising the electricity supply can be done with a mixture of renewables and maybe a dash of nuclear. Decarbonising domestic heating is the biggest challenge and will cost half a trillion pounds. The technologies we need to do it already exist and there’s every chance that new better ones will emerge. As we move towards 2050, successive governments will have to back several horses to make sure it’s not locked into any one path. Some of those bets may fail. The task, then, is daunting but not impossible. But there are some inconvenient truths that this analysis and the targets the government has set ignores. Firstly, international aviation is not included in the net zero target. It’s estimated that the UK’s share of aviation may make up as much as 7% of the UK’s total emissions. And secondly, the way we currently measure emissions does not include the environmental cost of the goods we import. If the UK were to close down a carbon-hungry steel plant, our emissions would go down. But we still need steel so we would import it - from China, say, where it’s made in a more carbon and energy-intensive way. So actually while the emissions produced on UK soil go down, the UK’s carbon footprint goes up. Dieter Helm, the author of a government cost-of-energy review argues we cannot ignore our overall consumption. “We have to be brutally honest,” he says. “This is one of the reasons why despite everything the people in Europe and the UK have been doing, we haven't made an iota of difference to climate change.” Helm points out that even a relatively small country such as Denmark, with a population of 5.8 million, has increased its carbon consumption. The increase in the carbon intensity of its imports has far outweighed the reduction in emissions it made through uptake of renewable energy. Concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has continued to rise every single year since 1990 despite 30 years of low emissions targets in the West. “You have to address the incentives which lie in China, India and Africa,” says Helm. “These countries are doubling in size every 10 years in economic input. This is where climate change is going to be determined and we should not have a policy which positively incentivises them to substitute our home production with more carbon intensive output.” That sounds like a counsel of despair. The UK is responsible for just 1% of global CO2 emissions. Even if we spend a trillion pounds getting our net emissions to zero it won’t make any difference – so why bother? Baroness Brown says the UK has a moral responsibility to lead, because it has profited so much from emitting CO2 over the years. “We like to claim that we are the cradle of the industrial revolution. So actually we have a huge responsibility for historic emissions. We should be prepared to make a strong statement now.” But if, as Baroness Brown points out, we became rich the dirty way, can we really say with any authority that others should do things differently now? Helm says no. “Preaching to developing countries how they should mend their ways when we've caused much of the problem… is never going to cut it. It's arrogant, it's morally unacceptable and it smacks of imperialism.” Instead, he suggests that the UK - and the West - should provide the means by which the world’s fastest growing economies can decarbonise. The biggest of these is China, whose $13tn economy is growing at 6% per year. It’s the world’s biggest burner of coal, but it’s also the biggest global investor in renewables. Emma Pinchbeck from RenewableUK is optimistic about China’s willingness to adopt low-carbon technology. She thinks that as the country’s “megacities” grow, poor air quality and poor quality of living will create political pressure to tackle the issue. “The availability of low carbon technology means they may just go straight there. Do not underestimate the visible benefits of low carbon living in the industrial world skipping straight to industrialised economies.” Panda-shaped solar panels, Datong power plant, China Panda-shaped solar panels, Datong power plant, China The UK has proved it is possible to grow your economy while reducing emissions. It’s also shown it can lead in green technology adoption. As well as its leading position in offshore wind, the UK’s particular history and geography means it is well placed to lead in carbon capture and storage (CCS), a process which extracts the carbon from fossil fuels the moment they're burned. That carbon is then stored securely underground in depleted oil and gas fields. - which by happy coincidence we have right on our doorstep in the North Sea. Many think it is impossible to hit the zero carbon target without developing this technology. Being in the vanguard of these methods will create industries and expertise the rest of the world will need. It could be a massive export opportunity. Imagine a world in which renewable power is used to charge a small number of shared electric cars - which double as energy storage units - while also being used to make hydrogen to supplement electric heating systems for well-insulated homes of citizens who eat very little meat and have international travel rationed, with everything managed by optimised networks powered by artificial intelligence (while the humans plant a lot of trees).

Facebook unveils its plan for oversight board,"Facebook has unveiled its plan to create an independent ""oversight"" board to make decisions over how the network is moderated. The firm insisted the panel, which will hear its first ""cases"" in 2020, will have power to override decisions it makes over contentious material and influence new policy. The idea, dubbed the Facebook supreme court, will eventually comprise 40 people around the world, but will be smaller at first. Experts have questioned the board's independence, as well as the motivation behind the move. ""Facebook does not have a court,"" said Bernie Hogan, senior research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute. ""The only vote that really counts is the majority shareholder, Mark Zuckerberg."" He added: ""Facebook's 'supreme court' invokes all the pomp and circumstance of actual judicial practice without any of the responsibility to citizens."" The board will launch with no fewer than 11 part-time members, Facebook said, and the names of those appointed will be made public - as will the results of their deliberations. The board will be paid via a trust set up and funded by Facebook upfront. ""We are responsible for enforcing our policies every day and we make millions of content decisions every week,"" wrote Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. ""But ultimately I don't believe private companies like ours should be making so many important decisions about speech on our own."" Facebook outlined how the board would operate in a charter published on Tuesday. The goals of the panel, as stated by Facebook, are to: ""Provide oversight of Facebook's content decisions"" Reverse Facebook's decisions when necessary"" ""Be an independent authority outside of Facebook"" Major disagreements will be escalated to the panel once all of Facebook's existing moderation layers had been exhausted. Facebook controls which cases are submitted to the board, although panel members will decide which of those cases to take on. Facebook anticipated that the board would only consider ""dozens"" of cases a year, focusing on those where a clear decision would be in ""the greatest public benefit"". Users affected will be allowed to state their case in a written statement, but Facebook said it anticipated some board members may wish to speak to users ""face-to-face"". ""The board's decision will be binding, even if I or anyone at Facebook disagrees with it,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""The board will use our values to inform its decisions and explain its reasoning openly and in a way that protects people's privacy."" One caveat, according to the firm's charter, is when recommendations are not technically feasible. Facebook said the trust would be opened up for other networks to join - and fund - in future. Facebook's primary concern is that it doesn't want the power it currently wields - or at least, it doesn't want the scrutiny that power attracts. Its ability to decide what goes on its platform, the biggest network of people ever created, brings it nothing but trouble, particularly in its home country. One recent example demonstrates the conflict Facebook faces. An anti-abortion video, deemed to contain inaccuracies by an independent fact-checking group contracted by Facebook, was removed - only to be reinstated after four Republican senators complained to Mr Zuckerberg personally, accusing the site of having a bias against conservative views. In future, this kind of decision could be taken out of Facebook's direct control and handed to the oversight board, which has the power to override the site's policies - although experts predict Facebook will still bear the brunt of criticism. ""This panel is seen as an attempt to do something, but it appears to be just short of having enough teeth to make a difference,"" argued Mr Hogan. ""It is a way to tell critics 'lay off, we are doing all it can'. Such a panel, while admirable is no match for some well organised trolls or broad systemic issues.""

"Global likes for plumber's Â£0 boiler billBurnley plumber gains worldwide attention for not charging elderly customer ""under any circumstances"".UK","James Anderson says his work has received a ""boost"" from international attention A not-for-profit plumbing company in Burnley has earned worldwide attention after it refused to charge an elderly customer for work on her boiler. A receipt for the work shows a 91-year-old woman with leukaemia would not be charged ""under any circumstances"". The receipt was shared on social media by the woman's daughter in the past week and has since been liked hundreds of thousands of times. Plumber James Anderson says he hopes to expand his altruism across the UK. James is originally from Liverpool, where he was a bin man before he became a plumber in 1998. He has been running Depher - Disabled & Elderly Plumbing and Heating Emergency Repair - as a not-for-profit plumbing company since March 2017. ""There are too many elderly and disabled people suffering in silence,"" he explains. ""They don't like asking for help. They don't want to be a burden. ""We take away the burden, the stigma."" Speaking to the BBC, James says the company's work ""stops them getting into debt"" and helps them regain an independence they fear they may lose ""if they think they can't afford repair costs"". The love letters returned after 70 years Your tips for staying positive Why this 89-year-old is visiting every US national park with her grandson Despite running up debts for such a selfless ethos, James says he will keep doing it until ""the day God calls me"". He now owes ""just under Â£8,000"" but the situation is ""under control,"" because of his arrangements with both his bank and his supplier. The company also has a crowdfunding page, and performs regular plumbing jobs: ""Any money we make goes back into the Depher account"". James says he had to lay off two workers because of a lack of funds. He wants to expand the philanthropic work beyond Burnley, and the attention brought by the receipt could help. ""I've got other plumbers... offering help. My hope is to get Depher national, in every city and town."" ""We need to be a human race, to look out for each other,"" says James, pictured with his daughter James was not initially aware of his note being shared online. ""I was at my grandson's christening,"" he says. ""I got a couple of likes and cheers on Sunday,"" but since then the reaction has been ""absolutely global"". He has been taking calls from as far away as Germany and the US, and from international broadcasters, talking about his aims to help those in need. ""It's going to give it a boost,"" he adds. But he's reluctant to take all the credit, calling his actions ""a community effort"". ""We all do what we can and we all come together as a community. We need to be a human race, to look out for each other.""

PC Andrew Harper, 28, died after he was dragged along a road by a vehicle in Sulhamstead, Berkshire, on 15 August. An 18-year-old man and two 17-year-old boys, all from the Reading area, were re-arrested in an operation involving more than 100 officers.

Thames Valley Police said the new arrests followed ""new evidence coming to light"". PC Harper married his long-term partner Lissie just four weeks before his death. Mrs Harper had previously paid tribute to the ""kindest, loveliest, most selfless person you will ever meet"". ""My darling boy I do not know how I will be able to survive without you,"" she said.

Swinson: Being a woman is not a weakness,"This video can not be played ""We must stop Brexit"", Jo Swinson says Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has warned Boris Johnson that ""if he thinks being a woman is somehow a weakness, he's about to find out it is not"". She said the PM's choice of insults such as ""big girl's blouse"" and ""girly swot"" were ""revealing"". In her first conference speech as leader, she said she could not wait to ""take on"" Mr Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage in an election. And she vowed a Lib Dem government would stop Brexit ""on day one"". The Lib Dems currently have 18 MPs - a figure boosted by recent defections - but it would require a seismic shift in the electoral landscape for them to win power. Nevertheless, Ms Swinson received a standing ovation when she told the conference she wanted to be prime minister, adding: ""There is no limit to my ambition for our party."" Mr Johnson called Mr Corbyn ""a big girl's blouse""during their first clash at Prime Minister's Questions earlier this month - a remark that prompted some criticism. It also emerged he had labelled former PM David Cameron a ""girly swot"". On Tuesday, as the Supreme Court began hearing two appeals relating to the suspension of Parliament, Lib Dem conference delegates backed an emergency motion calling forthe suspension of Parliamentto be reversed. Earlier at the conferencethey voted overwhelmingly to back her proposalfor a manifesto pledge to revoke Article 50 if the party came into power with a majority government. Five things from the Lib Dem conference Swinson rejects propping up Johnson or Corbyn Who is new Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson? EU has had 'bellyful' of Brexit process - Johnson In her speech, Ms Swinson criticised Mr Johnson's pledge to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, with or without a deal. She told the conference in Bournemouth the prime minister's spending on no-deal preparations was ""sickening"". ""The truth is you can't plan for no deal. Planning for no deal is like planning to burn your house down,"" she said. ""You might have insurance, but you're still going to lose all your stuff."" The six new Lib Dems - acquired from Labour and the Tories - were front and centre Ask Liberal Democrat members here what they think of their leader and words like ""refreshing"", ""energetic"" and ""relatable"" trip off the tongue. Some praise Jo Swinson's ability to communicate with voters, others gush about her confidence and composure in the House of Commons. But old hands who've seen leaders come and go sound a note of caution about fulfilling expectations. One senior figure said she needed to ""rise to the occasion"". Jo Swinson has won her party's backing for a bold shift in policy on Brexit, and talks of winning 300 seats in a general election. But with big ambitions come big expectations and soon Jo Swinson will be judged by her party on what she can deliver not just on what she can promise. Ms Swinson, whosucceeded Sir Vince Cable as Lib Dem leader in July,added: ""The first task is clear. We must stop Brexit. There is no Brexit that will be good for our country."" She criticised Mr Johnson for withdrawing the Conservative whip from 21 Tory rebels - including one,Sam Gyimah, who later joined the Lib Dems- and for deciding to suspend Parliament. She said he was ""silencing critics, purging opponents, ignoring the law"". ""For someone who proclaims to hate socialist dictators, he's doing a pretty good impression of one."" This video can not be played Jo Swinson criticises Corbyn and Johnson Ms Swinson also turned her fire on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, accusing him of holding on to Eurosceptic views. ""Even now, when faced with all the clear and obvious dangers that Brexit brings, Jeremy Corbyn still insists that if Labour win a general election, they will negotiate their own Brexit deal to take us out of the EU,"" she said. ""Nigel Farage might be Brexit by name, but it is very clear that Jeremy Corbyn is Brexit by nature."" Earlier, shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti described the Lib Dem's promise to revoke Article 50 without a further referendum as ""illiberal and anti-democratic"". Turning to Scotland, Ms Swinson highlighted its support to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum and urged supporters there to give ""a big vote"" to her party. ""Together we can stop Brexit,"" she said. ""We are building a movement across the United Kingdom that is on the verge of stopping it."" In her keynote speech, Ms Swinson also touched on policy matters away from Brexit. On climate change, she said a Lib Dem government would create a green investment bank and set up a citizens' assembly to debate how the UK would reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2045. She said her government would tackle climate change ""because, as the placards say, there is no Planet B."" Ms Swinson also said she wanted the party to ""fundamentally rethink the purpose of our economy"", asking why a country's success was ""reduced to a GDP figure"". ""It [GDP] measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile,"" she said quoting the American politician Bobby Kennedy. She pledged to introduce a wellbeing budget ""to spell out our priorities for public spending on the things that matter most"". The Lib Dem leader also promised to fund youth services in order to tackle knife crime and to ringfence funding for mental health services.

Second man arrested over solid gold toilet theft,"This video can not be played Solid gold toilet stolen in Blenheim Palace heist A second man has been arrested as police continue to hunt for a solid gold toilet stolen from Blenheim Palace. The artwork, valued at $6m (Â£4.8m), was stolen in a raid at the stately home in Woodstock, Oxfordshire on Saturday. Police said the 36-year-old man, from Cheltenham, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle and had been released under investigation. A 66-year-old man was previously arrested on the same day as the theft. He was held on suspicion of burglary and released on bail until October. The 18-carat gold toilet, entitled America, had been part of an exhibition by Maurizio Cattelan and was available to be used by visitors to the home of the Duke of Marlborough. Blenheim's chief executive Dominic Hare said the theft had echoes of a ""heist movie"" and added it was the ""first theft of this type in living memory"" from the palace. Mr Hare said the World Heritage Site had a ""a sophisticated security system"", but said staff were ""now challenged to look hard at ourselves and improve again"". Blenheim's chief executive Dominic Hare said the theft had echoes of a ""heist movie"" Det Insp Steve Jones said the force's priority was ""to locate the stolen item"" as he appealed for anyone with information to contact officers. Police said on Monday they believed a gang of thieves using at least two vehicles were responsible for the theft. Blenheim Palace was shut on Saturday after the burglary but reopened on Sunday. Palace gold toilet theft 'like heist movie' Security 'needs challenging' after toilet theft Gold toilet stolen in Blenheim Palace burglary Mr Hare said the artwork - famously offered to US President Donald Trump in 2017 - was a ""comment on the American dream"". He added it was ""not out of the question [the toilet] would be melted down"" by the thieves. In an email to the New York Times, Cattelan said he wanted ""to be positive and think the robbery is a kind of Robin Hood-inspired action"".

Could the Supreme Court overrule the government?,"Lady Hale, the brooch-wearing judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament was unlawful, has retired from the UK Supreme Court. Who will follow her as its president and what does the Supreme Court do? Lady Hale was president of the Supreme Court from September 2017 to January 2020 and oversaw the decision on the suspension of Parliament. She is among the most well-known judges in the world. Before she became a judge, she was the architect of the UK's internationally-recognised laws on the rights of children. As the first female justice,she has been critical of the lack of female representationon the body in the past. She stood down in 2020 in line with retirement rules for judges. Lord Reed is thenew Supreme Court president,external. The senior Scottish judge also sat in the European Court of Human Rights. He led the importantSupreme Court ruling that overturned high employment tribunal feeswhich had led to claims that people were being denied access to justice. Who is the new top judge at the Supreme Court? It is the highest court in the United Kingdom. The judges, known as justices, have the final say on the biggest legal issues. They are the ultimate check and balance on the UK's laws and constitution. Their job is no different to many comparable bodies in other countries. They rule on what a law means when there is a dispute. These are cases that raise what the court considers to be genuinely important points that affect the nation. This video can not be played The BBC's Clive Coleman takes a look inside the UK's Supreme Court Their judgements set out how a law should be interpreted and applied. Only a third of the cases that it is asked to rule on are heard by the Supreme Court. The court sits opposite the Houses of Parliament. Its location symbolises the relationship between the two. Parliament makes the laws and the Supreme Court oversees their ultimate interpretation and fair and just use. Over the course of its first 10 years of work, the court has delivered many judgements that have changed the nature of the UK. But its arguably most important case was 2019's decision to rule that Prime MinisterBoris Johnson had broken the law by proroguing (suspending) Parliament for five weeksas he faced division over the Brexit process. Lady Hale, wearing her spider brooch, reads out the Supreme Court's ruling on the suspension of Parliament The justices hear cases that have been considered in lower courts in any part of the United Kingdom, other than some issues from Northern Ireland and appeals against criminal convictions from Scotland. There is always an odd number of Supreme Court justices to decide on cases, so that if they disagree on the outcome, there is a majority ruling one way or the other. Since October 2009 it has heard and decided on more than 835 cases. Here are some examples: Two 2018 judgements meant the police could be sued for compensation,after 76-year-old Elizabeth Robinson was knocked overand whendetectives botched a solvable investigation into the John Worboys serial rapist case In 2016, the justices said a law about gang murderhad been wrongly interpreted for 30 years Three years later,justices backed end-of-life decisions Only Parliament can pass or cancel laws. The Supreme Court's role is to decide on the correct interpretation of those laws when there is a dispute. If the justices think a law conflicts with human rights safeguards, it can tell Parliament it should reconsider the legislation - but the government is under no legal obligation to act on that. New justices are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of a panel of legal experts from each of the UK's nations. Applicants must have been a High Court judge for at least two years or a practising lawyer for 15. These are the other members of the Supreme Court. Lord Hodgeis the deputy president and the second Scottish judge on the panel of 12. He specialises in commercial law, in particular intellectual property and land valuation. Lord Kerrwas Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland before joining the Supreme Court at its 2009 opening. As the only Northern Irish justice, he argued forfree NHS abortions to be given to Northern Irish womenwhen they travel to England, but the Supreme Court rejected the case. Lord Wilsonis one of the UK's most experienced judges in family law, having spent 12 years ruling on those cases. Lord Carnwathis an expert in company and commercial law. He has a particular interest in environmental law. Lady Blackis another expert in family law who has taught students at university and, from 2010, also sat as a Court of Appeal judge. Lord Lloyd-Jonesis the Supreme Court's judge from Wales and a Welsh speaker. He specialises in international law He chaired the Law Commission - which advises the government on which laws need reforming - up until 2015. Lord Briggswas appointed to the Court of Appeal in 2013. Three years later he became deputy head of civil justice. Lady Ardenwas a Court of Appeal judge for 18 years and another former head of the Law Commission. Lord Kitchinis an expert in the complex branch of commercial cases that deals with intellectual property, such as patents that protect an invention from being copied by a rival. Lord Saleswas inthe original court which ruled the government must ask Parliamentbefore invoking Article 50, the part of EU law which gives any country the right to leave the EU. This led to the Daily Mail labelling him and the other two judges as ""enemies of the people."" Lord Justice Hamblenis the newest member. He's been a senior judge since 2008, specialising in commercial law. Two more new justices are in the wings waiting to be sworn in later in the year as others retire. Since Mr Johnson lost the prorogation case, there has been a drip feed of stories implying the court got the decision wrong and will face reform. Some Conservatives say judges snatched powers they never had. The Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto pledged a constitutional review which would include the courts. It did not explicitly single out the Supreme Court for reform - so what may happen is unclear. Any attempt to water down the court's powers is likely to face a rocky road. Many lawyers would see this as an act of political revenge. No. There are two unrelated European Courts. TheEuropean Court of Justice(ECJ) oversees EU laws on trade and so on that are passed by the member states. When the UK leaves the EU, it will not be part of that system, unless it were to choose to be, as part of a deal. The entirely differentEuropean Court of Human Rights(ECtHR) was set up (largely at the instigation of the UK) to protect the rights of ordinary people across the continent from undemocratic use of power. It hears very few cases against the UK government as most human rights cases are dealt with by British judges. The Supreme Court takes into account the views of the ECtHR but is entitled to reject its conclusions.

Johnson attacked over Brexit,"This video can not be played Luxembourg's PM spoke beside the empty podium where Boris Johnson was due to appear Luxembourg's PM has attacked Boris Johnson's approach to Brexit, calling the situation a ""nightmare"". Xavier Bettel said the British government had failed to put forward any serious proposals for a new deal. But Mr Johnson, who pulled out of a joint press conference with Mr Bettel because of noisy protesters, said there was still a good chance of a deal. A government source said the gap the UK and Brussels needed to bridge to achieve a deal ""remains quite large"". Mr Johnson was visiting Luxembourg to hold talks with the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well as Mr Bettel. After the working lunch with Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier, Mr Johnson said he had been encouraged by the EU's willingness to engage with the UK in their shared desire to avoid a no-deal exit - but there had not been a ""total breakthrough"". However, the European Commission said the PM had yet to present concrete proposals for it to consider and insisted any new plans had to be ""compatible"" with the existing withdrawal agreement, which has been rejected three times by MPs. There was then confusion after Mr Bettel held a press conference without Mr Johnson amid noisy protests by anti-Brexit protesters. Mr Bettel, who addressed the media on his own after the UK PM pulled out, said his counterpart ""holds the future of all UK citizens in his hands"" and suggested it was his responsibility to break the deadlock in the process. What does 'podiumgate' say about Brexit deal? In full: Boris Johnson interview from Luxembourg How are the UK's talks with the EU going? This video can not be played Johnson: EU have had 'bellyful' of delays Standing next to an empty lectern, Mr Bettel warned Mr Johnson ""you can't hold the future hostage for party political gain"". He said there were ""no concrete proposals at the moment on the table"" on a new Brexit deal from the UK and said the EU ""needs more than just words"". ""We need written proposals and the time is ticking, so stop speaking and act,"" he said. The existing withdrawal agreement was the ""only solution"", he added. Mr Johnson said his joint press conference was cancelled over fears the two leaders would have been ""drowned out"" by pro-EU protesters. It is understood that his request for it to be held inside was turned down. What exactly should we make of the oh so public venting on Monday by the prime minister of Luxembourg following his meeting with Boris Johnson? Does this mean the EU has lost patience and will no longer engage in negotiations with the Johnson government? Can we expect an Angela Merkel rant or a Mark Rutte rave next? Quite the opposite. ""As long as there is a chance of a deal, it's in our own interest to engage. However frustrating negotiations are,"" a high-level EU contact told me. Read more from Katya's blog The EU's Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, tweeted a photograph of the empty podium where Mr Johnson had been due to speak alongside Mr Bettel with the caption: ""From Incredible Hulk to incredible sulk"".

Over the weekend Mr Johnson told a newspaper that the UK would break out of its ""manacles"" like cartoon character The Incredible Hulk - with or without a deal. After the working lunch with Mr Juncker, Mr Johnson told the BBC's political editor he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the state of negotiations and suggested the EU wanted to bring the two and half years of arguments about the terms of the UK's exit to an end. ""I see no point whatever in staying on in the EU beyond October 31st and we're going to come out. And actually that is what our friends and partners in the EU would like too. ""And I think that they've had a bellyful of all this stuff. You know they want to develop a new relationship with the UK. They're fed up with these endless negotiations, endless delays."" This video can not be played 'What a load of claptrap' While he was working ""very hard"" to get a deal, Mr Johnson said there would be no agreement unless the EU shifted its position on the backstop, the insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland unless and until another solution is found. ""If we can't get movement from them on that crucial issue... we won't be able to get it through the House of Commons, no way."" He said there were a number of ideas under discussion which would allow the whole of the UK to leave the EU while protecting the integrity of the bloc's single market, upholding the Good Friday Agreement and supporting the Irish economy. These, he said, included the use of technology to minimise border checks as well as the so-called Stormont lock, a mechanism to give Northern Irish politicians a say on the rules that apply to Northern Ireland. ""It is all doable with energy and goodwill,"" he insisted. A UK government source later said: ""It's clear Brussels is not yet ready to find the compromises required for a deal, so no-deal remains a real possibility - as the gap we need to bridge remains quite large."" As soon as we arrived at the office of the prime minister of Luxembourg it became obvious a planned outdoor news conference could not go ahead. The anti-Brexit protesters in the square numbered less than 100 but their music and megaphones made it sound like a lot more and they occasionally used language you wouldn't want to hear on the news. Behind the scenes the British and Luxembourgish delegations grappled with a diplomatic dilemma: Move the event inside but exclude the majority of the journalists? Gamble that the demonstrators could pipe down for a bit? Silence the host to save the guest's blushes? The end result saw Mr Johnson do a short interview at the ambassador's residence to be shared with everyone while Mr Bettel took to the stage next to an empty podium. He used the moment in the spotlight to deliver an impassioned speech, made all the more dramatic by the fact he's famed as one of the EU's most smiley, mild-mannered leaders. Mr Johnson said he would meet the Halloween Brexit deadline come what may, insisting that the UK would be ""in very good shape"" whether there was a deal or not. But pushed on how he would get around the law requiring him to ask for an extension if there is no deal by 19 October, the PM did not explain how it would be possible. Ahead of Tuesday's Supreme Court hearing into whether the prorogation of Parliament was lawful, Mr Johnson defended the decision to suspend Parliament. Parliament was prorogued last week, ahead of a Queen's Speech on 14 October. Legal challenges to the decision have been lodged in the courts by opposition MPs and campaigners. Could the Supreme Court overrule the government? What will happen with Brexit in the next month? Mr Johnson described claims that Parliament was ""being deprived of the opportunity to scrutinise Brexit"" as ""all this mumbo jumbo"" and a ""load of claptrap"". ""I think people think that we've somehow stopped Parliament from scrutinising Brexit. ""What absolute nonsense. Parliament will be able to scrutinise the deal that I hope we will be able to do both before and after the European Council on October 17.""

"Â£140m to be spent fixing Mossmorran flaringExxonMobil plans to employ 850 temporary extra staff during remedial work at the Fife chemical plant.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","ExxonMobil plant manager Jacob McAlister said he hoped residents would notice a difference within a year as a result of the new investment A total of Â£140m is to be spent reducing flaring and improving the reliability of a Fife chemical plant. ExxonMobil said it had started recruiting 850 temporary workers to carry out the work over the next 12 months. The operator said the investment was on top of the Â£20m it spends annually on maintaining its Mossmorran site. Residents have complained of light pollution and noise often disrupting their sleep during flaring events. ExxonMobil said the work - which includes fitting flaring tips and other technology to reduce flaring - would be completed by September 2020. Chemical plant shutdown extended by months Almost 1,400 complaints over chemical plant's flaring Gas processor get two-month flaring deadline Currently, the plant has temporarily shut down while two of its three boilers have parts renewed and repaired. The company said it expected to resume operations producing ethylene during the fourth quarter of the year - between October and December -  after the shutdown which began on 12 August. Exxonmobil's ethylene plant at Mossmorran is temporarily shut down The work will involve building a flare at ground level which means they will use the elevated flare less often, reducing the visual impact of the plant. The multi-million pound ground flare will be built by 2024. In addition, the work will lead to a reduction in the amount of vibration felt by local residents, plant bosses claim. Plant manager Jacob McAlister said: ""The reliability of the plant has not been where we want it to be and we recognise that -  Â£140m is a major step and shows our commitment that we are addressing these issues. ""We built this [elevated flare tower] 34 years ago to keep the community safe and it is doing its job but we have more advanced technology now that we didn't have when it was built which we hope will address the issues we have been having."" He added: ""We're intent on making improvements, which will drastically reduce flaring and the duration of elevated flaring. I hope in one year from now a significant portion of this project will be in place and that the number of flaring events will be driven down. ""We are not spending this money to pacify the community, we are concerned about how the plant is impacting on their lives and we are announcing how we are addressing that."" James Glen, chairman of the Mossmorran Action Group, said residents believed there had been ""major under investment""  in the safety and maintenance of the plant. He added: ""It would be good to know how much of the Â£140m planned expenditure is just to bring the plant up to a reasonable safety standard. ""We have been promised flaring tips before and these never reduced the levels of flaring and the noise impacts. ""So the communities will wait with bated breath to see if this is an improvement."" Residents have complained of light pollution and noise during flaring Environmental watchdog Sepa said it had been pressing for ground flaring to be introduced at the site - but wanted it introduced sooner than 2024. Sepa chief compliance officer Ian Buchanan said: ""We look forward to working with ExxonMobil on detailed proposals to both address the root causes of flaring and also on the requirement we have set around the 'shortest period possible to plan, design, build and safely integrate' new ground flare technology which will significantly reduce impacts of flaring on local communities."" Lesley Laird, MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, said the major investment justified the concerns communities had expressed for years. ""Residents were patronised for the most part, and those who dared raised concerns publicly were derided for scaremongering,"" she added. ""It is only through the concerted pressure of the Mossmorran Working Group that Sepa, HSE and the companies have finally all had to face up to the reality that communities had reached their absolute limit, and that they would have to act as the plant was clearly not fit for purpose. ""More detailed responses are now required from all of these organisations as to how, under the watchful eye of Sepa and HSE, Fife Ethylene Plant was allowed to deteriorate to this extent."" Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse, said: ""Given community concerns, the Scottish government has been clear that the frequency of unplanned flaring at the site is unacceptable and that the operators must take steps to address this, so this announcement of action being taken is therefore to be welcomed."" Ian Buchanan, a chief officer at Sepa, said: ""Sepa has been clear that repeated unplanned flaring by ExxonMobil was both unacceptable and preventable and that in future flaring will be the exception rather than routine. ""Having served a series of notices and operating permit variations to drive investment, including in noise reducing flare tips by 2020, we welcome today's broad announcement from ExxonMobil."" Alan Mitchell, chief executive of Fife Chamber of Commerce, said: ""First and foremost, this is tremendous news for the workforce at Mossmorran. ""But the benefits will be felt well beyond the plant's boundaries. ""It will create jobs in Fife and opportunities for contracts and work for local companies."" Meanwhile, BBC Scotland has learned the plant has been issued with an improvement notice over the risk of an explosion. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said ExxonMobil had failed to take all measures necessary to reduce the risk of ""firebox explosion from furnaces"". The firebox is an area in the plant's furnaces where fuel is burnt. Inspectors said the risk came from an uncontrolled accumulation of unburnt fuel in the firebox. The HSE notice, which affects seven furnaces at the plant, states ""the measures currently in place are not sufficient to reduce the risk to as low as reasonably practicable"". It was issued in July and ExxonMobil has until March next year to comply with the improvement order. On the HSE notice, Mr McAlister said: ""Our safety performance is such that in the 30-plus years we've been in operation we've never had a major safety incident. ""We've gone over 25 years without a lost time injury on the site. You don't do that if you're not managing the safety risks appropriately. We are managing the safety risks, that's our number one job to ensure that we do that right."" In August it emerged that Scotland's environmental regulatorSepa had received almost 1,400 complaints about the Mossmorransite, which is also shared by Shell Fife NGL. Both companies had their permits modified and were told to install flare tips that reduce noise.

Giant Yorkshire mine faces uncertain future,"The future of a huge potash mine in North Yorkshire has been thrown into doubt after the company behind the project cancelled plans to raise $500m (Â£403m) through a bond sale. Sirius Minerals  blamed ""market conditions"", including Brexit and lack of government support for the decision. It will now undergo a six-month review of four different options for a new financing plan to resume the project. The company's share price halved in reaction to the news. Sirius had alreadypaused the bond issue last month, blaming ""market conditions"". The project is set to be the world's largest mine for polyhalite, a naturally occurring fertiliser which is used in agriculture. The mine is due to open in 2021 and create more than 1,000 jobs. The plans include a 23-mile (37km) tunnel to transport minerals to a processing plant near the former Redcar steelworks. Different parts of the work will be slowed up to maintain cash flow while the strategic review takes place. Minerals would be transported underground to a processing plant on Teesside Announcing the changes, Sirius managing director Chris Fraser said: ""This is the most prudent decision to give the company the time necessary to restructure its plans to move the project forward. ""The process will incorporate feedback from prospective credit providers around the risks associated with construction and will include seeking a major strategic partner for the project."" The company said it had asked the government for support but its request had been turned down. Sirius added that it believed that ""this commitment would have enabled the company's financing to be delivered as planned"". More stories from Yorkshire First Sirius Minerals tunnel boring machine arrives Sirius proposes North Yorks pipeline to transport potash The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""When examining any request for financing, we have to assess the potential of a project against the need to protect taxpayers' money."" He added: ""We have made and continue to make very significant investment in the Northern Powerhouse project."" The MP for Redcar, Labour's Anna Turley, said it was ""devastating news"". She added on Twitter:,external""That the government are refusing to step in and secure this enormous project is an absolute disgrace. ""This government owes everyone involved an apology. It's not too late to change their minds and step in to save this huge project and the jobs and livelihoods that rely on it."" Middlesbrough's MP,Labour's Andy McDonald, tweeted:,external""Sirius is critical to Teesside's future and if government stands aside as they did with the Redcar Blast Furnace they will never be forgiven."" Robert Goodwill, the Conservative MP for Scarborough and Whitby, said it would be ""unprecedented"" for the government to step in. ""I hope they will be successful in finding a partner, I think that is the best way forward,"" he said. ""The government looked at it and said it wasn't the sort of thing it could do, it is a commercial project and if it is a viable project then other companies will back it."" Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, said there was still hope the problems could be overcome. ""I'm in daily contact with Chris Fraser and remain confident that the truly transformational benefits this project can deliver for our region can and will be delivered,"" he said. Russ Mould, from investment platform AJ Bell, said: ""This is terrible news for a very large number of retail investors who had put their faith in the company. ""Many of these shareholders live close to the mine and invested as a show of support in a project that had the potential to greatly improve the local economy."" He added: ""Although the share price has taken a beating on today's news, it isn't game over for Sirius and its shareholders. The miner has a few options to try and salvage the project.""

Who is Gina Miller?,"This video can not be played Campaigner Gina Miller reacts to the judgement outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday Gina Miller is the businesswoman and campaigner who has twice led legal challenges against the government and won. Her first victory came in September 2017, when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of giving MPs a say over triggering Article 50 - the legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU. Her second came on Tuesday,when the Supreme Court ruled that Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful. Her success in the courts has come at a price - she has become a hate figure for many Brexit supporters and has had to employ round-the-clock security after threats to her life. She says she does not want to block Brexit, but is standing up for Parliamentary democracy. Speaking outside the Supreme Court after the ruling on Tuesday, she said: ""Today is not a win for any individual or cause, it's a win for Parliamentary sovereignty, the separation of powers and the independence of our British courts. ""Crucially, this ruling confirms that we are a nation governed by the rule of law."" Mrs Miller is not officially aligned to any political party, havingspurned the advances of the Liberal Democrats, who rapturously received a speech she gave at their 2018 party conference. A 54-year-old investment manager and philanthropist, Mrs Miller was born in Guyana and educated in Britain. She went first to an exclusive all-girls private boarding school, Roedean, on the outskirts of Brighton, at the age of 10, then to Moira House Girls' School, in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Afterwards, she studied law at the University of East London, but left before completing her degree. Mrs Miller went on to start a successful marketing consultancy business with clients including private medical specialists in Harley Street in London. In 2009, she used the money she had made in marketing to co-found an investment firm supporting smaller charities. ""I realised then it was my money, I could do what I wanted with it and so I used that money to get involved in social justice,"" Mrs Miller toldUnfiltered with James O'Brien,externallast year. And in 2012, the businesswoman began the True and Fair Campaign, which campaigned for greater transparency in the City of London's fund management industry. According to an interview with theFinancial Times in 2016,external, this led some in the industry to label her the ""black widow spider"". Speaking about a time she asked three men at an industry party why they were staring at her, she told the paper: ""One of them replied that I was a disgrace and that my lobbying efforts would bring down the entire City."" Mrs Miller launched her first Brexit legal case with London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Tozetti Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney - a UK citizen who lives in France. Backed by a crowd-funding campaign, they argued the government could not invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - starting the formal process of the UK leaving the EU - without seeking approval from Parliament. Mrs Miller argued only Parliament could make a decision leading to the loss of her ""rights"" under EU law. But she stressed the challenge was not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are all leavers now."" In November 2016,three High Court judges ruled Parliament had to voteon when the process could begin. Speaking after her victory, Mrs Miller told the BBC the case was about scrutinising the details of Brexit, such as ""how we leave, how they're going to negotiate, the directions of travel the government will take"". And she said the legal challenge was about more than Brexit, arguing that it was ""verging on dictatorship"" for a prime minister to be able to take away people's rights without Parliament's consent. The government appealed, and the case went to the Supreme Court the following December, butthe 11 judges rejected it by a majority of eight to three. Mrs Miller after winning her High Court legal challenge in November 2016 Following the successful legal challenge, Mrs Miller suffered online abuse, including rape and death threats against her and her family. She told James O'Brien: ""It has changed the way we live our lives, and the conversations we have with the children"". ""We use humour a lot because that's the only way to get through it"", she told him. In July 2017, an aristocrat who wrote a Facebook post offering Â£5,000 to anyone who ran over Mrs Millerwas sentenced to 12 weeks in prison. Describing the businesswoman as a ""boat jumper"", Rhodri Colwyn Philipps - the 4th Viscount St Davids - wrote: ""If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles."" The peer claimed the comments were ""satire"" and a ""joke"". But the judge, who said the post effectively put a ""bounty"" on Mrs Miller's head, found him guilty of two charges of making menacing communications. Later that year,Mrs Miller was named as Britain's most influential black person. ""It's amazing to get an accolade when what I've done has solicited a huge amount of abuse,"" she said on receiving her title. ""To have somebody acknowledge me is extraordinarily kind and counters a lot of what I still get on a daily basis."" Mrs Miller arrived at the Supreme Court in 2017 flanked by security guards, having received death threats Despite the backlash, Mrs Miller went on to launch a second challenge against the government to""defend Parliamentary sovereignty"". After Mr Johnson announced in August that he would suspend Parliament for five weeks, Mrs Miller challenged the legality of the decision at the High Court. She argued thatParliament would be ""silenced""for an ""exceptional"" length of time in the critical period before the 31 October Brexit deadline. She initially lost her case, but in Scotland, a separate legal challenge succeeded, with judges taking the view thatthe suspension was unlawful. The UK government appealed to the Supreme Court against the Scottish judgement, and the two cases were then heard together. The court unanimously ruled in favour of Mrs Miller's appeal and against the government's. Gina Miller spoke to the media outside the Supreme Court after her victory Judges said it waswrong to stop MPs carrying out duties in the run-up to the Brexit deadlineon 31 October. After the ruling Mrs Miller told reporters the ruling showed the government ""will push the law, they will push the constitution and they will even bend it to get their own way"".

'My tears over pawned jewellery',"When part-time cleaner Jackie Alderson saw the household bills mounting up she decided to pawn some of her jewellery. Among the valuable items that secured the loan with Albemarle and Bond was a locket, inside which were pictures of her late parents. Now, having saved up the Â£1,000 needed to return the 10 rings and two necklaces, the 57-year-old is wondering how she will ever see her treasured belongings again. The pawnbroker's branch in Southend-on-Sea is one of more than 100 that haveshut their doorsowing to the company's significant financial losses. Its latest set of accounts show that it lost Â£3.3m last year, and Â£1.6m the year before. ""It made me cry,"" said Mrs Alderson, a mother-of-five and grandmother. ""My parents have died and a couple of the items were from my mum, including the locket with my parents' photos in. ""You think they are secure and I've been saving up to get them out."" Pawnbrokers allow customers to offer something valuable as security for a loan, or buy items such as jewellery and antiques. They lend money quickly, but usually at a worse rate than banks. How much will you give me for my false teeth? Speedloan Finance, the owner of Albemarle and Bond, has tried to reassure customers such as Mrs Alderson that her belongings are safe and held in a pawnbroking centre. Customers have been sent letters telling them about the status of their items and how they can redeem them. But a number of customers, like Mrs Alderson, are in the habit of redeeming belongings at their local branch with cash. They are uneasy about doing so through the post or with a bank transfer. That unease is made worse because they are unable to get through to the company's helpline to discuss the situation or make a payment. Mrs Alderson said she had tried calling at all hours, well over 60 times in total, but the line was constantly engaged. Callers often get a busy signal or a recorded message telling them the company is receiving a large number of calls, but their items are safe. Emails receive an automated response. BBC News has not received any reply from the company to explain the lack of responses. Late on Friday, in a statement, it said it was ""exploring options available to it"". These included finding a buyer for some or all of the stores. Staff were entering a period of consultation or being offered voluntary redundancy. The company's own trade body, the National Pawnbrokers Association (NPA), has criticised the company's failure to answer calls to the helpline, and told management to rectify the situation urgently. The financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has told the company to deal with the situation in an orderly way with as little disruption as possible to customers. TheAlbemarle and Bond website,externalsays: ""If your items are expired or due to expire, please note we will not take any action with your items until we speak to you."" The company's helpline is on 01865 798114, or customers can send an email to info@albemarlebond.com. If customers are not happy with the response from the company, they can contact the Financial Ombudsman Service to complain on 0800 023 4567. Customer ""pledges"" an item, such as a gold ring for a set period of time, usually six months Pawnbroker gives 50% to 60% of the item's value as a cash loan Customer pays 7% to 8% interest every month An item can be redeemed during the loan period by paying back the original loan and any interest up to that point If the customer cannot repay the loan at the end of the deal the pawnbroker sells the item and returns any surplus to the customer More information is available from theNational Pawnbrokers Association,external.

"Saudi oil attack drones 'launched from Iran'The drones and missiles that hit Saudi oil facilities were fired from southern Iran, US defence officials say.Middle East","This video can not be played Abqaiq has the world's largest oil processing plant The US has reportedly identified locations in Iran from which drones and cruise missiles were launched against major Saudi oil facilities on Saturday. Senior US officials told media outlets that the locations were in southern Iran, at the northern end of the Gulf. Saudi air defences did not stop the drones and missiles because they were pointed southwards, to prevent attacks from Yemen, they added. Iran denies involvement in the attacks, which disrupted global oil supplies. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi rebels said they had launched the drones that struck the Abqaiq oil processing plant, the world's largest, and the Khurais oilfield. They have launched attacks into Saudi Arabia before, but US officials said on Sunday they believed the drones and missiles did not originate from the south or south-west, and instead were launched from the north or north-west. Who's using armed drones in the Middle East? Images show detail of attacks on Saudi oil sites Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has called the attack a reciprocal act by the ""Yemeni people"". Oil prices soared 20% after the attacks, at one point reaching $71.95 (Â£57.53) a barrel. But they have since pared their gains as it appeared market disruption would not be as bad as feared. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia's energy minister said he expected production to be fully back online by the end of the month, adding that half the production at the damaged facilities had already been restored. Oil price falls as Saudi Arabia calms supply fears Brent crude - the international benchmark used by traders - was trading at about $64 (Â£51.20) after the announcement. A senior US official told CBS News that a US team had been on the ground at Abqaiq,externaland identified specific drones and missiles used in the attacks. This wreckage will be analysed and used to present ""a very compelling forensic case"" that Iran was responsible, the report says. Vice-President Mike Pence said on Tuesday the US was ""evaluating all the evidence"", and that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was en route to Saudi Arabia ""to discuss our response"". He added: ""The United States of America will take whatever action is necessary to defend our country, our troops, and our allies in the Gulf. You can count on it."" One of the US government's satellite images showing damage at the world's biggest oil-processing facility Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted that ""Yemeni victims"" were responsible for the attacks,external, saying that blaming Iran would not change the situation and saying the US was ""in denial"". Ending the war was the ""only solution for all,"" he added. Attack on Saudis destabilises already volatile region The huge US oil stash hidden in underground caves And in a televised address, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed talks ""at any level"" with the US, saying any dialogue could only happen if the US ""takes back its words and repents"" after withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. Earlier this year,President Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of the landmark agreementthat had limited Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The president told reporters on Tuesday he was not ruling out meeting Mr Rouhani at UN, as has been previously suggested, but added that he would ""prefer not meeting him"". He also said he would be willing to use the US strategic oil reserves if need be. ""I don't believe I need to, but if we want to use strategic oil reserves, I would open them up,"" he said.

This is the strongest claim yet from the Americans that the attacks against the Saudi oil facilities were launched from Iran itself. No corroborating evidence or intelligence has yet been provided.

There is no treaty relationship between Washington and Riyadh, and the Saudis are increasingly unpopular on Capitol Hill. The arguments for a response run both ways. If Iran's alleged escalation is not met by firm action, it might only embolden Tehran to go further. But the attacks have demonstrated Saudi Arabia's extraordinary vulnerability. In any protracted conflict it would be very much in the line of fire. For the White House this is a strategic dilemma with no easy answers.

Saudi oil attack drones 'launched from Iran',"This video can not be played Abqaiq has the world's largest oil processing plant The US has reportedly identified locations in Iran from which drones and cruise missiles were launched against major Saudi oil facilities on Saturday. Senior US officials told media outlets that the locations were in southern Iran, at the northern end of the Gulf. Saudi air defences did not stop the drones and missiles because they were pointed southwards, to prevent attacks from Yemen, they added. Iran denies involvement in the attacks, which disrupted global oil supplies. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi rebels said they had launched the drones that struck the Abqaiq oil processing plant, the world's largest, and the Khurais oilfield. They have launched attacks into Saudi Arabia before, but US officials said on Sunday they believed the drones and missiles did not originate from the south or south-west, and instead were launched from the north or north-west. Who's using armed drones in the Middle East? Images show detail of attacks on Saudi oil sites Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has called the attack a reciprocal act by the ""Yemeni people"". Oil prices soared 20% after the attacks, at one point reaching $71.95 (Â£57.53) a barrel. But they have since pared their gains as it appeared market disruption would not be as bad as feared. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia's energy minister said he expected production to be fully back online by the end of the month, adding that half the production at the damaged facilities had already been restored. Oil price falls as Saudi Arabia calms supply fears Brent crude - the international benchmark used by traders - was trading at about $64 (Â£51.20) after the announcement. A senior US official told CBS News that a US team had been on the ground at Abqaiq,externaland identified specific drones and missiles used in the attacks. This wreckage will be analysed and used to present ""a very compelling forensic case"" that Iran was responsible, the report says. Vice-President Mike Pence said on Tuesday the US was ""evaluating all the evidence"", and that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was en route to Saudi Arabia ""to discuss our response"". He added: ""The United States of America will take whatever action is necessary to defend our country, our troops, and our allies in the Gulf. You can count on it."" One of the US government's satellite images showing damage at the world's biggest oil-processing facility Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted that ""Yemeni victims"" were responsible for the attacks,external, saying that blaming Iran would not change the situation and saying the US was ""in denial"". Ending the war was the ""only solution for all,"" he added. Attack on Saudis destabilises already volatile region The huge US oil stash hidden in underground caves And in a televised address, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed talks ""at any level"" with the US, saying any dialogue could only happen if the US ""takes back its words and repents"" after withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. Earlier this year,President Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of the landmark agreementthat had limited Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The president told reporters on Tuesday he was not ruling out meeting Mr Rouhani at UN, as has been previously suggested, but added that he would ""prefer not meeting him"". He also said he would be willing to use the US strategic oil reserves if need be. ""I don't believe I need to, but if we want to use strategic oil reserves, I would open them up,"" he said.

Estate agents urged to tell buyers about pollution,"Estate agents have been urged to automatically disclose air pollution figures to home buyers. The industry trade body said providing this information should now be standard practice. ""Air quality is now public information, and it will never not be again,"" said Mark Hayward, chief executive of NAEA Propertymark. His comments came as a new website was launched which details air pollution by postcode. The site, calledaddresspollution.org,external, uses data from King's College London to give the level of nitrogen dioxide. The website has been created by the Central Office of Public Interest (COPI), a not-for-profit campaign,the Times newspaper reports,external. The site is currently limited to properties in London. It shows the concentration of nitrogen dioxide in the air and compares it to the World Health Organization's annual legal limit of 40 micrograms per cubic metre.  Long term exposure to high concentrations of the gas have beenlinked to early deaths,external. Humphrey Milles, its founder, said he thinks it could have an impact on where new homes are built, and that data such as this should be used to determine where schools and homes for the elderly are built. ""The data shows this is isn't just something that you are exposed to on the road, this pollution is in the air in our homes,"" he said. Nitrogen dioxide is created when petrol and diesel is burnt Mr Hayward conceded that the move would be extra work for agencies and would come on top of a slew of extra information sellers must provide, such as energy efficiency data. ""It may not be popular because it's an additional piece of information,"" he told the BBC, especially at a time when the number of sales have fallen, hitting agencies' revenues. But he said agents may as well start now before they are forced to by law. He also said that, like energy efficiency information, it may be ignored by some buyers who are led more by their gut than data. ""No-one says I won't buy that house with the roses around the door because of a poor energy rating."" But more and more people are interested in air quality when it comes to choosing where to live, said Henry Pryor, a buying agent of 33 years. He says he has included pollution data in his reports for clients for the last five years. People interested in air quality probably won't ask for discounts, but instead shun a particular area, which may depress prices, he said. ""It's not going to be a negotiating tool, it's going to be an informative tool."" Air quality may improve as more vehicles become electric. The number of electric car models available to consumers in Europe is expected to triple by 2021, the European Federation for Transport and Environmentsaid in July. This shift could help areas with high pollution, said Mr Pryor. His clients in London often look to the city's congestion charge zone for cleaner air, he said, as well as homes near the city's parks. ""More and more people are interested in what they are breathing,"" he said.

Can the court overrule the government?,"Lady Hale, the brooch-wearing judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament was unlawful, has retired from the UK Supreme Court. Who will follow her as its president and what does the Supreme Court do? Lady Hale was president of the Supreme Court from September 2017 to January 2020 and oversaw the decision on the suspension of Parliament. She is among the most well-known judges in the world. Before she became a judge, she was the architect of the UK's internationally-recognised laws on the rights of children. As the first female justice,she has been critical of the lack of female representationon the body in the past. She stood down in 2020 in line with retirement rules for judges. Lord Reed is thenew Supreme Court president,external. The senior Scottish judge also sat in the European Court of Human Rights. He led the importantSupreme Court ruling that overturned high employment tribunal feeswhich had led to claims that people were being denied access to justice. Who is the new top judge at the Supreme Court? It is the highest court in the United Kingdom. The judges, known as justices, have the final say on the biggest legal issues. They are the ultimate check and balance on the UK's laws and constitution. Their job is no different to many comparable bodies in other countries. They rule on what a law means when there is a dispute. These are cases that raise what the court considers to be genuinely important points that affect the nation. This video can not be played The BBC's Clive Coleman takes a look inside the UK's Supreme Court Their judgements set out how a law should be interpreted and applied. Only a third of the cases that it is asked to rule on are heard by the Supreme Court. The court sits opposite the Houses of Parliament. Its location symbolises the relationship between the two. Parliament makes the laws and the Supreme Court oversees their ultimate interpretation and fair and just use. Over the course of its first 10 years of work, the court has delivered many judgements that have changed the nature of the UK. But its arguably most important case was 2019's decision to rule that Prime MinisterBoris Johnson had broken the law by proroguing (suspending) Parliament for five weeksas he faced division over the Brexit process. Lady Hale, wearing her spider brooch, reads out the Supreme Court's ruling on the suspension of Parliament The justices hear cases that have been considered in lower courts in any part of the United Kingdom, other than some issues from Northern Ireland and appeals against criminal convictions from Scotland. There is always an odd number of Supreme Court justices to decide on cases, so that if they disagree on the outcome, there is a majority ruling one way or the other. Since October 2009 it has heard and decided on more than 835 cases. Here are some examples: Two 2018 judgements meant the police could be sued for compensation,after 76-year-old Elizabeth Robinson was knocked overand whendetectives botched a solvable investigation into the John Worboys serial rapist case In 2016, the justices said a law about gang murderhad been wrongly interpreted for 30 years Three years later,justices backed end-of-life decisions Only Parliament can pass or cancel laws. The Supreme Court's role is to decide on the correct interpretation of those laws when there is a dispute. If the justices think a law conflicts with human rights safeguards, it can tell Parliament it should reconsider the legislation - but the government is under no legal obligation to act on that. New justices are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of a panel of legal experts from each of the UK's nations. Applicants must have been a High Court judge for at least two years or a practising lawyer for 15. These are the other members of the Supreme Court. Lord Hodgeis the deputy president and the second Scottish judge on the panel of 12. He specialises in commercial law, in particular intellectual property and land valuation. Lord Kerrwas Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland before joining the Supreme Court at its 2009 opening. As the only Northern Irish justice, he argued forfree NHS abortions to be given to Northern Irish womenwhen they travel to England, but the Supreme Court rejected the case. Lord Wilsonis one of the UK's most experienced judges in family law, having spent 12 years ruling on those cases. Lord Carnwathis an expert in company and commercial law. He has a particular interest in environmental law. Lady Blackis another expert in family law who has taught students at university and, from 2010, also sat as a Court of Appeal judge. Lord Lloyd-Jonesis the Supreme Court's judge from Wales and a Welsh speaker. He specialises in international law He chaired the Law Commission - which advises the government on which laws need reforming - up until 2015. Lord Briggswas appointed to the Court of Appeal in 2013. Three years later he became deputy head of civil justice. Lady Ardenwas a Court of Appeal judge for 18 years and another former head of the Law Commission. Lord Kitchinis an expert in the complex branch of commercial cases that deals with intellectual property, such as patents that protect an invention from being copied by a rival. Lord Saleswas inthe original court which ruled the government must ask Parliamentbefore invoking Article 50, the part of EU law which gives any country the right to leave the EU. This led to the Daily Mail labelling him and the other two judges as ""enemies of the people."" Lord Justice Hamblenis the newest member. He's been a senior judge since 2008, specialising in commercial law. Two more new justices are in the wings waiting to be sworn in later in the year as others retire. Since Mr Johnson lost the prorogation case, there has been a drip feed of stories implying the court got the decision wrong and will face reform. Some Conservatives say judges snatched powers they never had. The Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto pledged a constitutional review which would include the courts. It did not explicitly single out the Supreme Court for reform - so what may happen is unclear. Any attempt to water down the court's powers is likely to face a rocky road. Many lawyers would see this as an act of political revenge. No. There are two unrelated European Courts. TheEuropean Court of Justice(ECJ) oversees EU laws on trade and so on that are passed by the member states. When the UK leaves the EU, it will not be part of that system, unless it were to choose to be, as part of a deal. The entirely differentEuropean Court of Human Rights(ECtHR) was set up (largely at the instigation of the UK) to protect the rights of ordinary people across the continent from undemocratic use of power. It hears very few cases against the UK government as most human rights cases are dealt with by British judges. The Supreme Court takes into account the views of the ECtHR but is entitled to reject its conclusions.

Netanyahu in tough election fight as Israelis vote,"Polls suggest no clear route to government for Benjamin Netanyahu or Benny Gantz (right) Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting to hold on to power following one of its closest election races in years. He called Tuesday's snap election after failing to form a governing coalition in the wake of an election in April. Polls forecast his right-wing Likud party to tie with its main challenger, the centrist Blue and White party led by former military chief Benny Gantz. Smaller parties could therefore have a big say in the final outcome. Negotiations on the formation of a new coalition are expected to start as soon as the preliminary results come on Wednesday morning. Likud and Blue and White came away with 35 seats each in the 120-seat Knesset. Mr Netanyahu declared victory and it appeared that he would be able to secure a majority with the backing of smaller right-wing and religious parties. But after several chaotic weeks the attempted coalition-building collapsed into recriminations. The most important things to know about Israel's election Bowen: Israel election a referendum on Netanyahu On the surface was a dispute over Israel's secular versus its religious character, says the BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem. But ultimately, our correspondent adds, Mr Netanyahu's problems stemmed from a narrowing range of options to build a governing bloc, weakened as he is by the charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust he faces in three corruption cases, pending a final hearing. Mr Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing. He refuses to rule out seeking parliamentary immunity should he stay in power. Throughout the campaign Mr Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving prime minister, has made ever more strident appeals to the right wing as he seeks a record fifth term. Last week,Mr Netanyahu declared he would ""apply Israeli sovereignty"" in the Jordan Valleyif he won. The announcement amounted to a promise to effectively annex 30% of the occupied West Bank, which Palestinians want to be part of a future state. This video can not be played Is Palestinian-Israel peace plan out of reach? Amid international condemnation, the Palestinian leadership called the move a war crime which would bury any prospects for peace. Mr Netanyahu also reiterated a pledge from the last election to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Can Jewish settlement issue be resolved? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Benny Gantz: The Israeli ex-military chief challenging Netanyahu Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu votes with his wife, Sara ""We find ourselves at the high point of an historic change in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel,"" Mr Netanyahu wrote in the Hebrew-language daily newspaper Maariv on Monday. ""I am asking now for your confidence in order to complete the historic task and fortify the State of Israel's borders and security forever."" Hours after voting got under way, Facebook suspended Mr Netanyahu's chat bot - a live messaging tool - for ""violating local [election] law"" by publicising polls. Mr Netanyahu faces an emergent centrist alliance studded with retired generals, who say they will end Israel's increasing divisions. Blue and White was founded in February by Mr Gantz and Yair Lapid, a former finance minister and leader of the Yesh Atid party. Writing in the Maariv, Mr Gantz said a victory for Blue and White would ""change the direction of the ship of state of Israeli democracy"". Blue and White's Benny Gantz voting in the election ""No more instigating rifts in an attempt to divide and conquer, but rather quick action to form a unity government,"" he wrote. ""No looking out for the interests of pressure groups, but rather a government that looks out for the majority of Israeli citizens."" It is not clear where Mr Gantz stands on Mr Netanyahu's plan to annex Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley. He has not said whether or not he accepts the idea of a Palestinian state, although he rejects withdrawing from all of the West Bank. The final polls suggested no clear route to government for either Mr Netanyahu or Mr Gantz. A total of 30 parties, with a wide range of policies, are contesting the election, but only a third of them are expected to pass the 3.25% threshold for entering parliament. Avigdor Lieberman, an ally-turned-rival of the prime minister and leader of the right-wing secular Yisrael Beiteinu party, could end up holding the balance of power. Avigdor Lieberman with his wife at a polling station in an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank He prevented Mr Netanyahu from forming a coalition after the last election because he refused to back down in a longstanding dispute with religious parties over a bill governing exemptions from military service for ultra-Orthodox young men. Mr Lieberman has said the only way he will help return Mr Netanyahu to office is if Likud agrees to a secular unity government and shares power with Blue and White - something the prime minister has ruled out. President Reuven Rivlin asks the party leader most likely to put together a coalition of more than 60 members of parliament to form a government. That leader has 28 days to do so, with a possible extension of not more than 14 days. If that attempt to form a government fails, Mr Rivlin can ask the leader of another party to try. After April's election, Mr Netanyahu's attempts to form a new government failed and he ran out of time in May. He pressed for new elections and Israeli MPs voted by a significant margin in favour of a new poll.

Nurse numbers rise 'eclipsed by jump in patients',"The rise in hospital nurses in England has been dwarfed by a jump in patients, a study suggests. The Royal College of Nursing research points to data showing the nurse workforce has increased by 4.6% in five years. But hospital admissions have jumped by 12.3% - nearly three times the rate. The union says this shows more needs to be done to ensure safe staffing, but the government says the rising NHS budget will ensure high-quality care. The fact there are shortages of nurses is already well established - latest figures suggest one in nine posts. But the government often counters that by pointing out the number of nurses working in the NHS is increasing. Official data shows there were 224,000 hospital nurses on average during last year - up by 4.6% in five years. But to put this in context, the RCN also looked at how much the number of admissions to hospital had gone up by. Last year there were 14.2m, which is 12.3% higher than it was five years ago. RCN general secretary Dame Donna Kinnair said the data should act as a ""stark warning"". ""Staffing shortfalls are never simply numbers on a spreadsheet - they affect real patients in real communities."" She said there needed to be a new law to ensure safe staffing, as has been introduced in Wales and Scotland. She also said she wanted a national body to take on responsibility for properly planning the nursing numbers needed in the future. The government says ensuring there are enough staff available for the NHS is a key priority. The number of training places for nurses is in the process of being increased by 25%, and there are campaigns under way to attract nurses who have left the profession back to the NHS. New roles to support nurses - called nursing associates - are also being created. This drive is being supported by the increased investment in the health service, the government said. One of the initiatives being funded with that money in the coming years is a Â£1,000 personal development budget over three years for all nurses, while a detailed workforce plan is also expected to be published soon. ""The safety of patients is paramount"" a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman added.

But to put this in context, the RCN also looked at how much the number of admissions to hospital had gone up by. Last year there were 14.2m, which is 12.3% higher than it was five years ago. RCN general secretary Dame Donna Kinnair said the data should act as a ""stark warning"". ""Staffing shortfalls are never simply numbers on a spreadsheet - they affect real patients in real communities."" She said there needed to be a new law to ensure safe staffing, as has been introduced in Wales and Scotland. She also said she wanted a national body to take on responsibility for properly planning the nursing numbers needed in the future. The government says ensuring there are enough staff available for the NHS is a key priority. The number of training places for nurses is in the process of being increased by 25%, and there are campaigns under way to attract nurses who have left the profession back to the NHS. New roles to support nurses - called nursing associates - are also being created. This drive is being supported by the increased investment in the health service, the government said. One of the initiatives being funded with that money in the coming years is a Â£1,000 personal development budget over three years for all nurses, while a detailed workforce plan is also expected to be published soon. ""The safety of patients is paramount"" a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman added.

"Flamingo Land withdraw Loch Lomond resort bidThe Â£30m development plan had prompted 55,000 objections.Glasgow & West Scotland","An artist's impression of how the development at Loch Lomond would look Flamingo Land has formally withdrawn its planning application to build a Â£30m tourist resort on Loch Lomond. The move comes after officials for the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority recommended its boardreject the bidearlier this month. More than 55,000 objections were lodged against the Lomond Banks development between April and May. But the team behind the project have not ruled out submitting a fresh application at a later date. Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer, who led the campaign against the plans, tweeted: ""We've won this battle but it's not over. ""They will resubmit, in a transparent attempt to cancel the 57,000 objections lodged against them this time."" Plans for Â£30m tourist development at Loch Lomond Why did 55,000 people object to Loch Lomond development plans? Flamingo Land Ltd and Scottish Enterprise confirmed that they had informed the National Park Authority they collectively wished to withdraw the live planning application. Andy Miller, director of Lomond Banks, said: ""We've been working hard with all parties, including the National Park Authority, for more than two years to ensure all information relating to the proposed development was made readily available. ""We know the national park recognises that the majority of what we propose fits in with the LDP [local development plan]. ""It is therefore surprising and disappointing that their recommendation report raises previously unidentified concerns and highlights the need for new additional information."" A hotel, lodges and ""glamping pods"" formed part of the plan for the site at Balloch He said the move would grant the team sufficient time to understand new concerns, provide additional information requested and consider the most appropriate course of action. Mr Miller added: ""Our priority now is to fully understand concerns, gather the necessary information and dispel some of the myths that continue to circulate around our ambitions for the site. ""It is only at this point, we will consider re-submitting our plans to ensure decision makers will be able to take a fully informed decision on this important application."" A park authority spokeswoman said that a ""significant amount of time and resource"" went into assessing the application and the report which recommended refusal. She said: ""It is ultimately the applicants' decision not to continue with this process. ""While land within this application site has been identified as suitable for tourism development, it is crucial that any new development protects the character of the existing landscape and the natural and built environment, while making a positive contribution to area as an international tourism destination."" The final say on the development rested with the park authority - not West Dunbartonshire Council. The proposals included a 60-bedroom apart-hotel, a 32-bedroom budget accommodation, a craft brewery, boat house, leisure centre and restaurants. Allow Twitter content?

Scottish Enterprise director Allan McQuade said: ""Any proposed plan and investment of this scale must be considered from all angles and subsequent planning and investment decisions based on hard evidence and fact therefore it is only right that the current planning application be withdrawn to allow sufficient time for all parties to consider additional new information. ""As with previous developments at Loch Lomond, we understand people are concerned and our priority is to ensure that any development on the parcel of derelict land in Balloch is delivered in line with planning policy."" It was estimated the Lomond Banks development at Balloch would create 80 full-time jobs, 50 part-time jobs and 70 seasonal roles in the area. While the proposal was drawn up by the theme-park operator, it was not branded as Flamingo Land. The developers have previously insisted the resort would not be a theme park. Campaigners feared the project would spoil the scenery and limit access to the shoreline for locals. The plans were drawn up Flamingo Land but the Loch Lomond development would not carry the theme park's name. Apark authority report,externalnoted that the plan ""has not demonstrated that there will be no adverse impacts on the character or integrity"" of the existing asset. It stated: ""Two key elements of the application - proposals in Drumkinnon Wood and at the Pierhead area - would result in significant unacceptable impacts on the landscape, visual amenity, and trees and woodland. ""As a result, the proposed development would adversely affect the area's built heritage and the enjoyment of the Pierhead area by both visitors and locals. ""There are no socio-economic reasons, or public benefits that would outweigh these reasons. It is also not considered that the use of planning conditions could reasonably control or mitigate these impacts."" Why did 55,000 object to Loch Lomond plans? Do you know this pooch?

Giant Yorkshire mine faces uncertain futureDeveloper Sirius Minerals has to cancel plans to issue a Â£403m bond to finance the project.Business,"The future of a huge potash mine in North Yorkshire has been thrown into doubt after the company behind the project cancelled plans to raise $500m (Â£403m) through a bond sale. Sirius Minerals  blamed ""market conditions"", including Brexit and lack of government support for the decision. It will now undergo a six-month review of four different options for a new financing plan to resume the project. The company's share price halved in reaction to the news. Sirius had alreadypaused the bond issue last month, blaming ""market conditions"". The project is set to be the world's largest mine for polyhalite, a naturally occurring fertiliser which is used in agriculture. The mine is due to open in 2021 and create more than 1,000 jobs. The plans include a 23-mile (37km) tunnel to transport minerals to a processing plant near the former Redcar steelworks. Different parts of the work will be slowed up to maintain cash flow while the strategic review takes place. Minerals would be transported underground to a processing plant on Teesside Announcing the changes, Sirius managing director Chris Fraser said: ""This is the most prudent decision to give the company the time necessary to restructure its plans to move the project forward. ""The process will incorporate feedback from prospective credit providers around the risks associated with construction and will include seeking a major strategic partner for the project."" The company said it had asked the government for support but its request had been turned down. Sirius added that it believed that ""this commitment would have enabled the company's financing to be delivered as planned"". More stories from Yorkshire First Sirius Minerals tunnel boring machine arrives Sirius proposes North Yorks pipeline to transport potash The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""When examining any request for financing, we have to assess the potential of a project against the need to protect taxpayers' money."" He added: ""We have made and continue to make very significant investment in the Northern Powerhouse project."" The MP for Redcar, Labour's Anna Turley, said it was ""devastating news"". She added on Twitter:,external""That the government are refusing to step in and secure this enormous project is an absolute disgrace. ""This government owes everyone involved an apology. It's not too late to change their minds and step in to save this huge project and the jobs and livelihoods that rely on it."" Middlesbrough's MP,Labour's Andy McDonald, tweeted:,external""Sirius is critical to Teesside's future and if government stands aside as they did with the Redcar Blast Furnace they will never be forgiven."" Robert Goodwill, the Conservative MP for Scarborough and Whitby, said it would be ""unprecedented"" for the government to step in. ""I hope they will be successful in finding a partner, I think that is the best way forward,"" he said. ""The government looked at it and said it wasn't the sort of thing it could do, it is a commercial project and if it is a viable project then other companies will back it."" Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, said there was still hope the problems could be overcome. ""I'm in daily contact with Chris Fraser and remain confident that the truly transformational benefits this project can deliver for our region can and will be delivered,"" he said. Russ Mould, from investment platform AJ Bell, said: ""This is terrible news for a very large number of retail investors who had put their faith in the company. ""Many of these shareholders live close to the mine and invested as a show of support in a project that had the potential to greatly improve the local economy."" He added: ""Although the share price has taken a beating on today's news, it isn't game over for Sirius and its shareholders. The miner has a few options to try and salvage the project.""

Oil prices soar after attacks on Saudi facilitiesBrent crude ends 15% higher - its largest one-day percentage gain since 1988.Business,"This video can not be played Abqaiq is the site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant Oil prices ended nearly 15% higher on Monday, with the Brent benchmark seeing its biggest jump in about 30 years. The rise came after two attacks on Saudi Arabian facilities on Saturday knocked out about 5% of global supply. Brent crude initially surged 20% at the start of trading, but eased back to end at $69 a barrel, up 14.6%. US oil prices finished up 14.7%, the biggest jump since 2008. Prices fell back after President Donald Trump vowed to release US reserves. The strike, which the US blames on Iran, has sparked fears of increased risk to energy supplies in the region. However, prices remain below Brent's 12-month high of $86.29 a barrel seen last October, when West Texas Intermediate also climbed to more than $76 a barrel. The drone attacks on plants in the heartland of Saudi Arabia's oil industry hit the world's biggest petroleum-processing facility as well as a nearby oil field, both of which are operated by energy giant Aramco. Together they account for about 50% of Saudi Arabia's oil output, or 5% of daily global oil production. It could take weeks before the facilities are fully back on line. Aneeka Gupta, commodities strategist at the fund manager Wisdom Tree, said that higher oil prices would not have an immediate impact on consumers as they ""could take a bit of time of feed through"". However, she says that if the outage lasts for more than six weeks, oil prices could hit ""north of"" $75 a barrel. Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former energy adviser in George W. Bush's administration, told the BBC: ""I think it's going to last.  As long as the United States and Saudi Arabia on one hand and Iran on the other remain in this escalatory conflict then we're going to build in a risk premium because it's getting very serious."" Saudi oil attacks: US says intelligence shows Iran involved Will Saudi oil attacks raise fuel prices? Attack on Saudis destabilises already volatile region Iran-US tensions: What's going on? US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed that Tehran was behind the attacks. Iran accused the US of ""deceit."" Later, Mr Trump said in a tweet the US knew who the culprit was and was ""locked and loaded"" but waiting to hear from the Saudis about how they wanted to proceed. Allow Twitter content?

In another tweet he said there was ""plenty of oil!"". The Saudis have provided little detail about the attacks, apart from saying there were no casualties, but have given a few more indications about oil production. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said some of the fall in production would be made up by tapping huge storage facilities. The kingdom is the world's biggest oil exporter, shipping more than seven million barrels daily. Saudi stocks stood at 188 million barrels in June, according to official data. ""Saudi authorities have claimed to control the fires, but this falls far short of extinguishing them,"" said Abhishek Kumar, head of analytics at Interfax Energy in London. ""The damage to facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais appears to be extensive, and it may be weeks before oil supplies are normalised."" However, Jeffery Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda, said the disruption would not affect crude supplies in the near-term. ""There's enough capacity in storage to meet the shortfall in the short-term."" Drivers will not immediately see an increase at the pump, according to international energy policy expert Prof Nick Butler. ""The direct impact of the attacks could be short-lived,"" he said. ""The market has adjusted without blinking over the last two years to the loss for political reasons of over two millions barrels a day of production from Venezuela and Iran."" In the UK, 40% of the price of a litre of petrol is made up of oil, fuel production and profit. The rest is tax. ""There are currently savings in the wholesale price that have only just started to be passed on to drivers by retailers,"" says Simon Williams from the RAC. ""Many retailers cut their prices by 3p on Friday and we believe that average prices were six pence too high before that, so the impact of these fires may not be too great."" But Mr Halley said that global fuel prices are likely to increase: ""You'll see price hikes in gasoline all over world. Consumers will first notice it quite quickly in higher petrol prices."" He also warned to ""watch airline fuel surcharges"" which could also rise, depending on an airline's fuel price hedging policies. The US held 644.8 million barrels of oil in storage as of 6 September, according to the Department of Energy. The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve,externalkeeps the oil in underground salt caverns across four sites in Texas and Louisiana along the Gulf of Mexico coast. The cylindrical caverns are typically 200 foot in diameter and 2,000 foot high, and in total they can store up to 727 million barrels of oil.

Â£140m to be spent fixing Mosmorran flaring,"ExxonMobil plant manager Jacob McAlister said he hoped residents would notice a difference within a year as a result of the new investment A total of Â£140m is to be spent reducing flaring and improving the reliability of a Fife chemical plant. ExxonMobil said it had started recruiting 850 temporary workers to carry out the work over the next 12 months. The operator said the investment was on top of the Â£20m it spends annually on maintaining its Mossmorran site. Residents have complained of light pollution and noise often disrupting their sleep during flaring events. ExxonMobil said the work - which includes fitting flaring tips and other technology to reduce flaring - would be completed by September 2020. Chemical plant shutdown extended by months Almost 1,400 complaints over chemical plant's flaring Gas processor get two-month flaring deadline Currently, the plant has temporarily shut down while two of its three boilers have parts renewed and repaired. The company said it expected to resume operations producing ethylene during the fourth quarter of the year - between October and December -  after the shutdown which began on 12 August. Exxonmobil's ethylene plant at Mossmorran is temporarily shut down The work will involve building a flare at ground level which means they will use the elevated flare less often, reducing the visual impact of the plant. The multi-million pound ground flare will be built by 2024. In addition, the work will lead to a reduction in the amount of vibration felt by local residents, plant bosses claim. Plant manager Jacob McAlister said: ""The reliability of the plant has not been where we want it to be and we recognise that -  Â£140m is a major step and shows our commitment that we are addressing these issues. ""We built this [elevated flare tower] 34 years ago to keep the community safe and it is doing its job but we have more advanced technology now that we didn't have when it was built which we hope will address the issues we have been having."" He added: ""We're intent on making improvements, which will drastically reduce flaring and the duration of elevated flaring. I hope in one year from now a significant portion of this project will be in place and that the number of flaring events will be driven down. ""We are not spending this money to pacify the community, we are concerned about how the plant is impacting on their lives and we are announcing how we are addressing that."" James Glen, chairman of the Mossmorran Action Group, said residents believed there had been ""major under investment""  in the safety and maintenance of the plant. He added: ""It would be good to know how much of the Â£140m planned expenditure is just to bring the plant up to a reasonable safety standard. ""We have been promised flaring tips before and these never reduced the levels of flaring and the noise impacts. ""So the communities will wait with bated breath to see if this is an improvement."" Residents have complained of light pollution and noise during flaring Environmental watchdog Sepa said it had been pressing for ground flaring to be introduced at the site - but wanted it introduced sooner than 2024. Sepa chief compliance officer Ian Buchanan said: ""We look forward to working with ExxonMobil on detailed proposals to both address the root causes of flaring and also on the requirement we have set around the 'shortest period possible to plan, design, build and safely integrate' new ground flare technology which will significantly reduce impacts of flaring on local communities."" Lesley Laird, MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, said the major investment justified the concerns communities had expressed for years. ""Residents were patronised for the most part, and those who dared raised concerns publicly were derided for scaremongering,"" she added. ""It is only through the concerted pressure of the Mossmorran Working Group that Sepa, HSE and the companies have finally all had to face up to the reality that communities had reached their absolute limit, and that they would have to act as the plant was clearly not fit for purpose. ""More detailed responses are now required from all of these organisations as to how, under the watchful eye of Sepa and HSE, Fife Ethylene Plant was allowed to deteriorate to this extent."" Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse, said: ""Given community concerns, the Scottish government has been clear that the frequency of unplanned flaring at the site is unacceptable and that the operators must take steps to address this, so this announcement of action being taken is therefore to be welcomed."" Ian Buchanan, a chief officer at Sepa, said: ""Sepa has been clear that repeated unplanned flaring by ExxonMobil was both unacceptable and preventable and that in future flaring will be the exception rather than routine. ""Having served a series of notices and operating permit variations to drive investment, including in noise reducing flare tips by 2020, we welcome today's broad announcement from ExxonMobil."" Alan Mitchell, chief executive of Fife Chamber of Commerce, said: ""First and foremost, this is tremendous news for the workforce at Mossmorran. ""But the benefits will be felt well beyond the plant's boundaries. ""It will create jobs in Fife and opportunities for contracts and work for local companies."" Meanwhile, BBC Scotland has learned the plant has been issued with an improvement notice over the risk of an explosion. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said ExxonMobil had failed to take all measures necessary to reduce the risk of ""firebox explosion from furnaces"". The firebox is an area in the plant's furnaces where fuel is burnt. Inspectors said the risk came from an uncontrolled accumulation of unburnt fuel in the firebox. The HSE notice, which affects seven furnaces at the plant, states ""the measures currently in place are not sufficient to reduce the risk to as low as reasonably practicable"". It was issued in July and ExxonMobil has until March next year to comply with the improvement order. On the HSE notice, Mr McAlister said: ""Our safety performance is such that in the 30-plus years we've been in operation we've never had a major safety incident. ""We've gone over 25 years without a lost time injury on the site. You don't do that if you're not managing the safety risks appropriately. We are managing the safety risks, that's our number one job to ensure that we do that right."" In August it emerged that Scotland's environmental regulatorSepa had received almost 1,400 complaints about the Mossmorransite, which is also shared by Shell Fife NGL. Both companies had their permits modified and were told to install flare tips that reduce noise.

Stalking victims will be able to contest sentences,"Victims of stalking, harassment and sex crimes will be able to challenge sentences they think are too lenient, under an expansion of a government scheme in England and Wales. Fourteen offences are to be added to theunduly lenient sentence scheme,external, which examines crown court punishments. Murder, robbery, rape and some child sex cases can currently be heard. The offences being added include abuse by a person in a position of trust and having indecent child images. The Ministry of Justice said controlling and coercive behaviour and sexual activity with a person who has a mental disorder would also now be covered. The unduly lenient sentence scheme began in 1989 after a series of controversial court cases caused public outcry. It allows anyone to ask for a sentence to be reviewed by theAttorney General's Office,,externaleven if they have no connection to the case. Only one request is needed for the government to decide whether a sentence can be looked at again, but it must be lodged within 28 days of the court hearing. Last year, 99 people saw their sentences increased after a review by the courts in England and Wales. There are similar schemes in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Terror offences and the most serious fraud, assault and drug cases can also be challenged under the existing scheme. The government says it hopes the changes will come into effect in the autumn via secondary legislation, which can be brought in without Parliament having to pass a new act. Although reforms to the scheme were under consideration before Boris Johnson became prime minister, they tie in with hiscommitment to a more punitive sentencing regime. Details of the expansionwere first reported in a Sunday Telegraphstory about government proposals to bring in longer sentences for violent and sexual offenders. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said it was ""absolutely right that victims have a voice in the system when punishments don't appear to fit the crime"". He said the scheme's expansion delivers on a key commitment in the cross-governmentvictims' strategy,,externalpublished last year. But Frances Crook from the Howard League for Penal Reform has suggested the move was as much about satisfying an apparent need for tougher punishments, as it is about public safety. ""There are questions to be asked about whether increasing the prison term of one person really has an impact on reducing harm and preventing crime more generally,"" she said. Figures obtained by the BBC under Freedom of Information lawsthis year show requests to increase 3,499 crown court sentences were received between 2015 and 2018. Only 643 of these ended up at the Court of Appeal, with 478 resulting in harsher punishments.

World's biggest amphibian 'discovered' in museum,"Giant salamander: Not one species but three A newly-identified amphibian is possibly the largest on the planet, according to DNA from museum specimens. Reaching nearly two metres in length, the South China giant salamander is critically endangered in the wild. Scientists say renewed conservation efforts are needed if the animal is to be saved from extinction. Harvesting for the luxury food trade has led to a collapse in numbers across China. Previously considered a single species, analysis of specimens, living and dead, suggests there are in fact three species found in different parts of China. The South China salamander is the largest of the three, which researchers suspect it is the largest amphibian alive today. Prof Samuel Turvey of ZSL (Zoological Society of London) said the decline of numbers in the wild has been ""catastrophic"". The specimen at London's Natural History Museum dates back to the 1920s ""We hope that this new understanding of their species diversity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain,"" he said. Co-researcher, Melissa Marr, of the Natural History Museum London, said measures must be put in place that preserve the genetic integrity of each distinct species. ""These findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild,"" she said. Giant salamanders were once found across a large area of central, eastern, and southern China. Over-exploitation has increased in recent decades, to supply a domestic luxury food market. A largeâscale farming industry has developed, which may threaten wild populations through poaching and spread of infectious diseases. Scientists used museum specimens to look at the genetic history of the Chinese giant salamander, a family tree so ancient that the animal is regarded as a ""living fossil"". 'Living fossil' heading for extinction Zoo unveils smuggled giant salamander The nuns helping save a sacred species - BBC News. The idea that the South China giant salamander was a separate species was first proposed in the 1920s, then abandoned, based on an unusual animal that was kept at London Zoo. The team used the same animal, which is now preserved as a specimen in the Natural History Museum, to define the characteristics of the new species.

UK minister apologises for Saudi military salesInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss tells a court a promise to halt export licences was broken.UK,"The international trade secretary has written to the Commons committee on armed exports controls The UK's international trade secretary has apologised to a court for two breaches of a pledge not to licence exports to Saudi Arabia that could be used in the Yemen conflict. Ministers promised to stop approving shipments in June after a challenge by campaigners at the Court of Appeal. Liz Truss said the granting of licences for Â£435,000 of radio spares and a Â£200 air cooler for the Royal Saudi Land Forces had been ""inadvertent"". An internal inquiry is taking place. In aletter to the Commons Committees on Arms Export Controls,,externalMs Truss said routine analysis of statistics found a licence for the air cooler for a Renault Sherpa Light Scout vehicle had been issued just days after the ruling. And a licence for the export of 260 items of radio spares had been issued in July. To date, the letter said, 180 items from that order - with a value of Â£261,450 - had been shipped. Ms Truss said: ""I have apologised to the court unreservedly for the error in granting these two licences."" Government lawyers had informed the court of the ""breaches of the undertaking given"", she added. She said the internal investigation had been launched to establish whether other licences had been issued against the assurances to the court or Parliament, and to ensure there could be no further breaches. Yemen has been locked in civil war since 2015 The court case saw theCampaign Against Arms Trade arguethat the UK decision to continue to license military equipment for export to the Gulf state was unlawful. Under UK export policy, military equipment licences should not be granted if there is a ""clear risk"" that weapons might be used in a ""serious violation of international humanitarian law"". Judges hearing the court case decided existing licences should be reviewed but they would not be immediately suspended. But Ms Truss's predecessor Liam Fox had given an assurance that the government would not grant further export licences while it considered the ruling. Responding to the government's apology, the campaign's Andrew Smith said: ""We are always being told how rigorous and robust UK arms export controls supposedly are, but this shows that nothing could be further from the truth.""

UK minister apologises for Saudi military sales,"The international trade secretary has written to the Commons committee on armed exports controls The UK's international trade secretary has apologised to a court for two breaches of a pledge not to licence exports to Saudi Arabia that could be used in the Yemen conflict. Ministers promised to stop approving shipments in June after a challenge by campaigners at the Court of Appeal. Liz Truss said the granting of licences for Â£435,000 of radio spares and a Â£200 air cooler for the Royal Saudi Land Forces had been ""inadvertent"". An internal inquiry is taking place. In aletter to the Commons Committees on Arms Export Controls,,externalMs Truss said routine analysis of statistics found a licence for the air cooler for a Renault Sherpa Light Scout vehicle had been issued just days after the ruling. And a licence for the export of 260 items of radio spares had been issued in July. To date, the letter said, 180 items from that order - with a value of Â£261,450 - had been shipped. Ms Truss said: ""I have apologised to the court unreservedly for the error in granting these two licences."" Government lawyers had informed the court of the ""breaches of the undertaking given"", she added. She said the internal investigation had been launched to establish whether other licences had been issued against the assurances to the court or Parliament, and to ensure there could be no further breaches. Yemen has been locked in civil war since 2015 The court case saw theCampaign Against Arms Trade arguethat the UK decision to continue to license military equipment for export to the Gulf state was unlawful. Under UK export policy, military equipment licences should not be granted if there is a ""clear risk"" that weapons might be used in a ""serious violation of international humanitarian law"". Judges hearing the court case decided existing licences should be reviewed but they would not be immediately suspended. But Ms Truss's predecessor Liam Fox had given an assurance that the government would not grant further export licences while it considered the ruling. Responding to the government's apology, the campaign's Andrew Smith said: ""We are always being told how rigorous and robust UK arms export controls supposedly are, but this shows that nothing could be further from the truth.""

Israelis vote in second election in five monthsPM Benjamin Netanyahu fights for a fifth term after failing to form a coalition during the summer.Middle East,"Polls suggest no clear route to government for Benjamin Netanyahu or Benny Gantz (right) Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting to hold on to power following one of its closest election races in years. He called Tuesday's snap election after failing to form a governing coalition in the wake of an election in April. Polls forecast his right-wing Likud party to tie with its main challenger, the centrist Blue and White party led by former military chief Benny Gantz. Smaller parties could therefore have a big say in the final outcome. Negotiations on the formation of a new coalition are expected to start as soon as the preliminary results come on Wednesday morning. Likud and Blue and White came away with 35 seats each in the 120-seat Knesset. Mr Netanyahu declared victory and it appeared that he would be able to secure a majority with the backing of smaller right-wing and religious parties. But after several chaotic weeks the attempted coalition-building collapsed into recriminations. The most important things to know about Israel's election Bowen: Israel election a referendum on Netanyahu On the surface was a dispute over Israel's secular versus its religious character, says the BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem. But ultimately, our correspondent adds, Mr Netanyahu's problems stemmed from a narrowing range of options to build a governing bloc, weakened as he is by the charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust he faces in three corruption cases, pending a final hearing. Mr Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing. He refuses to rule out seeking parliamentary immunity should he stay in power. Throughout the campaign Mr Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving prime minister, has made ever more strident appeals to the right wing as he seeks a record fifth term. Last week,Mr Netanyahu declared he would ""apply Israeli sovereignty"" in the Jordan Valleyif he won. The announcement amounted to a promise to effectively annex 30% of the occupied West Bank, which Palestinians want to be part of a future state. This video can not be played Is Palestinian-Israel peace plan out of reach? Amid international condemnation, the Palestinian leadership called the move a war crime which would bury any prospects for peace. Mr Netanyahu also reiterated a pledge from the last election to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Can Jewish settlement issue be resolved? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Benny Gantz: The Israeli ex-military chief challenging Netanyahu Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu votes with his wife, Sara ""We find ourselves at the high point of an historic change in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel,"" Mr Netanyahu wrote in the Hebrew-language daily newspaper Maariv on Monday. ""I am asking now for your confidence in order to complete the historic task and fortify the State of Israel's borders and security forever."" Hours after voting got under way, Facebook suspended Mr Netanyahu's chat bot - a live messaging tool - for ""violating local [election] law"" by publicising polls. Mr Netanyahu faces an emergent centrist alliance studded with retired generals, who say they will end Israel's increasing divisions. Blue and White was founded in February by Mr Gantz and Yair Lapid, a former finance minister and leader of the Yesh Atid party. Writing in the Maariv, Mr Gantz said a victory for Blue and White would ""change the direction of the ship of state of Israeli democracy"". Blue and White's Benny Gantz voting in the election ""No more instigating rifts in an attempt to divide and conquer, but rather quick action to form a unity government,"" he wrote. ""No looking out for the interests of pressure groups, but rather a government that looks out for the majority of Israeli citizens."" It is not clear where Mr Gantz stands on Mr Netanyahu's plan to annex Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley. He has not said whether or not he accepts the idea of a Palestinian state, although he rejects withdrawing from all of the West Bank. The final polls suggested no clear route to government for either Mr Netanyahu or Mr Gantz. A total of 30 parties, with a wide range of policies, are contesting the election, but only a third of them are expected to pass the 3.25% threshold for entering parliament. Avigdor Lieberman, an ally-turned-rival of the prime minister and leader of the right-wing secular Yisrael Beiteinu party, could end up holding the balance of power. Avigdor Lieberman with his wife at a polling station in an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank He prevented Mr Netanyahu from forming a coalition after the last election because he refused to back down in a longstanding dispute with religious parties over a bill governing exemptions from military service for ultra-Orthodox young men. Mr Lieberman has said the only way he will help return Mr Netanyahu to office is if Likud agrees to a secular unity government and shares power with Blue and White - something the prime minister has ruled out. President Reuven Rivlin asks the party leader most likely to put together a coalition of more than 60 members of parliament to form a government. That leader has 28 days to do so, with a possible extension of not more than 14 days. If that attempt to form a government fails, Mr Rivlin can ask the leader of another party to try. After April's election, Mr Netanyahu's attempts to form a new government failed and he ran out of time in May. He pressed for new elections and Israeli MPs voted by a significant margin in favour of a new poll.

Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM over Brexit,"This video can not be played Luxembourg's PM spoke beside the empty podium where Boris Johnson was due to appear Luxembourg's PM has attacked Boris Johnson's approach to Brexit, calling the situation a ""nightmare"". Xavier Bettel said the British government had failed to put forward any serious proposals for a new deal. But Mr Johnson, who pulled out of a joint press conference with Mr Bettel because of noisy protesters, said there was still a good chance of a deal. A government source said the gap the UK and Brussels needed to bridge to achieve a deal ""remains quite large"". Mr Johnson was visiting Luxembourg to hold talks with the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well as Mr Bettel. After the working lunch with Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier, Mr Johnson said he had been encouraged by the EU's willingness to engage with the UK in their shared desire to avoid a no-deal exit - but there had not been a ""total breakthrough"". However, the European Commission said the PM had yet to present concrete proposals for it to consider and insisted any new plans had to be ""compatible"" with the existing withdrawal agreement, which has been rejected three times by MPs. There was then confusion after Mr Bettel held a press conference without Mr Johnson amid noisy protests by anti-Brexit protesters. Mr Bettel, who addressed the media on his own after the UK PM pulled out, said his counterpart ""holds the future of all UK citizens in his hands"" and suggested it was his responsibility to break the deadlock in the process. What does 'podiumgate' say about Brexit deal? In full: Boris Johnson interview from Luxembourg How are the UK's talks with the EU going? This video can not be played Johnson: EU have had 'bellyful' of delays Standing next to an empty lectern, Mr Bettel warned Mr Johnson ""you can't hold the future hostage for party political gain"". He said there were ""no concrete proposals at the moment on the table"" on a new Brexit deal from the UK and said the EU ""needs more than just words"". ""We need written proposals and the time is ticking, so stop speaking and act,"" he said. The existing withdrawal agreement was the ""only solution"", he added. Mr Johnson said his joint press conference was cancelled over fears the two leaders would have been ""drowned out"" by pro-EU protesters. It is understood that his request for it to be held inside was turned down. What exactly should we make of the oh so public venting on Monday by the prime minister of Luxembourg following his meeting with Boris Johnson? Does this mean the EU has lost patience and will no longer engage in negotiations with the Johnson government? Can we expect an Angela Merkel rant or a Mark Rutte rave next? Quite the opposite. ""As long as there is a chance of a deal, it's in our own interest to engage. However frustrating negotiations are,"" a high-level EU contact told me. Read more from Katya's blog The EU's Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, tweeted a photograph of the empty podium where Mr Johnson had been due to speak alongside Mr Bettel with the caption: ""From Incredible Hulk to incredible sulk"".

Over the weekend Mr Johnson told a newspaper that the UK would break out of its ""manacles"" like cartoon character The Incredible Hulk - with or without a deal. After the working lunch with Mr Juncker, Mr Johnson told the BBC's political editor he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the state of negotiations and suggested the EU wanted to bring the two and half years of arguments about the terms of the UK's exit to an end. ""I see no point whatever in staying on in the EU beyond October 31st and we're going to come out. And actually that is what our friends and partners in the EU would like too. ""And I think that they've had a bellyful of all this stuff. You know they want to develop a new relationship with the UK. They're fed up with these endless negotiations, endless delays."" This video can not be played 'What a load of claptrap' While he was working ""very hard"" to get a deal, Mr Johnson said there would be no agreement unless the EU shifted its position on the backstop, the insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland unless and until another solution is found. ""If we can't get movement from them on that crucial issue... we won't be able to get it through the House of Commons, no way."" He said there were a number of ideas under discussion which would allow the whole of the UK to leave the EU while protecting the integrity of the bloc's single market, upholding the Good Friday Agreement and supporting the Irish economy. These, he said, included the use of technology to minimise border checks as well as the so-called Stormont lock, a mechanism to give Northern Irish politicians a say on the rules that apply to Northern Ireland. ""It is all doable with energy and goodwill,"" he insisted. A UK government source later said: ""It's clear Brussels is not yet ready to find the compromises required for a deal, so no-deal remains a real possibility - as the gap we need to bridge remains quite large."" As soon as we arrived at the office of the prime minister of Luxembourg it became obvious a planned outdoor news conference could not go ahead. The anti-Brexit protesters in the square numbered less than 100 but their music and megaphones made it sound like a lot more and they occasionally used language you wouldn't want to hear on the news. Behind the scenes the British and Luxembourgish delegations grappled with a diplomatic dilemma: Move the event inside but exclude the majority of the journalists? Gamble that the demonstrators could pipe down for a bit? Silence the host to save the guest's blushes? The end result saw Mr Johnson do a short interview at the ambassador's residence to be shared with everyone while Mr Bettel took to the stage next to an empty podium. He used the moment in the spotlight to deliver an impassioned speech, made all the more dramatic by the fact he's famed as one of the EU's most smiley, mild-mannered leaders. Mr Johnson said he would meet the Halloween Brexit deadline come what may, insisting that the UK would be ""in very good shape"" whether there was a deal or not. But pushed on how he would get around the law requiring him to ask for an extension if there is no deal by 19 October, the PM did not explain how it would be possible. Ahead of Tuesday's Supreme Court hearing into whether the prorogation of Parliament was lawful, Mr Johnson defended the decision to suspend Parliament. Parliament was prorogued last week, ahead of a Queen's Speech on 14 October. Legal challenges to the decision have been lodged in the courts by opposition MPs and campaigners. Could the Supreme Court overrule the government? What will happen with Brexit in the next month? Mr Johnson described claims that Parliament was ""being deprived of the opportunity to scrutinise Brexit"" as ""all this mumbo jumbo"" and a ""load of claptrap"". ""I think people think that we've somehow stopped Parliament from scrutinising Brexit. ""What absolute nonsense. Parliament will be able to scrutinise the deal that I hope we will be able to do both before and after the European Council on October 17.""

Does Luxembourg PM's scorn signal an EU shift?,"This video can not be played Luxembourg's PM spoke beside the empty podium where Boris Johnson was due to appear What exactly should we make of the oh so public venting on Monday by the prime minister of Luxembourg following his meeting with Boris Johnson? Does this mean the EU has lost patience and will no longer engage in negotiations with the Johnson government? Can we expect an Angela Merkel rant or a Mark Rutte rave next? Quite the opposite. ""As long as there is a chance of a deal, it's in our own interest to engage. However frustrating negotiations are,"" a high-level EU contact told me. How are the UK's talks with the EU going? Where do the UK parties stand on Brexit? A simple guide to Brexit ""It's no secret the EU prefers an orderly Brexit. And if talks breaks down and end in no deal, we (the EU) won't be the ones to have closed the door in the UK's face. It's important that European voters know that."" That said, Prime Minister Bettel's effervescent irritation with the Brexit process is shared by most EU leaders behind closed doors. Frustration seems to seeps out of every pore sometimes in off-the-record conversations with EU diplomats and politicians. Annoyance that more than three years after the UK referendum on EU membership, the country and parliament are still divided over what kind of Brexit - if any - to pursue. This means in EU eyes, they could perform any manner of contortions, make all sorts of compromises in a Brexit deal and still be unsure as to whether it would get through parliament. Resentment that EU leaders are often depicted as the villains of Brexit by high-profile UK politicians and journalists while they insist they never wanted Brexit and now that it's happening it's damaging for the EU itself. Brexit uncertainty is very costly for EU businesses and European governments are spending hundreds of millions on preparing for a possible no deal outcome. Exasperation that Boris Johnson insists on talking about great progress being made in negotiations with the EU, whereas Brussels insiders claim serious talks with the prime minister's main EU envoy David Frost only began on Friday and he has still not presented a concrete proposal on how to replace the backstop guarantee for the Irish border. But most EU figures (bar a couple of well-known exceptions) think it politically prudent to hide any teeth-clenching and nostril-flaring in public. This video can not be played Johnson: EU have had 'bellyful' of delays Boris Johnson said on Monday he wanted to step up EU-UK Brexit contacts to daily meetings. Fine, responded the EU. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker repeated his assertion, previously made to Theresa May, that the EU was open for talk 24/7. But it's important to remember that Mr Juncker and European Commission negotiators don't have the legal power to change the Brexit deal, even if they wanted to. That power lies with the EU national leaders. What will happen with Brexit in the next month? No-deal Brexit: How might it affect the EU? Could Brexit change the taste of whisky? And they are locked in a tussle of words and ""alternative facts"" with the UK prime minister. Boris Johnson insists EU leaders must compromise if they really want a deal. They reply that Mr Johnson has yet to come up with any realistic proposals. Suggesting, as the UK prime minister has, that Northern Ireland follow EU rules on animal, plant and food safety doesn't fly with the EU as an alternative to the backstop. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The EU wants to know what goods are entering its single market after Brexit. So what about customs? The perceived patchy approach of the Johnson government - ""Oh that'll work itself out. There's technology and trusted trader schemes"" - is not acceptable to the EU. ""As long as UK proposals remain flabby and aspirational,"" one key EU diplomat put it to me, ""Brussels is unlikely to budge."" The devil as always is in the detail. If the UK had specific, targeted requests for compromise on the backstop, the other EU leaders would look to Ireland and if Dublin gave the nod, the EU as a whole would most likely follow suit. Equally, if Boris Johnson made a realistic request (from Brussels' point of view) on the backstop and Ireland were reluctant, then Dublin could well come under ""gentle pressure"" from other EU leaders to compromise. But with no concrete, legally operable proposals from the UK at this stage, the pressure felt on Ireland the EU as a whole to ""compromise"" is ""basically zero,"" my contacts tell me.

More victims able to challenge lenient sentences,"Victims of stalking, harassment and sex crimes will be able to challenge sentences they think are too lenient, under an expansion of a government scheme in England and Wales. Fourteen offences are to be added to theunduly lenient sentence scheme,external, which examines crown court punishments. Murder, robbery, rape and some child sex cases can currently be heard. The offences being added include abuse by a person in a position of trust and having indecent child images. The Ministry of Justice said controlling and coercive behaviour and sexual activity with a person who has a mental disorder would also now be covered. The unduly lenient sentence scheme began in 1989 after a series of controversial court cases caused public outcry. It allows anyone to ask for a sentence to be reviewed by theAttorney General's Office,,externaleven if they have no connection to the case. Only one request is needed for the government to decide whether a sentence can be looked at again, but it must be lodged within 28 days of the court hearing. Last year, 99 people saw their sentences increased after a review by the courts in England and Wales. There are similar schemes in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Terror offences and the most serious fraud, assault and drug cases can also be challenged under the existing scheme. The government says it hopes the changes will come into effect in the autumn via secondary legislation, which can be brought in without Parliament having to pass a new act. Although reforms to the scheme were under consideration before Boris Johnson became prime minister, they tie in with hiscommitment to a more punitive sentencing regime. Details of the expansionwere first reported in a Sunday Telegraphstory about government proposals to bring in longer sentences for violent and sexual offenders. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said it was ""absolutely right that victims have a voice in the system when punishments don't appear to fit the crime"". He said the scheme's expansion delivers on a key commitment in the cross-governmentvictims' strategy,,externalpublished last year. But Frances Crook from the Howard League for Penal Reform has suggested the move was as much about satisfying an apparent need for tougher punishments, as it is about public safety. ""There are questions to be asked about whether increasing the prison term of one person really has an impact on reducing harm and preventing crime more generally,"" she said. Figures obtained by the BBC under Freedom of Information lawsthis year show requests to increase 3,499 crown court sentences were received between 2015 and 2018. Only 643 of these ended up at the Court of Appeal, with 478 resulting in harsher punishments. About a third of all requests, 1,148, were dismissed outright because the crimes committed were not eligible for review. Have you been able to challenge a sentencing or are interested in doing so?
